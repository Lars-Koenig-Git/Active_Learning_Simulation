1,What Teacher Knowledge Matters in Effectively Developing Critical Thinkers in the 21 st Century Curriculum?,"As the key agents of change in educational reforms, it is teachers who are seen as central to effecting change; this is no different in the curricular aim of developing critical thinkers found in numerous educational reforms across the world. One of the key assumptions behind such curricular reforms aimed at developing critical thinking in schools seems to be that teachers would somehow have the required knowledge and capacity to teach critical thinking successfully as envisaged in educational policies. However, research suggests that this is not necessarily the case and that teachers' knowledge in critical thinking teaching has to be developed in an explicit and systematic manner. Stemming from a qualitative case study on teacher knowledge in the context of implementing a curriculum that explicitly aims to develop critical thinking, a revised framework of teacher knowledge is proposed. This framework, which was emergent in the analysis of the study data, offers possibilities as a more complete heuristic and analytical tool to help understand the complexity and dynamics of teacher knowledge in teaching critical thinking. Moreover, it could help pave the way to better understand the various knowledge domains that need to be purposefully and systematically developed by schools and teacher education institutions to support teachers in their vital work of developing critical thinkers in the classroom successfully for life and work in the 21 st century.

2,,"A dialog system or a conversational agent provides a means for a human to interact with a computer system. Dialog systems use text, voice and other means to carry out conversations with humans in order to achieve some objective. Most dialog systems are created with specific objectives in mind and consist of preprogrammed conversations. The primary objective of this dissertation is to show that dialogs can be dynamically generated using semantic technologies. I show the feasibility by constructing a dialog system that can be specific to control physical entry points, and that can withstand an attempt to misuse the system by playing back previously recorded conversations. As a solution my system randomly generates questions with a pre-specified difficulty level and relevance, thereby not repeating conversations. In order to do so, my system uses policies to govern the entrance rules, and Item Response Theory to select questions derived from ontologies relevant to those policies. Furthermore, by using contextual reasoning to derive facts from a chosen context, my dialog system can be directed to generate questions that are randomized within a topic, yet relevant to the task at hand. My system design has been prototyped using a voice interface. The prototype demonstrates acceptable performance on benchmark data.","Ababneh, Mohammad",0,,2
3,,"Collective behavior of animal groups, such as bird flocks and fish schools, is an emergent phenomenon characterized by spatial patterns and synchronized motion of individuals. Animal groups comprising thousands of members are able to coordinate their positions and movements based on simple, local interactions among peers rather than in response to a single leader. Due to the distribution of information gathering and sharing among the group, individuals benefit from many aspects of social life, including protection from predators, efficient locomotion, and ease of foraging. Mathematical modeling of this phenomenon has garnered interest in the study of distributed systems, due to the efficiency and robustness of synchronization observed in nature. Individual-based modeling of distributed systems has yielded simulation results that bear striking resemblance to various modes of behavior observed in animal groups, including highly polarized movements and circular milling. In considering animal groups as a collection of individuals, the topology of interactions among group mates plays a pivotal role in the agreement of individuals on a common state. In fact, consensus protocols, which are updating algorithms widely used to model the synchrony characteristic in collective behavior, rely heavily on the underlying topology of interactions among individuals. In this dissertation, we present a biologically-inspired mathematical model of collective behavior and we develop both numerical and experimental techniques to test the ability of such models to mimic biological systems. The model is inspired by psychological limitations on the perception of numbers, known as numerosity, which have been shown to play an important role in the collective behavior exhibited by animal groups. We incorporate this limitation into an individual-based behavioral model of group motion, which we explore in a simulation study. The numerosity constraint is also translated into a network model of interaction, over which we analytically derive conditions for the consensus of agents comprising homogenous peers or groups of leaders and followers. Moreover, we generalize the numerosity constraint to a network model that encompasses many relevant networks in the consensus literature, thus extending the applicability of these results. To assess complexity in a model of collective behavior, we adopt numerical methods using a machine-learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction of large-scale data sets. In addition, we conduct a variety of animal experiments using both robotic fish and computer-animated images as stimuli. Such experimental techniques are proposed as viable options for assessing the ability of a model to reproduce the complex collective behaviors observed in animal groups.","Abaid, Nicole",0,,3
4,Men's Responses to Women's Sexual Refusals: Development and Construct Validity of a Virtual Dating Simulation of Sexual Aggression,"Objective: To provide evidence regarding the construct validity of a sexual aggression proxy in which male participants go on multiple virtual dates with a woman. A unique strength of this proxy is participants' opportunity to make choices throughout the simulation about how they interact with their virtual date. These decisions determine their exposure to the female agent's sexual refusals. Method: Piloting included focus groups (n = 82), surveys (n = 95), and cognitive interviews (n = 32). To establish construct validity, 87 male participants completed 2 separate sessions: a) an online survey with measures of discriminant and convergent validity; and b) a lab session in which they went on multiple dates that included nonsexual options, sexual options that the female agent accepted, and sexual options she refused. Sexual aggression was operationalized as the total number of sexual refusals that participants' received. Results: There was strong correlational evidence for discriminant and convergent validity. As hypothesized, there were some differences in the risk factors associated with refusals received on casual as compared to steady dates. Additionally, the number of refusals received was associated with the types of thoughts and actions commonly reported by perpetrators. Conclusions: This simulation provides a new approach for examining sexual aggression in controlled experiments that vary factors within the simulation such as the man's and woman's intoxication and past sexual history. Because what happens is based on each individual's responses, it could be adapted for use in prevention and treatment programs.","Abbey, A.",0,10.1037/vio0000078,4
8,Novel approach to study the perception of animacy in dogs,"Humans tend to perceive inanimate objects as animate based on simple motion cues. So far this perceptual bias has been studied mostly in humans by utilizing two-dimensional video and interactive displays. Considering its importance for survival, the perception of animacy is probably also widespread among animals, however two-dimensional displays are not necessarily the best approach to study the phenomenon in non-human species. Here we applied a novel method to study whether dogs recognize a dependent ( chasing-like) movement pattern performed by inanimate agents in live demonstration. We found that dogs showed more interest toward the agents that demonstrated the chasing-like motion, compared to those that were involved in the independent movement. We suggest that dogs spontaneously recognized the chasing-like pattern and thus they may have considered the interacting partners as animate agents. This methodological approach may be useful to test perceptual animacy in other non-human species.","Abdai, J.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0177010,5
11,,"Cloud computing is becoming increasingly popular among organizations. The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing model has become an attractive solution because of the ability of reducing costs and improving resource utilization. Such cloud services are expected to be always available and reliable as per the Service Level Agreements (SLA) between the cloud service providers (CSPs) and their customers. Cloud ecosystems have also become attractive targets to attackers because of the massive amount of data residing on the cloud as well as the massive processing power that can be recruited for malicious intent. Thus, security is a very critical task in cloud ecosystems and the need of continuous security monitoring in the cloud is mandatory for detecting malicious activities. This dissertation addresses the problem of online malware detection in cloud auto-scaling systems using performance metrics. First, we review the current state-of-the-art malware detection techniques in general with a focus on techniques that target cloud IaaS, specifically virtual machines (VMs). We find that malware detection techniques that target VMs lack taking advantage of cloud unique characteristics. Those techniques can be applied to VMs as well as stand alone servers with nothing specific about cloud. We then propose a malware detection framework that leverages cloud unique characteristics (i.e. auto-scaling) using black-box features (performance metrics), where data are collected from outside the VMs by the hypervisor in an auto-scaling scenario (e.g. three-tier web architecture with scalability in place). Our approach assumes no prior knowledge of the installed applications on the VMs. In this work, a modified version of sequential K-means clustering algorithm is used to group similar VMs based on workloads (e.g. applications servers, web servers and database servers are three different groups). Then, malware is detected as anomalies when one VM of the same group exceeds a certain threshold. Despite showing that highly active malware (e.g. ransomware) can be effectively detected by inspecting the performance and resource utilization metrics of VMs as a black-box, this approach is not as effective for detecting malware that maintains a low profile of resource utilization. Accordingly, we propose a white-box approach (where data are obtained from inside the VMs by either the hypervisor or pre-installed agents) for detecting such malware using 2d and 3d Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 3d CNN classifiers are introduced to partially mitigate the underestimated mislabeling problem. The developed white-box approach achieved good results; however, it works only for single VMs. To leverage auto-scalability, we extended the previous approach to handle multiple VMs and introduced a new approach based on paired samples to accommodate for correlations between VMs. We evaluate the proposed approaches on synthetic data collected from our OpenStack (a popular open-source cloud IaaS software) testbed based on a standard 3-tier web architecture with the ability to scale-up (when multiple copies of the server are spawned) and scale-down (where the number of copies are reduced) on demand.","Abdelsalam, Mahmoud",0,,6
12,Exploiting Small World Problems in a SIoT Environment,"Internet of Things (IoT) has been at the center of attention among researchers for the last two decades. Their aim was to convert each real-world object into a virtual object. Recently, a new idea of integrating the Social Networking concept into the Internet of Things has merged and is gaining popularity and attention in the research society due to its vast and flexible nature. It comprises of the potential to provide a platform for innovative applications and network services with efficient and effective manners. In this paper, we provide the sustenance for the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm to jump to the next level. Currently, the SIoT technique has been proven to be efficient, but heterogeneous smart devices are growing exponentially. This can develop a problematic scenario while searching for the right objects or services from billions of devices. Small world phenomena have revealed some interesting facts and motivated many researchers to find the hidden links between acquaintances in order to reach someone across the world. The contribution of this research is to integrate the SIoT paradigm with the small world concept. By integrating the small world properties in SIoT smart devices, we empower the Smart Social Agent (SSA). The Smart Social Agent ensures the finding of appropriate friends (i.e., the IoT devices used by our friend circle) and services that are required by the user, without human intervention. The Smart Social Agent can be any smart device in SIoTs, e.g., mobile phones.","Abdul, R.",0,10.3390/en11082089,7
17,,"Background and purpose: Ischaemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are at risk of early recurrent stroke (RS). However, antithrombotics commenced at the acute stage may exacerbate haemorrhagic transformation, provoking symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH). The relevance of antithrombotics on the patterns and outcome of the cohort was investigated. Methods: A non‐randomized cohort analysis was conducted using data obtained from VISTA (Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive). The associations of antithrombotics with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcome and the occurrence of RS and SICH (each as a combined end‐point of fatal and non‐fatal events) at 90 days for post‐stroke patients with AF were described. Dichotomized outcomes were also considered as a secondary end‐point (i.e. mortality and good outcome measure at 90 days). Results: In all, 1644 patients were identified; 1462 (89%) received antithrombotics, 157 (10%) had RS and 50 (3%) sustained SICH by day 90. Combined antithrombotic therapy (i.e. anticoagulants and antiplatelets), 782 (48%), was associated with favourable outcome on ordinal mRS and a significantly lower risk of RS, SICH and mortality by day 90, compared with the no antithrombotics group. The relative risk of RS and SICH appeared highest in the first 2 days post‐stroke before attenuating to become constant over time. Conclusions: The risks and benefits of antithrombotics in recent stroke patients with AF appear to track together. Early introduction of anticoagulants (2–3 days post‐stroke), and to a lesser extent antiplatelet agents, was associated with substantially fewer RS events over the following weeks but with no excess risk of SICH. More evidence is required to guide clinicians on this issue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Abdul‐Rahim, A.",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.12577,8
25,,"Cardio-embolic stroke accounts for nearly a third of all ischaemic strokes. The most clinically important cardio-embolic sources are non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic heart failure. Strokes due to these conditions are associated with greater disability and more mortality, as compared to stroke of other aetiology. This thesis is aimed at addressing some of the challenges faced by clinicians when dealing with stroke in patients with AF or heart failure, using an extensive range of historical data. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to stroke, AF and heart failure, including current prevalences, aetiology, and their complex intertwine relationship. The current acute stroke management in patients with AF or heart failure is also outlined within the chapter. In chapter 2, the data sources and statistical methods that were common to the studies in the thesis are outlined. The justifications of using historical data in the absence of evidence from robust clinical trials are also detailed. Chapter 3 explores the relevance of antithrombotic treatment on patterns and outcomes of acute stroke patients with AF. A non-randomised cohort analysis was conducted using data from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA). The associations of antithrombotic treatment with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) outcome, and the occurrence of recurrent stroke and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, at 90 days after stroke were described. Combined sequential antithrombotic therapy (i.e. oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment), was associated with favourable outcome on ordinal mRS and significantly lower risk of recurrent stroke, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and mortality by day 90, compared to the patients who did not receive any antithrombotic treatment. The relative-risk of recurrent stroke and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage appeared highest in the first 2 days after stroke before attenuating to become constant over time. Thus, early introduction of oral anticoagulant treatment (2-3 days after stroke), and to a lesser extent antiplatelet agents, was associated with substantially fewer recurrent stroke events over the following weeks but with no excess risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. Chapter 4 seeks to describe the current prescribing patterns in stroke survivors with AF, with particular emphasis on socio-demographic associations. A cross-sectional analysis of city-wide Glasgow primary care data for the year 2010, was conducted. This chapter highlights that oral anticoagulant treatment was under-used in this high risk population, especially those of older age and affected by deprivation. Strategies need to be developed to improve prescription of oral anticoagulant treatment. Chapter 5 investigates the incidence of stroke within the available heart failure trials spanning a 30 year period, according to AF status at baseline. Individual patient data were pooled from 11 trials conducted in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF); and, 3 trials performed in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF). Stroke incidence has not significantly declined over time in patients with HF-REF enrolled to trials, despite greater use of evidence-based heart failure and oral anticoagulant therapies. However, anticoagulation proportions remain under 70% among HF-REF patients with documented AF. Similar trends of stroke incidence were observed for patients enrolled in HF-PEF trials. Some patients with heart failure but without atrial fibrillation may be at high risk of stroke and may potentially benefit from oral anticoagulant treatment. Chapter 6 provides a comprehensive description of the current incidence of and risk factors for stroke in patients with HF-REF but without AF.

26,On the use of dance notation systems to generate movements in humanoid robots: The utility of Laban notation in robotics,"This article raises the issue of collaboration between the field of dance and that of robotics. Dance notation systems are developed in the choreographic field as a method to describe and record human movements. Translating movements into symbols is of particular concern for computer science and robotics, which are interested in generating anthropomorphic motions in robots or animated avatars. We examine different research projects on the use of Laban notation for this purpose, and present our own attempt at generating dance movements in a humanoid robot from a Laban score. We discuss the interests and difficulties related to the use of a dance notation system in a robotic context.","Abe, N.",0,10.1177/0539018417694773,10
30,,"Previously, we reported sipholenol A, a sipholane triterpenoid from the Red Sea sponge Callyspongia siphonella, as a potent reversal agent of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells that overexpressed P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Through extensive screening of several related sipholane triterpenoids that have been isolated from the same sponges, we identified sipholenone E, sipholenol L and siphonellinol D as potent reversal agents of MDR in cancer cells. These compounds, at a nontoxic concentration of 10 μM, enhanced the cytotoxicity of several P-gp substrate anticancer drugs, including colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel in P-gp-overexpressing MDR cancer cells KB-C2 and KB-V1 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, these three sipholanes had no effect on the response to cytotoxic agents in cells lacking P-gp expression or expressing MRP1 (ABCC1) or MRP7 (ABCC7) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2). [³H]-Paclitaxel accumulation and efflux studies demonstrated that all three triterpenoids time-dependently increased the intracellular accumulation of [³H]-paclitaxel by directly inhibiting P-gp-mediated drug efflux. Sipholanes also inhibited calcein-AM transport from P-gp-overexpressing cells. The Western blot analysis revealed that these three triterpenoids did not alter the expression of P-gp. However, they stimulated P-gp ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited the photolabeling of this transporter with its transport substrate [125I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin. In silico molecular docking aided the virtual identification of ligand binding sites of these compounds. In conclusion, sipholane triterpenoids efficiently inhibit the function of P-gp through direct interactions and may represent potential reversal agents for the treatment of MDR.","Abraham, Ioana",0,,11
31,Virtualisation of an administrative work environment in higher education Managing information in a developing country university,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how higher education institutions (HEIs) in developing countries can migrate their physical administrative work environment to a virtual platform to improve information management. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs an interpretive case study approach and a combined lens of activity and agency theories to understand how a developing country HEI attempted to improve its information management by migrating from a physical to a virtual administrative work environment. Findings - The findings show how contradictions caused by role conflicts, administrative staff's fear of elimination and external consultants' limited understanding of administrative rules and procedures can hamper work environment virtualisation. Such challenges should be resolved in order to achieve a successful virtual work environment that supports timely and accurate information management. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by its single case perspective in one developing country. However, future studies can compare the experiences of HEIs from developed and developing countries in order to account for contextual differences. Practical implications - The study provides practitioners with insight into how to address conflicts between employees (as potential users) and external consultants during virtual system development and implementation. In particular, role conflict, fear of eliminating some administrative staff and consultants' limited understanding of administrative work procedures should be resolved for successful work environment virtualisation. Originality/value - The study is the first attempt to offer rich insight into the challenges associated with administrative work environment virtualisation for improved information management in HEIs, through the principal-agent relationship.","Adam, I.

34,Evaluation of French motorway network in relation to slime mould transport networks,"France has developed a high quality motorway system that has been rapidly rationalised and matured in the late 20th century yet has been founded on ancient, Roman infrastructures. The development of the motorway system is thus an iterative method associated with hierarchical 'top-down' processes taking into consideration factors such as population density, network demand, location of natural resources, civil engineering challenges and population growth. At the opposite extreme to this approach is the development of transport networks within simple biological systems which are typically decentralised, dynamic and emerge from simple, local and 'bottom-up' interactions. We examine the notion, and to what extent, that the structure of a complex motorway network could be predicted by the transport network of the single-celled slime mould Physarum polycephalum. This comparison is explored through its ability to 'deduce' the French motorway network in a series of analogue and digital experiments. We compare Physarum network and motorway network topology in relation to proximity graphs and assess the trade-off between connectivity and minimal network length with a bottom-up model of a virtual plasmodium. We demonstrate that despite the apparent complexity of the challenge, Physarum can successfully apply its embodied intelligence to rationalise the motorway topology. We also demonstrate that such calculations prove challenging in the face of significant obstacles such as, mountainous terrain and may account for the missing route between Nice, Grenoble, Avignon and Lyon. Finally, we discuss the topological findings with respect to circle and spoke city planning infrastructures and certain species of web-building spiders.","Adamatzky, A.",0,10.1177/0265813515626924,13

Yet, not every social media tool is as popular as others; for instance in 2016, 74.4% of Flemings ever had an account on Facebook, only 34.1% were once active on the microblogging platform Twitter. However, Twitter might have advantages over Facebook as a didactic agent in higher education. To date, research results on the added value of Twitter as a learning and teaching tool are still ambiguous. Therefore, this paper describes two interventions, which are evaluated using a mixed methods approach, to determine higher education students' expectations and experiences about using Twitter for educational purposes. Results indicate that although students had moderate to high initial expectations about using Twitter in higher education, they were rather skeptical about this tool after using it. The most critical obstacles formulated by students were competence frustration, (information) overload, and extrinsic motivation; that were taken into account by designing the second, follow-up intervention. The results of both interventions are presented and discussed. This study also highlights practical implications regarding the educational use of Twitter as well as suggestions for further research.","Adams, B.",0,10.1186/s41239-018-0102-5,14

51,Teachers in school-based technology innovations: A typology of their beliefs on teaching and technology,"In many innovations in technology and education in secondary schools, teachers are the crucial agents of these innovations. To select, match and support groups of teachers for particular school projects, school principals could be supported with insights into teachers' beliefs about teaching, learning and technology. A teacher typology has been developed based on an online questionnaire completed by 1602 teachers from 59 Dutch secondary schools. Teachers are grouped on the basis of their beliefs about learned-centered teaching and attitudes towards technology, which underlie the school innovations that form the context of the current research. Five teacher types are distinguished: 1) Learner-centered teachers with technology, 2) Teachers critical of technology use in school, 3) Teachers uncomfortable with technology, 4) Teachers uneasy with learned-centered teaching and 5) Teachers critical of a clear-cut stance. This classification of teachers into these five types could be used to select or match the right group of teachers to a particular intervention or to organize different professional development activities for different types of school teachers.

The research explored the perceptions of foreign language course coordinators, teachers and students in the writing program of an institution of higher education in Lebanon regarding technology and multimedia use, the importance and the place of technology and multimedia in teaching writing. An assessment of faculty and students’ perceptions was needed to determine the necessity and possibility of revamping the broad objectives of composition and rhetoric courses. To respond to the new realities of teaching characterized by the ubiquity of technology and multimedia in the educational scene of the 21st century, it was important to measure the stakeholders’ – students, teachers and course coordinators – perceptions regarding the usefulness of technology and multimedia in writing and determine the feasibility of complementing traditional writing practices with multimodal ones. The study examined the technological dispositions of the various social agents within the same field of practice by looking into quantitative and qualitative results of perceptual data, while shedding light on practices in composition classrooms. The findings revealed while the majority of respondents perceived the use of technology and multimedia as added value which could enhance the learning process, some had mixed feelings about their perceived usefulness and ease of use, thus successful integration in the writing curriculum. Recommendations for research which would experiment with complementing the actual practices of teaching and performing written assignments with technology and multimedia elements were made in the concluding remarks.","Adra, Omar M.",0,,19
64,,"Recognition of spontaneous emotion would influence human-computer interaction and emotion-related studies in many related fields. In any given environment, the spontaneous generation of expression are more often observed than their prototypic counterparts.This thesis explores methods for detecting emotional facial expressions occurring in a tutor-tutee setting -- the expressions made by the tutee to non verbally communicate understanding. Given the importance of non-verbal communication in human dialog, the information gathered will in turn be used to inform the agent on user understanding of material and be able to provide a more realistic relationship between a tutor and the tutee.Considering that in-class teaching time is very limited, it can be very challenging for an educator to instruct the student, while keeping the student’s interest in the course high throughout the semester. This requires innovation in teaching, especially when the class is large. The affect sensitive animated tutoring system is designed to simulate the process of one-to-one tutoring of small class teaching and helping educators to further supplement the contents to suit the needs of the students. The intelligence of the embodied agent system comes from information related to the student knowledge, the specific domain knowledge, and the teaching strategies, but also the affective state of the student and the role it plays in helping the student progress through the curriculum. In this research, we put forth an affect sensitive emotionally capable animated tutoring system for introduction to programing courses, providing the student the opportunity to learn about certain aspects of the course. Key instruction modules based on core concepts in programing will be created in which the student is presented with a lecture specified by the instructor, as well topics to be covered in that lecture. Based on the subtopic selected by the student, only information pertinent to that subtopic is displayed. As the session proceeds the system will monitor the student for affective feedback via any spontaneous facial expression generation. Once a negative affect is detected the embodied agent will then assess the student to determine the root of the affect ad devise a strategy to help the student progress from the negative affect to a positive one. Also, following each lecture, quizzes will be made available to test the students’ comprehension and retention of the lecture. The quiz modules test students on information covered in each lecture module.Three issues were evaluated in the analyses: the comprehension level of the user after interacting with the system, the user’s perception of their learning experiences as a result of the embedded animated agent and the affective visualization of the different learning states. Preliminary results show that the condition in which the agent is fully expressive shows a marked increase in the level of comprehension because as we speculated the user is more invested in the software when the agent fully articulates emotion through head movement and facial expression. In addition, the condition in which the agent is partially animated illustrates that the comprehension level is the average of both the fully animated and non-animated agent.","Agada, Ruth O.",0,,20
65,A group-based approach for gaze behavior of virtual crowds incorporating personalities,"Predicting interest points of virtual characters and accurately simulating their gaze behavior play a significant role for realistic crowd simulations. We propose a saliency model that enables virtual agents to produce plausible gaze behavior. The model measures the effects of distinct saliency features implemented by examining the state-of-the-art perception studies. When predicting an agent's interest point, we compute the saliency scores by using a weighted sum function for other agents and environment objects in the field of view of the agent for each frame. Then, we determine the most salient entity for each agent in the scene; thus, agents gain a visual understanding of their environment. Besides, our model introduces new aspects to crowd perception, such as perceiving characters as groups of people and applying social norms on crowd gaze behavior, effects of agent personality on gaze, gaze copy phenomena, and effects of agent velocity on attention. For evaluation, we compare the resulting saliency gaze model with real-world crowd behavior in captured videos. In the experiments, we simulate the gaze behavior in real crowds. The results show that the proposed approach generates plausible gaze behaviors and is easily adaptable to varying scenarios for virtual crowds.","Agil, U.",0,10.1002/cav.1806,21

We consider this question through an institutional review board (IRB) supported research study attending to student learning experiences in undergraduate ethics courses at a Catholic university with an explicit commitment to social justice. This essay draws on and interprets qualitative data concerning the outcomes of select pedagogical approaches that involve exposing students to the experiences of others: the use of narratives; participation in structured experiential learning activities; and community engagement through deep listening and facilitated dialogue. We focus our interpretation around the implications of these pedagogies in relation to student understanding of and attitudes regarding three character traits identified as ""other-regarding"" virtues in theological and philosophical scholarship--altruism, compassion, and solidarity. This paper considers the implications of these pedagogies and the practical effects of different sorts of teaching strategies on students' self-understanding as moral agents.","Agnew Cochran, Elizabeth",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/teth.12392,22
69,,"For children, high quality friendships are associated with adaptive social, emotional and academic functioning. There is also evidence that children experience real and imaginary friendships in similar ways, and that imagined relationships could have an impact on development. However, less is known about the relationships made possible by virtual agents in digital media. This dissertation research was designed to provide preliminary data about children’s concepts of virtual agents, and the social opportunities they attribute to such entities. In Studies 1 and 2 (combined N = 48), preschool aged children differentiated the social affordances of a stuffed dog and a virtual dog. Participants played a game in which they guessed whether a child in a video was referring to a stuffed dog or a virtual dog in a series of statements. Items designed to assess high quality friendships, such as comfort, protection and love, were attributed more to the stuffed dog than the virtual dog. Studies 3 and 4 examined adult and child concepts of a virtual child, and how concepts of this entity might differ from a real child, a child on a video chat program (e.g., Skype™) and an inanimate doll. Adults and children attributed a range of properties to each child agent, including biological, psychological and social properties, as well as opportunities for relationships. In Study 3 (N = 144), adults did not differentiate between the virtual child and the doll on the social property; however, they favored the doll on opportunities for unilateral relationships. In Study 4 (N = 30), five to eight-year-old children indicated an overall preference for the doll on the social property, as well as on opportunities for reciprocal relationships. Children also favored the doll on opportunities for love, companionship, and intimate disclosure. Altogether, these findings suggest that virtual agents afford more limited social opportunities than inanimate artifacts, and they are less likely to be loved by children and adults alike. These results raise important questions about the design goals for virtual agents, and the functions they are intended to serve in our everyday lives. This dissertation includes both previously published and co-authored material.","Aguiar, Naomi Ruth",0,,23
70,Dev E-R: A computational model of early cognitive development as a creative process,"This paper describes a computational model named Dev E-R (Developmental Engagement-Reflection) that, inspired by Piaget's theory, simulates the assimilation-accommodation adaptation process. It is implemented with a new extended version of the computational model of creativity known as Engagement-Reflection. That is, this model simulates adaptation as a creative activity. We introduce here the implementation of our model on an agent that is initialized with basic reflex conducts and that through the interaction with a 3D virtual world, it is able to build new behaviors autonomously. The new acquired skills, according to Piaget's theory, are typically observed in children that have reached the second substage of the sensorimotor period. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

72,Emergence of eye-hand coordination as a creative process in an artificial developmental agent,"Based on Piaget's theory of cognitive development and an extension of the Engagement-Reflection model of creativity, the Developmental Engagement-Reflection (Dev E-R) model characterizes the early cognitive development of an agent as a creative activity. In its first version, Dev E-R uses an agent that can see and move its head; through interactions with its environment, it is able to develop elaborated behaviors consistent with Piaget's ideas. This work describes an advancement of our model. We give our agent a hand (tactile sensor) so it can detect the presence and features of an object in its environment; we also study the necessary mechanisms to coordinate its vision with the sense of touch. We report the behavior of the agent when it is granted the capacity of touching without seeing (i.e. the agent was blind) and when both skills, touch and sight, come together. For such purpose, we place an agent in a virtual environment and let it perform in different contexts. We analyze how new knowledge structures results from prior experiences and interactions with the environment. The outcomes from the experiments reveal that it learns new skills associated with eye-hand coordination. We observe that the arising developmental behavior resembles some of the features reported by Jean Piaget.","Aguilar, W.",0,10.1177/1059712317732116,25

76,Anthropomorphism - matters or not? On agent modality and its implications for teaching English idioms and design decisions,"The present study aimed to examine whether agent-based instruction would privilege English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners any better than mainstream approaches (e. g. analogical reasoning, guessing from context, image formation, semantic analysis, etc.) when it comes to the teaching of English idioms. It also sought to explore whether learning from multimedia agents and retention of English idioms would be differentially impacted if agent modality were concerned. To this end, three constellations of EFL learners, each consisting of 30 participants, received instruction on 128 English idioms under one of three conditions: One group received treatment through an anthropomorphic pedagogical agent that was capable of coordinating speech with a diverse range of human paralinguistic behaviors. Another group received treatment on the target idioms through a non-anthropomorphic agent in the form of an animated hand with a pointing finger that was capable of showing a small subset of human non-verbal behaviors. The other group received treatment on English idioms the conventional way, that is, through teacher-fronted instruction. The findings revealed that the participants learned better from agent-based instruction and that the pointing finger had proved even more efficient in teaching English idioms.","Ahmadi, A.",1,10.1080/09588221.2017.1284132,27
79,,"Tuberculosis (TB) caused approximately 1.5 million deaths worldwide in 2014 and is the second biggest killer due to a single infectious agent. Issues with current TB treatment such as interactions with antiretroviral therapy for HIV co-morbidities, poor compliance and the emergence of resistance to current antibiotics mean that there is an urgent need for new antitubercular drugs. InhA is an enoyl reductase that is the primary target for isoniazid, a first-line antitubercular drug. This enzyme plays a key role in the synthesis of mycolic acids which are key components of the TB cell wall. As such, InhA is an attractive target for future antitubercular drugs. Isoniazid is a pro-drug which is activated by the enzyme, katG, and resistance to isoniazid has been primarily attributed to mutations in katG. Thus, drug discovery for InhA to date has focused on direct inhibitors which do not require activation, mainly using virtual screening and structure-based drug design approaches. In recent years a structural mutation, S94A InhA, has been detected in clinical isolates conferring resistance to isoniazid in the absence of katG mutations, suggesting it is becoming clinically relevant in the context of isoniazid resistance. To date, no direct InhA inhibitors are available clinically, and only two S94A InhA inhibitors have been reported.","Ahmed, Aneesa",0,,28
80,,"Carrying Over reconsiders the widely held Romantic-era belief in poetry as a universal form by arguing for the centrality of linguistic and cultural translation within early Romantic poetics. It traces Romantic encounters with Eastern genres alongside an emerging imperial sense of the world in eighteenth-century British systems of knowledge, including philology, pedagogy, and biblical criticism. Expanding recent postcolonial accounts of world literature’s colonial origins, I show how Romantic works responded to a mounting scholarly effort to codify literature within England and its colonial peripheries. While Orientalist philologists like William Jones claimed to demonstrate ''what true poetry ought to be'' through their translations of Oriental works into familiar genres like the lyric and the romance, Romantic adaptations of non-Western forms (such as the Arabian Nights tale and the proverb) suggested what poetry could be once detached from these dominant modes. Indeed, I claim that these engagements with Oriental forms transfer, or ''carry over,'' problems of translation into issues of interpretation—moments of unintelligibility in which the poem appears as an agent of translation rather than its object. In doing so, these poets revise the world-literary assumption that locates poetry in European modes of expression, suggesting instead that poetry’s displaced origin precedes and lies outside of national forms. After an introduction that explores the early Romantic revision of translatio studii, the first chapter considers Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s fascination with the Arabian Nights against the backdrop of eighteenth-century empiricist pedagogical literature by John Locke, Anna Barbauld, and Maria Edgeworth. I show how the opaque and supernatural tales of the Nights precipitated a shift in early Romantic reading practice—from reading as a self-possessed act to a recursive and involuntary process—and offered a model for the enigmatic form of The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere. In chapter two, I read William Blake’s use of proverb form in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell alongside an empiricist insistence on knowledge’s demonstrability, as articulated through eighteenth-century biblical criticism and colonial pedagogy. I argue that Blake’s resuscitation of the proverb form in the ''Proverbs of Hell'' posits a mode of unfinished knowledge, in which incompletion is converted from a mark of error into a sign of knowledge’s deferred but eventual recognition. My third chapter looks at the dream of the Arab in William Wordsworth’s The Prelude, a vision of an itinerant Arab-knight saving poetry from destruction, to trace how this split figure embodies and unsettles the eighteenth-century belief in the primitive origin of poetry. I claim that the Arab-knight shows how poetry’s inheritance depends on its translation—its literal movement across linguistic and cultural boundaries. The dissertation concludes with a coda that explores the relationship between cultural translation and poetics in Walter Benjamin’s and Édouard Glissant’s different writings on translation.","Ahmed, Adam Nagi",0,,29
81,Observers versus agents Divergent associations of video versus game use with empathy and social connectedness,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore whether distinctive modes (observation vs control) of presenting diverse content differentially influence users. To achieve this goal, The authors first conceptualize empathy as social cognition and discuss the possible psychological mechanisms for divergent associations between observation-based media (i.e. video media) and control-based media (i.e. game media). Design/methodology/approach - In total, 300 adults (150 females) participated in this study through an online survey. Findings - Time spent with video media (television and film) was positively associated with empathy, which in turn was associated with enhanced social connectedness. However, time spent on game media (video games, computer games, and smartphone games) was negatively associated with empathy, which in turn was associated with inferior social connectedness. Originality/value - While previous studies on the effects of media have focussed mainly on content, the present study focusses on the effects of mode. The mode-focussed approach presents evidence contradictory to the content-focussed approach.","Ahn, D.",0,10.1108/itp-07-2014-0152,30
83,How does customer's product expertise moderate the usefulness of information recommendation agents in online stores?,"Introduction. Recommendation agents are software programs used by Internet stores to help customers find relevant information and make better purchasing decisions. This study investigates the moderating effect of customers' product expertise on the relationship between user evaluation of recommendation agents and its antecedents. Method. An experimental shopping mall of digital cameras was implemented for empirical examination of the hypotheses. Participants were asked to conduct virtual shopping in the shopping mall using the information recommendation agents. Analysis. The hypotheses were tested with the partial least squares method using the collected data. The samples were divided into high and low product expertise groups and the results of the analysis were compared between the two groups to see the moderating effect of product expertise. Results. Product expertise does moderate some of the relationships, showing difference between high and low product expertise groups. Analysis of the results shows that familiarity with recommendation agents and frequency of online shopping affect only the high expertise group, while specificity of shopping intention affects only the low expertise group. Conclusions. The difference in customers' product expertise needs to be taken into account when developing and providing information recommendation agents to customers to improve their shopping experience.","Ahn, H.

85,Asymmetric facial expressions: revealing richer emotions for embodied conversational agents,"In this paper, we propose a method to achieve effective facial emotional expressivity for embodied conversational agents by considering two types of asymmetry when exploiting the valence-arousal-dominance representation of emotions. Indeed, the asymmetry of facial expressions helps to convey complex emotional feelings such as conflicting and/or hidden emotions due to social conventions. To achieve such a higher degree of facial expression in a generic way, we propose a new model for mapping the valence-arousal-dominance emotion model onto a set of 12 scalar facial part actions built mostly by combining pairs of antagonist action units from the Facial Action Coding System. The proposed linear model can automatically drive a large number of autonomous virtual humans or support the interactive design of complex facial expressions over time. By design, our approach produces symmetric facial expressions, as expected for most of the emotional spectrum. However, more complex ambivalent feelings can be produced when differing emotions are applied on the left and right sides of the face. We conducted an experiment on static images produced by our approach to compare the expressive power of symmetric and asymmetric facial expressions for a set of eight basic and complex emotions. Results confirm both the pertinence of our general mapping for expressing basic emotions and the significant improvement brought by asymmetry for expressing ambivalent feelings.

89,Points-Based Reward Systems in Gamification Impact Children's Physical Activity Strategies and Psychological Needs,"Gamification is an increasingly popular form of health intervention but its efficacy remains elusive due to a lack of clarity in its conceptualization and operationalization. This study aimed to isolate and determine the direct causal effect of one of the most popular game elements used in gamified interventions, the points-based reward system, on physical activity (PA) in children. A 72-hour field study with children aged 9 to 13 (N = 67) was conducted using a digital PA intervention featuring a virtual dog, with and without a points-based reward system. PA was assessed with an activity monitor, and overall PA, three levels of PA intensity, and PA strategies during the 3-day intervention were measured. Guided by self-determination theory, the impact of the points-based reward system on children's basic psychological needs was also investigated. Results indicated that the points-based reward system briefly increased PA engagement but did not significantly affect overall PA over time. When given equal number of points regardless of intensity, children approached the PA intervention strategically by engaging in significantly more light intensity and significantly less vigorous intensity PA than children who did not receive points. Results also suggested that the points-based reward system might promote perceptions of relatedness with the virtual agent featured in the gamified intervention.","Ahn, S.

92,,"Spatial and non-spatial information of sound events is presumably processed in parallel auditory cortex (AC) “what” and “where” streams, which are modulated by inputs from the respective visual-cortex subsystems. How these parallel processes are integrated to perceptual objects that remain stable across time and the source agent's movements is unknown. We recorded magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) data while subjects viewed animated video clips featuring two audiovisual objects, a black cat and a gray cat. Adaptor-probe events were either linked to the same object (the black cat meowed twice in a row in the same location) or included a visually conveyed identity change (the black and then the gray cat meowed with identical voices in the same location). In addition to effects in visual (including fusiform, middle temporal or MT areas) and frontoparietal association areas, the visually conveyed object-identity change was associated with a release from adaptation of early (50–150ms) activity in posterior ACs, spreading to left anterior ACs at 250–450ms in our combined MEG/EEG source estimates. Repetition of events belonging to the same object resulted in increased theta-band (4–8Hz) synchronization within the “what” and “where” pathways (e.g., between anterior AC and fusiform areas). In contrast, the visually conveyed identity changes resulted in distributed synchronization at higher frequencies (alpha and beta bands, 8–32Hz) across different auditory, visual, and association areas. The results suggest that sound events become initially linked to perceptual objects in posterior AC, followed by modulations of representations in anterior AC. Hierarchical what and where pathways seem to operate in parallel after repeating audiovisual associations, whereas the resetting of such associations engages a distributed network across auditory, visual, and multisensory areas.

100,,"Humans may react very differently with respect to mechanical devices, including robots. They can interact with them with delight or retreat in aversion or fear. According to the famous model of the uncanny valley these opposite reactions depend on the degree of familiarity that different artifacts engender in humans. The aim of my work is trying to find out the cognitive bases of familiarity, analyzing the origin of anthropomorphic projection, namely human disposition to attribute anthropomorphic features - like intentions or feelings—to artifacts. I shall discuss two concepts: relatedness and empathy, and argue that relatedness is the precondition for empathy. The fact that it is possible to attribute anthropomorphic features virtually to any object shows that resemblance is not the point. Anthropomorphism is a kind of relation that humans establish with an artifact, and in order to comprehend this phenomenon we have to focus on the relational aspect. I shall argue that what we call anthropomorphism is an extension to nonhumans of forms of interactions typical of human communication, i.e. the attribution to an artifact of the position of interlocutor in a possible dialogue. It can be shown that attributing to an artifact the position of interlocutor in a dialogue implies dealing with it as if it were endowed of the features characterizing human mind, i.e. mental states and emotions.

101,,"This dissertation examines the nineteenth-century prehistory of artificial intelligence as it relates to the representation of and response to non-human artificially-constructed others, especially those of a mechanical origin. As the machine was increasingly viewed and described in anthropomorphic terms, it operated as a double to the human, a mirror in which broad existential anxieties faced by a society in the midst of social, religious, and industrial revolutions could be confronted and explored. Through a close study of material culture, examining not only the primary texts, but also related articles, reviews, journal entries, and other ephemera, I trace the evolution of the figure of the machine other in its various forms: the machine masquerading as a human; the constructed other in pursuit of a human soul; and the human with the mind of a machine. In Chapter One, I explore the ways in which von Kempelen's fake automaton chess-player enabled a discussion of machine personhood by sparking public discourse surrounding the limits of human ingenuity, the possibility of mechanizing intelligence, and the origin of intelligence. In Chapter Two, I begin by demonstrating the interchangeability of “machine,” “automaton,” and “artificial” in the nineteenth-century and subsequently argue that Mary Shelley's Frankenstein created a space in fiction for a more complete exploration of what personhood for an artificially constructed non-human intelligence by allowing Frankenstein's creature an opportunity to speak for itself and construct its own identity through storytelling. In Chapter Three, I examine what makes certain machine-like thinkers acceptable and others abhorrent, and in particular, how Sherlock Holmes, although portrayed as possessing a machine-like mind, is rehabilitated through Doyle's revelation that he is, at best, a flawed machine, capable of error, failure, and imperfection, whereas other contemporary and preceding machine-like thinkers like Charles Babbage and his calculating machines or Baron Savich in E.P. Mitchell's “The Ablest Man in the World” are ultimately too perfectly machine to elicit empathy from the public. The creative portion of this dissertation is comprised of poems which explore these same themes and ideas.","Aitken, Neil T.",0,,37
102,,"During the mid-1950s, an almost unknown and erased-from-history armed anti-colonial revolt – the Fellaga/Youssefite rebellion – rippled across the Tunisian countryside, sweeping across the width and depth of the country, even penetrating urban cores. My dissertation, Farmers, Fellaga, and Frenchmen: National Liberation and Post-Colonial Development in Tunisia, recovers the historical memory of that revolt, writing the armed struggle and its repression into the history of the Tunisian national liberation struggle and its effects on subsequent state-building efforts. In so doing I locate the place of the rural smallholder and newly landless, who although central to national liberation would be marginal to post-colonial development. This story cuts against the grain of dominant post-colonial historiography, which depicts a unitary and largely non-violent Western-oriented national struggle as the agent of independence. Such a narrative is the cement which the party has used to justify both its rule, post-colonial developmentalism, and subsequent social inclusions and exclusions. My dissertation shows how moments of collective violence, fueled by regional pan-Arab solidarities and materiel, propelled the political party which led the liberation movement, the Neo-Destour, to victory and secured the country's sovereignty from France. Simultaneously, the repression of that struggle led to the exclusion of the marginalized countryside from subsequent state-formation and economic development plans. I trace how the memory of that revolt animated an array of post-colonial plans, from both the General Union of Tunisian Workers, the governing party, and independent and party-linked French and Tunisian intellectuals and planners. I then show how subsequent plans contained social unrest and wove Tunisia into global commodity flows in lieu of centralizing smallholders in development planning. I then trace how the subsequent course of modernization, industrialization, and exclusion produced tensions strong enough to shatter the developmentalist compact by the end of the 1960s.","Ajl, Max Smith",0,,38

As to teachers' moral knowledge base, seven moral categories emerged with 'Teachers as Moral Agents' being the most frequently recalled category. Gender and experience were found to affect the order and the frequency of the thought categories teachers produced in different groups. The top thought categories for experienced and less experienced, female and male teachers were identified to be Student Problem, Teachers as Moral Agents, Student Problem and Student Manner respectively.","Akbari, R.",0,10.1080/03057240.2011.630384,39
105,,"This thesis presents a framework for the design of interfaces that can only obtain noisy and discrete inputs at high latency from a human user (e.g., with an electroencephalograph) to control a robotic system (e.g., a robotic wheelchair) that can provide visual feedback. In this framework, the human user communicates their intent by providing inputs in response to queries posed by the robot. The underlying problem is then to construct a policy that determines the next query to be posed in order for the robot to infer the user's intent as quickly and as reliably as possible. The approach is to maximize the expected amount of information to be obtained per unit of time from the user's response given a Bayesian estimate of the user's intent and an estimate of how quickly and accurately the robot can obtain the user's response. Under certain conditions, this policy reduces to the optimal feedback policy for transmitting a message between two computational agents over discrete noisy channels. Remarkably, for an interesting class of user intents (e.g., desired paths for robotic navigation), the queries synthesized by the optimal feedback policy can be easily understood and used by humans to convey their intent to the robot. As a case study in the application of this framework, this thesis focuses on the design of EEG-based brain-robot interfaces, which allow human users to control robotic systems with an electroencephalograph (EEG). It presents two interfaces for robotic navigation, where the user's intent was a desired path to be followed by the robot, and one interface for text entry, where the user's intent was a desired character to be spelled. The first interface enabled users to navigate a simulated aircraft ying at a fixed speed and altitude over smooth paths that corresponded to a sequence of path primitives. The second interface enabled users to navigate a mobile robot in a virtual indoor environment over paths that (locally) minimized a cost function recovered from human-demonstrated data. These two interfaces provided a new strategy, i.e., navigation based on querying desired paths, which was shown to be advantageous over existing EEG-based interfaces for robotic navigation. The third interface enabled users to specify text commands with inputs obtained from steady-state visually-evoked potentials in EEG at a rate twice as fast as they would using prior state-of-the-art text entry interfaces working with the same input mechanism. This interface showed the importance of querying human intent adaptively based on the prior knowledge on human intent (e.g., likelihoods of characters) and the expected accuracy and latency of inputs.","Akce, Abdullah",0,,40
106,Stories as mental representations of an agent's subjective world: A structural overview,"Narrative is a universal form of human information and communication. The generative cognition of narrative will be a core element of a human-like and human-friendly autonomous agent. In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the knowledge aspect of narrative, including script knowledge and episodic memory, has been studied from a functional perspective. However, this knowledge aspect is rooted in the close relationship between a narrative and how the human mind organizes subjective experiences into a mental representation. We use the term ""story"" to refer to the uniform mental representation of a piece of a subjective world containing individual meaning and a rich temporal extent. For example, stories include the following types of mental object: an episodic memory, an autobiographical memory, the contextual structure of a current situation, a prospective memory, a planned or imagined future, and a fictional or virtual story. Although narrative cognition is a very complex problem for AI, a cognitive mechanism for dynamically generating mental stories through interacting with external environments is necessary for the ultimate autonomous agent. Considering this long-term goal, in this paper, we provide a structural overview of a subjective world formed by stories as experiences of an agent. In particular, the following structural aspects of mental stories are described: a story-based context of a current situation, association of past, future, and fictional stories, association of others' mental stories, and the distinction between factual and fictitious stories.","Akimoto, T.",1,10.1016/j.bica.2018.07.003,41

The working group of the study consists of 47 students, taking 'Multimedia Design and Creation' classes in the spring term of 2010-2011 academic year in the department of Computer Education and Instructional Technologies of Ankara University. In terms of two variables, students were assigned to four different experiment groups at random. All of the experimental studies were maintained online. Measurements regarding dependent variables were carried out online. Problem Solving Inventory (PSI) is used to measure problem solving ability perceptions. Pre-test problem solving ability perception points were controlled in order to determine the effect of experimental operations on groups and post-test points were then compared. It is determined that applied method has an important effect on problem solving ability perception of students and that the educational agent in the role of teacher is more effective than the role of friend in the development of problem solving ability perception.","Akyuz, Halil Ibrahim",1,,42

An inhibitor of AAG is required to further study this mechanism and form a potential lead for future drug discovery. In previous work, to discover an inhibitor, a published X-ray co-crystal structure of AAG was used in a virtual screen of two million compounds for potential binding activity. Of the top 49 virtual hits, one real hit triazole-thione-based inhibitor (UNIS00021) with an IC50 of ~60 µM was identified in a biochemical assay. In this thesis, efforts to design and synthesise analogues of UNIS00021 with improved potency against AAG are described. Successful divergent syntheses were developed which provided access to: 1. analogues varying at the alkyl group of the amide (six different amides); 2. analogues with a free amine in place of the amide and with variation of the length of the alkyl linkage group (five different amines); and 3. analogues bearing a C5-methyl group instead of thiol/thione at the core (one cyclohexylamide triazole). Work was also begun on the synthesis of analogues varying the N4-CH2-aryl group but was not completed due to time constraints. Two main types of microplate biochemical assay were investigated for assessment of the candidate inhibitors’ potencies against AAG using: 1. a surface-bound fluorescein-conjugated substrate DNA-oligomer; and 2. a free substrate oligomer and LCMS. Despite much experimentation, these assays continued to show inconsistent and irreproducible inhibition curves so it was not possible to make conclusions about the candidate inhibitors’ potencies.","Al Yahyaei, Balqees",0,,43
110,,"Life-like characters are playing vital role in social computing by making human-computer interaction more easy and spontaneous. Nowadays, use of these characters to interact in online virtual environment has gained immense popularity. In this paper, we proposed a framework for a text-based chat system embodied with a life-like virtual agent that aims at natural communication between the users. To achieve this kind of system, we developed an agent that performs some nonverbal communications such as generating facial expression and motions by analyzing the text messages of the users. More specifically, this agent is capable of generating facial expressions for six basic emotions such as happy, sad, fear, angry, surprise, and disgust along with two additional emotions, irony and determined.Then to make the interaction between the users more realistic and lively, we added motions such as eye blink and head movements. We measured our proposed system from different aspects and found the results satisfactory, which make us believe that this kind of system can play a significant role in making an interaction episode more natural, effective, and interesting. Experimental evaluation reveals that the proposed agent can display emotive expressions correctly 93% of the time by analyzing the users’ text input.

This smart arc therapy decreases the treatment time, which decreases the patient motion and the internal motion of the tumor. This thesis came to study the accuracy of this kind of treatment in heterogenetic region like the head and neck regions. TLDs and EBT2 Gafchromic films have been used in side an anthropomorphic phantom for this dosimetric study. These two dosimeters have been used to determine the dose in specific points and to compare the results with the computer plan. Also, EBT2 films have been used to study the isodose distribution on the anthropomorphic phantom slices. After collecting VMAT data, we applied IMRT and Conventional treatment to the same plan, and compared the results with VMAT results. We concluded that VMAT therapy gave the better results over the other kinds of therapy. However, the treatment gave 7.3% fewer doses than what ADAC expected at the high dose and low gradient region.","Aldaais, Ebtisam Abdullatif",0,,45
113,A Novel Computer-Based Set-Up to Study Movement Coordination in Human Ensembles,"Existing experimental works on movement coordination in human ensembles mostly investigate situations where each subject is connected to all the others through direct visual and auditory coupling, so that unavoidable social interaction affects their coordination level. Here, we present a novel computer-based set-up to study movement coordination in human groups so as to minimize the influence of social interaction among participants and implement different visual pairings between them. In so doing, players can only take into consideration the motion of a designated subset of the others. This allows the evaluation of the exclusive effects on coordination of the structure of interconnections among the players in the group and their own dynamics. In addition, our set-up enables the deployment of virtual computer players to investigate dyadic interaction between a human and a virtual agent, as well as group synchronization in mixed teams of human and virtual agents. We show how this novel set-up can be employed to study coordination both in dyads and in groups over different structures of interconnections, in the presence as well as in the absence of virtual agents acting as followers or leaders. Finally, in order to illustrate the capabilities of the architecture, we describe some preliminary results. The platform is available to any researcher who wishes to unfold the mechanisms underlying group synchronization in human ensembles and shed light on its socio-psychological aspects.","Alderisio, F.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00967,46
117,Understanding the complexity of the lived experiences of Foundation Degree sport lecturers within the context of Further Education,"This paper provides an ethnographic account of the lived experiences of Further Education (FE) lecturers (N=4) who are engaged in the transmission of pedagogic knowledge within a Foundation Degree. To further understand the experiences of the lecturers the paper draws upon Stones' quadripartite cycle of structuration. This conceptual and methodological approach has informed an understanding of how the transmission of pedagogical knowledge is shaped through connections between the external structures of FE and the embodied practices of agents. The paper draws its empirical perspective from an ethnographic case study exploring relations and experiences of agents within one FE college, Hope (pseudonym). The data highlights the numerous in-situ practices of the lecturers, reflecting how their embodied experiences and resulting agency continually influence the transmission of conjunctural-specific forms of pedagogic knowledge. The data draws attention to the knowledgeability of agents in evolving and reproducing forms of pedagogic knowledge socially, intellectually and corporeally and how this begins to shape the student experience. The paper concludes by reflecting upon the complexity of their role and the outcomes of this for the transmission of pedagogic knowledge within the context of FE and the need to reflect upon how FE supports lecturers within this context.","Aldous, D.",0,10.1080/13573322.2012.674506,47
118,Partners of humans: a realistic assessment of the role of robots in the foreseeable future,"As robots are generally thought to perform human-like tasks, they depend on the successes of information technology in the area of artificial intelligence to succeed in such pursuits. But robots, through their anthropomorphic character and their weighty presence in science fiction, attract the attention of the press and the media in a way that, at times, blurs the distinction between the actual state of the art and exaggerated claims. This makes it hard to assess the true functional positioning of robots, how this is likely to move forward and whether the outcome of progress could be detrimental to human society. The aim of this paper is to review the actual level of competence that is being achieved in robotics research laboratories and a plausible impact that this is likely to have on human control over life and jobs. The key thesis here is that cognition in machines and even an artificial form of consciousness lead to operations in a set of tasks (the 'algorithmic' category) which is different from that available to truly cognitive and conscious human beings (the 'life-need' category): that is, in the paper it is argued that a major category error (Ryle in The concept of mind, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1949) looms in predictions of serious threats to humanity. As far as a threat to jobs goes, it is argued that early attention to education and re-skilling of humans in the workplace can lead to an effective symbiosis between people and robots.","Aleksander, I.",0,10.1057/s41265-016-0032-4,48
119,Mimebot-Investigating the Expressibility of Non-Verbal Communication Across Agent Embodiments,"Unlike their human counterparts, artificial agents such as robots and game characters may be deployed with a large variety of face and body configurations. Some have articulated bodies but lack facial features, and others may be talking heads ending at the neck. Generally, they have many fewer degrees of freedom than humans through which they must express themselves, and there will inevitably be a filtering effect when mapping human motion onto the agent. In this article, we investigate filtering effects on three types of embodiments: (a) an agent with a body but no facial features, (b) an agent with a head only, and (c) an agent with a body and a face. We performed a full performance capture of a mime actor enacting short interactions varying the non-verbal expression along five dimensions (e.g., level of frustration and level of certainty) for each of the three embodiments. We performed a crowd-sourced evaluation experiment comparing the video of the actor to the video of an animated robot for the different embodiments and dimensions. Our findings suggest that the face is especially important to pinpoint emotional reactions but is also most volatile to filtering effects. The body motion, on the other hand, had more diverse interpretations but tended to preserve the interpretation after mapping and thus proved to be more resilient to filtering.","Alexanderson, S.",0,10.1145/3127590,49
123,"Conjugal Utopia: Marriage and Social Transformation in Rousseau's Julie, ou la Nouvelle Heloise and Leprince de Beaumont's La Nouvelle Clarice","Utopias represent a crucial means of Enlightenment critique and inquiry. A general eighteenth-century blind spot vis-a-vis women as subjects and sociopolitical agents, as well as the discrepancy be tween their onerous obligations and incommensurate rights, is thrown into stark relief by two utopias: Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Julie, ou la Nouvelle Heloise (1761) and Marie Leprince de Beaumont's La Nouvelle Clarice (1767). The writers' pedagogical backgrounds inform each novel's emphasis on a heroine's education, which determines the utopian program of each society. Though both utopias place women at the centre of a complex social order, Rousseau's imagined community is predicated on the self-abnegation of the heroine. In contrast, Leprince de Beaumont's novel requires the male protagonist to re-establish his tainted virtue through marriage and the implementation of a female-dominated utopian community. Through its unmistakeable reversal of La Nouvelle Heloise's utopian paradigm, La Nouvelle Clarice functions as a dynamic critique of Rousseau's seminal plot and provides a striking vision of a matriarchal utopia that simultaneously refuses closure and any limits on women's political and social activity.","Alexandrova, E.

124,,"Students in higher education institutions are often advised to think critically, yet without being guided to do so. The study investigated the use of a conversational agent (Botocrates) for supporting critical thinking and academic argumentation skills. The overarching research questions were: can a conversational agent support critical thinking and academic argumentation skills? If so, how? The study was carried out in two stages: modelling and evaluating Botocrates' prototype. The prototype was a Wizard-of-Oz system where a human plays Botocrates' role by following a set of instructions and knowledge-base to guide generation of responses. Both stages were conducted at the School of Education at the University of Leeds. In the first stage, the study analysed 13 logs of online seminars in order to define the tasks and dialogue strategies needed to be performed by Botocrates. The study identified two main tasks of Botocrates: providing answers to students' enquiries and engaging students in the argumentation process. Botocrates’ dialogue strategies and contents were built to achieve these two tasks. The novel theoretical framework of the ‘challenge to explain’ process and the notion of the ‘constructive expansion of exchange structure’ were produced during this stage and incorporated into Botocrates’ prototype. The aim of the ‘challenge to explain’ process is to engage users in repeated and constant cycles of reflective thinking processes. The ‘constructive expansion of exchange structure’ is the practical application of the ‘challenge to explain’ process. In the second stage, the study used the Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) experiments and interviews to evaluate Botocrates’ prototype. 7 students participated in the evaluation stage and each participant was immediately interviewed after chatting with Botocrates. The analysis of the data gathered from the WOZ and interviews showed encouraging results in terms of students’ engagement in the process of argumentation. As a result of the role of ‘critic’ played by Botocrates during the interactions, users actively and positively adopted the roles of explainer, clarifier, and evaluator. However, the results also showed negative experiences that occurred to users during the interaction. Improving Botocrates’ performance and training users could decrease users’ unsuccessful and negative experiences. The study identified the critical success and failure factors related to achieving the tasks of Botocrates.","Alharbi, Abdulqader Hamid F.",0,,51

126,The Effects of Talking-Head with Various Realism Levels on Students' Emotions in Learning,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of various realistic levels of talking-head on students' emotions in pronunciation learning. Four talking-head characters with varying levels of realism were developed and tested: a nonrealistic three-dimensional character, a realistic three-dimensional character, a two-dimensional character, and an actual human character. The student's emotional level was measured with the learning component of Achievement Emotions Questionnaire following their exploration of the instructional material on a self-paced learning method. The research method was a quasi-experimental design, and the data were analyzed using ANCOVA test. The sample consisted of 150 Semester 1 students from four community colleges. The findings revealed significant differences (p<.05) in emotion test outcomes among groups who received different levels of realism for the talking-head in pronunciation learning app. In conclusion, this study recommends a nonrealistic three-dimensional, two-dimensional, or actual human character as the most suitable design for the talking-head in instructional materials.","Ali, A.

128,Effects of Verbal Components in 3D Talking-head on Pronunciation Learning among Non-native Speakers,"This study was designed to investigate the benefit of inclusion of various verbal elements in 3D talking-head on pronunciation learning among non-native speakers. In particular, the study examines the effects of three different multimedia presentation strategies in 3D talking-head Mobile-Assisted-Language-Learning (MALL) on the learning achievement of students with low English pronunciation skills. Pre-test and post-test scores were utilized to determine the students' overall performance. 60 college students with low pronunciation skill were involved, in which they were divided into three equal groups of 20 students. Scores obtained were analyzed statistically with one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the pre-test scores as covariate. The findings revealed that 3D talking-head with spoken text and on-screen text MALL has significant contribution in retaining the correct pronunciation acquisition in comparison with 3D talking-head with spoken-text alone MALL and spoken text with on-screen text MALL. Therefore, it may be concluded that multiple sources of verbal information to identify and decode language input are advantageous for effective pronunciation learning, specifically among non-native speakers.","Ali, A.

131,,"Identifying, examining, and understanding faculty members’ technological knowledge development and the process of technology adoption in higher education is a multifaceted process. Past studies have used Rogers (1995, 2003) diffusion of innovation theoretical framework to delineate the technology adoption process. These studies, however, have frequently reported the influencing factors based on the statistical analysis such as regression analysis-based approach, and have not focused on the emerging process of technology adoptions or the developing process of technological knowledge and pedagogical knowledge. A mixed method study was designed to see how faculty members acquire different technologies and develop technological knowledge that might help them adopt technologies in their classrooms and online using different pedagogies. A sample of STEM teaching faculty members with different ranks, tenure, teaching experience, and varied degree of experience in the use of educational technologies participated in the study. A survey was designed to identify internal and external factors affecting technology adoption and its effective use in different teaching activities. To elaborate survey results, the study also included class observations as well as pre- and post-observation interviews. Online classrooms used by the faculty via Blackboard learning management system, online flipped classrooms, or other websites such as Piazza were also examined for data triangulation. The findings of the study indicate that faculty members are influenced by their own professional motivations and student learning to improve their teaching methods and to enhance student interactions and learning through the use of different educational technologies. The adoption process was identified as spreading over a period of time and it looked at how faculty members’ developed their technological knowledge and pedagogical knowledge. With the recognition of the social, organizational, and professional motivational factors both expert faculty members, university administrators, and technologist could be made aware of the critical components necessary to construct and support a bottom-up or user-centric successful innovation adoption decision process. The bottom-up approach would use expert professors as change agents and educational designers that would encourage exchanges and meaningful dialogues about educational technology adoptions and effective uses of technology with pedagogy within each discipline and department.","Ali, Zarka Asghar",0,,55
132,,"Humanoid robots needs to have human-like motions and appearance in order to be well-accepted by humans. Mimicking is a fast and user-friendly way to teach them human-like motions. However, direct assignment of observed human motions to robot’s joints is not possible due to their physical differences. This paper presents a real-time inverse kinematics based human mimicking system to map human upper limbs motions to robot’s joints safely and smoothly. It considers both main definitions of motion similarity, between end-effector motions and between angular configurations. Microsoft Kinect sensor is used for natural perceiving of human motions. Additional constraints are proposed and solved in the projected null space of the Jacobian matrix. They consider not only the workspace and the valid motion ranges of the robot’s joints to avoid self-collisions, but also the similarity between the end-effector motions and the angular configurations to bring highly human-like motions to the robot. Performance of the proposed human mimicking system is quantitatively and qualitatively assessed and compared with the state-of-the-art methods in a human-robot interaction task using Nao humanoid robot. The results confirm applicability and ability of the proposed human mimicking system to properly mimic various human motions.

135,,"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed and implemented in many areas as a new communication channel between the human brain and external devices. Despite their rapid growth and broad popularity, the inaccurate performance and cost of user-training are yet the main issues that prevent their application out of the research and clinical environment. We previously introduced a BCI system for the control of a very humanlike android that could raise a sense of embodiment and agency in the operators only by imagining a movement (motor imagery) and watching the robot perform it. Also using the same setup, we further discovered that the positive bias of subjects’ performance both increased their sensation of embodiment and improved their motor imagery skills in a short period. In this work, we studied the shared mechanism between the experience of embodiment and motor imagery.We compared the trend of motor imagery learning when two groups of subjects BCI-operated different looking robots, a very humanlike android’s hands and a pair of metallic gripper. Although our experiments did not show a significant change of learning between the two groups immediately during one session, the android group revealed better motor imagery skills in the follow up session when both groups repeated the task using the non-humanlike gripper. This result shows that motor imagery skills learnt during the BCI-operation of humanlike hands are more robust to time and visual feedback changes. We discuss the role of embodiment and mirror neuron system in such outcome and propose the application of androids for efficient BCI training.

138,Removal of proprioception by BCI raises a stronger body ownership illusion in control of a humanlike robot,"Body ownership illusions provide evidence that our sense of self is not coherent and can be extended to non-body objects. Studying about these illusions gives us practical tools to understand the brain mechanisms that underlie body recognition and the experience of self. We previously introduced an illusion of body ownership transfer (BOT) for operators of a very humanlike robot. This sensation of owning the robot's body was confirmed when operators controlled the robot either by performing the desired motion with their body (motion-control) or by employing a brain-computer interface (BCI) that translated motor imagery commands to robot movement (BCI-control). The interesting observation during BCI-control was that the illusion could be induced even with a noticeable delay in the BCI system. Temporal discrepancy has always shown critical weakening effects on body ownership illusions. However the delay-robustness of BOT during BCI-control raised a question about the interaction between the proprioceptive inputs and delayed visual feedback in agency-driven illusions. In this work, we compared the intensity of BOT illusion for operators in two conditions; motion-control and BCI-control. Our results revealed a significantly stronger BOT illusion for the case of BCI-control. This finding highlights BCI's potential in inducing stronger agency-driven illusions by building a direct communication between the brain and controlled body, and therefore removing awareness from the subject's own body.","Alimardani, M.",0,10.1038/srep33514,58
141,"Effects of Real Estate Brokers' Marketing Strategies: Public Open Houses, Broker Open Houses, MLS Virtual Tours, and MLS Photographs","The existence of the real estate brokerage industry is generally attributed to high transaction costs in real estate markets. Brokers are typically expected to market sellers' properties, assist in contract negotiations, and coordinate the post-contract tasks necessary to close transactions. Presumably, brokers can perform these duties at lower cost than sellers. In addition to cost efficiencies, brokers may also impact market outcomes. Numerous researchers have investigated whether or not the use of brokers as well as various broker actions, broker characteristics, and broker/seller legal relationships affect market outcomes in the form of price and/or, time-on-the-market effects. We extend this line of research by considering price, time-on-market, and probability of sale effects in relation to four specific broker strategies: public open houses, broker open houses, MLS virtual tours, and MLS photographs. The results indicate positive relationships between these strategies and house prices and mixed relationships between these strategies and probability of sale and time-on-market.","Allen, M.

146,,"The uncanny valley is the tendency for highly humanlike, but non-human agents (e.g., robots, animated characters, dolls) to be perceived as creepy or unsettling, relative to their less humanlike counterparts. Recent research has pointed to mismatching signals of humanity as a possible explanation for the uncanny valley. The current work aimed to extend this hypothesis by investigating whether conflicting signals of humanity from face processing styles and featural cues can trigger negative affect. To this end, participants viewed faces that were morphed on a continuum from full dolls to full humans and indicated the extent to which these faces are unsettling. Critically, on half of the trials, faces were inverted to disrupt configural face processing, a processing style that involves viewing faces as a single Gestalt and is a cue for humanity. When faces were highly humanlike, they were experienced as less creepy than less humanlike faces, but when such targets were inverted, processing and featural signals did not disagree with one another, and some of the feelings of unease were alleviated.","Almaraz, Steven Michael",0,,61

This type of training, which is almost a replica of the real-world experience, gives the trainee teacher enough confidence to become an expert teacher. In this classroom simulation, six trainee teachers evaluated the SL teaching experience by survey using qualitative and quantitative methods that measured interaction, simulated behaviour, and safety. Additionally, six observers evaluated trainee teachers' performance according to a set of teaching roles and roleplay approaches. The experiment scenario was set up between smartbots, trainee teacher avatars, and observer avatars in the virtual classroom, where smartbots are intelligent agents managing SL bots, and where groups are similar to one another but are under programming control.","Alotaibi, Fahad Mazaed",0,,62
148,,"In a complex adaptive system, diverse agents perform various actions without adherence to a predefined structure. The achievement of collaborative actions will be the result of continual interactions among them that shape a dynamic network. Agents may form an ad hoc organization based on the dynamic network of interactions for the purpose of achieving a long-term objective, which we termed a Network Organization (NO). Fervent and agile communication on social networking sites provides opportunities for potential issues to trigger individuals into individual actions as well as the attraction and mobilization of like-minded individuals into an NO that is both physically and virtually emergent. Examples are the rapid pace of Arab Spring proliferation and the diffusion rate of the Occupy Movement. We are motivated by a spontaneously formed NO as well as the quality of plasticity that enables the organization to change rapidly to describe an NO. Thus, we present a paradigm that serves as a reference model for organizations of socially networked individuals. This paradigm suggests modular components that can be combined to form an ad hoc network organization of agents. We touch on how this model accounts for external change in an environment through internal adjustment. For the predominant influences of the network substrate in an NO, multiple effects of it have an impact on the NO behaviors and directions. We envisioned several dimensions of such effects to include synergy, social capital, externality, influence, etc. A special focus in this work is measuring synergy and social capital as two predominant network effects. Synergy is perceived as different modalities of compatibility among agents when performing a set of coherent and correspondingly different actions. When agents are under no structural obligation to contribute, synergy is quantified through multiple forms of serendipitous agent chosen benevolence among them. The approach is to measure four types of benevolence and the pursuant synergies stemming from agent interactions. Social capital is another effect of networking that describes the accumulation of positive values of social flow and perceived trust plus abundance of communication over the common topic of NO. We provide measurement of social capital based on an agents’ expected benevolence. We examine those two effects in two different case studies — one case of a virtual organization and another of a real world terrorist organization — that best illustrate the main tenets of our conceptualization.","Alqithami, Saad",0,,63

Present agents state recognition is introduced as a demanding matter in security classification systems in a wide assortment of environments. This research exploits the correlation between existing agents, sensory data and the environment under surveillance to end up with a well-chosen security classification and consequently a decision. The system operator’s state responsiveness can be attained based on monitored agents’ behaviors. The proposed model utilizes three different types of sensors namely Pressure Sensor, Active Sonar and Infrared where there are three of each sensor (Active Sonar and Infrared). Sensors similarity and complementarity concepts are applied after proper data is collected in real-time. Sensors measurement fusion is the essence of data preprocessing “sensor similarity”; whereas, state vector fusion blend the three types of sensory data altogether within the loop of Extended Kalman Filter. Data is then fed to a Fuzzified Extended Kalman Filter which perform the data fusion process of all the sensory data. Based on the risk and suspiciousness degrees of the monitoring system, moving agents are assessed. A Hyper-Fuzzy logic is utilized in the system as a decision making sub-system that allows the monitored area to be carefully and completely examined for any abnormal activities.

150,,"The real time monitoring of environment context aware activities, based on distributed detection, is becoming a standard in public safety and service delivery in a wide range of domains (child and elderly care and supervision, logistics, circulation, and other). The safety of people, goods and premises depends on the prompt immediate reaction to potential hazards identified in real time, at an early stage to engage appropriate control actions. Effective emergency response can be supported only by available and acquired expertise or elaborate collaborative knowledge in the domain of distributed detection that include indoor sensing, tracking and localizing. This research proposes a hybrid conceptual multi-agent framework for the acquisition of collaborative knowledge in dynamic complex context aware environments for distributed detection. This framework has been applied for the design and development of a hybrid intelligent multi-agent decision system (HIDSS) that supports a decentralized active sensing, tracking and localizing strategy, and the deployment and configuration of smart detection devices associated to active sensor nodes wirelessly connected in a network topology to configure, deploy and control ad hoc wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This system, which is based on the interactive use of data, models and knowledge base, has been implemented to support fire detection and control access fusion functions aimed at elaborating: An integrated data model, grouping the building information data and WSN-RFID database, composed of the network configuration and captured data, A virtual layout configuration of the controlled premises, based on using a building information model, A knowledge-based support for the design of generic detection devices, A multi-criteria decision making model for generic detection devices distribution, ad hoc WSNs configuration, clustering and deployment, and Predictive data models for evacuation planning, and fire and evacuation simulation. An evaluation of the system prototype has been carried out to enrich information and knowledge fusion requirements and show the scope of the concepts used in data and process modelling. It has shown the practicability of hybrid solutions grouping generic homogeneous smart detection devices enhanced by heterogeneous support devices in their deployment, forming ad hoc networks that integrate WSNs and radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The novelty in this work is the web-based support system architecture proposed in this framework that is based on the use of intelligent agent modelling and multi-agent systems, and the decoupling of the processes supporting the multi-sensor data fusion from those supporting different context applications. Although this decoupling is essential to appropriately distribute the different fusion functions, the integration of several dimensions of policy settings for the modelling of knowledge processes, and intelligent and pro-active decision making activities, requires the organisation of interactive fusion functions deployed upstream to a safety and emergency response.","Alshahrany, Falah",0,,65
151,,"Purpose of this study was to validate a novel CyberKnife stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment planning on an MRI-based 3D prostate model insert in an anthropomorphic pelvis phantom using Gafchromic EBT3 films to perform dosimetric measurements. The methodology of this study is based on a pelvis phantom and a physical printed 3D model of the prostate with dominant intra-prostatic-lesion and surrounding organs at risk segmented from a patient MR images. Cyberknife prostate treatment planning was performed to have at least 95% the planning target volumes (PTV: prostate expanded with margins of 5 mm in all directions except 3 mm posteriorly) covered by 3625 cGy (725x5) and a simultaneous dose escalation to 4750 cGy on the dominant intra-prostatic-lesion. Plan dosimetry verification was performed using Gafchromic EBT3 films on a Stereotactic Dose Verification Phantom. First, film calibration was done on Gafchromic EBT3 films exposed to various doses of 0-2500 cGy based on a LINAC (Trilogy) and CyberKnife monthly quality assurance (QA) for machine output calibration. Second, absolute dose measurements were taken by using films within the dose range 0-2250 cGy. Third, Gafchromic EBT3 films were placed in coronal and sagittal planes on the standard “blue phantom” or Stereotactic Dose Verification Phantom (SDVP) on which one fraction of the treatment plan is delivered for verification measurements. Then, on the prostate-pelvis phantom, a dosimetry inserts were used with films through the DIL region. After the calibration, the accuracy of absolute dose measurements with EBT3 was verified to be ≤ 1% in the dose range of interest (500-1500 cGy). On the SDVP phantom, comparison of films vs. plan for the coronal plane yielded ? 99.7% passing rates while for sagittal plane yielded ≥ 95.3% passing rates under the gamma criteria of ≤ 2% in dose and ≤ 2mm in distance to agreement (DTA). This study demonstrated that it is feasible to plan and deliver a SBRT treatment to prostate with a simultaneous dose escalation to the dominant intra-prostatic lesion.","Alshammari, Meshari",0,,66
152,,"The aim of this thesis is to report on a transdisciplinary approach, regarding the complexity of thinking about human embodiment in relation to machine embodiment. A practical dimension of this thesis is to elicit some principles for the design and evaluation of virtual embodiment. The transdisciplinary approach suggests, firstly, that a single discipline or reality is, on its own, not sufficient to explain the complexity and dynamism of the embodied interaction between the human and machine. Secondly, the thesis argues for thinking of transdisciplinary research as a process of individuation, becoming or transduction, that is, as a process of mediation between heterogeneous approaches rather than perceiving research as a stabilized cognitive schema designed to accumulate new outcomes to the already-there reality. Arguing for going beyond the individualized approaches to embodiment, this thesis analyzes three cases where the problems that appear in one case are resolved through the analysis of the following one. Consisting of three phases, this research moves from objective scientific 'reality' to more phenomenological, subjective and complex realities. The first study employs a critical review of embodied conversational agents in human-computer interaction (HCI) in a learning context using a comparative meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was applied because most of the studies for evaluating embodiment are experimental. A learning context was selected because the number of studies is suitable for meta-analysis and the findings could be generalized to other contexts. The analysis reveals that there is no 'persona effect', that is, the expected positive effect of virtual embodiment on the participant's affective, perceptive and cognitive measures. On the contrary, it shows the reduction of virtual embodiment to image and a lack of consideration for the participant's embodiment and interaction, in addition to theoretical and methodological shortcomings. The second phase solves these problems by focusing on Mark Hansen's phenomenological account of embodiment in new media. The investigation shows that Hansen improves on the HCI account by focusing on the participant's dynamic interaction with new media. Nevertheless, his views of embodied perception and affection are underpinned by a subjective patriarchal account leading to object/subject and body/work polarizations. The final phase resolves this polarization by analyzing the controversial work of Alan Turing on intelligent machinery. The research provides a different reading of the Turing Machine based on Simondon's concept of individuation, repositioning its materiality from the abstract non-existent to the actual-virtual realm and investigating the reasons for its abstraction. It relates the emergence of multiple human-machine encounters in Turing's work to the complex counter-becoming of what it describes as 'the Turing Machine compound'.","Al-Shihi, Hamda Darwish Ali",1,,67
153,,"Collective animal behavior plays a major role in optimization decision making. Making decisions in a complex environment like an ant colony provides significant solutions for many problems. Ant colony employs individuals who have limited ability and rules of behavior, but together make a complex system. In this thesis, the Virtual Ant Laboratory (VAL) model is introduced to simulate ants’ foraging behavior. It has two options: closed and open arenas to simulate the ants’ environments and their behaviors, including food consumption as well as communication. As an interactive simulation and prediction tool VAL provides the ability to generate customized complex ant environments. The can determine additional features of the environment, such as food quality and quantity, food source distance to the nest, physical obstacles, adjustable pheromone evaporation and diffusion rates, and varying agent (ant) populations. The model shows that the quality of the food and the distance between the nest and food sources have a significant impact on the density and distribution of the pheromone and, thus, subsequent decisions by the ants. As a result, each ant in the colony will gain the ability to reach their goal by choosing the nearest food. Sharing information by the trail presents a fascinating technique to analyze, improve and/or present new solutions for many problems in complex systems.","Alsultaan, Heba",0,,68
154,,"Grid computing technology is used as inexpensive systems to gather and utilize computational capability. This technology enhances applications services by arranging machines and distributed resources in a single huge computational entity. A Grid is a system that has the ability to organize resources which are not under the subject of centralized domain, utilize protocols and interfaces, and supply high quality of service. The Grid should have the ability to enhance not only the systems performance and job throughput of the applications participated but also increase the utilization scale of resources by employing effective resource management methods to the huge amount of its resources. Grid mobility appears as a technology to facilitate the accomplishment of requirements for Grid jobs as well as Grid users. This idea depends on migrating or relocating jobs, data and application software among Grid nodes. However, making use of mobility technology leads to data confidentiality problems within the Grid. Data confidentiality is the protection of data from intruders’ attacks. The data confidentiality can be addressed by limiting the mobility to trusted parts of the Grid, but this solution leads to the notion of Virtual Organizations (VOs). Also as a result of mobility technology the need for a tool to organize and enforce policies while applying the mobility has been increased. To date, not enough attention has been paid to policies that deal with data movements within the Grid. Most existing Grid systems have support only limited types of policies (e.g. CPU resources). A few designs consider enforcing data policies in their architecture. Therefore, we propose a policy-managed Grid environment that addresses these issues (user-submitted policy, data policy, and multiple VOs). In this research, a new policy management tool has been introduced to solve the mobility limitation and data confidentiality especially in the case of mobile sharing and data movements within the Grid. We present a dynamic and heterogeneous policy management framework that can give a clear policy definition about the ability to move jobs, data and application software from nodes to nodes during jobs’ execution in the Grid environment. This framework supports a multi-organization environment with different domains, supports the external Grid user preferences along with enforces policies for data movements and the mobility feature within different domains. The results of our research have been evaluated using Jade simulator, which is a software framework fully implemented in Java language and allows agents to execute tasks defined according to the agent policy. The simulation results have verified that the research aims enhance the security and performance in the Grid environments. They also show enhanced control over data and services distribution and usage and present practical evidence in the form of scenario test-bed data as to the effectiveness of our architecture.","Alwada’n, Tariq Falah",0,,69
155,,"This thesis is a journey which started investigating CLT innovation and implementation in Syrian schools and, due to the armed conflict in the country, ended with another layer of focus on the impact of Syria War on (education and) ELT, teachers and students. Employing a qualitative approach, the data incorporated audio-recordings and interviews as the two main research tools in the study. The lesson transcripts from two teachers in Syria (Grade 7) and a teacher in a camp school in Turkey (Grade 8) were explored in light of retrospective interviews to uncover how far teachers responded in their actual classroom practices to CLT curriculum innovation tenets and how implementation challenges, including teachers’ cognitions and contextual realities, influenced their practices. Celebrating diversity rather than uniformity, I also endeavoured to appreciate teachers’ own complex reasoning on their practices and how they made sense of their teaching in their immediate contexts. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 other Syrian teachers to further elicit perspectives on contextual forces and teacher beliefs, suggestions for a locally feasible ELT pedagogy and the impact of the current war circumstances on their lives and careers. The analysis of the data reveals the value of seeing teachers as agents of their own practice both in ‘normally’ difficult circumstances and in extreme crisis situations. Teachers’ pedagogical decisions and practices seem to be grounded on their beliefs as to what is viable rather than on the MoE plans. The study points to the significance of not only appreciating teacher beliefs and agency in establishing context-sensitive ELT pedagogies, but also capitalising upon local teachers’ experiences and perspectives and involving teachers in both educational planning and implementation. The final layer of the thesis shows that it is valuable to explore teacher agency in crisis situations and to consider ways to extend the literature to recognise conflict-affected ELT as a research area in which locally produced pedagogies are encouraged, supported and developed within the constraints of displacement and refugee camp schools.","Alyasin, Abulqader",0,,70
156,,"In this dissertation we address the topic of self-organization in multi-agent simulation systems from two perspectives: structural and application. Structural self-organization refers to the capability of the simulation system to re-organize its underlying environment structure to meet the simulation's functional and performance requirements. This feature is necessary when simulating a large number of sensor-based virtual agents evolving in a virtual environment that is open (i.e., non-deterministic, dynamic, continuous). If the environment structure is static, the large amount of processing required for virtual agent perception may lead to performance degradation. In this dissertation, we define a model and implementation of a self-organizing environment structure for the execution of a large number of virtual agents on a single machine. The environment self-organizing system consists of micro- and macro-level specialized agents. The specialized agents continuously interact with one another and re-organize the environment structure to ensure that both the functional and performance simulation requirements are met. Application-level self-organization refers to the simulation of a real-world self-organizing system. In this dissertation, we focus on the simulation of a specific category of cyber-physical systems, namely Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS). More precisely, we define Agent-ITS, a multi-layered agent-based self-organizing ITS. Agent-ITS consists of micro- and macro-level components. Micro-level components include context-aware intelligent vehicles and agent-based traffic control devices. Macro-level components are specialized agents whose goal is to inform, monitor, and guide micro-level components. The interactions between micro-and macro- level entities lead to a self-organization of the traffic infrastructure. We have developed MATISSE 2.0 (Multi-Agent based TraffIc Safety Simulation systEm), an agent-based simulation system for the specification and execution of simulation scenarios for Agent-ITS. MATISSE is used to simulate a self-organizing traffic model for urban emergency evacuation. The outcome of this work is a multi-agent simulation system which self-organizes at the structural level while simulating a self-organizing cyber-physical system at the application level.","Al-Zinati, Mohammad Hussein",0,,71
157,Digital manufacturing market: a semantic web-based framework for agile supply chain deployment,"Manufacturing Market is a market in which manufacturing process capacity is the object of trade. In a market, units of capacity, represented as manufacturing services, can be acquired as needed and when needed, thus making supply chains more responsive to fluctuations in supply and demand. Although Manufacturing Market can be built physically as a spot market, its benefits can be better realized in a web-based framework. We refer to the web-based version of Manufacturing Market as Digital Manufacturing Market (DMM). The major challenges in deployment of a virtual market for manufacturing services include standard representation of manufacturing needs and capabilities, incorporation of intelligent supplier search and evaluation mechanism, and automation of supply chain configuration process. This paper introduces DMM through its major components including a multi-agent framework, a formal ontology for representation of manufacturing services as well as a matchmaking methodology used for connecting buyers and sellers of manufacturing services based on their semantic similarities. The ultimate goal of the proposed framework is to enable autonomous deployment of manufacturing supply chains based on the specific technological requirements defined by particular work orders.","Ameri, F.",0,10.1007/s10845-010-0495-z,72
159,,"There is a growing societal need to address the increasing prevalence of behavioral health issues, such as obesity, alcohol or drug use, and general lack of treatment adherence for a variety of health problems. The statistics, worldwide and in the USA, are daunting. Excessive alcohol use is the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States (with 79,000 deaths annually), and is responsible for a wide range of health and social problems. On the positive side though, these behavioral health issues (and associated possible diseases) can often be prevented with relatively simple lifestyle changes, such as losing weight with a diet and/or physical exercise, or learning how to reduce alcohol consumption. Medicine has therefore started to move toward finding ways of preventively promoting wellness, rather than solely treating already established illness. Evidence-based patient-centered Brief Motivational Interviewing (BMI) interventions have been found particularly effective in helping people find intrinsic motivation to change problem behaviors after short counseling sessions, and to maintain healthy lifestyles over the long-term. Lack of locally available personnel well-trained in BMI, however, often limits access to successful interventions for people in need. To fill this accessibility gap, Computer-Based Interventions (CBIs) have started to emerge. Success of the CBIs, however, critically relies on insuring engagement and retention of CBI users so that they remain motivated to use these systems and come back to use them over the long term as necessary. Because of their text-only interfaces, current CBIs can therefore only express limited empathy and rapport, which are the most important factors of health interventions. Fortunately, in the last decade, computer science research has progressed in the design of simulated human characters with anthropomorphic communicative abilities. Virtual characters interact using humans’ innate communication modalities, such as facial expressions, body language, speech, and natural language understanding. By advancing research in Artificial Intelligence (AI), we can improve the ability of artificial agents to help us solve CBI problems. To facilitate successful communication and social interaction between artificial agents and human partners, it is essential that aspects of human social behavior, especially empathy and rapport, be considered when designing human-computer interfaces. Hence, the goal of the present dissertation is to provide a computational model of rapport to enhance an artificial agent’s social behavior, and to provide an experimental tool for the psychological theories shaping the model. Parts of this thesis were already published in [LYL+12, AYL12, AL13, ALYR13, LAYR13, YALR13, ALY14].","Amini, Reza",0,,73
160,,"Distributed cognition refers to situations in which task requirements are distributed among multiple agents or, potentially, off-loaded onto the environment. The idea assumes that the cognitive system is flexibly composed of various CNS components as well as non-neural bodily and environmental components, including other agents. Important to understanding distributed cognition is a consideration of how cognitive components become coordinated, and whether multi-agent cognitive coordination yields as a single cognitive system—an emergent, interpersonal cognitive synergy. Synergies are organizations of anatomical (and, potentially, environmental) components into a single, functional unit, such that the components work together and regulate one another to promote task performance. Synergies exhibit reciprocal compensation, or the interaction of components to accomplish the desired goal even in the face of obstacles. Synergies have a number of additional features found in complex systems, or systems with numerous, nonlinearly interacting elements across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Complex systems offer tools for identifying some of the features of cognitive synergies. For example, 1/f scaling has been demonstrated in a range of cognitive tasks, supporting the notion that features common to both complex systems and synergies play a key role in cognitive functioning. 1/f scaling, or ""pink noise,"" can be used as an indicator of coordination or task interdependence, with ""white noise"" as an indicator of independence. Three experiments compared isolated and distributed cognition to determine which are appropriately characterized as cognitive systems composed of individual agents or as distributed among (and irreducible to the behaviors of) multiple agents. Each experiment tested for interdependent and emergent properties of cognitive performance during distributed temporal estimation (TE) tasks. 1/f scaling was present during solo and dyadic tasks, providing evidence for task interdependence and emergence. 1/f scaling persisted with task modulations (Experiment 2) and perturbations (Experiment 3) to performance. Similarly, reciprocal compensation within dyads was observed across studies, which is a key feature of synergies. When one dyad member produced a shorter response-time, their partner was likely to have a longer response-time, and vice versa. The trial-by-trial compensation in the dyadic condition was associated with a mean response-time statistically equivalent to solo participants, indicating dyads were relatively successful in their goal of estimating 700 ms. The fact that both solo participants and dyads did not demonstrate longer timescale coordination beyond that observed in virtual pairs suggests that long timescale information may not be necessary to perform the task successfully. Interdependence and reciprocal compensation between participants demonstrated that properties common to complex systems and synergies emerged during a distributed cognitive task. The present studies provide preliminary support for the conjecture that a singular, non-decomposable cognitive system can be distributed. While more research is needed to understand the properties of distributed cognition, the findings support the hypothesis that the cognitive system is flexible in incorporating different parts of the CNS, non-neural parts of the body, and environment to behave adaptively.","Amon, Mary Jean",0,,74
161,,"Narrative is context where intention plays a critical role; individual characters collaborate and conflict while in pursuit of their intentions. We often experience suspense when a character’s intention is in doubt, or relief when a character’s malicious intent is foiled. This range of cognitive responses we exhibit to narrative leads some to characterize narrative as a fundamental cognitive ability of humans. Interactive narrative build on these foundations and is a powerful platform that engages our cognitive abilities through computational models of narrative phenomena. Its applications are wide ranging from education, to entertainment, and even to business (e.g. strategic foresight). One of the more ambitious goals of interactive narrative is for an experience manager, an agent who ensures certain experience qualities, to adapt the story structure to accommodate user actions that introduce inconsistencies to a story’s plot. Adapting the story structure in this way, which I refer to as a story branch, creates a virtual environment where a user is free to exact their agency. However, enabling agency by accommodating user actions is at odds with intentional plans that use the IPOCL representation. User actions can introduce causal link threats to the planned steps of a non-player character agent, making an agent’s goal impossible to achieve. To address this limitation of an experience manager, I make three major contributions in this dissertation. First, I formalize intention revision for intentional agents in a way that is consistent with human comprehension. I apply existing theories of belief-desire-intention agents and intentional logic to formalize definitions of intention revision for intentional planning. My evaluation shows that after experiencing the intention revision model I formalized, subject’s have an accurate mental model of intention revision. Second, I develop an algorithm that characterizes a planning problem’s solution space in a way that supports the formal definition of intention revision. The algorithm captures sets of interdependent agent goals that represent the causally-necessary agent goals to reach a given state. Results on benchmark problems show that when a planner uses the algorithm to direct planning, the planner achieves a more diverse plan-set that is a representative characterization of the solution space. Lastly, I investigate whether narrative texts that contain intention revisions generated from the aforementioned algorithm lead to greater subject engagement. Using intentional plans that contain intention revisions, I generate simple template-based natural language text that human subjects read. My analysis shows that subjects who read narrative texts where characters revise their intentions experience greater transportation and perceived interest than subjects who read texts where characters achieve their original intentions without issue.","Amos-Binks, Adam Alexis",0,,75
162,,"Ectopic eruption and impaction of the permanent maxillary canines represent a significant problem of dental development, occurring in 1% to 3% of the population. Careful observation of the development and eruption of maxillary canines is necessary in growing patients as canine impaction can result in serious sequelae to the dentition. A major sequela associated with impaction of maxillary canines is external root resorption of neighboring teeth. Root resorption is often clinically asymptomatic and mainly discovered during radiographic examination. Accurate diagnosis of canine position and detection of possible root resorption of adjacent teeth can significantly impact the orthodontic-surgical treatment planning. The successful management of impacted maxillary canines and possible root resorption of adjacent teeth involves accurate prediction and diagnosis along with proper timing of intervention. The purpose of this study was to measure juvenile radiation dose to organs of the head and neck in radiographic examination of root resorption associated with impacted maxillary canines during two-dimensional digital radiographic techniques and three-dimensional cone-beam tomographic scans using anthromorphic CIRS phantom at 10-years-old with nanoDot optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters (OSLDs). A juvenile anthropomorphic phantom (model 705; Computerized Imaging Reference System (CIRS), Norfolk, Va) corresponding to a 10-year-old male was used for all exposures. OSLDs were placed at 21 head and neck organ sites of the phantom head. The following devices were tested: Gendex Export OC, Sirona Orthophos XG, Carestream Kodak 9000 3D, i-CAT Platinum, and Instrumentarium Orthopantomograph OP300 Maxio. For all scans, the preset pediatric scan settings representing those used typically for orthodontic imaging were used and when available, the field of view selected was to image the anterior maxilla, capturing the maxillary canines and its neighboring teeth (incisors and first premolars). The scans were performed with and without applying lead glasses and thyroid collar shield. The effective radiation dose was calculated for the organs of the head and neck. All scans were repeated three times and the results averaged. Organ fractions irradiated were determined from ICRP-89. Overall effective doses were calculated in microSieverts for the averaged results and based on the ICRP-103 tissue weighting factors. Overall measured organ doses and the effective doses were higher for the CBCT scans than for the digital intraoral periapical and panoramic radiographs. The effective doses measured with panoramic radiographs were significantly less when compared to CBCT scans. The highest organ dose exposures were in the salivary glands, oral mucosa, and extrathoracic airway. The use of leaded glasses and thyroid collar resulted in dose reduction of 24.4–25% with the Sirona Orthophos XG, Kodak 9000 3D machine and Instrumentarium OP300 at standard resolution. This was the first study to evaluate radiation exposure to a 10-year-old juvenile CIRS phantom using OSL dot dosimetry in conjunction with leaded glasses and thyroid shield, utilizing two and three dimensional imaging for orthodontic purposes. CBCT, although recognized for superior diagnostic benefits, had higher levels of radiation than conventional two-dimensional digital radiography. Following the ALARA principle, restricting the field of view to anterior maxilla can allow CBCT imaging to be used with young patients in specific and justified clinical situations when three-dimensional assessment of the presence and severity of root resorption is necessary. When such imaging is prescribed, the recommendation would be to use a narrow-field CBCT imaging machine with the proper use of radiation shielding equipment.","An, Hee Gi",0,,76
163,,"Adapted physical education (APE) is offered as a course in most physical education teacher education (PETE) programs to better prepare preservice teachers (PST) in giving instruction to students with disabilities. As a growing pedagogical approach, service-learning (SL) continues to be integrated into the APE course, as a supplement to PSTs' learning. Traditionally, SL activities focus on changing one's own actions, attitudes or beliefs rather than challenging social problems that may exist in physical education for students with disabilities (e.g., power, privilege, social equality). Preservice teachers should be given an opportunity to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to teach students with disabilities from multiple dimensions (e.g., classroom, school, society). Likewise, they should also be prepared to become active agents in creating unbiased programs for students with disabilities. Therefore, this article introduces the concept of a critical SL approach as an effective pedagogy within an introductory APE course. Specifically, it is a method that focuses on a social-justice orientation which can be utilized to empower PSTs beyond the PETE setting.","An, Jihoun",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07303084.2019.1568932,77
165,Outcomes From Two Forms of Training for First-Responder Competency in Cholinergic Crisis Management,"Military and civilian first responders must be able to recognize and effectively manage mass disaster casualties. Clinical management of injuries resulting from nerve agents provides different challenges for first responders than those of conventional weapons. We evaluated the impact of a mixed-methods training program on competency acquisition in cholinergic crisis clinical management using multimedia with either live animal or patient actor examples, and hands-on practice using SimMan3G mannequin simulators. A purposively selected sample of 204 civilian and military first responders who had not previously completed nerve agent training were assessed pre- and post-training for knowledge, performance, self-efficacy, and affective state. We conducted analysis of variance with repeated measures; statistical significance p < 0.05. Both groups had significant performance improvement across all assessment dimensions: knowledge > 20%, performance > 50%, self-efficacy > 34%, and affective state > 15%. There were no significant differences between the live animal and patient actor groups. These findings could aid in the specification of training for first-responder personnel in military and civilian service. Although less comprehensive than U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense courses, the training outcomes associated with this easily distributed program demonstrate its value in increasing the competency of first responders in recognizing and managing a mass casualty cholinergic event.","Andreatta, P.",0,10.7205/milmed-d-14-00290,78
170,,"Computer interfaces represented as embodied agents, either virtually as animated characters or physically as humanlike robots, utilize a powerful metaphor of everyday social interaction in order to communicate effectively with human users. One of the most promising features of embodied agents is their ability to embody humanlike attributes and make use of nonverbal conversational cues just as people do. Gaze is a particularly important nonverbal signal in social interactions and is utilized in several rich communication mechanisms with which people are intuitively familiar. This dissertation proposes the following thesis: humanlike gaze mechanisms can enable both virtual agents and social robots to more effectively communicate with human users in situated interaction contexts. To be fully situated, these mechanisms must be tightly linked with and responsive to the user, environment, and context in which they are deployed. Four mechanisms of social gaze are discussed. The first and most basic gaze mechanism, gaze shifts, handles the coordination of both head and eye movements to direct an agent's attention from one focal point to another. The next mechanism is gaze aversion, specifying when agents should avert their gaze away from their interlocutors and what they might accomplish by doing so. By coordinating its gaze with gaze motions tracked from a human collaborator, the agent can be become more tightly situated in the task and improve collaborative outcomes. This goal is captured in a mechanism referred to as gaze coordination. Finally, it is important to consider that a one-size-fits-all approach limits an agent's ability to account for cultural and individual differences across human users. The final mechanism presented in this dissertation, gaze adaptivity, demonstrates how the timing of an agent's gaze shifts can be manipulated in order to express extroversion or introversion, and how this personality expressed via gaze can be matched to a user's personality in order to improve motivation in a rehabilitation setting. This dissertation makes a number of design, systems, and empirical contributions to research on human-robot interaction (HRI), intelligent virtual agents (IVA), human-computer interaction (HCI), multimodal interaction, and human communication. Overall, this dissertation contributes a set of gaze models that embody humanlike gaze mechanisms situated in specific interaction contexts, systems that implement these gaze models on virtual and physical agent platforms, and a number of user studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of these models and the general importance of well-designed gaze behaviors for achieving powerful social and cognitive outcomes for human users.","Andrist, Sean",0,,79
171,Robots showing emotions Emotion Representation with no bio-inspired body,"Robots should be able to represent emotional states to interact with people as social agents. There are cases where robots cannot have bio-inspired bodies, for instance because the task to be performed requires a special shape, as in the case of home cleaners, package carriers, and many others. In these cases, emotional states have to be represented by exploiting movements of the body. In this paper, we present a set of case studies aimed at identifying specific values to convey emotion trough changes in linear and angular velocities, which might be applied on different non-anthropomorphic bodies. This work originates from some of the most considered emotion expression theories and from emotion coding for people. We show that people can recognize some emotional expressions better than others, and we propose some directions to express emotions exploiting only bio-neutral movement.","Angel-Fernandez, J.

In the first place, the presence of a continuum, during the entire first period of the dictatorship, of a high consideration for emotions and sentiments as a key component of political thought, social action and education - a characteristic that was transferred to writings on education. Secondly, pedagogical discourse highlights the role of the teacher as the main agent which transmits, teaches and employs emotions and sentiments in his practice, assuming them as part of his personal and professional identity. Finally, the nature of the emotionally hotheaded discourse is investigated from a historical perspective, looking for an explanation beyond Catholicism. The analysis of texts from educational, political and legislative contexts leads one to find traces of possible antecedents in historical periods of the exaltation, repression or inhibition, of particular emotional states according to precise ideological purposes of 'emotional indoctrination'.","Angulo, K.

A Lógica Difusa é uma delas que, influenciada pelos princípios fundamentais da lógica proposicional do raciocínio humano, está na base de alguns dos sistemas computacionais ""inteligentes"" mais usados da atualidade. A teoria da Lógica Difusa é uma ferramenta fundamental na suplantação de algumas das limitações inerentes à representação de informação incerta em sistemas computacionais. No entanto esta apresenta ainda algumas lacunas, pelo que diversos melhoramentos à teoria original têm sido introduzidos ao longo dos anos, sendo a Lógica Difusa de Tipo-2 uma das mais recentes propostas. Os novos graus de liberdade introduzidos por esta teoria têm-se demonstrado vantajosos, particularmente em aplicações de modelação de sistemas não-lineares complexos. Uma das principais vantagens prende-se com o aumento da robustez dos modelos assim desenvolvidos comparativamente àqueles baseados nos princípios da Lógica Difusa de Tipo-1 sem implicar necessariamente um aumento da sua dimensão. Tal propriedade é particularmente vantajosa considerando que muitas vezes estes modelos são utilizados como suporte ao desenvolvimento de sistemas de controlo que deverão ser capazes de assegurar o comportamento ótimo de um processo em condições de operação variáveis. No entanto, o estado-da-arte da teoria de controlo de sistemas baseada em modelos não tem integrado todos os melhoramentos proporcionados pelo desenvolvimento de modelos baseados nos princípios da Lógica Difusa de Tipo-2. Por essa razão, a presente tese propõe-se a abordar este tópico desenvolvendo uma metodologia de síntese de Controladores Preditivos baseados em modelos Takagi-Sugeno seguindo os princípios da Lógica Difusa de Tipo-2. De modo a cumprir este objetivo, quatro linhas de investigação serão debatidas neste trabalho.Primeiramente proceder-se-á ao desenvolvimento de uma metodologia de treino de Modelos Difusos de Tipo-2 simplificada, focada em dois paradigmas: manter a clareza dos intervalos de incerteza introduzidos sobre um Modelo Difuso de Tipo-1; assegurar a validade dos diversos modelos localmente lineares que constituem a estrutura Takagi- Sugeno, de modo a torná-los adequados a métodos de síntese de controladores baseados em modelos. O modelo desenvolvido é tipicamente utilizado para extrapolar o comportamento do sistema numa janela temporal futura. No entanto, quando usados em aproximações de sistemas não lineares, os modelos do tipo Takagi-Sugeno estabelecem um compromisso entre exatidão e complexidade computacional. Assim, é proposta a utilização dos princípios da Lógica Difusa de Tipo-2 para reduzir a influência dos erros de modelação nas estimações obtidas através do ajuste dos intervalos de incerteza dos parâmetros do modelo. Com base na estrutura Takagi-Sugeno, um método de linearização local de modelos não-lineares será utilizado em cada ponto de funcionamento do sistema de modo a obter os parâmetros necessários para a síntese de um controlador otimizado numa janela temporal futura de acordo com os princípios da teoria de Controlo Preditivo Generalizado - um dos algoritmos de Controlo Preditivo mais utilizado na indústria. A qualidade da resposta do sistema em malha fechada e a sua robustez a perturbações serão então comparadas com implementações do mesmo algoritmo baseadas em métodos de modelação mais simples.

175,,"Computer agents are required to make appropriate decisions quickly and efficiently. As the environments in which they act become increasingly complex, efficient decision-making becomes significantly more challenging. This thesis examines the positive ways in which human emotions influence people's ability to make good decisions in complex, uncertain contexts, and develops computational analogues of these beneficial functions, demonstrating their usefulness in agent decision-making and communication. For decision-making by a single agent in large-scale environments with stochasticity and high uncertainty, the thesis presents GRUE (Goal Re-prioritization Using Emotion), a decision-making technique that deploys emotion-inspired computational operators to dynamically re-prioritize the agent's goals. In two complex domains, GRUE is shown to result in improved agent performance over many existing techniques. Agents working in groups benefit from communicating and sharing information that would otherwise be unobservable. The thesis defines an affective signaling mechanism, inspired by the beneficial communicative functions of human emotion, that increases coordination. In two studies, agents using the mechanism are shown to make faster and more accurate inferences than agents that do not signal, resulting in improved performance. Moreover, affective signals confer performance increases equivalent to those achieved by broadcasting agents' entire private state information. Emotions are also useful signals in agents' interactions with people, influencing people's perceptions of them. A computer-human negotiation study is presented, in which virtual agents expressed emotion. Agents whose emotion expressions matched their negotiation strategy were perceived as more trustworthy, and they were more likely to be selected for future interactions. In addition, to address similar limitations in strategic environments, this thesis uses the theory of reasoning patters in complex game-theoretic settings. An algorithm is presented that speeds up equilibrium computation in certain classes of games. For Bayesian games, with and without a common prior, the thesis also discusses a novel graphical formalism that allows agents' possibly inconsistent beliefs to be succinctly represented, and for reasoning patterns to be defined in such games. Finally, the thesis presents a technique for generating advice from a game's reasoning patterns for human decision-makers, and demonstrates empirically that such advice helps people make better decisions in a complex game.","Antos, Dimitrios",0,,83
176,Teachers as frontline agents of integration: Finnish physical education students' reflections on intercultural encounters,"Background and purpose: This article focuses on how future Physical Education and Dance teachers may be better prepared to work in increasingly diverse education environments. It also discusses how tertiary institutions might address issues of social inclusion and cultural pluralism within their programmes, courses and assignments. The authors critically reflect on an experiential learning intervention in Jyvaskyla, Finland, in which trainee PE teachers facilitated kinaesthetic language-learning workshops for asylum seekers. The applied use of physical education and dance in this context was aimed at providing a distinct opportunity to consider a PE teacher's professional competence and role as an agent of integration. Methods: Adopting an interpretive approach, the authors sought to understand students' experiences, rather than to determine the causes behind, and results emerging from, the experience. Through a qualitative, open, yet structured set of questions they gathered the trainee PE teachers' reflections on their experiences related to the workshops. The data were analysed through a collaborative, interpretive process. The analysis was supported by pertinent theories on, e.g. transformative learning in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the meanings of this intercultural encounter for the trainee teachers. The authors have sought to understand how a learning intervention may function as a transformative experience, shifting professional dispositions towards social inclusion and cultural integration. Results: The interpretive process resulted in a thematic structure that contains the following four themes: (1) Preconceptions of others, (2) Questioning the relevance, (3) Positive affirmation and (4) Pedagogical practices in motion. Conclusion: This study has sought to identify the ways in which intercultural encounters may support PE teacher trainees' dispositions towards working with asylum seekers, and migrants in general. The findings suggest that not all students feel that such encounters are relevant to the role of a PE teacher. The authors conclude that courses on interculturality need to be developed for encouraging trainee teachers towards such encounters and applied uses of physical education and dance. For many students, however, the experience appeared to contribute to a process of transformation, in which they were developing professional competences that are amenable to the idea of being an agent of integration.","Anttila, E.",0,10.1080/17408989.2018.1485141,84
179,GOVERNANCE IN PRACTICES: DELIMITATION AND CONTESTATION IN ADULT EDUCATION AND TRAINING POLICY IN PORTUGAL,"This paper explores the governance of education, focusing on the terrain of practices. The analysis articulates the centrality of public authorities, such as the state. by discussing the mandate and the governance arrangement. with the approach of the policy cycle, by taking into account the ""context of practices."" In the context of the development of public adult education and training policy in Portugal in the first decade of the twenty-first century, the paper discusses the movement towards an instrumental extension of the governance circle through agency distribution by public and private, civic, cultural, charity and commercial entities. Based on the testimonies of the heads of these entities, the text discusses their appropriations and reactions concerning the meaning of the policy at hand and its relationship with the state, along with the terms for contracting educational services, as well as the mandate and scope of educational activities. On the one hand, empirical data suggest that concerns regarding governability support the subordination of the agents contracted and nurture the state's evasion from its commitments to the population's rights and demands; on the other hand, several testimonies evoke contestation and interstitial practices that try to enlarge the scope of the community's embeddedness in socio-educational and pedagogical interventions.","Antunes, F.",0,10.17159/1947-9417/2017/1399,85

A Computational Ecosystem is a system of agents designed to emulate, in the computer, biological systems where autonomous individuals are organized in a hierarchical food chain and interact by trading units of energy. This thesis maps out this field and examines the modes of production and functions of these systems. The central claim is focused on how the narratives normally associated with these systems and their functioning are two complementary, but separate entities. By virtue of considering these separately the computational ecosystem is argued to be an abstract generative engine for heterogeneity, spontaneity, and even novelty. It is contended that the set of methods of production developed by exploratory artists using these artefacts might be instrumentalized as generative methods for the animation of general purpose non-player characters in virtual worlds.","Antunes, Rui Filipe",0,,86

These are virtual worlds running on computers, composed of agents that trade units of energy and emulate cycles of life and behaviors adapted from biological life forms. In this article we propose a conceptual framework in order to understand these systems, which are involved in processes of authorship and interpretation that this investigation analyzes in order to identify critical instruments for artistic exploration. We formulate a model of narrative that we call system stories (after Mitchell Whitelaw), characterized by the dynamic network of material and conceptual processes that define these artefacts. They account for narrative constellations with multiple agencies from which meaning and messages emerge. Finally, we present three case studies to explore the potential of this model within an artistic and generative domain, arguing that this understanding expands and enriches the palette of the language of these systems.","Antunes, R.

184,,"Currently, European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are experiencing increasing pressure to provide high quality goods with customised features while at the same time remain cost effective and competitive in the global market. In the future, manufacturing systems need to be able to cope with constantly changing market requirements. Consequently, there is a need to develop the research foundations for a new generation of manufacturing systems composed of intelligent autonomous entities which are able to reconfigure themselves and to adapt their performance as a result of product and environmental changes. The research described in this thesis addresses the issue by developing three distinctive elements of an adaptation framework for next-generation manufacturing systems. The first element is a capability-based data model for the representation of manufacturing resources to enable self-awareness. The model captures the resources’ life cycle and performance indicators to provide information about the resources’ condition. The second element is a multi-agent architecture for plug and produce and the reconfiguration of manufacturing systems. The resource data model is utilised by the agent society, which is able to instantiate a model to represent a physical resource in the virtual agent society. The shift to the virtual environment enables a communication infrastructure for heterogeneous resources and the application of the digital twin concept. The agent architecture applies negotiation techniques to establish a plan for system adaptation. The third element is a methodology for automated experience-based manufacturing system adaptation. The adaptation methodology is based on previous runtime experience instances to generate adaptation knowledge. The information generated is applied to the current context and part of the agent negotiation which is dynamically executed in case of a disturbance. Collectively, these three elements significantly increase the flexibility and reconfigurability of a manufacturing system reducing the time required for integration and maintenance of complex systems on demand, improving their effectiveness. The developed framework is implemented and evaluated experimentally on a physical, industrial standard demonstrator and using a virtual simulation model. The experimental results confirm a significant step towards new solutions for the deployment of self-adaptable intelligent manufacturing systems.","Antzoulatos, Nikolas",0,,88
185,Evaluating the Engagement with Social Robots,"To interact and cooperate with humans in their daily-life activities, robots should exhibit human-like ""intelligence"". This skill will substantially emerge from the interconnection of all the algorithms used to ensure cognitive and interaction capabilities. While new robotics technologies allow us to extend such abilities, their evaluation for social interaction is still challenging. The quality of a human-robot interaction can not be reduced to the evaluation of the employed algorithms: we should integrate the engagement information that naturally arises during interaction in response to the robot's behaviors. In this paper we want to show a practical approach to evaluate the engagement aroused during interactions between humans and social robots. We will introduce a set of metrics useful in direct, face to face scenarios, based on the behaviors analysis of the human partners. We will show how such metrics are useful to assess how the robot is perceived by humans and how this perception changes according to the behaviors shown by the social robot. We discuss experimental results obtained in two human-interaction studies, with the robots Nao and iCub respectively.","Anzalone, S. M.",0,10.1007/s12369-015-0298-7,89

Starting from the concept of the otaku, a term from Japanese youth culture that describes secluded persons with a high affinity for fictional manga characters, we examine individual differences behind sex robot appeal (anime and manga fandom, interest in Japanese culture, preference for indoor activities, shyness). In an online-experiment, 261 participants read one out of three randomly assigned descriptions of future technologies (sex robot, nursing robot, genetically modified organism) and reported on their overall evaluation, eeriness, and contact/purchase intentions. Higher anime and manga fandom was associated with higher appeal for all three future technologies. For our male subsample, sex robots and GMOs stood out as shyness yielded a particularly strong relationship to contact/purchase intentions for these new technologies.","Appel, M.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00569,91
196,Affective Interaction with a Virtual Character Through an fNIRS Brain-Computer Interface,"Affective brain-computer interfaces (BCI) harness Neuroscience knowledge to develop affective interaction from first principles. In this article, we explore affective engagement with a virtual agent through Neurofeedback (NF). We report an experiment where subjects engage with a virtual agent by expressing positive attitudes towards her under a NF paradigm. We use for affective input the asymmetric activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC), which has been previously found to be related to the high-level affective-motivational dimension of approach/avoidance. The magnitude of left-asymmetric DL-PFC activity, measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and treated as a proxy for approach, is mapped onto a control mechanism for the virtual agent's facial expressions, in which action units (AUs) are activated through a neural network. We carried out an experiment with 18 subjects, which demonstrated that subjects are able to successfully engage with the virtual agent by controlling their mental disposition through NF, and that they perceived the agent's responses as realistic and consistent with their projected mental disposition. This interaction paradigm is particularly relevant in the case of affective BCI as it facilitates the volitional activation of specific areas normally not under conscious control. Overall, our contribution reconciles a model of affect derived from brain metabolic data with an ecologically valid, yet computationally controllable, virtual affective communication environment.","Aranyi, G.",0,10.3389/fncom.2016.00070,92
201,,"This study deals with teachers' perceptions of principals' leadership style as it affects parental involvement (PI) in the special context of the Arab education system in Israel. Contemporary perceptions of education within the Western individualist society, including in the majority society in Israel, regard the full spectrum of PI, ranging from supervising homework to taking part in pedagogical decision-making, as very beneficial for children's education and support it. Yet the social context of the Arab minority, which is both traditional and collectivist, may induce Arab teachers to different views. In this study we correlate the teachers' PI perceptions with the leadership style of principals at their schools. We presented two kinds of Likert-type questionnaires to a sample of 200 Arab elementary school teachers. Our findings indicate that, contrary to what was expected, Arab teachers support PI as beneficial for the children's education. When they perceive the principal as efficient, they tend to be rather reserved about pedagogical PI. If the principals are passive, teachers welcome PI. It is concluded that Arab teachers can serve as agents of change in their society toward more democratic values. There are limitations to the validity of such a conclusion for the whole population of the Arab teachers as this is their view in theory, not tested with actual behaviors.","Arar, Khalid",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/22040552.2016.1227253,93

Adopting an experimental design with actual chatbots powered with current technology, this study explores the extent to which human-like cues such as language style and name, and the framing used to introduce the chatbot to the consumer can influence perceptions about social presence as well as mindful and mindless anthropomorphism. Moreover, this study investigates the relevance of anthropomorphism and social presence to important company-related outcomes, such as attitudes, satisfaction and the emotional connection that consumers feel with the company after interacting with the chatbot.

Virtual cognitive niches can be considered as digitally-encoded collaborative distributions of diverse types of information into an environment performed by agents to aid thinking and reasoning about some target domain. Discussing this definition, we will also consider how online communities, as networks displaying a social bias, can both foster civic awareness and promote problematic group-led behaviors in the virtually aggregated crowds. To support this affirmation, we will take into account the use of online communication networks during crises and we will argue that it can lead to ethically dubious consequences.","Arfini, S.",0,10.1007/s11229-017-1482-0,95
210,An architecture of agent-based multi-layer interactive e-learning and e-testing platform,"E-learning is the synthesis of multimedia and social media platforms powered by Internet and mobile technologies. Great popularity of e-learning is encouraging governments and educational institutions to adopt and develop e-learning cultures in societies in general and universities in particular. In traditional e-learning systems, all components (agents and services) are tightly coupled into a single system. In this study, we propose a new architecture for e-learning with two subsystems, namely, e-learning and e-testing. The motivation of the research is to improve the effectiveness of the learning process by extracting relevant features for elastic learning and testing process. We employ a multi-agent system because it contains five-layer architecture, including agents at various levels. We also propose a novel method for updating content through question and answer between e-learners and intelligent agents. To achieve optimization, we design a system that applies various technologies, which guarantee various dynamic features for e-learning systems, such as intelligence, distributed nature, adaptive attitude, interaction, accessibility, and security. Agent assisted e- learning enable the users to collect the quantifiable and sensible material; examine, and distribute customized knowledge from multiple e-learning sources. Intelligent agents, being program helper or assistants, are deployed at different levels of abstraction in this architecture to manage information overload and create environment for learners. Moreover, this proposed system is designed by keeping in view several characteristics specific to e-learning system such as interaction, personalization, adaptation, intelligence, interoperability, accessibility and security. The architecture is designed to support instructional design, to retrieve relevant learning materials, to process and analyses data to enable meaningful e-learning recommendations for instructors and learners by considering all issues that existing e-learning architectures don't address. Most of the existing e-learning architectures don't consider all the features in a single system so there is a need for a generic architecture that should support all the features to make the e-learning system more efficient. The outcome of this approach is to provide flexible and lightweight systems for e-learning environments.","Arif, M.",0,10.1007/s11135-014-0121-9,96
219,,"Tubulin inhibitors are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents, and their success is attributed to their ability to target microtubule dynamics and disrupt critical cellular functions including cell signaling, motility, intracellular trafficking, and mitosis. Interference with microtubule dynamics consequently disrupts mitotic progression and ultimately leads to apoptosis, validating microtubule dynamics as an excellent target for anticancer agents. While this class of drug has proven to be effective against many cancer types, the clinical efficacy of current tubulin inhibitors is often limited by the development of multidrug resistance. The most common form of resistance to these agents arises from the overexpression of drug efflux transporters. Extensive research efforts have attempted to develop colchicine binding site inhibitors, which are reported to be significantly less susceptible to multidrug resistance and have therapeutic advantages over agents that target the taxane and vinca alkaloid site. Herein, we evaluated the anticancer activity of novel small-molecules that target the colchicine binding site, focusing on the most promising compounds from several structural scaffolds including indolyl-imidazopyridines (DJ95 and DJ101), VERU-111 analogs with a modified indole moiety (10ab and 10bb) or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl moiety (13f), and heterocyclic pyrimidines (4a, 6a, 5a, and 5b). We demonstrated the cytotoxic potency of these compounds against a variety of cancer cell lines, including malignant melanomas, taxane-resistant prostate cancer cells, and drug efflux pump-overexpressing cell lines. Their mechanism of action was revealed through tubulin polymerization inhibition, disruption of microtubule networks and mitotic spindle formation, and confirmed through X-ray crystallography, which detailed their specific molecular interactions with tubulin in the colchicine binding pocket. Furthermore, these compounds exhibited hallmark characteristics of colchicine binding site agents, such as arresting cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, inducing apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, and impeding cancer cell proliferation and migration. Finally, the compounds were efficacious in vivo against melanoma and taxane-resistant prostate cancer xenograft tumors. Several agents were evaluated for ability to prevent melanoma metastases to the lungs in experimental mouse models, and they potently inhibited the development metastatic foci. Safety assessment by pharmacological profiling demonstrated minimal interactions to physiologically important targets and pathophysiological analysis of major organs from the in vivo treatment groups did not expose apparent drug-related injury. Several of the investigated compounds also demonstrated vascular disrupting properties by targeting tumor vasculature and inhibiting capillary-like network formation of endothelial cells. Ultimately, these compounds exhibit strong anticancer efficacy, specifically target the colchicine binding site, and have great potential as cancer therapeutics, particularly for multidrug resistance phenotypes. Another target we explored for anticancer intervention was survivin. Survivin is the smallest member the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family and its overexpression in tumor cells is been positively correlated with the development of multidrug resistance and radiation resistance. Because it is differentially expressed in healthy tissues and tumors, it is an attractive therapeutic target. Using the scaffold of UC-112, which was previously identified through virtual screening, we evaluated a series of analogs designed to optimize potency and improve selectivity to survivin over other inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. We identified compound 10f, which was highly cytotoxic to melanoma and P-glycoprotein overexpressing cell lines, induced apoptotic cascades in a concentration-dependent manner, specifically downregulated survivin protein levels, and significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Ultimately, these results validated our in-depth biol","Arnst, Kinsie E.",0,,97
220,Gender differences in the use and benefit of advanced learning technologies for mathematics,"We provide evidence of persistent gender effects for students using advanced adaptive technology while learning mathematics. This technology improves each gender’s learning and affective predispositions toward mathematics, but specific features in the software help either female or male students. Gender differences were seen in the students’ style of use of the system, motivational goals, affective needs, and cognitive/affective benefits, as well as the impact of affective interventions involving pedagogical agents. We describe 4 studies, with hundreds of students in public schools over several years, which suggest that technology responses should probably be customized to each gender. This article shows differential results before, during, and after the use of adaptive tutoring software, indicating that digital tutoring systems can be an important supplement to mathematics classrooms but that male and female students should be addressed differently. Female students were more receptive than male students to seeking and accepting help provided by the tutoring system and to spending time seeing the hints; thus, they had a consistent general trend to benefit more from it, especially when affective learning companions were present. In addition, female students expressed positively valenced emotions most often and exhibited more productive behaviors when exposed to female characters; these affective pedagogical agents encouraged effort and perseverance. This was not the case for male students, who had more positive outcomes when no learning companion was present and their worst affective and cognitive outcomes when the female character was present.

We developed a mobile version of a virtual reality scenario where the participants were able to interact with virtual human characters through their psychophysiological activity. Music was played in the background of the scenario and, depending on the experimental condition, the virtual humans were initially either barely dancing or dancing very euphorically. The task of the participants was to encourage the apathetic virtual humans to dance or to calm down the frenetically dancing characters, through the modulation of their own mood and physiological activity. Results from our study show that by using this mobile game with the physiologically aware and affective virtual humans the participants were able to emotionally arouse themselves in the Activation condition and were able to relax themselves in the Relaxation condition, during the same session with only a brief break between conditions. The self-reported affective data was also corroborated by the physiological data ( heart rate, respiration and skin conductance) which significantly differed between the Activation and Relaxation conditions.","Arroyo-Palacios, J.",0,10.1109/taffc.2015.2472013,99

This study employed a 2 (no cueing vs. visual cueing)x2 (low vs. high prior knowledge) between-subjects factorial design. The results revealed a significant interaction effect between prior knowledge and cueing on learning. Low prior knowledge learners had higher scores after studying an instructional animation with visual cues, compared to those who studied the same instructional animation without visual cues. Conversely, when cues were not provided, high prior knowledge learners outperformed those high prior knowledge learners who studied with the cued version of an instructional animation. These results indicated that the effects of cueing in an instructional animation change depending on the learners' level of prior knowledge. Specifically, low prior knowledge learners benefited more when visual cues were provided, whereas cues did not facilitate learning for high prior knowledge learners.","Arslan-Ari, I.",0,10.1111/jcal.12222,100

Examination of these portrayals occurs to uncover an understanding of the ethical modeling Disney conveys to young boys as they develop their own codes of ethics. This study uncovered three categorical themes in Disney animation films produced during the corporation’s renaissance era: virtuous heroes, anthropomorphic deontologists, and supporting roles of virtue. These thematic categories provide three types of ethical modeling via social learning to young male viewers. According to the results, Disney provides children with good natured programming. This allows Disney to become a positive “teaching machine” used to shape a child’s perception of reality.","Artman, Nicholas",0,,103
255,,"The construction industry is a complex, multi-level system that includes a large collection of independent, heterogeneous organizations and institutions and is associated with several economic sectors and markets. Because of its unique characteristics, the construction industry as one of the major economic sectors and contributors to the economic development of the nation needs its own specific and dedicated economics. The shortcomings of the existing methodologies call for the use of more sophisticated modeling tools that can capture more important aspects of the real world and its complexity in particular the interconnections among elements of the system, their idiosyncrasies, and emergent behavior. As a pioneer attempt in the exploration of a new theory of construction economics, this study aims to found the first building blocks of the comprehensive economic model of the construction industry. In this dissertation, an agent-based approach is applied to model the low-bid lump-sum construction competitive bidding by which most construction works are allocated. This model has several advantages over the previous analytical and empirical models including the capability of observing the bidding process dynamics, the interaction between the heterogeneous and learning agents, and the emergent bidding patterns arising from multiple scenarios of market conditions and contractors’ attributes. Then the model is used as a virtual laboratory for conducting a variety of experiments to answer several important research questions in the field of construction economics. The main research objectives of this study are to: (1) analyze the effectiveness of major quantitative methods in the bidding environment under a variety of market conditions (2) study the effect of contractors’ risk behavior, cost estimating and project management skills, and complexity of projects on contractors’ choice of optimal markup, long-term financial growth and market share (3) investigate the impact of risk behavior and need for work on contractors’ performance. The results presented in this dissertation offer new understandings and insights on the construction bidding environment and recommendations for both owners and contractors’ competitive success, which are not available using conventional approaches. In particular, results suggest that (1) using Friedman model can result in considerably higher market share whereas using Gates model can result in higher profit per project, (2) the optimal policy for contractors is moderation in both dimensions of risk attitude and need for work, (3) the comparative performance of slightly and extremely risk averse contractors are depending on level of cost estimating accuracy and project execution skills of contractors as well as the level of project complexities.","Asgari, Sadegh",0,,104

But who are those student learners? Most studies focus on native, dominant-culture, dominant-language students serving marginalized populations. Studies of the United States, for example, primarily focus on English-speaking U.S. citizens serving either linguistically and culturally similar populations marked by economic, educational, or health vulnerabilities, or linguistically and culturally different populations to facilitate the acquisition of another language or cultural tradition, such as tutoring at a Latino community center in order to learn Spanish. Much less research has focused on English language learners as agents of service in the United States, volunteering at U.S. social service agencies in order to increase their own acquisition of the English language and U.S. culture. This study addresses that gap in the research by analyzing results of a language immersion program that aimed to develop multiple literacies in academic English through service-learning and community engagement.

259,The Social Dimension of Learning Through Argumentation: Effects of Human Presence and Discourse Style,"In spite of its potential for learning, and in particular knowledge revision, argumentation on science concepts is neither easily elicited nor easily sustained. Students may feel uneasy critiquing and being critiqued, especially on complex science topics. We report on a controlled study that tested the role of 2 potential factors that may either relieve or aggravate some of these concerns: the partner's argumentative discourse style (disputative or deliberative) and belief in interaction with a human or a computer agent. Learners interacted in scripted, computer-mediated interactions with a confederate on their understanding of a scientific concept they had just studied (i.e., diffusion). They were led to believe they were either interacting with a human peer or with a conversational peer agent. The peer confederate's verbal behavior was scripted to evoke argumentative discourse, while controlling for exposure to conceptual content and the type of dialogue moves, but differed in argumentative discourse style (disputative or deliberative). Results show that conceptual understanding of participants in the deliberative discourse style condition was higher than that in the disputative condition. Further, even though previous studies have reported that the belief in human interaction benefits learning in consensual interactions, the opposite was found to be true in a setting of disagreement and critique: Belief in interaction with a computer agent resulted in higher conceptual learning gains, compared to belief in interaction with a human peer. Implications for theory as well as instructional design are discussed.","Asterhan, C. S. C.",1,10.1037/edu0000014,106
261,Assessing the Sustainability of Small Farmer Natural Resource Management Systems. A Critical Analysis of the MESMIS Program (1995-2010),"Sustainability assessment oriented to improve current systems and practices is urgently needed, particularly in the context of small farmer natural resource management systems (NRMS). Unfortunately, social-ecological systems (SES) theory, sustainability evaluation frameworks, and assessment methods are still foreign not only to farmers but to many researchers, students, NGOs, policy makers/operators, and other interested groups. In this paper we examine the main achievements and challenges of the MESMIS Program (Spanish acronym for Indicator-based Sustainability Assessment Framework), a 15-year ongoing effort with impact in 60 case studies and 20 undergraduate and graduate programs mainly in Ibero-America that is attempting to cope with the stated challenges. The MESMIS experience shows that it is possible to conduct sustainability assessments in the context of small farmers through a long-term, participatory, interdisciplinary, and multi-institutional approach that integrates a solid theoretical background, a field-tested operational framework, learning tools specifically devised to facilitate the understanding of sustainability as a multidimensional and dynamic concept, and a growing set of case studies to apply to and get feedback from users. Specifically, through the dissemination of the MESMIS assessment framework in a large set of case studies in a contrasting set of social-ecological contexts, we have been able to: (a) characterize the NRMS, their subsystems, and their main interactions; (b) link attributes, i.e., general systemic properties, with sustainability indicators to assess critical socioeconomic and environmental aspects of the NRMS; (c) integrate indicators through multicriteria tools and to expose the multidimensional aspects of sustainability; (d) propose an initial multiscale assessment to articulate processes and actors at different spatial scales; (e) develop multimedia learning tools, i.e., Interactive-MESMIS, to help users understand dynamic concepts, trade-offs, and counter-intuitive behavior; and (f) promote participatory processes through role-playing games and agent-based simulation models. Key challenges are related to the need to conduct long-term longitudinal studies that fully capture system dynamic properties while at the same time actively involving relevant stakeholders through creative and lasting participative processes. We outline an improved assessment framework that should help move the program in this direction.","Astier, M.",0,10.5751/es-04910-170325,107
266,,"As robots move out of factory floors and into human environments, out from safe barricaded workstations to operating in close proximity with people, they will increasingly be expected to understand and coordinate with basic aspects of human behavior. If they are to become useful and productive participants in human-robot teams, they will require effective methods of modeling their human counterparts in order to better coordinate and cooperate with them. Theory of Mind (ToM) is defined as people's ability to reason about others' behavior in terms of their internal states, such as beliefs and desires. Having a ToM allows an individual to understand the observed behavior of others, based not only on directly observable perceptual features but also an understanding of underlying mental states; this understanding allows the individual to anticipate and better react to future actions. In this thesis a Mind-Theoretic Planning (MTP) system is presented which attempts to provide robots with some of the basic ToM abilities that people rely on for coordinating and interacting with others. The MTP system frames the problem of mind-theoretic reasoning as a planning problem with mixed observability. A predictive forward model of others' behavior is computed by creating a set of mental state situations (MSS), each composed of stacks of Markov Decision Process (MDP) models whose solutions provide approximations of anticipated rational actions and reactions of that agent. This forward model, in addition to a perceptual-range limiting observation function, is combined into a Partially Observable MDP (POMDP), The presented MTP approach increases computational efficiency by taking advantage of approximation methods offered by a novel POMDP solver B3RTDP as well as leveraging value functions at various levels of the MSS as heuristics for value functions at higher levels. For the purpose of creating an efficient MTP system, a novel general-purpose online POMDP solver B3RTDP was developed. This planner extends the Real-Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP) approach to solving POMDPs. By using a bounded value function representation, we are able to apply a novel approach to pruning the belief-action search graph and maintain a Convergence Frontier, a novel mechanism for taking advantage of early action convergence, which can greatly improve RTDP's search time. Lastly, an online video game was developed for the purpose of evaluating the MTP system by having people complete tasks in a virtual environment with a simulated robotic assistant. A human subject study was performed to assess both the objective behavioral differences in performance of the human-robot teams, as well as the subjective attitudinal differences in how people perceived agents with varying MTP capabilities. We demonstrate that providing agents with mind-theoretic capabilities can significantly improve the efficiency of human-robot teamwork in certain domains and suggest that it may also positively influence humans' subjective perception of their robotic teammates.

267,Wireless Brain-Robot Interface: User Perception and Performance Assessment of Spinal Cord Injury Patients,"Patients suffering from life-changing disability due to Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) increasingly benefit from assistive robotics technology. The field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has started to develop mature assistive applications for those patients. Nonetheless, noninvasive BCIs still lack accurate control of external devices along several degrees of freedom (DoFs). Unobtrusiveness, portability, and simplicity should not be sacrificed in favor of complex performance and user acceptance should be a key aim among future technological directions. In our study 10 subjects with SCI (one complete) and 10 healthy controls were recruited. In a single session they operated two anthropomorphic 8-DoF robotic arms via wireless commercial BCI, using kinesthetic motor imagery to perform 32 different upper extremity movements. Training skill and BCI control performance were analyzed with regard to demographics, neurological condition, independence, imagery capacity, psychometric evaluation, and user perception. Healthy controls, SCI subgroup with positive neurological outcome, and SCI subgroup with cervical injuries performed better in BCI control. User perception of the robot did not differ between SCI and healthy groups. SCI subgroup with negative outcome rated Anthropomorphism higher. Multi-DoF robotics control is possible by patients through commercial wireless BCI. Multiple sessions and tailored BCI algorithms are needed to improve performance.","Athanasiou, A.",0,10.1155/2017/2986423,109
274,Towards Rehabilitation Robotics: Off-the-Shelf BCI Control of Anthropomorphic Robotic Arms,"Advances in neural interfaces have demonstrated remarkable results in the direction of replacing and restoring lost sensorimotor function in human patients. Noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are popular due to considerable advantages including simplicity, safety, and low cost, while recent advances aim at improving past technological and neurophysiological limitations. Taking into account the neurophysiological alterations of disabled individuals, investigating brain connectivity features for implementation of BCI control holds special importance. Off-the-shelf BCI systems are based on fast, reproducible detection of mental activity and can be implemented in neurorobotic applications. Moreover, social Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is increasingly important in rehabilitation robotics development. In this paper, we present our progress and goals towards developing off-the-shelf BCI-controlled anthropomorphic robotic arms for assistive technologies and rehabilitation applications. We account for robotics development, BCI implementation, and qualitative assessment of HRI characteristics of the system. Furthermore, we present two illustrative experimental applications of the BCI-controlled arms, a study of motor imagery modalities on healthy individuals' BCI performance, and a pilot investigation on spinal cord injured patients' BCI control and brain connectivity. We discuss strengths and limitations of our design and propose further steps on development and neurophysiological study, including implementation of connectivity features as BCI modality.","Athanasiou, A.",0,10.1155/2017/5708937,110
283,The uncanny valley: Transformations of the body and debates about sexualization,"Themes of transformation recur in a wide range of media and more broadly in self-help and makeover culture which invites us to join in with a process of endless improvement that Meredith Jones has described as always-becoming'. The visual effects that are achieved through CGI (computer-generated imagery), Photoshop and 3D printing technologies, as well as a multitude of body modification practices can also be considered as part of a battery of techniques that are widely seen as tools of transformation. This article considers how these techniques are bound up with the interruption of ideas about how girls and women should look and behave, and, more broadly, about age-appropriate appearance and behaviour. It asks how we might consider current debates about the sexualization of culture in this broader context where self-presentation is so closely tied to representational practices and where representational regimes are being radically transformed.","Attwood, F.",0,10.1177/1367877913513683,111
284,Musical friends and foes: The social cognition of affiliation and control in improvised interactions,"A recently emerging view in music cognition holds that music is not only social and participatory in its production, but also in its perception, i.e. that music is in fact perceived as the sonic trace of social relations between a group of real or virtual agents. While this view appears compatible with a number of intriguing music cognitive phenomena, such as the links between beat entrainment and prosocial behaviour or between strong musical emotions and empathy, direct evidence is lacking that listeners are at all able to use the acoustic features of a musical interaction to infer the affiliatory or controlling nature of an underlying social intention. We created a novel experimental situation in which we asked expert music improvisers to communicate 5 types of non-musical social intentions, such as being domineering, disdainful or conciliatory, to one another solely using musical interaction. Using a combination of decoding studies, computational and psychoacoustical analyses, we show that both musically-trained and non musically-trained listeners can recognize relational intentions encoded in music, and that this social cognitive ability relies, to a sizeable extent, on the information processing of acoustic cues of temporal and harmonic coordination that are not present in any one of the musicians' channels, but emerge from the dynamics of their interaction. By manipulating these cues in two-channel audio recordings and testing their impact on the social judgements of non-musician observers, we finally establish a causal relationship between the affiliation dimension of social behaviour and musical harmonic coordination on the one hand, and between the control dimension and musical temporal coordination On the other hand. These results provide novel mechanistic insights not only into the social cognition of musical interactions, but also into that of non-verbal interactions as a whole. (C) 2017 The Authors.

286,Development and validation of a virtual agent to screen tobacco and alcohol use disorders,"Background: Substance use disorders are under-detected and not systematically diagnosed or screened for by primary care. In this study, we present the acceptability and validity of an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) designed to screen tobacco and alcohol use disorder, in individuals who did not seek medical help for these disorders. Methods: Individuals were included from June 2016 to May 2017 in the Outpatient Sleep Clinic of the University Hospital of Bordeaux. DSM-5 diagnoses of tobacco and alcohol use disorders were assessed by human interviewers. The ECA interview integrated items from the Cigarette Dependence Scale-5 (CDS-5) for tobacco use disorder screening, and the ""Cut Down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener"" (CAGE) questionnaire for alcohol use disorder screening. Paper version of CDS-5 and CAGE questionnaires and acceptability questionnaire was also self-administered. Results: Of the 139 participants in the study (mean age 43.0 [SD = 13.7] years), 71 were women, and 68 were men. The ECA was well accepted by the patients. Paper self-administered CDS-5 and CAGE scores had a strong agreement with the ECA (p < 0.0001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis of the ECA interview showed AUC of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-1.0) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69-0.98) for CDS-5 and CAGE respectively with p-value < 0.0001. Conclusions: This ECA was acceptable and valid to screen tobacco or alcohol use disorder among patients not requesting treatment for addiction. The ECA could be used in hospitals and potentially in primary care settings to help clinicians to better screen their patients for alcohol and tobacco use disorders.","Auriacombe, M.",0,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.08.025,113
296,,"This qualitative study aimed to reveal patterns of empowerment among ICT (Information and Communication Technology) coordinators during ICT reform implementation in schools, and to examine if and how a sense of empowerment is expressed in their roles as teachers and as agents of change. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 ICT coordinators from elementary schools, who were asked to describe the ICT role and its affects upon them. Findings indicate that participants felt empowerment in three areas: (1) personal; (2) subject area; and (3) leadership. All participants felt personally empowered by their new role. This was expressed in a sense of self-efficacy, a sense of responsibility, intrinsic motivation to act, and the ability to lead change and overcome resistance. Some also felt subject area empowerment, which expressed as a desire to learn more about ICT, pedagogical-technical knowledge, and improving the quality of their own ICT teaching. Others experienced leadership empowerment, which manifested as being able to instruct staff members, expand their own areas of authority and achieve hierarchical job advancement. Those 10 participants who experienced (1) and (2) saw their future career advancement as becoming better ICT teachers, whereas those 14 participants who experienced (1) and (3) perceived their ICT coordinator role as a lever to achieve leadership positions, not necessarily within education. All the ICT coordinators reported that the ICT coordinator position positively affected the way they undertook their other teaching roles. The study indicates that synergy results from holding a dual role as teacher and ICT coordinator.

298,Toward Perceiving Robots as Humans: Three Handshake Models Face the Turing-Like Handshake Test,"In the Turing test a computer model is deemed to ""think intelligently"" if it can generate answers that are indistinguishable from those of a human. We developed an analogous Turing-like handshake test to determine if a machine can produce similarly indistinguishable movements. The test is administered through a telerobotic system in which an interrogator holds a robotic stylus and interacts with another party-artificial or human with varying levels of noise. The interrogator is asked which party seems to be more human. Here, we compare the human-likeness levels of three different models for handshake: 1) Tit-for-Tat model, 2) lambda model, and 3) Machine Learning model. The Tit-for-Tat and the Machine Learning models generated handshakes that were perceived as the most human-like among the three models that were tested. Combining the best aspects of each of the three models into a single robotic handshake algorithm might allow us to advance our understanding of the way the nervous system controls sensorimotor interactions and further improve the human-likeness of robotic handshakes.","Avraham, G.",0,10.1109/toh.2012.16,115
305,Scaffolding Executive Function Capabilities via Play-&-Learn Software for Preschoolers,"Educational software in the form of games or so called ""computer assisted intervention"" for young children has become increasingly common receiving a growing interest and support. Currently there are, for instance, more than 1,000 iPad apps tagged for preschool. Thus, it has become increasingly important to empirically investigate whether these kinds of software actually provide educational benefits for such young children. The study presented in the present article investigated whether preschoolers have the cognitive capabilities necessary to benefit from a teachable-agent-based game of which pedagogical benefits have been shown for older children. The role of executive functions in children's attention was explored by letting 36 preschoolers (3;9-6;3 years) play a teachable-agent-based educational game and measure their capabilities to maintain focus on pedagogically relevant screen events in the presence of competing visual stimuli. Even though the participants did not succeed very well in an inhibition pretest, results showed that they nonetheless managed to inhibit distractions during game-play. It is suggested that the game context acts as a motivator that scaffolds more mature cognitive capabilities in young children than they exhibit during a noncontextual standardized test. The results further indicate gender differences in the development of these capabilities.","Axelsson, A.",0,10.1037/edu0000099,116
308,,"This paper describes an embodied conversational agent enhanced with specific conversational strategies aiming to foster learners' readiness towards communication in a second language (L2). Willingness to communicate (WTC) in a second language is believed to have a direct and sustained influence on learners' actual usage frequency of the target language. To help overcome the lack of suitable environments for increasing L2 learners' WTC, our approach is to build embodied conversational agents that can help learners surmount their apprehension towards communication in L2. Here, we focus on the dialogue management aspects of our approach and propose a model based on a set of communication strategies (CS) and affective backchannels (AB) to foster such agents' ability to carry on natural and WTC-friendly conversations with learners. We examined learners' expected WTC after interacting with one of the following versions of the system: an agent featuring both CS and AB; an agent featuring only CS; and an agent featuring only AB. The results suggested that combining CS and AB empowers the conversational agent and leads to higher expected WTC among L2 learners. We also found that even the AB-only version of the system had the potential to enhance WTC to some extent. These findings are evidence of the feasibility of enhancing L2 learners' engagement towards communication using a computer-based environment coupled with appropriate conversational strategies.","Ayedoun, Emmanuel",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-018-0171-6,117

Critically, our study shows for the first time that users can experience haptic sensations from a nonanthropomorphic embodied limb/agent with visual feedback alone (i.e. no haptic feedback provided).

315,Efficient bidding strategies for Cliff-Edge problems,"In this paper, we propose an efficient agent for competing in Cliff-Edge (CE) and simultaneous Cliff-Edge (SCE) situations. In CE interactions, which include common interactions such as sealed-bid auctions, dynamic pricing and the ultimatum game (UG), the probability of success decreases monotonically as the reward for success increases. This trade-off exists also in SCE interactions, which include simultaneous auctions and various multi-player ultimatum games, where the agent has to decide about more than one offer or bid simultaneously. Our agent competes repeatedly in one-shot interactions, each time against different human opponents. The agent learns the general pattern of the population's behavior, and its performance is evaluated based on all of the interactions in which it participates. We propose a generic approach which may help the agent compete against unknown opponents in different environments where CE and SCE interactions exist, where the agent has a relatively large number of alternatives and where its achievements in the first several dozen interactions are important. The underlying mechanism we propose for CE interactions is a new meta-algorithm, deviated virtual learning (DVL), which extends existing methods to efficiently cope with environments comprising a large number of alternative decisions at each decision point. Another competitive approach is the Bayesian approach, which learns the opponents' statistical distribution, given prior knowledge about the type of distribution. For the SCE, we propose the simultaneous deviated virtual reinforcement learning algorithm (SDVRL), the segmentation meta-algorithm as a method for extending different basic algorithms, and a heuristic called fixed success probabilities (FSP). Experiments comparing the performance of the proposed algorithms with algorithms taken from the literature, as well as other intuitive meta-algorithms, reveal superiority of the proposed algorithms in average payoff and stability as well as in accuracy in converging to the optimal action, both in CE and SCE problems.","Azoulay, R.",0,10.1007/s10458-013-9227-z,119

Drawing from constructivist theory, I first present ethnically diverse young people as ""experts of their own lives"" and as active agents in their self-expression of their embodiments. I then demonstrate how young people's visual narratives created alternative visions to media-driven body ideals, and to current schooling practices of body control and regulation. Last, I consider the benefits and limitations of organizing a photo exhibition as a pedagogical means to disseminate research findings to a larger audience, beyond the ""academic monopoly,"" for social change.","Azzarito, L.",0,10.1123/jtpe.2014-0189,120

The occurrence of beliefs of the dead rising from graves and returning to harm the living across many cultures indicates that this concept has features that make it successful in the process of cultural transmission. Comparing ghost- and vampire-like beliefs, it is argued that bodiless agents and animated but dead bodies represent two divergent cognitive attractors concerning concepts of dead humans. The inferential potential of the classic idea of a bodiless ghost is based on intuitions produced by the mental system of Theory of Mind, while the traditional concepts of a vampire attribute to the dead only minimal intentionality. The inferential potential of a vampire is based on the system of disease avoidance and the emotion of disgust related to the dead body. Vampirism beliefs represent a cognitively attractive combination of a hazard and relevant actions to eliminate it: they postulate a threat of an animated corpse and relevant behavioral reaction, namely fatal interventions on vampire’s body.

322,,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), infects an estimated one third of the global population and killed approximately 1.3 million people in 2017. The global health threat posed by TB requires a better understanding of the pathogen. In this study I present the characterization of a mycobacterial lipid transport protein LprG towards a general model for outer membrane lipid transport and validation as a potential drug target. Additionally, I report the further development and application of a compartment-specific protein labeling method to identify the localization of LprG and periplasmic proteins in general. Mtb lacking the operon rv1411-1410, which encodes LprG and Rv1410c, has dramatically attenuated growth and survival in mice. While its importance for host-pathogen interactions has been the subject of numerous studies, the physiological functions of LprG are not well characterized. I report a variety of methods to investigate the molecular mechanism of LprG function. We successfully utilized a vesicle-based in vitro assay to show that LprG can transfer triacylglyceride between bilayer membranes. Using an LprG-dependent growth defect phenotype, I also show that LprG post-translational processing and ability to bind lipids are required in the cellular context. Given the importance of LprG in Mtb virulence and physiological functions, we hypothesized that this lipid transport protein is a potential pharmacological target. To explore potential inhibitors of LprG, I conducted a computational virtual screening of ~300,000 compounds to identify lead compounds. The binding affinities for top hit compounds are determined and the antimicrobial activity and target specificity of the highest-affinity compounds are characterized. We successfully confirmed one compound that inhibited mycobacterial growth in an LprG-dependent manner. Inspired by the outer membrane lipid transport pathways of Gram-negative bacteria, we predicted that other periplasmic proteins are required in the LprG-dependent lipid transport pathway. Unfortunately, no mycobacterial proteins with homology to Gram-negative bacteria outer membrane-transport proteins offer obvious candidates for these additional components. Further, identifying additional components of the LprG pathway will also require localizing them to the cell wall or periplasm, but currently available methods have critical limitations that limit their accuracy. Given the present challenges in validating periplasmic proteins, I successfully improve peroxidase-mediated biotinylation for compartment-specific protein labeling and applied this method to identify the localization of LprG and its potential interacting proteins as additional players in lipid transport.","Bai, Lu",0,,123
323,,"As teachers are being viewed as critical agents of educational change, conceptions and approaches of how to prepare teachers are changing. Among these changing conceptions of teacher preparation, the kinds of knowledge prospective teachers need to develop so as to be effective at teaching are often at the center of the debates. Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is considered a crucial part of the knowledge base for teaching and was anticipated to have the greatest impact on teachers' classroom actions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which science methods courses help prospective teachers to develop PCK. A content analysis method was used. Course modules and assessment tools were the sources of data for this study. The objectives and the subtitles of the sections of modules and items of course assignments and final exams were analyzed. The observations were coded against the 3 knowledge bases of teaching. The observations that were coded as PCK were further coded in terms of the 5 components of PCK along with important descriptors that were later used for analysis. The results of this study showed that the courses did not adequately foster preservice teachers' PCK. Despite an awareness of the purposes of the courses that was evident in the formulation of objectives and the preliminary notes in the introductory parts of the course modules, the elements of the courses as a whole were very far from helping preservice teachers develop PCK for teaching secondary school science subjects. Moreover, of those elements of the courses that were identified as fostering PCK, the knowledge of instructional strategies component was given due emphasis and the knowledge of assessment in science component was seldom addressed. The findings imply a need to rethink ways of preparing curriculum materials in light of PCK and also rethink the pathways of becoming a teacher educator.","Bailie, Addisu Leyew",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1046560X.2017.1394773,124

326,"Democracy and discipline: Object lessons and the stereoscope in American education, 1870-1920","This article explores the use of the stereoscope as a pedagogical medium in the United States from the 1870s to the 1920s as an extension of object teaching, and as a device that asserted a particular visual paradigm on student users. Due to aggressive marketing strategies by firms like Underwood & Underwood and the Keystone View Company, the stereoscope experienced a resurgence of popularity near the end of the nineteenth century, particularly finding application in American schools. This was, in part, because the three-dimensional images that stereographs simulated could be used in the popular nineteenth-century pedagogical method of the object lesson. Analysis of the marketing and pedagogical materials that surrounded the stereograph in the classroom demonstrates the fidelities that its use bore to the methods and objectives of object teaching, and reveals educators' and social scientists' efforts to endorse the stereographic image's properties as realistic to legitimize its work in education. These efforts suggest an ambivalence toward the educational use of a visual medium previously associated primarily with entertainment, and lay bare prevailing attitudes toward work and play in nineteenth-century educational thought. The stereoscope thus extended the reaches of the object lesson, and balanced amusement and instruction. While deployed in order to provide students with more direct sensory impressions, however, the stereoscope functioned as a disciplinary agent, providing highly structured and mediated encounters with the visual world. In this respect, it became a disciplinary tool capable of shaping children's visual habits and structuring their fields of vision.","Bak, M. A.",0,10.1080/17460654.2012.664746,126
327,,"Focusing on issues of embodiment and power in technical communication specifically through visual discourses of health and medicine created through data, the research is an introduction to an original methodology called pragmatic feminist empiricism. Pragmatic feminist empiricism urges technical communicators to acknowledge their own embodiments to inform the creation, reflection, and transformation of medical discourse; value differences in the embodiments that are both represented and served by medicine; and consider the multiple aims inquiry may serve and their impact in both private and public spheres. Pragmatic feminist empiricism draws upon Miller’s notion of the social construction of knowledge as well as Hayles’s concept of skeuomorphic design in creating more inclusive definitions of health and disease. The research centers on tropes in medical rhetoric that lean toward creating standardized visual representations of bodies to represent norms and their dangers to public health, as well as the effect of medical discourse on embodiment of health and disease that are represented in medical models. Case studies of the Visible Human Project® and several anatomy textbooks use pragmatic feminist empiricism to identify exigencies in visual medical technical communications and to reimagine how images may be designed to create more inclusive definitions of health and disease.

332,Artificial faces are harder to remember,"Observers interact with artificial faces in a range of different settings and in many cases must remember and identify computer-generated faces. In general, however, most adults have heavily biased experience favoring real faces over synthetic faces. It is well known that face recognition abilities are affected by experience such that faces belonging to ""out-groups"" defined by race or age are more poorly remembered and harder to discriminate from one another than faces belonging to the ""in-group"". Here, we examine the extent to which artificial faces form an ""out-group"" in this sense when other perceptual categories are matched. We rendered synthetic faces using photographs of real human faces and compared performance in a memory task and a discrimination task across real and artificial versions of the same faces. We found that real faces were easier to remember, but only slightly more discriminable than artificial faces. Artificial faces were also equally susceptible to the well-known face inversion effect, suggesting that while these patterns are still processed by the human visual system in a face-like manner, artificial appearance does compromise the efficiency of face processing.

334,Face animacy is not all in the eyes: Evidence from contrast chimeras,"Observers are capable of distinguishing real faces from artificial faces of various types (eg dolls, computer-generated faces) relatively easily. While a number of diagnostic cues are potentially available to observers to accomplish this task, the appearance of the eyes has been shown to be critically important. However, eye appearance appears to interact with other cues, like the appearance of the skin, in some settings. The 'uncanny' appearance of some artificial faces appears to result from multiple visual features and their departure from typical face norms, for example, and recent results investigating how real and artificial features are perceived in chimeric faces also suggest that observers use multiple cues to measure face animacy. Presently, we examined the cues that support real artificial face discrimination by using contrast negation and so-called 'contrast chimeras' to selectively disrupt the appearance of the eyes and the remainder of the face pattern. First, we demonstrate that, like other aspects of face perception, perceived animacy is significantly impacted by contrast negation. Second, by selectively manipulating the contrast of the eyes relative to the rest of the face, we demonstrate that these face regions are of approximately equal use to observers for animacy discrimination.","Balas, B.",0,10.1068/p7696,130
336,,"In games, training environments, and other virtual simulations, non-player characters (virtual agents) perform actions to interact with the 3-D graphical objects surrounding them to accomplish specified goals. These interactions and other components of a virtual agents behavior are generally created by hand by a simulation author. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and planning systems then utilize these created actions to allow virtual agents to reason over their abilities considering their environment. However, any behavior or interaction the simulation author wishes to have the virtual agent perform must be created beforehand. When using actions that have several components, the creation process is tedious, time consuming and possibly combinatoric. This is especially true when faced with many objects and actions, when multiple objects can be used for an action. While this burden is decreased to some extent with the use of hierarchies where information can be generalized, the total number of possible connections still explodes as the number of actions and objects in a simulation grow. It is also important for an AI system to have a consistent representation of the meaning of each action. Also, a simulation author hand-crafting actions can lead to inconsistencies between actions, such as having actions that can never be completed or should, but do not, connect actions to all usable objects. To address this issue, we show how to automate the processes for describing, organizing, and generating the meaning (semantics) of actions. Specifically, we formalized and refined the Parameterized Action Representation (PAR) to better exploit its capabilities to enable the automated generation of actions in this language. PAR is unique in that it allows for intelligent organization of virtual agent actions through the use of action taxonomies. From this, we have formulated algorithms and measures to quantify the utility of action organization strategies based on their end application. Furthermore, we developed and evaluated novel methods to automate the population of action taxonomies from base action names through use of existing lexical databases. Our work culminates in a transformative pipeline to automate connections between virtual agent actions and 3-D graphical models as well as the population of action semantics. By defining and refining PAR, as well as automating populating the connections made between virtual agent actions and 3-D graphical models, action sets can be transferred between different virtual environments and ease the simulation authors burden.","Balint, J.

337,,"This study sought to reveal factors that affect human trust with virtual agents. A virtual agent designed at Institute of Creative Technologies for psychotherapy was used. Issues such as gender differences, bias, and ethnicity perception of trust with the virtual agents were studied. Eigenvalues were used to determine the number of factors for measuring trust in virtual-human systems. Principle Component Analysis revealed the following: Affectivity showed some correlation with emotional sense of relief, emotional sense of joy, sense of reputation, and reliability; (b) The user's emotional state was revealed by frustration, anger, and perception of depression with the virtual agents. There was dissatisfaction in perception of behavior of the virtual human; this led to the human users to show negative dependability with the virtual agents; (c) The reliability of virtual human therapists correlated with some known trust factors such as perception of reputation and dependability. Reliability was negatively correlated with the user's sense of comfort. Collectively, human bias is negatively correlated with judging virtual human therapists and competence. The attitude toward blacks scale was not significantly different from the attitude toward white scale. Similarly, the Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire revealed no significant interaction effect between immersive tendencies and gender.","Balogun, Oluyomi",0,,132
338,Elements of ancient power in the Cahokian world,"Power in ancient eastern North America cannot be segregated a priori into political, social, and religious dimensions. Rather, it was a commonly dispersed attribute of human/non-human social fields that might be transferred, gathered, embodied, or emplaced. Thus, political power was realized, at least in part, through socio-religious practices involving ancestors, elements, and otherworldly forces. Deconstructing the dichotomy of religion and politics, we focus on practices of material manipulation, burning, and burial at and around the eleventh- and twelfth-century complex of Cahokia along the Mississippi River. Specifically, we detail a number of contexts where temple buildings, human remains, and objects were transubstantiated, especially through burning, and hence their power transformed. Persons were constructed, places of power were built, political agents were defined, and enemies were eliminated through fire and earth.","Baltus, M. R.",0,10.1177/1469605311433369,133
340,The Teacher - A Reflective Researcher of the Teaching Practice,"The needs of modern society set before teachers some new requirements with regard to the teacher's changed role. Teachers are ceasing to be agents transferring knowledge and are becoming persons who diagnose and organize the research process. As a starting point in the discussion, we have analyzed the correlation between the methodological training of teachers in the model of the reflective practitioner and in the model of educating the teacher researcher. Likewise, the paper has analyzed teachers' positions on knowledge, skills and potentials needed for the study and promotion of educational practice, viewed against: the length of professional service, the knowledge and use of a foreign language, the school environment, the length of undergraduate study and the grade point average during this study. The goal of the research is to initiate practical changes which would bring about expected results in terms of promoting educational practice. The research pooled 390 Serbian primary school teachers. The results have shown that knowledge of the methodology of pedagogical research (construction and use of instruments, project and research implementation) is perceived as most indispensable for the promotion of educational practice (p<0.001).","Bandjur, V.",0,,134
342,,"Socrates articulated it best, ""Speak, so I may see you."" Indeed, language represents an invisible probe into the mind. It is the medium through which we express our deepest thoughts, our aspirations, our views, our feelings, our inner reality. From the beginning of artificial intelligence, researchers have sought to impart human like understanding to machines. As much of our language represents a form of self expression, capturing thoughts, beliefs, evaluations, opinions, and emotions which are not available for scrutiny by an outside observer, in the field of natural language, research involving these aspects has crystallized under the name of subjectivity and sentiment analysis. While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification further divides subjective text into either positive, negative or neutral. In this thesis, I investigate techniques of generating tools and resources for subjectivity analysis that do not rely on an existing natural language processing infrastructure in a given language. This constraint is motivated by the fact that the vast majority of human languages are scarce from an electronic point of view: they lack basic tools such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers, or basic resources such as electronic text, annotated corpora or lexica. This severely limits the implementation of techniques on par with those developed for English, and by applying methods that are lighter in the usage of text processing infrastructure, we are able to conduct multilingual subjectivity research in these languages as well. Since my aim is also to minimize the amount of manual work required to develop lexica or corpora in these languages, the techniques proposed employ a lever approach, where English often acts as the donor language (the fulcrum in a lever) and allows through a relatively minimal amount of effort to establish preliminary subjectivity research in a target language.","Banea, Carmen",0,,135
343,Data-Structures for Multisensory Information Processing in an Embodied Machine-Mind,"The real-world is a medley of multisensory information and so are our experiences, memories, and responses. As embodied beings, we respond to the information endogenously and in ways derived from self-defining factors. Thus inspired, we attempt formalization of data-structures to facilitate generation of system-bespoke comprehension-granules of the real-world. The conceptualized structures encapsulate multisensory inputs (sourced from the real-world or memories), intrinsic and deliberate emotions, messages (bearing intermittent process-results, queries, multimodal data, etc.) across system modules and memory units, and sensorimotor responses to the inputs. The structural-schematics are anthropomorphic. These variable-length constructs are theoretically platform-independent, support genericity across data-modality and information-inclusion, and provide for representation of novel sensory-data. An epigenome-styled header node for the afferent data-units provides for the activation of intuitive ""fight-flight"" behavior. The documentation includes a flow-graph, depicting the translation of information across the data-structures and the different ways of thinking while interpreting a real-world scene or a mind-generated event. Applicability of the structures has been analyzed in the context of comprehension in an embodied mind-machine framework and other similar architectures.

To facilitate such scholarship, the notion of perceived moral agency (PMA) is proposed and defined, and a metric developed and validated through two studies: (1) a large-scale online survey featuring potential scale items and concurrent validation metrics for both machine and human targets, and (2) a scale validation study with robots presented as variably agentic and moral.

346,Improving Learning in Business Simulations with an Agent-Based Approach,"Artificial society simulations may provide unprecedented insight into the intricate dynamics of economic markets. Such an insight may help solve the well-known black-box dilemma of business simulations, where designers prefer model concealment over model transparency. The core contribution of this work is an agent-based business simulation that models the marketplace as an artificial society of consumers. In the simulation, users assume the role of a store owner playing against an artificial intelligence competitor. The simulation can be accessed via a graphical user interface that animates the decision behavior of consumers. Consumers are modeled as agents with concrete beliefs, intentions and desires that act to maximize their utility and accomplish their purchase plans. We claim that unlike the classical equation-based approach, the visualization of market dynamics facilitated by our agent-based approach can provide important information to the user. We hypothesize that such information is key to understanding several economic concepts. To validate our hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with 30 users, where we compared the effects of the graphical animation of the market. Our results indicate that the agent-based approach has better learning outcomes both at the level of users' subjective self-assessment and at the level of objective performance metrics and knowledge acquisition tests. As a secondary contribution, we demonstrate by example how simple codification rules at the level of the utility functions of agents allow the emergence of diverse macroeconomic behavior of a two-product duopoly.","Baptista, M.",0,10.18564/jasss.2516,138
351,An experimental study of large mammal bone modification by crocodiles and its bearing on the interpretation of crocodile predation at FLK Zinj and FLK NN3,"The taphonomic signature of crocodiles as agents of bone modification has been previously identified by specific tooth mark types (e.g., bisected pits) and by a conspicuous presence of these marks: more than 75% of bones modified by crocodiles bear at least one of these distinctive marks. Therefore, crocodile tooth-marking would be notably prevalent in bone assemblages resulting from crocodile predation and active scavenging. The present study contributes to refine this diagnosis by showing greater variability of these types of marks, a different degree of tooth-marking intensity, and a somewhat different distribution of tooth-marked elements according to skeletal parts from previous experiments with crocodiles. Some of these differences are due to different experimental variables and conditions and this highlights the need to understand behavioral variability in crocodile ecological settings. This variability in crocodile tooth-marking probably results from several as-yet-inadequately measured behavioral and ecological factors, such as intensity of feeding competition and differences between male and female crocodile feeding behaviors, among others. Furthermore, this study also contributes to a better definition of the microscopic criteria that can be used to distinguish crocodile-inflicted marks from other types of bone surface modifications. In light of these and previous experimental frameworks, we reevaluate the application of these analogs to modifications documented in hominin fossils from Olduvai Gorge (OH8 and OH35) and the resulting inferences about the hazard posed by crocodiles on the paleolandscape where FLK North North and FLK Zinj (Bed I) were formed. The taphonomic analysis also shows that Olduvai OH8 and OH35 were probably not preyed upon by crocodiles. It is concluded that no tangible evidence can be used to support the interpretation that OH35 was modified by crocodiles and that the overall presence of crocodiles in FLK North North and FLK Zinj was rather marginal, based on the virtual absence of crocodile-modified bones in both archaeofaunal assemblages.

This condition amplifies the general view of children as incompetent in producing and acting knowledge. This paper analyses video-recorded interactions in kindergartens in Reggio Emilia (Italy), involving migrant children, teachers and Italian children. These schools are famous worldwide for their methodology, based on treating children as competent agents. I focus on the participants’ actions constructing conversational sequences and the systems that these interactional sequences construct. The analysis highlights that migrant children are given recognition as competent agents, and that their status and authority is promoted in producing and acting knowledge. Recognition and promotion of migrant children’s agency, status and authority are based on forms of facilitation, coordination and negotiation, enhanced by initiatives taken by teachers and Italian children. These initiatives give particular relevance to: a. migrant children’s personal expressions and display of competent agency, and b. their linguistic and cultural difficulties. Initiatives combining these two aspects promote the social construction of a form of hybrid identity, both personal and cultural, which is constructed and appraised in the interaction.

355,A model supported interactive virtual environment for natural resource sharing in environmental education,"This paper introduces a realistic 3D model supported virtual environment for environmental education, that highlights the importance of water resource sharing by focusing on the tragedy of the commons dilemma. The proposed virtual environment entails simulations that are controlled by a multi-agent simulation model of a real ecosystem consisting of a lake that is being drained by a community of farmers with different types of behaviours. This resembles real-life scenarios, where farmers operate under extreme economic pressure. The virtual environment provides realistic visualization of the elements of the multi-agent model in a comprehensible manner, while keeping the details and the complexity of the ecosystem hidden from the students. Extensive experiments were conducted using students divided in a control group, exposed to conventional teaching means, and an experimental group that used the proposed virtual environment. Both groups were administered questionnaires at pre-test and post-test intervals, and conclusions were drawn after qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results. It was revealed that the proposed virtual environment provided significant cognitive advancements for the students, especially for complex inter-related notions, thus constituting a valuable tool for environment education.

The co-design process was founded on an inquiry-based and technology-enhanced model that takes shape in a set of design principles. The research had two main objectives. Firstly, to identify the moments of change that occur during the co-design process and secondly, to describe the causes and agents that motivate them. This study applied design-based research methodology and used a qualitative approach to collect, analyse, and interpret data. The results show that the co-design methodology led to moderate changes consisting of the progressive construction and refinement of the activities, seeking a sense of continuum throughout by including students' collaboration. The findings also reveal the main role of each of the actors involved. Thus, the teacher focused on basic instructional design related aspects while students focused on improving the use of resources and learning aids. Researchers helped them to embody and achieve the proposed changes and also acted as mediators of pedagogical concepts and vocabulary. CompendiumLD software was a helpful tool to graphically represent and share the prototyping of the activities and to help analyse the design process.","Barbera, E.",0,,142
362,Gravity-dependent change in the 'light-from-above' prior,"In environments where orientation is ambiguous, the visual system uses prior knowledge about lighting coming from above to recognize objects, determine which way is up, and reorient the body. Here we investigated the extent with which assumed light from above preferences are affected by body orientation and the orientation of the retina relative to gravity. We tested the ability to extract shape-from-shading with seven human male observers positioned in multiple orientations relative to gravity using a modified KUKA anthropomorphic robot arm. Observers made convex-concave judgments of a central monocularly viewed stimulus with orientations of a shading gradient consistent with being lit from one of 24 simulated illumination directions. By positioning observers in different roll-tilt orientations relative to gravity and when supine, we were able to monitor change in the light-from-above prior (the orientation at which a shaded disk appears maximally convex). The results confirm previous findings that the light-from-above prior changes with body orientation relative to gravity. Interestingly, the results varied also with retinal orientation as well as an additional component that was approximately twice the frequency of retinal orientation. We use a modelling approach to show that the data are well predicted by summing retinal orientation with cross-multiplied utricle and saccule signals of the vestibular system, yielding gravity-dependent biases in the ability to extract shape-from-shading. We conclude that priors such as light coming from above appear to be constantly updated by neural processes that monitor self-orientation to achieve optimal object recognition over moderate deviations from upright posture at the cost of poor recognition when extremely tilted relative to gravity.","Barnett-Cowan, M.",0,10.1038/s41598-018-33625-2,143
365,"Why Brains Are Not Computers, Why Behaviorism Is Not Satanism, and Why Dolphins Are Not Aquatic Apes","Modern psychology has, to all intents and purposes, become synonymous with cognitive psychology, with an emphasis on the idea that the brain is a form of computer, whose job is to take in sensory input, process information, and produce motor output. This places the brain at a remove from both the body and environment and denies the intimate connection that exists between them. As a result, a great injustice is done to both human and nonhuman animals: On the one hand, we fail to recognize the distinctive nature of nonhuman cognition, and on the other hand, we continue to promote a somewhat misleading view of human psychological capacities. Here, I suggest a more mutualistic, embodied, enactive view might allow us to ask more interesting questions about how animals of all kinds come to know their worlds, in ways that avoid the (inevitable) anthropocentric baggage of the cognitivist viewpoint.","Barrett, L.",0,10.1007/s40614-015-0047-0,144
366,Multimodal emotional state recognition using sequence-dependent deep hierarchical features,"Emotional state recognition has become an important topic for human-robot interaction in the past years. By determining emotion expressions, robots can identify important variables of human behavior and use these to communicate in a more human-like fashion and thereby extend the interaction possibilities. Human emotions are multimodal and spontaneous, which makes them hard to be recognized by robots. Each modality has its own restrictions and constraints which, together with the non-structured behavior of spontaneous expressions, create several difficulties for the approaches present in the literature, which are based on several explicit feature extraction techniques and manual modality fusion. Our model uses a hierarchical feature representation to deal with spontaneous emotions, and learns how to integrate multiple modalities for non-verbal emotion recognition, making it suitable to be used in an HRI scenario. Our experiments show that a significant improvement of recognition accuracy is achieved when we use hierarchical features and multimodal information, and our model improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art approaches from 82.5% reported in the literature to 91.3% for a benchmark dataset on spontaneous emotion expressions.

375,On-the-Job E-Learning : Workers' Attitudes and Perceptions,"The use of e-learning for on-the-job training has grown exponentially in the last decade due to it being accepted by people in charge of businesses. Few papers have explored virtual training from the workers' standpoint, that is, the perception they have about the different training methodologies (face-to-face vs. virtual) and the attitudes they have towards on-the-job learning. Training, in this context, is an investment for both the two participating agents: businesses and workers. It seems logical that knowing the perceptions and attitudes shown by the targets of the training is, at least, as important as knowing the advantages for the companies. To analyse workers' perceptions and attitudes we conducted an online survey of 2,000 employees of the leading European savings bank, CaixaBank (http://www.caixabank.com/index_en.html), on training habits, perceptions, motivations, and disincentives of undertaking face-to-face or online instruction. The results reveal that workers perceive e-learning as a more flexible and up-to-date training methodology. On the other hand, face-to-face training continues to be perceived as a more motivating methodology compared to virtuality and with better explanations from the course trainers. As regards motivations given by the workers when it comes to training, there are three main groups of attitudes: those which are more affective and social, those which reveal poor adaptability or fear of the new training requirements, and, finally, those linked to the knowledge society. Such results state that while the benefits of distance methodology can be clearly identified from the company's point of view (i.e., as a flexible and efficient methodology to develop the employees' skills and knowledge), from the employees' standpoint, the advantages of virtual training are not so clear and depend to a great extent on their attitude towards the use of virtuality.","Batalla-Busquets, J.

377,,"Educational policies are found at every level of the educational system, influencing what teachers do in their classrooms. This study examines how teachers in two middle schools, who participate in multiple communities of practice, negotiated the meaning of policies from multiple levels of the educational system and translated the policies into practice. The study explores the dilemmas teachers face during sense-making and translation of policy into practice and the cultural features that serve as affordances and constraints on this process. This dissertation follows in the ethnographic tradition, in that eight teachers (four science, four nonscience) participated in observations and interviews that also produced artifacts over an eighteen-month study. Principals, district and state level administrators, and other district teachers also participated in interviews throughout the study. Grounded theory was used to analyze the data, complemented by MacLure’s (2010) concept of “glowing data” to generate the claims about the community. This study found that teachers responded to policy in four main ways: adapt, adopt, combine, or reject (Coburn, 2005). These responses were tied to conceptual, pedagogical, and political dilemmas (Windschitl, 2002) teachers faced as they negotiated meaning in their network of communities of practice. Communities of practice both supported and limited teachers’ sensemaking. When policies and espoused practices misaligned, teachers were less productive in their policy play and more likely to reject a policy. Principals, who served as boundary agents, could also serve as an affordance if teachers had a collegial and collaborative relationship. When teachers viewed their principals’ actions as managerial or authoritative, principals became a constraint on teachers’ productive policy play. This study has implications as a framework to examine teacher learning about policy, as well as for practice in designing policies and opportunities for teachers to make sense of policies.","Bateman, Kathryn M.",0,,150
378,,"This dissertation examines the figure of the Immigrant in light of the practical and symbolic role played by the mass media, and especially television and its images, in the processes of identity construction and socialization, as problematized in several Francophone North African immigrant novels. It aims to shed light on the ways in which the figure of the Immigrant has been “mediated” in novels such as Tahar Ben Jelloun’s Les raisins de la galère, Youssouf Elalamy’s Les clandestins or Faiza Guène’s Kiffe kiffe demain. These novels fall mainly into three literary categories: Beur Literature, Banlieue literature and Illiterature (Hakim Abderrezak) which focuses on the phenomenon of clandestine migration (Hrig) in the Mediterranean basin. Products of what I call the “génération du visible,” these novels offer ground for reflection on the political, psychological, social, cultural and, ultimately, ontological effects of the media’s obsessive representations of this social category. Arguing for a new model of subjectivity for the Immigrant grounded on his relationship with the mass media, I posit that, in these novels and more generally in the collective imagination, the Immigrant—embodied by the Beur, Jeune de Banlieue or Harraga—emerges not only as a constructed figure of alterity and subalternity, but also as a Homo Mediaticus (Massimo Ragnedda) born from the interstices of images and discourses, and of the virtual and the real. I also contend that as a Homo Mediaticus, the Immigrant is both a product of media representation and a media user whose existence, subjectivity, and agency depend on his visibility (as object of the Gaze) and on the performative and meaningful act of “seeing” (as agent and user of technology). In novels like Faïza Guène’s Kiffe kiffe demain, the Immigrant's use of media technologies and of his imagination allows him to mediate his experiences in and with society, to control his “droit de regard,” and to create new identities that are more subversive and transcultural in nature than fixed or unique.","Bates, Severine Valerie",0,,151
379,,"In clinical and biomedical settings researchers often use specialized search engines to acquire answers to technical questions or to verify experimental results through the use of peer reviewed scientific literature. The outcome of such queries typically results in the reading and scanning of multiple Web pages and documents. Information retrieval is the science of retrieving relevant items; question answering (QA) is a specialized type of information retrieval with the aim of returning precise short answers to queries posed as natural language questions. In this dissertation I describe and discuss a QA system named Jikitou (www.jikitou.com), which creates a dialog with the user that mimics human interaction and utilizes multiple search agents to answer biomedical questions. Jikitou's modular design allows for easy modification and evolution of core components. An evaluation system has been devised to aid the evolution, which allows for the quick and systematic comparison among different algorithms for finding relevant answers. The system's architecture is composed of four subsystems: knowledge base, question analysis, answer agents, and user interface. Multiple software agents find possible answers to questions, and the most relevant are presented to the user. Additional relevant information is presented to the user establishing a kind of dialog with the user to obtain feedback to refine the query. Answers are automatically marked up and linked to semantically relevant content in other databases. The additional information is presented in a popup window that appears when a marked term is clicked. There is a lack of systems that allow the user to establish context, take advantage of multimedia information resources, and utilize both to return the appropriate answer. Jikitou addresses these current requirement gaps in biomedical question answering, namely by, incorporating multimedia information through the HyperGlossary and having the ability to interact with the user through query refinement. Jikitou returns answers to biological questions rather than lists of documents, which reduces the need to read entire documents. In addition to addressing current gaps, the system demonstrates an architectural framework that can continually evolve, maintaining itself as a valuable tool to researchers not only for question answering but also for other information retrieval needs.","Bauer, Michael Anton",0,,152
380,,"It is argued that social toxins present in urban environments often stunt the growth of youth living in those areas (Gabarino 1995). And because of a deficit perspective of urban youth of color, some research has tried to argue that young people coming from those upbringings both perpetuate their own demise, academically and socially, and lack the desire to change their situations (Ogbu 1978, 1991). Although this may seem to be the grim reality of young people in urban areas, similar to scholars (Solorzano and Bernal 2001; Duncan-Andrade and Morrell 2008; Cammarota and Fine, et al. 2008), I argue that low-income youth of color in urban areas actually are resilient and find ways to cope with if not transform inequitable conditions that they face on a daily-basis. In this dissertation research, I focused on the ways in which five students from a large urban high school in Los Angeles participating in the Freedom Scholars Program developed their sense of agency and advocated for themselves and their community by conducting participatory action research, a research methodology that positions young people as critical sociologists and experts of their own experiences (McIntyre 2000; Morrell 2004). I address these following questions with this research: (1) How do urban youth negotiate/mediate cultural deficit perceptions engrained in dominant society? (2) How does their participation in a youth research program shape and influence their development as active agents in their school and community? (3) How are urban youth utilizing research as a pedagogical tool to (a) resist deficit perceptions, (b) teach others of their schooling experience, and (c) actually transform inequitable social conditions? Through a mixed-method, ethnographic, participatory action research design, this project examined how these five students over the 2010–2011 school year theorized and acted upon this concept of agency. As second-year continuing participants of the Freedom Scholars Program, they utilized the space and learning opportunities in this college access program to develop critical youth participatory action research (YPAR) projects that focused on pertinent issues in their schools and surrounding community. I argue in this dissertation study that in their processes of enacting their agency, the five students moved from doing research about their schooling experience to teaching and influencing others to change their schooling conditions, which I refer to as a pedagogy of agency. In building their pedagogy, these five students developed the potentials and capabilities as legitimate experts who presented their work to members of their community, as well as decision-makers as part of their efforts to transform their existential experiences in and out of schools.","Bautista, Mark Angelo",0,,153
381,Towards the generation of dialogue acts in socio-affective ECAs: a corpus-based prosodic analysis,"We present a corpus-based prosodic analysis with the aim of uncovering the relationship between dialogue acts, personality and prosody in view to providing guidelines for the ECA Greta's text-to-speech system. The corpus used is the SEMAINE corpus, featuring four different personalities, further annotated for dialogue acts and prosodic features. In order to show the importance of the choice of dialogue act taxonomy, two different taxonomies were used, the first corresponding to Searle's taxonomy of speech acts and the second, inspired by Bunt's DIT++, including a division of directive acts into finer categories. Our results show that finer-grained distinctions are important when choosing a taxonomy. We also show with some preliminary results that the prosodic correlates of dialogue acts are not always as cited in the literature and prove more complex and variable. By studying the realisation of different directive acts, we also observe differences in the communicative strategies of the ECA depending on personality, in view to providing input to a speech system.","Bawden, R.",0,10.1007/s10579-015-9312-9,154
384,,"From visualizations to movies to video games, a camera is often an indispensable tool for structuring narratives given a set of input data. Today, an ever-increasing number of images are gathered by public, private, benevolent, and/or malicious agents, autonomous or controlled, and it is humans who must parse them in order to turn raw data into knowledge. However, the size of these datasets renders them intractable to understanding without a level of analysis and automation: either in what to capture, or in how to capture it, or in how to present/re-present it. Automation is increasingly ubiquitous, and it can work in various ways, ranging from adjusting small parameters in systems under human supervision, to human-in-the-loop systems, to so-called ""fully automated"" systems. How to best design and implement an automatic control system is extremely context-specific, especially with regard to how to integrate human decision-making and awareness into the system. This dissertation examines the process of automation of real and virtual cameras, drawing on insights from artificial intelligence, robotics, narrative theory, and interactive systems design, and presents two contributions: an analysis of automation in camera systems, and a prototype software tool for virtual camera control. Informed by the content of Edward Branigan's Projecting a Camera, the software provides a proof-of-concept for generating automated visual narratives through camera control in virtual simulations.","Bazo, Daniel",0,,155
385,,"This article discusses robot teammates for humans working in various spheres of life. A growing group of human–robot interaction researchers is developing robot teammates for humans working in a range of jobs, from manufacturing cars to exploring outer space. Rather than being remotely controlled, these robotic teammates, whether machines with robotic arms or human-like forms, are designed to collaborate with humans directly. In every hospital labor and delivery department, a resource nurse decides which patients go to which room, which nurses care for which patients, and much more. One way to foster productive interactions among humans and their robot teammates is to use the same sort of team building strategies that have proven successful in human-only teams. Good teammates also anticipate a partner’s next move. Today, for safety reasons, robots on factory floors stop whenever a human is near. In principle, robots could traverse factory floors without constantly shutting down. To perfect teammate set-ups, roboticists will have to replicate another quality of a human teammate: social awareness. There are also barriers to humans accepting robots as teammates.

386,A mechanistic account of bodily resonance and implicit bias,"Implicit social biases play a critical role in shaping our attitudes towards other people. Such biases are thought to arise, in part, from a comparison between features of one's own self-image and those of another agent, a process known as 'bodily resonance'. Recent data have demonstrated that implicit bias can be remarkably plastic, being modulated by brief immersive virtual reality experiences that place participants in a virtual body with features of an out-group member. Here, we provide a mechanistic account of bodily resonance and implicit bias in terms of a putative self-image network that encodes associations between different features of an agent. When subsequently perceiving another agent, the output of this self-image network is proportional to the overlap between their respective features, providing an index of bodily resonance. By combining the self-image network with a drift diffusion model of decision making, we simulate performance on the implicit association test (LAT) and show that the model captures the ubiquitous implicit bias towards in-group members. We subsequently demonstrate that this implicit bias can be modulated by a simulated illusory body ownership experience, consistent with empirical data; and that the magnitude and plasticity of implicit bias correlates with self-esteem. Hence, we provide a simple mechanistic account of bodily resonance and implicit bias which could contribute to the development of interventions for reducing the negative evaluation of social out-groups.","Bedder, R.

In two experiments performed for this study, university students watched an instructional video about multiple sclerosis (experiment 1) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (experiment 2). In both experiments, the lecturer's presentation was manipulated in terms of addressing (frontal versus lateral) and dress style (professional versus non-professional). The results revealed that learners who watched the videos where the frontal addressing style was used outperformed those who watched the video where the lateral addressing style was used. The professional dress style was only beneficial for retention performance in the condition where the frontal addressing style was used. The frontal addressing style and the professional dress style were also found to be beneficial in terms of cognitive load reduction and in enhancing parasocial processes.","Beege, M.",1,10.1016/j.chb.2018.11.051,158
396,Ageism - Age coherence within learning material fosters learning,"Pedagogical agents are frequently used in digital learning environments. On the basis of the computers as-social-actors paradigm (CASA), learners do not differentiate between the interaction with these characters and any other social interaction. Therefore, the appearance of pedagogical agents is vulnerable to stereotyping mechanisms such as ageism. In addition, research suggests that the activation of stereotypes also depends on the context of accompanying verbal information. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to one cell of a 2 (stereotype of the agent: young vs. old) x 2 (stereotypical priming within the text: young vs. old) between-subjects factorial design in order to examine if stereotypes impact learning processes. In addition to retention and transfer scores, cognitive load and motivational data of learners were collected. Results revealed that transfer performance is only enhanced when agents and texts activate together either old or young stereotypes, whereas retention performance was not affected by the manipulation. In addition, the manipulation did not result in differences in any cognitive or motivational scores. The results can be explained by the coherence principle which postulates that information from different media should be congruent in order to foster process fluency. (C) 72017 Elsevier Ltd.

401,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Beer, J.

Reappraisal as a coping strategy might help first responders to better cope with their emotional responses to traumatic events. Objective: This study investigated the effects of repeated sessions of a digital reappraisal training among seven firefighters. The training consisted of four sessions supported by a virtual agent, conducted at home or at work, over a two-week period in a single case series. Method: Sixteen data points were collected from each participant in the eight days pre- and post-training. Results: Significantly more themes were used at post-training than at pre- training, implying more flexibility and confirming the main hypothesis of the study. Negative side effects were not reported during or in the week after the training. Conclusions: More controlled studies into the short- and long-term effects of a training of this nature are needed.

411,,"My thesis, the result of an Artistic Research Project, is composed of a theoretical part, which is titled “Semiotics and Perception of Substitute Location in Fiction Film” and a practical work, a Road Movie. The Road Movie will take us through a coordinate system of topics (alienation, assimilation, ideological interpellation, immediacy, etc.) that the theoretical work approaches from a different angle: For the theoretical part, I have analyzed a number of fiction films and artworks with a special focus on the question how places and locations are perceived by the human visual system, which operates as an interface or even as a translation centre between seeing, perceiving, mapping and being. Visual perception is at the same time the source that anchors semiotic information perceived as representative for a real, physical location and the projection point for mapping the world in schemes of virtual environments. Any filmmaker or photographer has to find his own position on a scale that goes from 'total subjective projection' to 'total objective documentation'. Hence, the semiotics of a filmic/photographic narrative space is not only a geographical, geometrical, or a cinematographic category, but always also a moral category. This is expressed in the double meaning of the term point of view, which designates simultaneously a topological and an ethical dimension. As the object of my theoretical research I have chosen a practice that is common in feature film production. It should serve as a point of departure for my speculative journey, and this phenomenon is called 'Substitute Location'. The James Bond movie Die another Day (Lee Tamahori, 2002) is one of many mainstream movies, which illustrate this practice. The film has a plot that takes place in part in Havana, Cuba and some of the scenes show the actor Pierce Brosnan as agent 007 walking along the famous Malecón in Havana, but these scenes were actually shot in Cádiz, Spain, so Cádiz serves as a ‘Substitute Location’ for Havana. A location is a place where a film or a TV series is wholly or partially produced, in addition to the scenes that are shot in a film studio or on extra sets produced for the film. Since Roberto Rossellini and Italian neo-realism, many filmmakers prefer to shoot in real locations because they believe that they will catch more realism if they are in a real place, and not in an artificial studio set pretending to be a real place. The realists - among them many documentary filmmakers - assume, in the philosophical tradition of Aristotle, that the basic structures of reality are reliable, can be reflected by experience, and, in principle, can be represented adequately in linguistic or other symbolic (iconographic) form. The particular phenomenon of ‘Substitute Location’ addresses in a concrete way, how disembodiment and the ideological semiotics of 'make-believe' work hand in hand. Substitute Location allow us simultaneously to assume that somebody in the film team (the responsible producer/ director/ location scout) believed that location A 'looks more historically appropriate than' or 'will be perceived as' location B while exploring moments of convergence and conflict between the signifier and the signified. A Substitute Location then becomes a potential, yet involuntary, environment for a dialectics of seeing, where the blind spots of our projections become an integral part of our individual and collective perception of identities and their ideological interpellation. My artistic approach to reality is influenced by the discipline of Psychogeography. There is no universal definition of what Psychogeography means, however, this discipline was undoubtedly influenced, if not created by Guy Debord and the Situationist International (SI). The body of work which has been created by the SI may seem trivial today but I think that the current state of our society, which has raised passive consumption and its prerequisite, individual financial success, to the measure of all things, can not only be grasped, but it also can be effectiv","Behrens, Thomas",0,,163
412,"The effect of virtual sales agent (VSA) gender - product gender congruence on product advice credibility, trust in VSA and online vendor, and purchase intention","Online vendors are increasingly using virtual sales assistants (VSA), either in the form of an animated picture or a photograph of a real person, to help customers with their product-related information needs. Currently, what is known is that the use of a VSA in an online web shop results in positive outcomes such as trust and purchase intention. What remains unknown, however, is whether or not VSA gender product gender congruence has a positive effect on customers' attitude towards the product-related advice, the VSA, and the online vendor and on customers' online purchase intention. To determine the hypothesized effect of VSA gender-product gender on variables such as trust and purchase intention, a 2 (VSA gender: male vs female)-x-3 (product gender: male, female, and neutral) experiment with 183 inhabitants (between the age of 18 and 30) of the Netherlands was implemented. Results of the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) reveal that congruence between VSA gender and product gender (e.g. female VSA providing advice about a feminine product) positively influences customers' belief in the credibility of the product-related advice, their trust in the VSA and the online vendor, and their purchase intention. The separate main effects of VSA gender and product gender on the aforementioned dependent variables, however, are not statistically significant. Furthermore, customers' gender did not serve any moderating function in the relationship between VSA gender-product gender congruence and the dependent variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

415,Virtual Sprouts: A Virtual Gardening Pilot Intervention Increases Self-Efficacy to Cook and Eat Fruits and Vegetables in Minority Youth,"Objective: To examine the effect of the Virtual Sprouts intervention, an interactive multiplatform mobile gardening game, on dietary intake and psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior in minority youth. Materials and Methods: In this quasi-experimental pilot intervention, 180 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students in Los Angeles Unified School District participated in a 3-week program that included three Virtual Sprouts gaming sessions, three in-school lessons, and three in-home activities, using a nutrition- and gardening-focused curriculum. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires were used to assess psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior, including knowledge about and self-efficacy to eat fruits and vegetables (FV). Data were collected on FV, whole grains, fiber, total sugar, added sugar, and energy from sugary beverages through the Block Kids Food Screener (last week version) for Ages 2-17. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models was used for continuous outcomes, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, school, and free school lunch. Results: After the intervention, the intervention group (n = 116) compared with the control group (n = 64) had a significantly improved self-efficacy to eat FV score (+1.6% vs. -10.3%, P = 0.01), and an improved self-efficacy to cook FV score (+2.9% vs. -5.0%, P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in dietary intake or self-efficacy to garden scores between intervention and control groups. Conclusion: The results from this 3-week pilot study suggest that an interactive mobile game with a nutrition- and gardening-focused curriculum can improve psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior in minority youth.","Bell, B.

423,A Pedagogical Response to Decoloniality: Decolonial Atmospheres and Rising Subjectivity,"The neoliberal academy is, at its core, an apparatus through which coloniality sustains itself. Despite the academy's self-promotion as a catalyzing institution that prepares students to become agents of social change and transformation, some students and faculty experience it as a crucible of oppression. In this essay I trace the beginnings of a project I was a part of in which I worked alongside students who demanded that a psychology program in the university be transformed into a force for decoloniality. I reflect on some of the conditions of coloniality that students actively resisted at one college and that exist elsewhere within the university. Juxtaposed against manifestations of coloniality in the university are synopses of student's experience of them. These synopses provide insight into why students have chosen to resist coloniality in the academy. I also outline a pedagogical response to coloniality that I created given students' desire for decoloniality. Finally, and with the permission of student artists, two liberation psychology student art projects are included to make visible the rise in subjectivity that becomes possible when a decolonial atmosphere is created within the university.","Bell, D.",0,10.1002/ajcp.12292,166

Findings suggest that informal conversational tone lowers perceptions of relative susceptibility to health risks.

426,,"Does the power of interactive media rest in their ability to afford natural and human like conversations? Do we believe that human-machine interactions are capable of successfully engaging us, if they can mimic the back-and-forth dialogue found in human-human interactions? The current study (N = 172), employing a between-subjects experiment, examines the effects of two dialogue-based variables—(i) message-interactivity, operationalized via contingency in message exchanges, and (ii) conversational tone , operationalized in terms of informal turn-taking cues—in how they influence participants’ responses to an online health information tool. Findings suggest that the effect of message-interactivity was positively mediated via perceived contingency and negatively mediated via perceived interactivity in influencing health-related attitudes and behavioral intentions. By enhancing perceptions of contingency in the system’s interaction with the user, message interactivity serves to increase user engagement with the health content supplied by the system. However, users’ perception of interactivity (or the degree of feedback and two-way communication) was at odds with message interactivity, with study participants perceiving greater interactivity when there was lesser contingency in the system’s responses to user input. This, in turn, led to greater perceptions of message relevance, resulting in greater cognitive elaboration of health information. An informal conversational tone, in the form of verbal turn taking cues, lowered perceptions of relative susceptibility to health risks. Implications for designing future interactive health technologies and theoretical considerations surrounding the concepts of interactivity, contingency and turn-taking cues are discussed.","Bellur-Thandaveshwara, Saraswathi",1,,168

Second Life (SL) platform was then used as a traditional on-site class complement in electronic related subjects.

After the specified study period it was found that using SL as part of the methodology, increments motivation toward electronic related subjects, and promotes participation and investigation, due to the fact that this tool makes learning possible in a funnier, more interactive and deeper way than if it had been taught in a master class. Having real-time access from a virtual classroom to all types of audiovisual information, helps more senses get involved in the learning process, making it more effective; nevertheless a weakness was detected related to the attention and concentration: students tend to get distracted, because their classroom is the computer and from there they have access not only to the many worlds of SL but to all the social networks and the Internet in general.

430,Spontaneous flocking in human groups,"Flocking behaviour, as a type of self-organised collective behaviour, is described as the spatial formation of groups without global control and explicit inter-individual recruitment signals. It can be observed in many animals, such as bird flocks, shoals or herds of ungulates. Spatial attraction between humans as the central component of flocking behaviour has been simulated in a number of seminal models but it has not been detected experimentally in human groups so far. The two other sub-processes of this self-organised collective movement - collision avoidance and alignment - are excluded or held constant respectively in this study. We created a computer-based, multi-agent game where human players, represented as black dots, moved on a virtual playground. The participants were deprived of social cues about each other and could neither communicate verbally nor nonverbally. They played two games: (1) Single Game, where other players were invisible, and (2) Joint Game, where each player could see players' positions in a local radius around himself/herself. We found that individuals approached their neighbours spontaneously if their positions were visible, leading to less spatial dispersion of the whole group compared to moving alone. We conclude that human groups show the basic component of flocking behaviour without being explicitly instructed or rewarded to do so. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

438,,"Unmanned systems have grown significantly in popularity since the turn of the century. The advanced development of old and emergent technologies has ushered in an era of capable and accessible unmanned solutions. Increased processing power, memory density, component miniaturization, and energy storage capabilities all lend themselves to smaller systems without the need for a human onboard. Many industries have found applications for inexpensive and portable systems to reach heights, depths, and everything in between that were previously inaccessible without significant funding. Agriculture, defense, and entertainment are just a few of the industries who have been quick to acquire and apply these systems. With the increased demand for unmanned vehicles comes an equivalent need for control systems to utilize these vehicles in useful ways. One such requirement, and the topic of this thesis, is the implementation and optimization of autonomously controlled formation flight for fixed wing aircraft. Traveling in formation is particularly useful in situations where multiple systems are transiting between locations. Whether this is the shipment of freight, passenger transportation, or multiple-angle videography, the ability to have a single system with one or many automated followers simplifies the control of multi-agent scenarios. This research proposes 2-dimensional, nonlinear control algorithms and expands the use of virtual target points to stabilize flight. Additionally, the application of virtual targets to anticipate a variable path is optimized through machine learning techniques. The result is a control system capable of following a leader while maintaining a relative position across a wide range of maneuvers.","Benavidez, Brian",0,,173
439,Observable Agent Effort and Limits Innovation in Residential Real Estate,"Although agent effort is essential and a given in the residential brokerage market, it is difficult to observe and quantify. We estimate a simultaneous systems model using virtual tours as a proxy for observable agent effort. By studying a period during which a visible technological innovation (virtual tour) was introduced to the market, we are able to show relationships between agent effort, price, and time-on-market. Using the introduction to the market of visual tours to proxy agent effort, we find a positive effect on listing price, selling price, and time-on-market, with no significant effect on the commission rate. The effect is greater for lower-priced homes (3% positive effect) than for higher-priced homes (1.60% positive effect) and the effect is greater for larger brokerage firms versus smaller firms. A return to the agent possibly lower than the prospective cost of the innovation suggests agency costs at the transaction level that might limit innovation in the industry.","Benefield, J. D.",0,,174

Recent research in computer vision has shown that a small number of moving points/lines can be used to capture the majority of information (95 %) in human facial expressions. Here, we apply such findings to a minimalist robot face design, which was run through a series of experiments with human subjects (n = 75) exploring the effect of various factors, including added neck motion and degree of expression. Facial expression identification rates were similar to more complex robots. In addition, added neck motion significantly improved facial expression identification rates to 100 % for all expressions (except Fear). The Negative Attitudes towards Robots (NARS) and Godspeed scales were also collected to examine user perceptions, e.g. perceived animacy and intelligence. The project aims to answer a number of fundamental questions about robotic face design, as well as to develop inexpensive and replicable robotic faces for experimental purposes.","Bennett, C.

Much of the progress to date has focused on analysing the visual scene at the object level-the recognition and localization of objects in the scene. Human understanding of images reaches a richer and deeper image understanding both 'below' the object level, such as identifying and localizing object parts and sub-parts, as well as 'above' the object level, such as identifying object relations, and agents with their actions and interactions. In both cases, understanding depends on recovering meaningful structures in the image, and their components, properties and inter-relations, a process referred here as ` image interpretation'. In this paper, we describe recent directions, based on human and computer vision studies, towards human-like image interpretation, beyond the reach of current schemes, both below the object level, as well as some aspects of image interpretation at the level of meaningful configurations beyond the recognition of individual objects, and in particular, interactions between two people in close contact. In both cases the recognition process depends on the detailed interpretation of so-called 'minimal images', and at both levels recognition depends on combining 'bottom-up' processing, proceeding from low to higher levels of a processing hierarchy, together with 'top-down' processing, proceeding from high to lower levels stages of visual analysis.","Ben-Yosef, G.",0,10.1098/rsfs.2018.0020,178
452,Interdependent preferences and strategic distinguishability,"We study agents whose expected utility preferences are interdependent for informational or psychological reasons. We characterize when two types can be ""strategically distinguished"" in the sense that they are guaranteed to behave differently in some finite mechanism. We show that two types are strategically distinguishable if and only if they have different hierarchies of interdependent preferences. The same characterization applies for rationalizability, equilibrium, and any interim solution concept in between. Our results generalize and unify results of Abreu and Matsushima (1992), who characterize strategic distinguishability on fixed finite type spaces, and Dekel et al. (2006, 2007), who characterize strategic distinguishability without interdependent preferences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Bergemann, D.",0,10.1016/j.jet.2017.01.002,179
455,,"A long-standing problem with the use of conventional cancer chemotherapy is the inherent lack of tumor specificity. Tumor-targeting drug-delivery systems (TTDS) have since been explored to overcome this deficiency. These drug conjugates can deliver potent cytotoxic drugs specifically to tumors and tumor cells with minimal systemic toxicity. Among various tumor-targeting molecules discussed, Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) represent a new approach to tumor targeting. In particular, DARPins targeting CD326 Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) receptors provide an effective cancer target, as EpCAM is critical to the regulation of cellular matrix composition and overall cancer aggressiveness. Botulism is a human illness caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum which results in fatal flaccid paralysis and eventual respiratory failure. Clostridium botulinum produces botulinum neurotoxins (BotNTs), which by themselves are considered by the CDC to be potential Category A bioterrorism weapons. The light chain protease domain of BotNTs efficiently cleaves SNARE proteins which in turn regulates neurotransmitter release in motor neurons, resulting in the inhibition of neuronal transmission. Discussed is the use of a novel footprint-based virtual screening to identify compounds with inhibitory activity against BotNTA-LC catalytic activity. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), have recently been identified as intracellular transporters for the endocannabinoid anadamide (AEA). Furthermore, animal studies by others have shown that elevated levels of endocannabinoids result in beneficial pharmacological effects on stress, pain and inflammation and also ameliorate the effects of drug withdrawal. Accordingly a novel α-truxillic acid derivative (SB-FI-26) was synthesized and assayed for its inhibitory activity against FABP5. Additionally, we found SB-FI-26 to act as a potent anti-nociceptive agent with mild anti-inflammatory activity in mice, which strongly supports our hypothesis that the inhibition of FABPs and subsequent elevation of anandamide is a promising new approach in drug discovery.","Berger, William T.",0,,180
456,,"This study examined the civic properties afforded by Twitter and considered whether hashtag communities achieve issues-pluralism in order to facilitate at least some viewpoints to popular expression otherwise absent from print media. Data sources included Twitter hashtag communities that formed around the 2013 Alberta Budget and the associated print media coverage. This inquiry found that while diverse actors contribute to the formation of Twitter hashtag communities, the associated discussion failed to drive issues-pluralism. Twitter's most apparent value to civil society is information exchange—both in terms of tweet content and hyperlinked content and multimedia. In spite of this strength, Twitter is ill-suited as a communicative forum for civil society. Discussion uptake and opinion expression were relatively modest among participants, and the conversation was overwhelmingly dominated and driven by agents of traditional news media intent on perpetuating roles in content gatekeeping and who operated in the service of profits.","Bergie, Brett",0,,181
457,Comparing Virtual and Physical Robotics Environments for Supporting Complex Systems and Computational Thinking,"Both complex systems methods (such as agent-based modeling) and computational methods (such as programming) provide powerful ways for students to understand new phenomena. To understand how to effectively teach complex systems and computational content to younger students, we conducted a study in four urban middle school classrooms comparing 2-week-long curricular units-one using a physical robotics participatory simulation and one using a virtual robotics participatory simulation. We compare the two units for their effectiveness in supporting students' complex systems thinking and computational thinking skills. We find that while both units improved student outcomes to roughly the same extent, they engendered different perspectives on the content. That is, students using the physical system were more likely to interpret situations from a bottom-up (""agent"") perspective, and students using the virtual system were more likely to employ a top-down (""aggregate"") perspective. Our outcomes suggest that the medium of students' interactions with systems leads to differences in their learning from and about those systems. We explore the reasons for and effects of these differences, challenges in teaching this content, and student learning gains. The paper contributes operationalizable definitions of complex systems perspectives and computational perspectives and provides both a theoretical framework for and empirical evidence of a relationship between those two perspectives.","Berland, M.",1,10.1007/s10956-015-9552-x,182

We focus on the design and implementation of the interactive learning activities, which take place in a two-dimensional sensory garden, and the autonomous virtual agent, which acts as a credible social partner to children with autism. Both the activities and the agent are based on principles of best autism practice and input from users. Specification guidelines are given for building an autonomous socially competent agent that supports learning in this context.

462,"Analysis of instructional support elements for an online, educational simulation on active listening for women graduate students in science and engineering","Strong interpersonal communication skills (ICS) are critical for educational and career success, but effective and widely accessible training systems are not available. This paper describes a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental study of an online, educational simulation for practice with the ICS of active listening. The simulation was customized for women graduate students in the natural sciences and engineering. In such environments, where gender stereotyping is common, ICS can make the difference between continued progress and discouraging setbacks. The pedagogical effects of following three instructional support variables were investigated: (1) elaborative versus simple feedback (2) presence versus absence of a static image to accompany the content delivered aurally by a human pedagogical agent, and (3) presence versus absence of instructional hints. The four outcome measures were self-reported knowledge about, skill in applying, and self-efficacy with respect to active listening, along with the usability of the simulation itself. Participants in the study included N = 137 women in the natural sciences and engineering. Results showed that the instructional support variables were significantly related to the outcome measures of knowledge, skills, and usability, but not self-efficacy with respect to active listening. A three-way interaction among all three of the instructional support variables was found to be statistically significant for both the knowledge and skills outcome variables; for both, the highest scores were obtained by participants who were presented with elaborative feedback and neither pedagogical agent image nor hints. Also, participants who received elaborative feedback reported the simulation to have significantly greater usability than those who received simple feedback.","Bernstein, B.

466,MOVEMENT! ACTION! BELIEF? notes for a critique of deleuze's cinema philosophy,"Deleuze's philosophy of cinema departs from the standard conception of modernist aesthetics that sees art withdrawing from representation in order to reflect upon the specificity of its medium. While ambitious and influential, Deleuze's attempt fails. Overdetermined by its own metaphysics, it forsakes the real importance of the movies. It is unable to explain how they function and why they matter. This essay pursues three lines of criticism: Deleuze cannot account for the aesthetic specificity of cinema because he deposes the primacy of action in the movement-image in favour of the primacy of belief (the time-image). This failure is connected to the fact that a cinema of the virtual depends on the very Bazinian realism it is meant to displace. Realism must be acknowledged as the cinematic condition and truth of virtuality. Further, Bazinian realism is the cinematic form of philosophical modernism, preferable for many reasons to Deleuze's philosophy, which returns to pre-modern cosmology in its desire to escape the agent-based, anti-metaphysical commitments of modernism. I apply these criticisms to my analysis of Resnais's Hiroshima mon amour, a movie that prima facie looks made to fulfil the terms of Deleuze's theory but which I argue is an object lesson in realism.","Bernstein, J.

467,Patients with schizophrenia are less prone to interpret virtual others' empathetic questioning as helpful,"Individuals with schizophrenia are impaired in their neurocognition and present cognitive biases. These impairments may lead to a deficit in recognizing helping intentions of others. To investigate recognition of help, we designed a card-guessing game (Virtual Help Recognition Paradigm) involving two successive virtual agents asking questions to the participant at different moments of the game. These questions were either empathetic (i.e. on the subject's feelings) or non-empathetic (i.e. on technical aspects of the game). We assessed how much the participant felt that the virtual agent had helped him and, her attitude and personality traits. We measured how much the participant trusted the virtual agent with a monetary allocation procedure. Twenty individuals with schizophrenia and twenty healthy controls were recruited. The controls' ratings demonstrated that they interpreted empathetic questioning as helping and rewarded it positively with an increased monetary allocation. Participants with schizophrenia had a reduced perception of the differences between the two agents. Only the rating concerning the ""interest/ attention"" of the agent toward these participants yielded significant differences among conditions. Hypothetically, individuals with schizophrenia take into account the fact they are the object of another's attention, but may fail to infer a helping intention and to behave accordingly.

477,Shopping with a robotic companion,"In this paper, we present a robotic shopping assistant, designed with a cognitive architecture, grounded in machine learning systems, in order to study how the human-robot interaction (HRI) is changing the shopping behavior in smart technological stores. In the software environment of the NAO robot, connected to the Internet with cloud services, we designed a social-like interaction where the robot carries out actions with the customer. In particular, we focused our design on two main skills the robot has to learn: the first is the ability to acquire social input communicated by relevant clues that humans provide about their emotional state (emotions, emotional speech), or collected in the Social Media (such as, information on the customer's tastes, cultural background, etc.). The second is the skill to express in turn its own emotional state, so that it can affect the customer buying decision, refining in the user the sense of interacting with a human-like companion. By combining social robotics and machine learning systems the potential of robotics to assist people in real life situations will increase, providing a gentle customers' acceptance of advanced technologies.

480,Pals in Power Armor: Attribution of Human-Like Emotions to Video Game Characters in an Ingroup/Outgroup Situation,"Previous research has demonstrated the tendency for humans to anthropomorphize computers that is, to react to computers as social actors, despite knowing that the computers are mere machines. In the present research, we examined the attribution of both primary (non-uniquely human) and secondary (human-like) emotions to ingroup (teammate) and outgroup (opponent) computer-controlled characters in a video game. We found that participants perceived the teammate character as experiencing more secondary emotions than the opponent character, but that they perceived the teammate and opponent character as experiencing equal levels of primary emotions. Thus, participants anthropomorphized the ingroup character to a greater extent than the outgroup character. These results imply that computers' ""emotions"" are treated with a similar ingroup/outgroup social regard as the emotions of actual humans.","Besmann, A.",1,10.1089/cyber.2012.0111,188
482,Normative and descriptive rationality: from nature to artifice and back,"Rationality plays a key role in both the study of human reasoning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Certain notions of rationality have been adopted in AI as guides for the development of intelligent machines and these notions have been given a normative function. The notions of rationality in AI are often taken to be closely related to conceptions of rationality in human contexts. In this paper, we argue that the normative role of rationality differs in the human and artificial contexts. While rationality in human-focused fields of study is normative, prescribing how humans ought to reason, the normative conception in AI is built on a notion of human rationality which is descriptive, not normative, in the human context, as AI aims at building agents which reason as humans do. In order to make this point, we review prominent notions of rationality used in psychology, cognitive science, and (the history of) philosophy, as well as in AI, and discuss some factors that contributed to rationality being assigned the differing normative statuses in the differing fields of study. We argue that while rationality' is a normative notion in both AI and in human reasoning, the normativity of the AI conception of rationality' is grounded in a descriptive account of human rationality.","Besold, T.

484,,"Man-made entities and humans rely on movement as an essential form of interaction with the world. Whether it is an autonomous vehicle navigating crowded roadways or a simulated pedestrian traversing a virtual world, each entity must compute safe, effective paths to achieve their goals. In addition, these entities, termed agents, are subject to unique physical and behavioral limitations within their environment. For example, vehicles have a finite physical turning radius and must obey behavioral constraints such as traffic signals and rules of the road. Effective motion planning algorithms for diverse agents must account for these physics-based and behavior constraints. In this dissertation, we present novel motion planning algorithms that account for constraints which physically limit the agent and impose behavioral limitations on the virtual agents. We describe representational approaches to capture specific physical constraints on the various agents and propose abstractions to model behavior constraints affecting them. We then describe algorithms to plan motions for agents who are subject to the modeled constraints. First, we describe a biomechanically accurate elliptical representation for virtual pedestrians; we also describe human-like movement constraints corresponding to shoulder-turning and side-stepping in dense environments. We detail a novel motion planning algorithm extending velocity obstacles to generate collisionfree paths for hundreds of elliptical agents at interactive rates. Next, we describe an algorithm to encode dynamics and traffic-like behavior constraints for autonomous vehicles in urban and highway environments. We describe a motion planning algorithm to generate safe, high-speed avoidance maneuvers using a novel optimization function and modified control obstacle formulation, and we also present a simulation framework to evaluate driving strategies. Next, we present an approach to incorporate high-level reasoning to model the motions and behaviors of virtual agents in terms of verbal interactions with other agents or avatars. Our approach leverages natural-language interaction to reduce uncertainty and generate effective plans. Finally, we describe an application of our techniques to simulate pedestrian behaviors for gathering simulated data about loading, unloading, and evacuating an aircraft.","Best, Andrew",0,,190
485,"The Technologically Determined Decade: Robert Zemeckis, Andy Serkis, and the Promotion of Performance Capture","Between 2004 and 2011, Robert Zemeckis directed or produced five films - The Polar Express, Monster House, Beowulf, A Christmas Carol, and Mars Needs Mom - which utilized performance capture technology. Zemeckis and his effects team on The Polar Express refined the existing standards of motion capture to produce the more sophisticated performance capture, which allows for the digitization of an actor's complete performance. This article charts two competing discourses that surrounded these films: the generally negative critical reception that saw the performance capture aesthetic as uncanny and creepy, and Zemeckis' own promotion of the technology in industry interviews. Zemeckis' early work with the technology is contrasted with Andy Serkis' acclaim as a performance capture star, and how both men have worked as advocates for the technology, foregrounding their claims that performance capture could enhance or even revolutionize film production and, in particular, film acting.","Bestor, N.",0,10.1177/1746847716643928,191
486,A listener model: introducing personality traits,"We present a computational model that generates listening behaviour for a virtual agent. It triggers backchannel signals according to the user's visual and acoustic behaviour. The appropriateness of the backchannel algorithm in a user-agent situation of storytelling, has been evaluated by naive participants, who judged the algorithm-ruled timing of backchannels more positively than a random timing. The system can generate different types of backchannels. The choice of the type and the frequency of the backchannels to be displayed is performed considering the agent's personality traits. The personality of the agent is defined in terms of two dimensions, extroversion and neuroticism. We link agents with a higher level of extroversion to a higher tendency to perform more backchannels than introverted ones, and we link neuroticism to less mimicry production and more response and reactive signals sent. We run a perception study to test these relations in agent-user interactions, as evaluated by third parties. We find that the selection of the frequency of backchannels performed by our algorithm contributes to the correct interpretation of the agent's behaviour in terms of personality traits.","Bevacqua, E.",0,10.1007/s12193-012-0094-8,192
490,,"This dissertation is organized in two main parts. In Part I we study networks of homogeneous robots consisting of agents having the same dynamics, sensing, and communication capabilities. We first present a centralized approach based on disjunctive programming to tether a chain of mobile routers between a base station and a user that is moving in a concave environment. We consider line-of-sight (LOS) communication and use a mixed integer approach to determine the number of required agents and their goal locations. Because centralized approaches have the limitation that a central node has to compute all the operations and everything has to be known a priori, we study decentralized approaches to swarm groups of mobile agents while considering communication constraints. Specifically we introduce a spring-mass virtual interaction between the agents and use artificial potentials to navigate the network in a cluttered environment. When dealing with connected networks of mobile robots, the problem of detecting variations in the topology is an important area of study. Therefore we present a novel decentralized technique to detect and estimate changes in the topology of mobile robotic networks. In this case we assume that each robot is equipped with a chaotic oscillator whose state is propagated to the other robots through wireless communication. The key idea of our approach is that every node receives an aggregate signal from the surrounding neighbors, which can be used to detect changes in the local network topology. We introduce an adaptive strategy that each robot independently implements to: (i) estimate the net coupling of all the oscillators in its neighborhood, and (ii) synchronize the state of the oscillators onto the same time evolution. We show that by using this strategy, synchronization can be attained and changes of the network topology can be detected. Finally in the last chapter of Part I we exploit antenna diversity in a practical case study to localize and improve the signal quality between a mobile agent and a user. In Part II we focus our attention on heterogeneous systems. With the term heterogeneous we imply the synergy of multiple robotic platforms characterized by different dynamics and specialized sensing and communication capabilities. An approach that makes use of a heterogeneous team of agents has several advantages when cost, integration of capabilities, or possible large search areas need to be considered. A heterogeneous team allows for the robots to become ""specialized"" in their abilities and therefore accomplish sub-goals more efficiently which in turn makes the overall mission more efficient. In certain situations the use of homogeneous systems can be unfeasible or have limited performance. For instance, aerial vehicles have the capability to cover an area faster, while flying over obstacles, but cannot have a detailed view of mines, caves or building where line-of-sight is lost. On the other hand, ground vehicles, like wheeled or multi-legged robotic platforms, can explore a limited area but with much more accuracy. Here we introduce a hierarchical approach to coordinate aerial and ground agents as intelligent transportation systems. We use optimization theory and potential functions to guide the agents toward specific areas of a partially known environment while maintaining a robust connectivity among the network and exploiting the different mobilities of the agents. Finally we conclude this dissertation with a case study for heterogeneous systems characterized by different kinematics, sensing, and manipulation properties. We consider connectivity constraints and realistic communication, exploiting mobility to implement a power control algorithm that increases the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) among certain members of the network. We also create realistic sensing fields and manipulation by using the geometric properties of the sensor field-of-view and the manipulability metric, respectively.

491,Group Segregation and Urban Violence,"How does segregation shape intergroup violence in contested urban spaces? Should nominal rivals be kept separate or instead more closely integrated? We develop an empirically grounded agent-based model to understand the sources and patterns of violence in urban areas, employing Jerusalem as a demonstration case and seeding our model with microlevel, geocoded data on settlement patterns. An optimal set of parameters is selected to best fit the observed spatial distribution of violence in the city, with the calibrated model used to assess how different levels of segregation, reflecting various proposed virtual futures for Jerusalem, would shape violence. Our results suggest that besides spatial proximity, social distance is key to explaining conflict over urban areas: arrangements conducive to reducing the extent of intergroup interactionsincluding localized segregation, limits on mobility and migration, partition, and differentiation of political authoritycan be expected to dampen violence, although their effect depends decisively on social distance.","Bhavnani, R.",0,10.1111/ajps.12045,194

Applications allowing a learner to have a conversation in a foreign language with a computer have been studied from various perspectives and under different names (dialogue systems, conversational agents, chatbots…). Considering the fragmentation of what we identify under the term dialogue-based CALL, we attempt to offer a structured overview of these efforts into a conceptual framework. Through a methodical search strategy, we collected a corpus of 343 publications. From this corpus, we formalized an operational definition of dialogue-based CALL, which allowed us to identify 96 relevant systems. Analyzing the type of dialogue they offer, on a continuum of constraints on form and meaning, we propose to classify those systems into four groups. We have called these branching, form-focused, goal-oriented and reactive systems, and we describe their corresponding interactional, instructional and technological traits. We summarize the main results from empirical studies on such systems, distinguishing observational, survey and experimental studies, and discuss the impact of dialogue-based CALL on motivation and L2 development, identifying positive evidence on both outcomes. Finally, we propose two main avenues for future research: relative effectiveness of dialogue-based CALL approaches, and dialogue systems as an environment for testing SLA hypotheses.

Methods: The agent was evaluated in a 4-arm randomized trial of a two-month daily contact intervention comparing: (a) physical activity; (b) fruit and vegetable consumption; (c) both interventions; and (d) a non-intervention control. Physical activity was assessed using daily pedometer steps. Daily servings of fruit and vegetables were assessed using the NIH/NCI self-report Fruit and Vegetable Scan. Results: Participants in the physical activity intervention increased their walking on average compared to the control group, while those in the fruit and vegetable intervention and combined intervention decreased walking. Participants in the fruit and vegetable intervention group consumed significantly more servings per day compared to those in the control group, and those in the combined intervention reported consuming more compared to those in the control group.

SettingThree urban ambulatory care practices at Boston Medical Center between April 2009 and September 2011. ParticipantsOlder adults (N=263; mean age 71.3; 61% female; 63% African American; 51% high school diploma or less). InterventionECA participants were provided with portable tablet computers with touch screens to use for 2months and were directed to connect their pedometers to the computer using a data cable and interact with a computer-animated virtual exercise coach daily to discuss walking and to set walking goals. Intervention participants were then given the opportunity to interact with the ECA in a kiosk in their clinic waiting room for the following 10months. Control participants were given a control pedometer intervention that only tracked step counts for an equivalent period of time. Intervention participants were also provided with pedometers. MeasurementsThe primary outcome was average daily step count for the 30days before the 12-month interview. Secondary outcomes were average daily step count for the 30days before the 2-month interview. Outcomes were also stratified according to health literacy level. ResultsECA participants walked significantly more steps than control participants at 2months (adjusted mean 4,041 vs 3,499 steps/day, P=.01), but this effect waned by 12months (3,861 vs 3,383, P=.09). For participants with adequate health literacy, those in the ECA group walked significantly more than controls at both 2months (P=.03) and 12months (P=.02), while those with inadequate health literacy failed to show significant differences between treatment groups at either time point. Intervention participants were highly satisfied with the program. ConclusionAn automated exercise promotion system deployed from outpatient clinics increased walking among older adults over the short-term.

However, the potential safety issues of using conversational assistants for medical information by patients and consumers are not understood. Objective: To determine the prevalence and nature of the harm that could result from patients or consumers using conversational assistants for medical information. Methods: Participants were given medical problems to pose to Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant, and asked to determine an action to take based on information from the system. Assignment of tasks and systems were randomized across participants, and participants queried the conversational assistants in their own words, making as many attempts as needed until they either reported an action to take or gave up. Participant-reported actions for each medical task were rated for patient harm using an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality harm scale. Results: Fifty-four subjects completed the study with a mean age of 42 years (SD 18). Twenty-nine (54%) were female, 31 (57%) Caucasian, and 26 (50%) were college educated. Only 8 (15%) reported using a conversational assistant regularly, while 22 (41%) had never used one, and 24 (44%) had tried one "" a few times."" Forty-four (82%) used computers regularly. Subjects were only able to complete 168 (43%) of their 394 tasks. Of these, 49 (29%) reported actions that could have resulted in some degree of patient harm, including 27 (16%) that could have resulted in death. Conclusions: Reliance on conversational assistants for actionable medical information represents a safety risk for patients and consumers.

Objective: We describe a conversational search engine interface designed to allow individuals with low health and computer literacy identify and learn about clinical trials on the Internet. Methods: A randomized trial involving 89 participants compared the conversational search engine interface (n=43) to the existing conventional keyword-and facet-based search engine interface ( n=46) for the National Cancer Institute Clinical Trials database. Each participant performed 2 tasks: finding a clinical trial for themselves and finding a trial that met prespecified criteria. Results: Results indicated that all participants were more satisfied with the conversational interface based on 7-point self-reported satisfaction ratings (task 1: mean 4.9, SD 1.8 vs mean 3.2, SD 1.8, P <.001; task 2: mean 4.8, SD 1.9 vs mean 3.2, SD 1.7, P<.001) compared to the conventional Web form-based interface. All participants also rated the trials they found as better meeting their search criteria, based on 7-point self-reported scales (task 1: mean 3.7, SD 1.6 vs mean 2.7, SD 1.8, P=.01; task 2: mean 4.8, SD 1.7 vs mean 3.4, SD 1.9, P<.01). Participants with low health literacy failed to find any trials that satisfied the prespecified criteria for task 2 using the conventional search engine interface, whereas 36% (5/14) were successful at this task using the conversational interface (P=.05).

523,Tinker: a relational agent museum guide,"A virtual museum guide agent that uses human relationship-building behaviors to engage museum visitors is described. The computer animated agent, named ""Tinker"", uses nonverbal conversational behavior, empathy, social dialogue, reciprocal self-disclosure and other relational behavior to establish social bonds with users, and encourage continued interaction and repeated visits. Tinker describes exhibits in the museum, gives directions, and discusses technical aspects of her own implementation. Tinker also recognizes returning visitors through biometric analysis of their hand shapes and dialogue cues. Results from two experiments using Tinker are described. In the first, 29 returning visitors are randomized to interact with the agent with the biometric identification turned on or off. In the second experiment, 1,607 visitors are randomized to interact with versions of Tinker that have relationship-building behavior turned on or off. Results indicate that the use of relational behavior leads to significantly greater engagement by museum visitors, measured by session length, number of sessions, and self-reported attitude, as well as learning gains, as measured by a knowledge test, compared to the same agent that does not use relational behavior. Implications for museum exhibits and intelligent tutoring systems are discussed.","Bickmore, T. W.",1,10.1007/s10458-012-9216-7,201
526,,"Multi-agent systems (MAS) research has not produced consensus on how to best structure dialogues conducted between artificial agents. Even simple interactions require robust protocols to accommodate agent autonomy, provide fault tolerance, and signal the termination of dialogues. This research analyzes and demonstrates the feasibility of establishing conversations as the first-order mechanism of communication between artificial agents. It identifies recurring patterns of performative messages exchanged in existing protocols and builds a system in which these patterns are used alongside social commitments and policies to construct complete, coherent agent dialogues. The first-order conversational paradigm allows the agent designer to easily extend agent and dialogue functionality, as demonstrated by the simple Transaction Agents and various Auction Agents implemented here. As well, these conversation protocols naturally signal their own termination when all social commitments formed over their course have been fulfilled - a recognized problem within belief-desire-intention (BDI) and ad hoc agent development paradigms.","Bidulock, Daniel",0,,202
527,The Missing Dimensions of Children's Well-being and Well-becoming in Education Systems: Capabilities and Philosophy for Children,"The objectives of this paper are twofold. The first is to consider how the capability approach can help rethink the policy goals of educational systems by analysing well-being and well-becoming from an individual and societal point of view. The second is to explore Philosophy for Children as a suitable pedagogical approach to promote capable agents and enhance critical, creative and caring thinking. The paper is divided into four parts. After a background is sketched, the capability approach and the concept of evolving capabilities are disentangled in order to rethink educational systems. The Philosophy for Children approach is then presented as a pedagogical base and possible instrument to foster the individual faculties (creativity, critical thinking and care) needed to flourish and participate fully in society (these are usually missing in achievement-based educational systems). In the final part of the paper the main elements of change are recalled and some conclusions are offered.","Biggeri, M.",0,10.1080/19452829.2012.694858,203
529,,"One way to build large-scale autonomous systems is to develop an open multi-agent system using peer-to-peer architectures in which agents are not pre-engineered to work together and in which agents themselves determine the social norms that govern collective behaviour. The social norms and the agent interaction models can be described by Electronic Institutions such as those expressed in the Lightweight Coordination Calculus (LCC), a compact executable specification language based on logic programming and pi-calculus. Open multi-agent systems have experienced growing popularity in the multi-agent community and are expected to have many applications in the near future as large scale distributed systems become more widespread, e.g. in emergency response, electronic commerce and cloud computing. A major practical limitation to such systems is security, because the very openness of such systems opens the doors to adversaries for exploit existing vulnerabilities. This thesis addresses the security of open multi-agent systems governed by electronic institutions. First, the main forms of attack on open multi-agent systems are introduced and classified in the proposed attack taxonomy. Then, various security techniques from the literature are surveyed and analysed. These techniques are categorised as either prevention or detection approaches. Appropriate countermeasures to each class of attack are also suggested. A fundamental limitation of conventional security mechanisms (e.g. access control and encryption) is the inability to prevent information from being propagated. Focusing on information leakage in choreography systems using LCC, we then suggest two frameworks to detect insecure information flows: conceptual modeling of interaction models and language-based information flow analysis. A novel security-typed LCC language is proposed to address the latter approach. Both static (design-time) and dynamic (run-time) security type checking are employed to guarantee no information leakage can occur in annotated LCC interaction models. The proposed security type system is then formally evaluated by proving its properties. A limitation of both conceptual modeling and language-based frameworks is difficulty of formalising realistic policies using annotations. Finally, the proposed security-typed LCC is applied to a cloud computing configuration case study, in which virtual machine migration is managed. The secrecy of LCC interaction models for virtual machine management is analysed and information leaks are discussed.","Bijani, Shahriar",0,,204
530,Exploring Secondary School Students' Stances on the Predictive and Explanatory Power of Science,"There are widespread calls for school education to put more emphasis on developing students' appreciation of the power and limitations of science. Without effective teaching, there is a risk that sensationalist media claims will unduly influence students' perceptions of the power of science to already explain and predict aspects of our daily lives. Secondly, schools have a role in preparing students for a future in which they are likely to work and play alongside increasingly humanlike machines. The study reported here assessed the feasibility of a survey to discover students' stances on the predictive and explanatory power of science in relation to personality, behaviour and the mind The study forms part of a larger project that seeks to identify ways that schools can develop students' epistemic insight when they consider big questions about the nature of reality and human personhood. Beginning with a broad conceptualisation of personhood designed to pick up on questions in the science-religion dialogue, we drew on interviews and focus groups with students in upper secondary school to formulate a set of statements that seemed to be effective in stimulating discussion about the power and limitations of science. The questionnaire was administered to 311 secondary students. Students' responses indicate that they were engaged by the theme and that they were generally not working with a secure overarching scientistic or nonscientistic framework. When we grouped students according to how they responded to the narrower theme of personality and behaviour, one in five of the cohort was labelled as strongly scientistic. We also found that in their comments at different points in the survey, the majority of students expressed ideas and everyday phrases associated with scientism. The article concludes with implications for future research and further recommendations for teachers.","Billingsley, B.",0,10.1007/s11191-019-00031-7,205
532,,"Humanoid motion generation using human-to-humanoid motion transfer (motion retargeting) has become an essential and useful method to produce human-like motions. However, this method has a number of challenges that limit its usefulness. The objective of this dissertation is to develop efficient methods to retarget whole-body, task-space motion from a human to a humanoid while managing online (real-time) dynamic (balance) and kinematic (joint-limit, self-collision, and foot) constraints, and while ensuring motion tracking characterized by dynamic consistency with natural human motion. This dissertation describes a very efficient, modified resolved acceleration control (MRAC) algorithm for dynamic filtering and control of whole-body humanoid motion in response to upper-body task specifications, or a commanded joint-space motion reference in general. The dynamic filter is applicable for general motions when standing in place. It is characterized by modification of the commanded torso acceleration based on a geometric solution to produce a Zero Moment Point (ZMP) which is inside the foot support. The resulting feasible, modified motion is synchronized to the reference motion when the computed ZMP for the reference motion again falls within the support. Contact forces at each foot are controlled through a dedicated force distribution module which optimizes the ankle roll and pitch torques. MRAC uses time-local information and is therefore targeted for online control. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by means of simulated experiments. This dissertation presents a Cartesian-space constrained resolved acceleration control (CRAC) framework to manage execution of operational motion-tracking tasks, and handle constraints for redundant and non-redundant task specifications. The approach is particularly well suited for online control of humanoid robots using captured human motion data expressed by Cartesian variables. The current formulation is dynamically consistent, and enforces kinematic constraints such as joint-limit, self-collision, and foot constraints. Based on the applied reference motion and constraints setup, CRAC enables motion control at rates of 3k Hz in the fastest case and more than 400 Hz in the slowest case. A method, called the Unified CRAC (UCRAC), that handles dynamic balance and kinematic constraints together for whole-body task-space motion is also developed. The approach is non-iterative and as a result suitable for real-time applications. It utilizes an efficient centroidal dynamics formulation to relate the net force, applied to the humanoid by the environment, to the joint accelerations that realize the motion. UCRAC uses heuristically-designed rules to force the computed ZMP and centroidal projection to remain inside the foot support area, and to compute and command the net force on the system. Enforcing foot constraints are managed through the application of the constrained centroidal dynamic equations. UCRAC is capable to handle quasi-static tic balance in addition to dynamic balance, which is shown to provide significant flexibility for different humanoid foot dimensions. This method performs with rates providing faster than real-time performance with a minimum speed of 250 Hz which includes all constraint computations as well. The efficacy of the proposed methods is demonstrated in all cases by simulated and real-time experiments of task-level human motion replication on a Honda-like humanoid robot model.","Bin Hammam, Ghassan M.",0,,206
533,Emergent Regularities of Interpersonal Victimization: An Agent-Based Investigation,"Objectives: Apply computational agent-based modeling to explore the generative sufficiency of several mechanisms derived from the field of environmental criminology in explaining commonly observed patterns of interpersonal victimization. Method: Controlled simulation experiments compared patterns of simulated interpersonal victimization to three empirically derived regularities of crime using established statistical techniques: (1) spatial clustering (nearest neighbor index), (2) repeat victimization (Gini coefficient), and (3) journeys to crime (Pearson's coefficient of skewness). Results: Large, statistically significant increases in spatial clustering, repeat victimization, and journey to crime skewness are observed when virtual offenders operate according to mechanisms proposed by the routine activity approach, rational choice perspective, and geometry/pattern theories of crime. Conclusion: This research provides support for several propositions of environmental criminology in explaining why interpersonal victimization tends to be spatially concentrated, experienced by a small number of repeat victims, and why aggregate journey to crime curves tend to follow a distance decay relationship. By extending previous work in agent-based modeling of property victimization, it also demonstrates that the same core mechanisms are sufficient to generate plausible patterns of crime when examining fundamentally different types of offending.","Birks, D.",0,10.1177/0022427813487353,207
536,,"The lead characters in the CGI-animated children’s films produced by Pixar and DreamWorks Animation are overwhelming male, and more often than not, they are not human. This simultaneously reflects a long history of anthropomorphization in animated storytelling and a breakaway from Disney’s princess-centric focus. Given these characters’ non-human status, how do animators map biological maleness and masculine gender norms onto these characters? This qualitative textual analysis of the studios’ films produced between roughly 2000 and 2010 suggests that these anthropomorphized characters were constructed as male and masculine through three textual strategies: codes of bodily masculinity, sexual masculinity, and social masculinity. The project considers the implication of these constructions of hegemonic masculinity for audiences of children, building on the premise that major global companies such as Pixar and DreamWorks are “teaching machines” and “agents of socialization,” teaching children the “right” way to conceptualize themselves and others.

This article argues that the focus of technical development in this field is too ambitious, neglecting the potential market for an affordable device that is aleady in the realm of the 'adjacent possible' given current technology capabilities. It also questions on both ethical and marketing grounds the current effort to develop assistive robots with pet-like or human-like features. The marketing literature on 'really new products' has so far not appeared to inform the development of assistive robots but has some important lessons. These include using analogies with existing products and giving particular attention to the role of early adopters. Relevant analogies for care robots are not animals or humans but useful domestic appliances and personal technologies with attractive designs, engaging functionality and intuitive usability. This points to a strategy for enabling mass adoption - which has so far eluded even conventional telecare - of emphasising how such an appliance is part of older people's contemporary lifestyles rather than a sign of age-related decline and loss of independence.","Blackman, T.",0,10.1017/s0144686x1200027x,210

The objective of the paper is to propose a feminist post- structuralist pedagogical model of delivering training to public professionals.

541,,"Data-driven techniques have become synonymous with replication of real-world phenomena. Efforts have been underway to use these techniques in crowd simulation through a mapping of pedestrian trajectories onto virtual agents using a similarity of circumstance. These works have exposed two fundamental issues with data-driven crowds. First, robust real-world data is logistically difficult to accurately collect and filled with unknown variables, such as a person's mental state, which change behavior without providing a means to replicate their effects. Second, current data-driven approaches store and search the entire set of training data to decide the next course of action for each agent. A straightforward single-model system would alleviate the burden of storing and searching the data. The problem with a monolithic model, though, is that a single steering policy cannot handle all possible scenarios. To counter this we propose the splitting of possible scenarios into separable contexts, with each context in turn learning a model. The model used by an agent can then be dynamically swapped at runtime based on the evolving conditions around the agent. This results in a more scalable approach to data-driven simulation. In lieu of tracked data from real pedestrians, we propose the use of an oracle steering algorithm. This algorithm stands in for real data and can be queried for a steering decision for any combination of factors. This allows us to more thoroughly explore the problem space as needed. Furthermore, we can control all variables and capture behavior from scenarios that are otherwise infeasible to adequately sample in reality. This synthetic source of training data allows for a scalable and structured approach to training machine-learned models which virtual agents can use to navigate at runtime.","Boatright, Cory D.",0,,212
542,Human exit route choice in virtual crowd evacuations,"The collective behaviour of human crowds emerges from the local interactions of individuals. To understand human crowds we therefore need to identify the behavioural rules individual pedestrians follow. This is crucial for the control of emergency evacuations from confined spaces, for example. At a microscopic level we seek to predict the next step of pedestrians based on their local environment. However, we also have to consider 'tactical-level' individual behaviour that is not an immediate response to the local environment, such as the choice between different routes to exit a building. We used an interactive virtual environment to study human exit route decisions in simulated evacuations. Participants had to escape from a building and had to choose between different exit routes in the presence of evacuating simulated agents. We found no inherent preference for familiar routes, but under a stress-inducing treatment, subjects were more likely to display behaviour in their route choice that was detrimental to their evacuation time. Most strikingly, subjects were less likely to avoid a congested exit by changing their original decision to move towards it under this treatment. Age and gender had clear effects on reaction times in the virtual environment. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Bode, N.

544,Information use by humans during dynamic route choice in virtual crowd evacuations,"We conducted a computer-based experiment with over 450 human participants and used a Bayesian model selection approach to explore dynamic exit route choice mechanisms of individuals in simulated crowd evacuations. In contrast to previous work, we explicitly explore the use of time-dependent and time-independent information in decision-making. Our findings suggest that participants tended to base their exit choices on time-dependent information, such as differences in queue lengths and queue speeds at exits rather than on time-independent information, such as differences in exit widths or exit route length. We found weak support for similar decision-making mechanisms under a stress-inducing experimental treatment. However, under this treatment participants were less able or willing to adjust their original exit choice in the course of the evacuation. Our experiment is not a direct test of behaviour in real evacuations, but it does highlight the role different types of information and stress play in real human decision-making in a virtual environment. Our findings may be useful in identifying topics for future study on real human crowd movements or for developing more realistic agent-based simulations.","Bode, N. W. F.",0,10.1098/rsos.140410,214
547,What makes virtual agents believable?,"In this paper we investigate the concept of believability and make an attempt to isolate individual characteristics (features) that contribute to making virtual characters believable. As the result of this investigation we have produced a formalisation of believability and based on this formalisation built a computational framework focused on simulation of believable virtual agents that possess the identified features. In order to test whether the identified features are, in fact, responsible for agents being perceived as more believable, we have conducted a user study. In this study we tested user reactions towards the virtual characters that were created for a simulation of aboriginal inhabitants of a particular area of Sydney, Australia in 1770 A.D. The participants of our user study were exposed to short simulated scenes, in which virtual agents performed some behaviour in two different ways (while possessing a certain aspect of believability vs. not possessing it). The results of the study indicate that virtual agents that appear resource bounded, are aware of their environment, own interaction capabilities and their state in the world, agents that can adapt to changes in the environment and exist in correct social context are those that are being perceived as more believable. Further in the paper we discuss these and other believability features and provide a quantitative analysis of the level of contribution for each such feature to the overall perceived believability of a virtual agent.","Bogdanovych, A.",0,10.1080/09540091.2015.1130021,215

551,,"In recent years, massive growth in internet usage has spurred the emergence of complex large-scale networking systems to serve growing user bases, bandwidth and computation requirements. For example, data center facilities – workhorses of today's internet – have evolved to house upward of several hundreds of thousands of servers; content distribution networks with high capacity and wide coverage have emerged as a de facto content dissemination modality, and peer-to-peer applications with hundreds of thousands of users are increasingly becoming popular. At these scales, it becomes critical to operate at high efficiencies as the price of idling resources can be significant. In particular, the interaction between agents (servers, peers etc.) is a defining factor of efficiency in these systems – applications are often communication intensive, whereas agents share links of only limited bandwidth. This necessitates the use of principled algorithms, as efficient communication to a large extent depends on the interaction protocols. We study data center networks and peer-to-peer networks as canonical examples of modern-day large-scale networking systems. Server-to-server interaction is an integral part of the data center's operation. The latency of these interactions is often a significant bottleneck toward overall job completion times. We study complementary approaches toward reducing this latency: (i) design of computation algorithms that minimize interaction and (ii) optimal scheduling algorithms to maximally utilize the network fabric. We also consider peer-to-peer networks as an emerging mode of content distribution and sharing. Unlike data centers, these networks are flexible in their network structure and also scale well, but require decentralized algorithms for control. Of central importance here is the design of a network topology that enables efficient peer interactions for optimal application performance. We propose novel topology designs for two popular applications: (i) multimedia streaming and (ii) anonymity in Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network.","Bojja Venkatakrishnan, Shaileshh",0,,217

My work has attempted to provide metrics that could increase the positive predictive value of coronary CTA through the use of dual energy CTA imaging. After developing an algorithm for obtaining calcium scores from a CTA exam, a dual energy CTA exam was performed on patients at dose levels equivalent to levels for single energy CTA with a calcium scoring exam. Calcium Agatston scores obtained from the dual energy CTA exam were within ±11% of scores obtained with conventional calcium scoring exams. In the presence of highly attenuating coronary calcium plaques, the virtual non-calcium images obtained with dual energy CTA were able to successfully measure percent coronary stenosis within 5% of known stenosis values, which is not possible with single energy CTA images due to the presence of the calcium blooming artifact. After fabricating an anthropomorphic beating heart phantom with coronary plaques, characterization of soft plaque vulnerability to rupture or erosion was demonstrated with measurements of the distance from soft plaque to aortic ostium, percent stenosis, and percent lipid volume in soft plaque. A classification model was developed, with training data from the beating heart phantom and plaques, which utilized support vector machines to classify coronary soft plaque pixels as lipid or fibrous. Lipid versus fibrous classification with single energy CTA images exhibited a 17% error while dual energy CTA images in the classification model developed here only exhibited a 4% error. Combining the calcium blooming correction and the percent lipid volume methods developed in this work will provide physicians with metrics for increasing the positive predictive value of coronary CTA as well as expanding the use of coronary CTA to patients with highly attenuating calcium plaques.","Boltz, Thomas",0,,219

It causes severe illnesses in animals and humans yet there are no FDA approved drugs or human vaccines. RVFV is spread by mosquitoes or contact with infected animal carcasses and is endemic to Africa and Peninsula regions of the Middle East, but there is concern that it could spread to other regions of the world given that the mosquito vectors are more widely distributed than the pathogen itself. It is cross-listed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Human and Health Services (DHHS) as a select agent, which are organisms or toxins with the potential of being used for bioterrorism and for which there are no available countermeasures. With crystal structures of RVFV nucleocapsid (N) protein becoming recently available, it was hypothesized that identification of its mode of interaction with RNA could lead to selection of compounds with the ability to inhibit genome packaging. The main goal of this thesis research was to study through computational techniques the interaction of N with the RNA genome with an aim of identifying putative inhibitors by screening drug-like molecular libraries. The coordinates for the crystal structures of N were obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and used in dockings and virtual screening. Using sequence alignment and molecular modeling, invariant residues in phleboviral N proteins were mapped to the model with a view of refining the modes of interactions. The RVFV N protein was analyzed for potential drug/ligand binding cavities with Pocket-Finder while molecules derived from the NCI Diversity Set III, Drug Bank and PubChem libraries were screened with AutoDock Vina using the PyRx virtual screening tool. Docking Server and Discovery studio were used to determine protein-ligand interactions. These studies successively developed a theoretical model describing the N-protein interactions with RNA.

557,,"Community colleges constitute a special type of higher education organization: their complex mission, dynamics, personnel structures, and values require a distinct set of understandings and skills to lead and manage them well. Most of the research on leadership in community colleges focuses on leaders in positions of power (presidents, provosts, etc.) and not on grassroots or bottom-up leadership. Bottom-up leaders are individuals who perpetuate change without having the backing of a formal position of authority to do so. Recent leadership research validates the importance of having change agents at all levels of an organization in order to further the mission of the institution. This dissertation consists of three primary parts: (1) a technical report written by a three-person research team representing a synthesis of the collaborative research findings on the various leadership pathways that exist in the community college and the factors that influence individuals to engage in leadership efforts; (2) an individual research study on the perspectives of grassroots leaders who have engaged in informal change initiatives at a community college; and (3) an extension of the individual research study that discusses institutional attributes, properties, and/or conditions that foster and encourage grassroots organization. Individual, in-depth interviews were conducted in order to identify strategies grassroots leaders used to influence top-down leadership and the major obstacles they faced. The conversational nature of these interviews allowed for two-way interactions that lent themselves to a greater understanding of the subjects’ experiences, thoughts, and motives. This study provides a greater focus on understanding the motivations, tactics, obstacles, and sources of resiliency that grassroots leaders use to affect change. The findings indicate that a variety of personal and professional influences affect a grassroots leader’s decision to engage in leadership efforts, that grassroots leaders tailor their tactics and strategies to fit the situation, and that resiliency is essential to the success of their engagement. Finally, this study makes several recommendations administrators can use to promote grassroots leadership on their campuses.

558,Recognition and repair of communicative failures: The interaction between Theory of Mind and cognitive complexity in schizophrenic patients,"The aim of the present research is to perform a detailed and empirical investigation of schizophrenia patients' deficits in recognizing and recovering a communicative failure. In particular, this paper investigates the role of Theory of Mind (ToM) and of the complexity of the mental representations involved in explaining patients' deficits in recognizing and recovering different kinds of communicative failures, i.e. failure of the expressive act, failure of communicative meaning and failure of the communicative effect. Twenty-two patients with schizophrenia and an equal number of healthy controls took part in the experiment. The experimental protocol consisted of videotaped stories in which two agents interact, showing a communicative failure: the participants were asked to recognize and repair the observed failure. Some classical ToM tests (Sally and Ann, Modified Smarties and a selection of six Strange Stories) were also administered. Our results revealed a deficit in patients, when compared with healthy controls, in recognizing and recovering communicative failures. Furthermore, focusing on schizophrenia patients' performance per se, we observed a trend with regard to the increasing difficulty of understanding and recognizing different kinds of communicative failures, i.e. failure of expression act, failure of communicative meaning, and failure of the communicative effect. Learning outcomes: The reader becomes aware that schizophrenic patients perform less well than healthy controls in recognizing and recovering different kinds of communicative failures, and of the role played by Theory of Mind, and representational complexity involved in such different kinds of failures, in explaining patients' performance.

This review focuses on two aims: (1) to provide an overview of the recent ICT applications used in the treatment of autism and (2) to focus on the early development of imitation and joint attention in the context of children with autism as well as robotics. There have been a variety of recent ICT applications in autism, which include the use of interactive environments implemented in computers and special input devices, virtual environments, avatars and serious games as well as telerehabilitation. Despite exciting preliminary results, the use of ICT remains limited. Many of the existing ICTs have limited capabilities and performance in actual interactive conditions. Clinically, most ICT proposals have not been validated beyond proof of concept studies. Robotics systems, developed as interactive devices for children with autism, have been used to assess the child’s response to robot behaviors; to elicit behaviors that are promoted in the child; to model, teach and practice a skill; and to provide feedback on performance in specific environments (e.g., therapeutic sessions). Based on their importance for both early development and for building autonomous robots that have humanlike abilities, imitation, joint attention and interactive engagement are key issues in the development of assistive robotics for autism and must be the focus of further research.

In addition, to avoid the rules associated conceptual holes, to deal with the conflicting objectives and to reduce the substantial overhead, the components selection is formulated as a multiobjective problem and it is tackled using a metaheuristic search method. Furthermore, to evaluate the design and the feasibility of the proposed framework, a use case and a discussion are provided.

But all too often they are regarded in an instrumental way or as promoters of some form of ideal global teacher. Evidence from the UK and elsewhere suggests that if a pedagogical approach is taken to the role of teachers within the process of learning, then three distinct locations of teachers as change agents can be identified. These are as change agents within the classroom, within the wider school, and within society as a whole.","Bourn, Douglas",0,,227

580,,"This book defends a theory of linguistic understanding, or what is alternatively called linguistic competence or semantic competence; it also defends a view about how linguistic understanding is related to semantic theory. The central target for a theory of understanding is to answer the question, ""What is it to understand and competently use a language?"" It is natural to think that understanding a language is a matter of knowing what various expressions in the language mean. Since semantic theory is a theory of what various expressions in a language mean, it is a natural and widely held view that linguistic understanding is simply a matter of knowing something like a semantic theory. According to this view, we essentially arrive at the best theory of understanding by pointing to the best semantic theory and simply saying that to understand and be competent with a language is to know that. Thus, the theory of understanding has been thought by many to be a trivial offspring of semantic theory, and the theory of understanding is generally passed over as an independent topic of inquiry. I argue, however, that linguistic understanding cannot simply be a matter of knowing a semantic theory. I develop a theory of understanding distinct from semantic theory, explain how the two are related, and why both are essential. Four major threads run through the chapters. First is a proposal about how to understand competent use. A theory of understanding must begin with a characterization of the linguistic abilities we are trying to account for. Competence consists in at least three abilities: referential competence , recognitional competence, and inferential competence. Referential competence is the ability to use a word with its meaning — using it in various sentences to make assertions, commands or promises, to ask questions, and form linguistically mediated thoughts (I will henceforth only mention the case of assertion). For example, a speaker is referentially competent with the name `Felicity' if she can use it to refer to Felicity and thus, among many other things, use the sentence `Felicity is a horse' to assert that Felicity is a horse. It is widely accepted in the literature that we can successfully use certain words, such as names and some natural kind terms (i.e. `elm'), without knowing much about their reference or meaning. I argue that the relevant sense of successful use in these cases is referential competence. I extend this idea by arguing that mere referential competence is possible for a much greater variety of expressions, including some that carry a higher standard of understanding (`red', `bachelor', `horse' etc.). Such words do carry a higher standard of understanding, but this doesn't mean mere referential competence isn't possible, only that there is a larger gap between mere referential competence and a ""normal"" level of understanding. The gap is filled in my view by recognitional and/or inferential competence. A speaker is recognitionally competent with a word to the extent that she can recognize whether or not it applies in a given circumstance — i.e. to the extent that she can correctly determine whether or not `red' applies to various objects. A speaker is inferentially competent with a word to the extent that she can see how its meaning relates to the meanings of other words in the language. Knowing to infer `Felicity is a horse' from `Felicity is a mare' is an instance of inferential competence with `mare' (and `horse'). A key point about the abilities is that they suggest a highly graded picture where understanding can range from minimal to robust. Mere referential competence, accompanied by no significant measure of the other abilities, is the most minimal level of genuinely linguistic understanding possible. Robust understanding comes with the addition of a significant measure of recognitional and/or inferential competence. The second thread is negative, arguing that semantic theory alone can't provide a theory of understanding. I argue for this primarily on the grounds that","Bowman, Brian",0,,229
581,Student use of animated pedagogical agents in a middle school science inquiry program,"Animated pedagogical agents (APAs) have the potential to provide one-on-one, just-in-time instruction, guidance or mentoring in classrooms where such individualized human interactions may be infeasible. Much current APA research focuses on a wide range of design variables tested with small samples or in laboratory settings, while overlooking important practical issues relating to large-scale, school-based implementations. The present study provides an early step in addressing this gap by investigating the patterns, affordances and challenges of sustained classroom use of APAs. During a 15-class-period science curriculum, middle school students in the treatment groups (nDr C-1 = 191; nDr C-2 = 181) had uninterrupted classroom access to one of the two APAs, while control group students (n = 149) completed the same curriculum without APA access. Usage patterns indicate that students accessed the APAs on a fluctuating, as needed, basis corresponding to the introductory, information-gathering, and synthesis and reporting segments of the curriculum. Survey results revealed no statistically significant difference in student feelings toward the APAs between the two treatments. While treatment students reported that the APAs were unique, reliable, timely resources, interviews indicate little difference between their experiences with the curriculum and those of the control group. Results presented here provide guidance for researchers and practitioners.","Bowman, C. D. D.",1,10.1111/j.1467-8535.2011.01198.x,230
582,"The rugged border: Surveillance, policing and the dynamic materiality of the US/Mexico frontier","This paper explores US Department of Homeland Security surveillance programs in the United States/Mexico borderlands, with an emphasis on the quotidian role of a dynamic more-than-human landscape in frustrating the department's enforcement practices and ambitions. The paper is based on several years' ethnographic research in southern Arizona, archival research, and semi-structured interviews with current and former government personnel. By unpacking the quotidian challenges confronted by Homeland Security personnel, the paper contributes to a post-humanist theory of terrain, shifting the focus of geographic inquiry to the ways that the qualities of certain spaces, objects, and conditions may resist or impede everyday navigation, centralized vision or administrative practice. Yet, as the long saga of Department of Homeland Security surveillance initiatives would suggest, the impediments of terrain are by no means final or determinant. To think through this indeterminacy and its implications for the geographic composition of state practice, the paper proposes that the latter be approached metabolically, with state security and surveillance practices continuously animated by a dynamic exterior as agents and agencies seek to overcome tactical and strategic limitations by incorporating, digesting and subjecting ever-greater kinds and volumes of objects, bodies, landscapes, and data to centralized legibility and control.","Boyce, G.

583,,"In the context of virtual reality applications such as games, films and training exercises, the virtual environment is fundamental to the viewer’s experience. Improvements in computer graphics, particularly in rendering and artificial intelligence, continue to make virtual worlds look and feel more believable and more natural. This thesis focuses on virtual landscapes and the industry requirement for increasingly large digital assets, such as artificial landscapes extending as far as entire planets. This, however, requires high financial investment in artists and designers to carry out tedious, detailed tasks. As a result, tools which reduce the artists’ workload are valued, facilitating both faster work-flow and artistic control of the final visual result. Commercial production tools commonly incorporate procedural and stochastic methods. Although they can, in theory, provide a great deal of freedom, their use is limited by the fact that they often limit artistic control by employing non-intuitive parametric controls. This can make it hard for users to edit a generated scene or add data-based assets later. Alternative tools give the artist complete control over the content created at the expense of a heavy work-flow. This thesis addresses the problems involved in production of virtual landscapes by creating a series of tools which improve production workflow. These tools are built to simultaneously exploit real-world data as well as traditional algorithmic models, whilst also providing means of artist interaction and guidance. Contribution is made in the following three contexts: aerial footage is explored to create environments which incorporate the statistical distributions of different types of vegetation in real-world landscapes; stochastic methods are applied to real-world elevation maps to facilitate height-field manipulation using frequency-based controls; and finally, landscape ecology is investigated along with the application of ecological modelling to landscape synthesis, resulting in a toolset encouraging early user-involvement in the creative process. The presented systems run interactively, allowing user-involvement throughout, and together contribute to a fluid workflow for landscape production whereby the artist may define a scene in terms of a layout map of ecosystems (or object classes) as well as a customisable terrain elevation map. An agent-based simulation then ‘plants’ and ‘grows’ vegetation instances on the landscape. This simulation can be paused and all inputs adjusted at any point. The work presented represents an important contribution to the problem of virtual landscape contribution, addressing some of its more considerable bottlenecks.","Bradbury, Gwyneth Anne",0,,232
584,Sandboxes for Model-Based Inquiry,"In this article, we introduce a class of constructionist learning environments that we call Emergent Systems Sandboxes (ESSs), which have served as a centerpiece of our recent work in developing curriculum to support scalable model-based learning in classroom settings. ESSs are a carefully specified form of virtual construction environment that support students in creating, exploring, and sharing computational models of dynamic systems that exhibit emergent phenomena. They provide learners with ""entity""-level construction primitives that reflect an underlying scientific model. These primitives can be directly ""painted"" into a sandbox space, where they can then be combined, arranged, and manipulated to construct complex systems and explore the emergent properties of those systems. We argue that ESSs offer a means of addressing some of the key barriers to adopting rich, constructionist model-based inquiry approaches in science classrooms at scale. Situating the ESS in a large-scale science modeling curriculum we are implementing across the USA, we describe how the unique ""entity-level"" primitive design of an ESS facilitates knowledge system refinement at both an individual and social level, we describe how it supports flexible modeling practices by providing both continuous and discrete modes of executability, and we illustrate how it offers students a variety of opportunities for validating their qualitative understandings of emergent systems as they develop.","Brady, C.",0,10.1007/s10956-014-9506-8,233
589,Gender affordances of conversational agents,"Conversational agents are attributed humanlike characteristics: in particular, they are often assumed to have a gender. There is evidence that gender sets up expectations that have an impact on user experiences with agents. The objective of this paper is to explore gender affordances of conversational agents. Our examination takes a holistic approach to the analysis of the application of gender stereotypes to nine chatterbots: six embodied (three male and three female), two disembodied (male and female), and a robot embodiment. Building on social psychology research, we test the persistence of gender stereotypes in the selection of conversation topics and in the elicitation of disinhibition and verbal abuse. Our study is based on quantitative textual analysis of interaction logs. A dictionary of English sexual slang and derogatory terms was developed for this study. Results show that gender stereotypes tend to affect interaction more at the relational (style) level then at the referential (content) level of conversation. People attribute negative stereotypes to female-presenting chatterbots more often than they do to male-presenting chatterbots, and female-presenting chatterbots are more often the objects of implicit and explicit sexual attention and swear words. We conclude by calling for a more informed analysis of user interactions that considers the full range of user interactions. (C) 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

591,Living brands: consumer responses to animated brand logos,"This research builds foundational theory in a new domain of marketing: animated visual brand elements. It focuses on agent animation, which conveys a sense that the brand element, such as a logo, moves of its own volition, as distinguished from object animation, which does not. Given limited marketplace utilization (pilot study), animated logos represent new opportunities for branding and promotion. However, the influence of agent animation on attitude toward the firm or brand is contingent on the fluent processing of the animation in the context it is used. As compared with object-animated or static logos, agent animation encourages more favorable attitudes toward dynamic firms but less favorable attitudes toward stable firms (Studies 1 and 2). Further, more favorable attitudes arise when the brand personality suggested by the animation is consistent with other brand cues, such as brand slogans (Study 3) or the logo graphic (Study 4). Finally, the effects are replicated with choice behavior using established brands (Study 5).","Brasel, S. A.",0,10.1007/s11747-015-0449-2,235
593,,"The use of conversational agents has increased across the world. From providing automated support for companies to being virtual psychologists they have moved from an academic curiosity to an application with real world relevance. While many researchers have focused on the content of the dialogue and synthetic speech to give the agents a voice, more recently animating these characters has become a topic of interest. An additional use for character animation technology is in the film and video game industry where having characters animated without needing to pay for expensive labour would save tremendous costs. When animating characters there are many aspects to consider, for example the way they walk. However, to truly assist with communication automated animation needs to duplicate the body language used when speaking. In particular conversational agents are often only an animation of the upper parts of the body, so head motion is one of the keys to a believable agent. While certain linguistic features are obvious, such as nodding to indicate agreement, research has shown that head motion also aids understanding of speech. Additionally head motion often contains emotional cues, prosodic information, and other paralinguistic information. In this thesis we will present our research into synthesising head motion using only recorded speech as input. During this research we collected a large dataset of head motion synchronised with speech, examined evaluation methodology, and developed a synthesis system. Our dataset is one of the larger ones available. From it we present some statistics about head motion in general. Including differences between read speech and story telling speech, and differences between speakers. From this we are able to draw some conclusions as to what type of source data will be the most interesting in head motion research, and if speaker-dependent models are needed for synthesis. In our examination of head motion evaluation methodology we introduce Forced Canonical Correlation Analysis (FCCA). FCCA shows the difference between head motion shaped noise and motion capture better than standard methods for objective evaluation used in the literature. We have shown that for subjective testing it is best practice to use a variation of MUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) based testing, adapted for head motion. Through experimentation we have developed guidelines for the implementation of the test, and the constraints on the length. Finally we present a new system for head motion synthesis. We make use of simple templates of motion, automatically extracted from source data, that are warped to suit the speech features. Our system uses clustering to pick the small motion units, and a combined HMM and GMM based approach for determining the values of warping parameters at synthesis time. This results in highly natural looking motion that outperforms other state of the art systems. Our system requires minimal human intervention and produces believable motion. The key innovates were the new methods for segmenting head motion and creating a process similar to language modelling for synthesising head motion.","Braude, David Adam",0,,236
594,Partnering with Pots: The Work of Objects in the Imperial Inca Project,"New developments in the natural sciences are contributing to new thinking on the nature of matter, materiality and being. Such re-visioning of the natural world is, in part, responsible for 'the ontological turn', a trend clearly visible in recent archaeological discourse. In combination with evolving relational and symmetrical approaches to investigating the constitution of 'the social', the door is open for exploring logics, taxonomies and under-standings of reality different from our own in studies of the past. Applying these ideas to the investigation of early imperialism, this paper offers an analysis of a key element in the repertoire of Inca material culture that forwards the importance of human-thing relations in the context of early state politics. Working from the basis of the imperial Inca ceramic assemblage, the study examines how these objects were deployed in the task of empire-building and what insights they provide into Andean ontological commitments during the late pre-Columbian period. An argument is developed that imperial pots were construed as animate beings and agents of the State. The study brings to the fore the mutually constituted nature of the imperial Inca project and suggests new avenues for future research that highlight the matter of early empires.","Bray, T.

Children treated the robots as interlocutors. They supplied information to the robots and retained what the robots told them.

Consistent with studies of children's early sensitivity to an interlocutor's non-verbal signals, children were especially attentive and receptive to whichever robot displayed the greater non-verbal contingency. Such selective information seeking is consistent with recent findings showing that although young children learn from others, they are selective with respect to the informants that they question or endorse.","Breazeal, C.",0,10.1111/tops.12192,238

614,,"This project analyzes nineteenth-century suicide politics as an essential catalyst in the emergence of American eugenics. It tracks developments in five cultural arenas, or morbid publics, in which acts and idioms of suicide animated early eugenic thought in intricate and flexible ways. It argues that debates within and between these publics authorized eugenics as a prestigious science and remarkably enduring style of humanitarian reform. While historians locate eugenics' popular appeal in new theories of the natural and biological sciences, my focus on suicide reveals instead a fundamental restructuring of humanitarian sensibilities. A remarkable array of actors contributed to this shift: agents of suicide and their families, statists and legal professionals, medical practitioners and actuaries, newspaper editors and popular novelists. Fin de siècle advocates of eugenic science and eugenic legislation drew upon suicide's multiple valances as they debated the methods by which to produce an ideal American race. As a capacious theory, suicidality facilitated eugenic distinctions between ""fit"" and ""unfit"" individuals. As an act, suicide offered the means by which to remove the latter from the collective. And as political rhetoric, suicide served as an emotionally charged appeal that ignited a sense of emergency as it flowed between eugenicists, state officials, and the broader public. Eugenic science cannot be understood without attention to eugenic sensibility, which emerged through complex negotiations between local, scientific, and official knowledges about suicide.","Brian, Kathleeen M.",0,,244
615,,"Based on fourteen months of ethnographic fieldwork in población 'La Victoria', a working-class neighbourhood in the city of Santiago, this research describes the everyday lives of its inhabitants (pobladores) in the context of contemporary neoliberal Chile. Although the pobladores' movement had animated Chilean politics since the 1950s, also becoming the main actor in the struggle against the dictatorship, after the return to democracy in 1990 pobladores disappeared from the political arena. Most researchers have proposed that the political absence of pobladores must be understood as an effect of neoliberal modernization—a set of policies implemented during dictatorship and maintained by successive democratic governments after 1990. Their main argument is that a major cultural transformation in Chile has degraded social ties producing a consumeristic, individualistic and depoliticized society. Instead, I propose that pobladores from La Victoria have, despite the transformations, preserved a form of conviviality based on strong affective bonds with kin, friends and neighbours—alongside equally sentimental separations and divisions from others. I argue that, due to their pervasiveness and importance in pobladores' lives, social relationships are the main agents in the articulation of pobladores' ethical frameworks guiding their decisions and actions in life. Pobladores' affective social relationships have allowed them not only to mitigate the side effects of the current neoliberal model, but also to accept, adapt and contest specific aspects of it. In this sense, life in the población has a heterogeneous grammar, a way in which social relations are articulated and disarticulated, activated and de-activated, connecting personal lives to collective processes. This grammar of strong affective ties, terrible betrayals and deep but changing separations and divisions is what I call the 'politics of the everyday life'. This politics of everyday life lies behind apparently very different historical processes, such as the pobladores' struggle against dictatorship in the 1980s and their post-1990 absence from the political arena. I contend that what characterizes the current context is not a lack of politics or a 'depoliticization' but a particular way in which certain pobladores, known as 'políticos'—those interested in collective action in order to produce change in the world—are articulated with or disarticulated from other pobladores in the politics of everyday life in the población.","Briceño, Pablo Agustin",0,,245

The first version exhibits synthetic facial expressions while the second version does not exhibit facial expression (i.e., neutral facial expression). Two groups of students with the same levels of prior knowledge in mathematics utilized two different versions of PIA. The first group-the facial group-utilized a PIA that provides textual and facial expressions feedback (happy, sad, surprise, and neutral facial expressions). The second group-the nonfacial group-used the same software except that PIA only exhibited neutral facial expression. The study showed that the mathematics scores of the students in the facial group significantly improved as compared with those who are in the nonfacial group. The posttest scores of the facial group were found significantly higher than those of the nonfacial group. The study showed that PIA that exhibited synthetic facial expressions improved students' mathematics learning.

Like adults, children older than 9 judged the human-like robot as creepier than the machine-like robot-but younger children did not.

623,The hydrosocial empire: The Karakum River and the Soviet conquest of Central Asia in the 20th century,"Irrigation canals played an essential role in the Soviet conquest of Central Asia in the 20th century. From the time of Lenin onwards, Soviet authorities invested significant human and material capital to dig new irrigation channels in Central Asia's arid deserts, in an effort to subdue native peoples and integrate the region into a command economy. While the Soviet Union's great success with environmental transformation in Central Asia was indeed extraordinary (and notorious), too little attention has been given to the ways that this transformation was assembled. In this contribution to the special issue on Archaeologies of Empire and Environment, I explore an archaeology of the contemporary past of Soviet irrigation in Central Asia, utilizing the insights of new materialism theory. Rather than conceiving of the Soviet imperial project as exclusively human-driven, I consider the multiple other non-human agents that exerted forces on irrigation development and drove its emergence within Central Asia's desert environments. The example of the region's largest irrigation canal is examined. Using a critically-informed, animated GIS, I show how this canal emerged through negotiations between human and non-human agents. In this process, a hydrosocial object the Karakum River was produced that continues to promote the imperial agenda even after the Soviet Union's collapse. The implications for 21st century discourses on environmental degradation and post-Sovietism, and the methodological possibilities of a theoretically-informed, animated GIS for symmetrical, contemporary archaeologies, are also explored.","Brite, E.

624,,"Studies from psychology conclude that “birds of a feather flock together”- or, in other words, people tend to seek companionship with those who have a similar personality to their own. Researchers in the fields of Linguistics and Psychology have found numerous markers that differentiate the dialogue of extroverts from that of introverts. Recent work in Human Computer Interaction has sought to understand the nature of creating and maintaining rapport between humans and Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs). Seeking an interdisciplinary approach that combines knowledge from HCI, Linguistics, and Psychology, I sought to establish whether introverted users report the highest level of rapport when matched with a similarly introverted agent or with an extraverted agent. This understanding can establish a paradigm for creating the highest level of rapport between humans and ECAs from verbal interaction. Questions that I answered include: (1) Will all subjects establish a level of rapport with the extraverted agent? (2) Will extraverted subjects matched with an introverted agent show the lowest level of rapport? (3) If all subjects establish rapport with the extraverted agent, will subjects report the highest level of rapport when interacting with the agent whose extraversion level matches that of the subject?  Two agents representing an extrovert and an introvert were created by manipulating three dialogue features. Using a task-oriented but informal setting, participants interacted with an agent in an immersive environment. Responses from participants to a 16-question survey were reviewed using statistical analysis. New exploratory work using qualitative analysis to four free-response questions in the same survey give new insights into both how humans interpret levels of extraversion, and what this means in terms of human-ECA interactions.

625,Robots with Display Screens: A Robot with a More Humanlike Face Display Is Perceived To Have More Mind and a Better Personality,"It is important for robot designers to know how to make robots that interact effectively with humans. One key dimension is robot appearance and in particular how humanlike the robot should be. Uncanny Valley theory suggests that robots look uncanny when their appearance approaches, but is not absolutely, human. An underlying mechanism may be that appearance affects users' perceptions of the robot's personality and mind. This study aimed to investigate how robot facial appearance affected perceptions of the robot's mind, personality and eeriness. A repeated measures experiment was conducted. 30 participants (14 females and 16 males, mean age 22.5 years) interacted with a Peoplebot healthcare robot under three conditions in a randomized order: the robot had either a humanlike face, silver face, or no-face on its display screen. Each time, the robot assisted the participant to take his/her blood pressure. Participants rated the robot's mind, personality, and eeriness in each condition. The robot with the humanlike face display was most preferred, rated as having most mind, being most humanlike, alive, sociable and amiable. The robot with the silver face display was least preferred, rated most eerie, moderate in mind, humanlikeness and amiability. The robot with the no-face display was rated least sociable and amiable. There was no difference in blood pressure readings between the robots with different face displays. Higher ratings of eeriness were related to impressions of the robot with the humanlike face display being less amiable, less sociable and less trustworthy. These results suggest that the more humanlike a healthcare robot's face display is, the more people attribute mind and positive personality characteristics to it. Eeriness was related to negative impressions of the robot's personality. Designers should be aware that the face on a robot's display screen can affect both the perceived mind and personality of the robot.","Broadbent, E.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0072589,250
632,,"The use of Conversational Agents (CAs) utilizing Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) has been studied in a number of disciplines. Previous research has shown a great deal of promise. It has also documented significant limitations in the abilities of these CAs. Many of these limitations are related specifically to the method employed by AIML to resolve ambiguities in the meaning and context of words. While methods exist to detect and correct common errors in spelling and grammar of sentences and queries submitted by a user, one class of input error that is particularly difficult to detect and correct is the malapropism. In this research a malapropism is defined a ""verbal blunder in which one word is replaced by another similar in sound but different in meaning"" (""malapropism,"" 2013). This research explored the use of alternative methods of correcting malapropisms in sentences input to AIML CAs using measures of Semantic Distance and tri-gram probabilities. Results of these alternate methods were compared against AIML CAs using only the Symbolic Reductions built into AIML. This research found that the use of the two methodologies studied here did indeed lead to a small, but measurable improvement in the performance of the CA in terms of the appropriateness of its responses as classified by human judges. However, it was also noted that in a large number of cases, the CA simply ignored the existence of a malapropism altogether in formulating its responses. In most of these cases, the interpretation and response to the user's input was of such a general nature that one might question the overall efficacy of the AIML engine. The answer to this question is a matter for further study.","Brock, Walter A.",0,,251
633,The stifling silence around scholarly creativity in doctoral education: experiences of students and supervisors in four disciplines,"The demand for developing creativity among doctoral students is found in a number of educational policies all over the world. Yet, earlier studies on Swedish doctoral education suggest that doctoral students' creativity is not always encouraged. Based on a critical hermeneutic approach and cases in four different disciplines, the aim of this study was therefore (1) to explore different shapes of doctoral students' creativity in Swedish doctoral education and (2) to reveal and find possible explanations to some of the conditions stifling doctoral students' scholarly creativity. Interview data was collected from 28 participants, constituting 14 dyads of students and supervisors in four disciplines. Through hermeneutic interpretative analysis of the disciplinary cases, the results show that creativity kept on playing in musical performance, was an unexpected guest in pedagogical work, was captured in frames in philosophy and put on hold in psychiatry. Across the cases, students' scholarly creativity was essentially encapsulated in silence. This silence seemed to emanate from controlling intellectual, political and economic agendas that enabled stifling conditions of the students' scholarly creativity, where it was as follows: restricted by scholarly traditions, embodying supervisors' power and unrequested in practice. Based on these findings, the article ends in suggestions for preventing such conditions, holding that it is important to establish a discourse on scholarly creativity in doctoral education, to view doctoral students as capable creative agents and to actually ask for their scholarly creativity.","Brodin, E.

634,,"Synthetic biology has presented engineers with a fascinating opportunity: can we understand the principles of our origins – animal embryonic development – by re-engineering it in the laboratory? I investigate, from an engineer's perspective, some of problems that arise in developing geometric form in a deformable substrate. More abstractly, I attack the problem of establishing spatial patterns, when rearranging and deforming parts of the system is inherent to the process. Deformable, foam-like cellular surfaces are developed as a model for embryonic epithelia (polarized cellular sheets), one of the principal tissue types in early animal development. I explore ways in which simple agent programs running within the individual cells can collectively craft large-scale structures. The mechanical properties of the substrate prove crucial to the patterning process. In such a distributed, heterogeneous substrate, little can be assumed about the progress of time. In one branch of my work, I develop patterning techniques where convergence is transparently and locally detectable, drawing insights from clockless digital circuits and casting the problem as distributed constraint propagation. In another branch of work, I avoid the problem of timing by making all patterns self-correcting. In self-correcting patterning, I attempt to understand ""canalization"" – how development is naturally robust to perturbations. I formulate a model for regional patterning, inspired by regeneration experiments in developmental biology, and using mathematical principles from classical models of magnetic domains and phase separation. The problem again becomes a form of distributed constraint propagation, now using soft constraints. I explore some of the resulting phenomena and then apply the mechanism to crafting surface geometries, where self-correction makes the process robust to both damage and self-deformation. I conclude with a look at how this naturally leads to an example of partial redundancy – multiple systems that partly but not completely overlap in function – yielding confusing responses to the effects of virtual knock-out experiments, reminiscent of the confusing behavior of knock-out experiments in biology.

635,Enjoyment or involvement? Affective-motivational mediation during learning from a complex computerized simulation,"There is increased interest in augmenting multimedia instructional materials to elevate learners' positive affective-motivational states in order to improve learning. However, these efforts have only been partly successful and mediational effects of positive affective motivational states have not always been established. In this study, university students (N = 65) from the Czech Republic, a country where beer brewing is a source of national pride, were informed that they would either study how to brew beer (high intrinsic motivation condition) or how to prepare a citrate substrate (low intrinsic motivation condition). The 90-min simulation environment used for learning was about beer brewing in both cases, with superficial changes to instructions and graphics to disguise the topic manipulation. Generalized positive affect, overall enjoyment, flow, and learning involvement were higher in the beer brewing condition (Cohen's d = 0.44-0.87) as were learning gains when measured immediately (retention: d = 0.48; transfer: d = 0.46) and a month later (retention: d = 0.66; transfer: d = 0.62). However, only learning involvement and flow positively mediated the influence of the topic manipulation on immediate learning outcomes; there were no mediation effects on delayed learning outcomes after co-varying out immediate learning. The findings corroborate results from extant studies on the importance of topic interest in learning from instructional texts. They also indicate that affective motivational mediation is one, but not the only, mechanism by which topic-based intrinsic motivation manipulations influence learning and that induced positive affective motivational states can be differentially related or unrelated to learning.

In this paper, we present a computational model of this ability. The model provides a possible explanation of contradictory results from experimental psychology related to this ability, namely explanation of why some experiments have reproduced the so-called ""disorientation effect"" while others have failed to do so. Additionally, in contrast to other computational models of various aspects of spatial cognition, our model is integrated within an intelligent virtual agent. Thus, on a more general level, this paper also demonstrates that it is possible to use intelligent virtual agents as a powerful research tool in computational cognitive sciences.

646,,"The primary focus of this dissertation is the synthesis and testing of cyclotriveratrylenes (CTV) as potential biomedical molecular imaging contrast agents. CTVs are bowl shaped molecules that have a hydrophobic pocket capable of reversibly binding Xenon-129 (129Xe) gas, a spin ½ noble gas, which is paramagnetic and produces a signal when a strong magnetic field is applied to it. These CTVs then create two pools of 129Xe which produce distinct signals in an NMR scan. The creation of the two pools of 129Xe is necessary for the application of an imaging technique named HyperCEST, Hyperpolarized Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer, which increases the sensitivity of the scan by up to 10,000 times. The ease of synthesis for the CTV as well as its ability to be conjugated to biochemical ligands should expedite the synthesis of targeted 129Xe biosensors. The last chapter deals with, Process oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL), which is a pedagogical method that has demonstrated improvement in student performance, increases in attendance, and decreases in failing grades and withdrawals. A three-year study was conducted where attendance was mandatory for all students across both the POGIL and traditional lecture formats to measure the effect of POGIL. There was a decrease in the standard deviation of exam grades in the POGIL lecture sections however there was no statistically significant change in grades received by the students. This is in keeping with previous studies that have found a decrease in D, F, and W's.","Brown, Joseph",0,,256
647,An investigation of the effects of a speech-restructuring treatment for stuttering on the distribution of intervals of phonation,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether stuttering reductions following the instatement phase of a speech-restructuring treatment for adults were accompanied by reductions in the frequency of short intervals of phonation (Pis). The study was prompted by the possibility that reductions in the frequency of short PIs is the mechanism underlying such reductions in stuttering. Method: The distribution of PIs was determined for seven adults who stutter, before and immediately after the intensive phase of a speech-restructuring treatment program. Audiovisual recordings of conversational speech were made on both assessment occasions, with Pis recorded with an accelerometer. Results: All seven participants had much lower levels of stuttering after treatment but these were associated with reductions in the frequency of short PIs for only four of them. For the other three participants, two showed no change in frequency of short Pis, while for the other participant the frequency of short Pis actually increased. Conclusions: Stuttering reduction with speech-restructuring treatment can co-occur with reduction in the frequency of short PIs. However, the latter does not appear necessary for this reduction in stuttering to occur. Thus, speech-restructuring treatment must have other, or additional, treatment agents for stuttering to reduce. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

653,,"This dissertation explores the relationship between migrant caregivers and their employers in Israel. Based on interviews I conducted with migrant caregivers from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and India, and their Jewish-Israeli citizen-employers, I illustrate how the daily glances and exchanges comprising this relationship are shaped by the transnational racialized, gendered, and sexualized division of labor and ethno-racially hierarchical citizenship law. I also examine the many ways migrant caregivers navigate debt bondage, Israeli laws and policies legally “binding” them to their employers, and de jure exclusion from the body politic. I therefore contextualize the reproductive labor done by migrant caregivers within Israel’s broader ethno-racial Zionist project of nation-building, and the ongoing occupation and colonization of Palestinian land. Throughout my dissertation, I highlight how networks of mutual aid, service provision, and community-building unfold at the local and transnational levels, considering the implications for transnational feminist solidarity. I thus treat Israel/Palestine as a case study for rethinking how the segmentation of transnational labor markets and the privatization of labor recruitment under neoliberal forms of governance intersect in particular ways with a de jure ethno-racially hierarchical citizenship regime. In undertaking this analysis, I foreground the affective, relational components of migrant labor and citizenship in addition to the political and legal. This project contributes to transnational feminist scholarship on migration and the racialization of labor and to empirically grounded theories of transnational care migration. It also intervenes in debates about nationalism, occupation, and settler colonialism in Israel/Palestine by providing an intersectional analysis of legal exclusions and state violence as they differentially unfold across lines of gender, ethnicity, race, class, religion, nationalism, and citizenship status. The introduction situates the migrant caregiver/citizen-employer relationship in Israel/Palestine within the broader context of domestic and care migration transnationally, and the neoliberal turn to labor outsourcing in Israel. It also addresses the mutually constitutive relationship between citizenship and labor as it has unfolded within the context of Israeli settler colonialism, and considers the impact of Israel’s perpetual state of emergency on the daily lives of migrant caregivers. Finally, I examine the racialized, gendered, and sexualized construction of migrant caregivers by migrant-sending countries, private recruitment agencies, and Israeli employers. Chapter one explores migrant caregivers’ political orientations towards the Israeli government, looking in particular at interviewees’ narratives about the government’s treatment of Palestinians and Eritrean and Sudanese refugees. I argue that the support migrant caregivers demonstrate for the Israeli government and the Zionist project are partially explained by the high cost of political dissent in Israel. I also examine how migrant networks of service provision and community organizing publicly represent themselves so as to appear, out of necessity, non-threatening to the Jewish body politic. Chapter two addresses migrant caregivers’ experiences working inside Jewish-Israeli homes, and their strategies for navigating debt bondage, Israel’s “Slavery Law,” and for gaining greater control over the work process. In doing so I treat the household as a site of race, class, and gender conflict that reflects, perpetuates, and contests hierarchical social relations in Israel/Palestine. I illustrate how migrant caregivers are at once treated as intimate members of the family and as “foreign” interlopers, a pattern reflecting the state’s legal classification of migrant caregivers more broadly. While their treatment as workers performing an exceptionally intimate form of labor creates the conditions for task expansion and under-compensation, their constitu","Brown, Rachel H.",0,,258
654,,"In the last decade entertainment-education has emerged as a key educational approach to promoting personal and social change amongst the general population in mass media contexts such as radio and television. Audiences of entertainment-education are commonly presented with educational messages embedded in soap-opera style dramas that are designed to prompt individuals to explore their values and beliefs and make positive choices about their actions and behaviours. Its use with learners in higher education is however limited and there is a paucity of research regarding its transferability to the online learning environment. In order to understand how nurses learn through online entertainment-education in the higher education context I interviewed nine registered nurses who had studied in these circumstances using Interview Plus technique. The interviews were taped, transcribed and subsequently analysed using Smith and Osborne’s (2003) steps for Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Parasocial learning emerged from nurse learners’ experience of entertainment-education as an active, reflective response to an emotional encounter between a nurse learner and an online character. It promoted changes in nurse learners’ attitudes leading them to act as change agents in the clinical environment. Alternatively nurse learners engaged in monophonic learning. This unilateral approach appeared lead to a reduction in their communicative capacity and their sense of therapeutic agency. The online learning environment appeared to enhance the experience of learning through entertainment-education by facilitating social support for learning. Nurse learners were able to increase their social capital through online social networking; a sense of identity concealment in the form of a virtual mask appeared to liberate them to participate. Some nurse learners however seemed to experience a sense of identity revelation in the form of a virtual window which inhibited their willingness to contribute. By promoting parasocial learning it seems entertainment-education has the potential to enrich the nursing curriculum. It places the patient voice at the centre of the educational experience and stimulates nurse learners to shape care. It seems entertainment-education can be usefully adopted in higher education with nurse learners. The online learning environment appears to be an appropriate media for learning through-entertainment-education. It affords an increase in social capital through meaningful social interaction and promotes freedom to participate through a sense of identity concealment. As liberation through identity concealment was not a universal experience approaches to identity concealment/revelation would need to be carefully considered. Monophonic learning emerged as an alternative experience of learning through entertainment-education. As the factors that influence the adoption of monophonic learning remain unclear they would benefit from further exploration.","Brownlow, Rosalind",0,,259
655,Equity of Incentives: Agent-Based Explorations of How Social Networks Influence the Efficacy of Programs to Promote Solar Adoption,"Agent-based models are used to explore how social networks influence the effectiveness of governmental programs to promote the adoption of solar photovoltaics (solar PV) by residential households. This paper examines how a common characteristic of social networks, known as network segregation, can dampen the indirect benefits of solar incentive programs that arise from peer effects. Peer effects cause an agent to be more likely to adopt a technology if they are socially connected to other adopters. Due to network segregation, programs that target relatively affluent agents can generate rapid increases in overall adoption levels but at the cost of increasing disparities in access to solar technology between rich and poor communities. These dynamics are explored through theoretical agent-based models of solar adoption within hypothetical social systems. The effectiveness of three types of solar incentive programs, the feed-in tariff, leasing programs, and seeding programs, is explored. Even though these programs promote rapid adoption in the short term, results demonstrate that network segregation can create serious distributional justice problems in the long term for some programs. The distributional justice effects are particularly severe with the feed-in tariff. Overall, this paper provides an illustration of how agent-based models may be used to evaluate and experiment with policy interventions in a virtual space, which enhances the scientific basis of policymaking.","Brugger, H.

Our project aims at building believable embodied conversational characters to play the role of suspects in a serious game for learning interrogation strategies. The main question we ask is: do human judges agree on the way they perceive the various aspects of stance taking, such as friendliness and dominance? Four types of stances were acted by eight amateur actors. Short recordings were shown in an online survey to subjects who were asked to describe them using a selection of a number of adjectives. Results of this annotation task are reported in this paper. We explain how we computed the inter-rater agreement with Krippendorff's alpha statistics using a set theoretical distance metric. Results show that for some of the stance types observers agreed more than for others. Some actors are better than others, but validity (recognizing the intended stance) and inter-rater agreement do not always go hand in hand. We further investigate the effect the expertise of actors has on the perception of the stance that is acted. We compare the fragments from amateur actors to fragments from professional actors taken from popular TV-shows.","Bruijnes, M.",0,10.1007/s12193-015-0189-0,261

The present topic emphasizes the parallel development of concepts in social neurosciences and in other domains such as computer science, affective computing, virtual reality development, and even hardware technologies. While several researchers in neurosciences pointed out the necessity to consider naturalistic social cognition, the second person perspective, social interaction and reciprocity, both computer and software developments allowed more and more realistic real-time models of our environment and of virtual humans capable of some interaction with users. A new convergence between scientific disciplines might occur from which it is tricky to predict the outcomes in terms of new concepts, methods, and uses. Although this convergence meets ongoing societal changes it comes with several difficulties for which the current Frontiers in’ topic strives to bring some positive answers, and to provide both theoretical arguments and experimental examples.

Using a multidimensional conceptual framework including Black masculinity, Fictive Kinship Network, Culturally Relevant Pedagogy, and Critical Race Theory, this study captured counterstories of culturally relevant Black male kindergarten teachers. The counterstories were used as a methodological tool to convey major themes which demonstrated Black male kindergarten teachers’ ability to positively influence Black male kindergarteners academically using culturally relevant teaching. Findings revealed that Black male kindergarten teachers perceived themselves to be fictive brothers/fathers who fostered collaboration and built solidarity with the Black community to academically and socially support Black male kindergarteners in early childhood classrooms. Black male kindergarten teachers were also found to be pedagogues of culturally relevant classroom management practices. Black male kindergartners reported that their Black male teachers used hip-hop, sports, and mathematics literacies as instructional approaches. Black family members perceived Black male kindergarten teachers as Role Models who represented positive images of Black manhood for their Black male kindergarteners. They also regarded Black male kindergarten teachers as Role Models who minimized Black parents’ distrust for White female teachers and other White educational professionals. The findings of this study may be useful for: (a) understanding the need for the recruitment and retention of culturally relevant Black male teachers to early childhood classrooms; (b) further understanding the need for specific preparation in using hip-hop, sports, and critical literacies as instructional tools in early childhood classrooms; and (c) drawing from the wisdom and wealth of Black family members to inform pedagogical practices in early childhood classrooms.","Bryan, Nathaniel",0,,263
668,Analyzing stakeholders' workshop dialogue for evidence of social learning,"After much debate and synthesis, social learning scholarship is entering an era of empirical research. Given the range across individual-, network-, and systems-level perspectives and scales, clear documentation of social learning processes is critical for making claims about social learning outcomes and their impacts. Past studies have relied on participant recall and concept maps to document perceptions of social learning process and outcome. Using an individual-centric perspective and importing ideas from communication and psychology on question-answer learning through conversational agents, we contribute an expanded conceptual framework and qualitative analytical strategy for assessing stakeholder dialogue for evidence of social learning. We observed stakeholder dialogue across five workshops coordinated for the Bruneau-Owyhee Sage-Grouse Habitat Project (BOSH) in Owyhee County, Idaho, USA. Participants' dialogue was audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for cross-case patterns. Deductive and inductive coding techniques were applied to illuminate cognitive, relational, and epistemic dimensions of learning and topics of learning. A key finding supports our inclusion of the epistemic dimension and highlights a need for future research: although some participants articulated epistemic positions, they did not challenge each other to share sources or justify factual claims. These findings align with previous research suggesting that, in addition to considering diversity and representation (who is at the table), we should pay more attention to how participants talk, perhaps prompting specific patterns of speech as we endeavor to draw causal connections between social learning processes and outcomes.","Brymer, A.

671,,"This dissertation investigates a perennial problem in teacher education: the theory-practice divide. There has always been a rift between theory and practice; however, this gap and the responses to it take on different shapes and meanings based on the reforms, politics, and structures of the time. For example, in the 1980s and 90s Professional Development Schools sought to close this gap (Darling-Hammond, 1994). In the 2000s, this gap became a flashpoint for targeted attacks on university teacher education on the one side, and on eased-entry teacher preparation alternatives on the other (Cochran-Smith & Fries, 2005a). Currently, many reform circles are trying to address the theory-practice divide (and the various concerns it engenders) by advocating what is called a Residency Model (Berry. Montgomery, & Snyder 2008). This study investigates how two teacher education programs, both with social justice agendas, navigated this divide. I identified two teacher education programs in California, one residency and one traditional, and using stratified random sampling selected several pre-service teachers, practicing teacher educators, and cooperating teachers from each site, and then collected longitudinal data over the course of one year. I employed an ethnographic, ecological analysis of program structure, teacher educator practice, and pre-service teacher development as sets of intertwined learning processes. My findings illustrate how the historical structure of apprenticeship made it difficult for both of the teacher education programs to meet their goals of developing social justice, change agents. The combination of the apprenticeship structure and a climate of accountability privileged the performance aspects of teaching, encouraging pre-service teachers to attend to the technical and visible aspects of teaching, rather than the more complex and nuanced aspects of teaching. Pre-service teachers experienced their training as fragmented, and pieced together a their teacher identity through a process of bricolage, which made it difficult to develop cohesive teaching philosophy aligned with the program’s constructivists and social justice goals. These findings complicate the hyper-practice-oriented emphasis of recent teacher education scholarship by demonstrating how a practice-based program, in fact, marginalizes coursework and professional thought and may inadvertently make it difficult for the field to develop critical-minded, social justice educators. Instead, this research suggests that teacher education should centralize the institutional divide between university and school and use it as a pedagogical object. This could support pre-service teachers in developing a cohesive set of teaching principles, which they can use to evaluate the efficacy of their own developing practice as well as the many mandates, reforms, and strategies they will encounter as PK-12 educators.","Buchanan, Rebecca",0,,265
672,Simulation within simulation for agent decision-making: Theoretical foundations from cognitive science to operational computer model,"This article deals with artificial intelligence models inspired from cognitive science. The scope of this paper is the simulation of the decision-making process for virtual entities. The theoretical framework consists of concepts from the use of internal behavioral simulation for human decision-making. Inspired from such cognitive concepts, the contribution consists in a computational framework that enables a virtual entity to possess an autonomous world of simulation within the simulation. It can simulate itself (using its own model of behavior) and simulate its environment (using its representation of other entities). The entity has the ability to anticipate using internal simulations, in complex environments where it would be extremely difficult to use formal proof methods. Comparing the prediction and the original simulation, its predictive models are improved through a learning process. Illustrations of this model are provided through two implementations. First illustration is an example showing a shepherd, his herd and dogs. The dog simulates the sheep's behavior in order to make predictions testing different strategies. Second, an artificial 3D juggler plays in interaction with virtual jugglers, humans and robots. For this application, the juggler predicts the behavior of balls in the air and uses prediction to coordinate its behavior in order to juggle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

What motivated this work was the desire to under stand how this company wielded its power through the different agents responsible for taking decisions on the behaviour of the users within this virtual world. Simultaneously, this research went deeply into the type of lessons learnt by users as to citizenship springing from the behaviour rules imposed by the company owning this space. In order to understand what young people were learning about the wielding of power, and the prototype model citizen within the virtual world, we analyse the systems of rules that govern what users can or cannot do, and we proceed to analyse the contents of spaces in which users will talk about the reasons why the company had expelled them from Habbo Hotel. The findings of this work reveal that the application of rules on the part of the company results in the experience inside this virtual world not always being fun, democratic, creative, participative or completely satisfying. This thus questions some of the main arguments proposed by different writers on these new forms of communication.","Buckingham, D.",0,10.3916/c40-2013-02-05,267
677,,"The social dimension of learning informs much of the current research and development of learning technologies. In some lines of research, the learning tool itself provides the social dimension, often in the form of an intelligent virtual agent. In other lines of research, a learning tool provides an environment in which multiple human learners can collaborate. Integrating these lines of research, this dissertation makes progress toward answering a question that demands increased attention: How can designers of learning technologies leverage the social capabilities of intelligent virtual agents to support collaborative learning? Specifically, I examine the effects of virtual learning companions on the discourse of pairs of middle school students collaborating in a game-based learning environment for computer science education, with a focus on equity. To investigate this line of research, I crafted multiple individual episodes with virtual learning companions, designed for specific locations in the game where students could most benefit from their presence. Through their conversations with the virtual learning companions, I hypothesized that a wider range of students would benefit from productive learning experiences, and that students would collaborate more equitably. These hypotheses emerge out of prior research that has shown the benefits—particularly with respect to equity—that virtual learning companions can have for individual students. To investigate equitable collaboration among pairs of students, this work looks at the dialogue of student pairs as they collaboratively interacted in the learning environment. Following established methods for analyzing discourse, I have annotated transcripts of the student pairs by manually tagging each utterance. These coded transcripts allow for the investigation of research questions concerning the impact of the virtual learning companions, including how the impact differs based on student characteristics such as gender and prior computing experience. They also lead to insights on the general nature of equitable collaboration within game-based learning experiences for middle school students. The quantitative and qualitative analyses included in this dissertation provide the groundwork for much future research in the fields of virtual agents, game-based learning, computer-supported collaborative learning, learning sciences and computer science education.","Buffum, Philip Sheridan",1,,268
678,The Importance of Attribution: Connecting Online Travel Communities with Online Travel Agents,"Using attribution theory, this study examines 207 travel consumers' views of five online travel communities (namely, Lonelyplanet, Travellerspoint, Tripadvisor, VirtualTourist, and Wayn) and their intentions to patronize one of the websites' affiliates, Expedia. As a starting point, customers form an opinion of the community website itself based on communication quality and service quality. A high-quality experience, which includes interaction with other community members, engenders loyalty to the community website. With that base, the study tested three aspects of attributional responsiveness (evaluative satisfaction, cognitive loyalty, and affective belonging) and found that they could act as mediating factors to convey favorable attribution to the online communities' affiliates, as represented by Expedia. Thus, a high standard of information and service will receive a favorable response from the online travel community, and that response can then be transferred to the community's affiliates, in the form of purchases and return visits.","Bui, M.

Animated scenarios are designed with 3D virtual agents in order to test 3 conditions: In the still condition, the narrative content was accompanied by emotional facial expressions without any body movements; in the idle condition, emotionally neutral body movements were introduced; and in the congruent condition, emotional body postures congruent with the character's facial expressions were displayed. Those conditions were examined by 27 subjects, and their impact on the viewers' attentional and emotional processes was assessed. The results highlight the importance of the contextual information to emotion recognition and irony interpretation. It is also shown that both idle and emotional postures improve the detection of emotional expressions. Moreover, emotional postures increase the perceived intensity of emotions and the realism of the animations.","Buisine, S.",0,10.1080/10447318.2013.802200,271

Studies suggest these processes are affected by the human/non-human nature of the agent the task is shared with. In two experiments (Experiments 1 and 2), we measured the Joint Simon Effect (JSE) as an index of action discrimination, using a virtual version of the joint go/no-go task in which the task was shared with a virtual robotic vs. human hand. Furthermore, both experiments tested whether the JSE was affected by sensorimotor experience during which the participant manipulated the virtual robotic hand via an exoskeleton (vs. passive observation of movements of the virtual robotic hand). Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1, except that prior to the joint action task, participants were informed about the robotic vs. human nature of the two virtual hands (no such information was given in Experiment 1). Both experiments demonstrated a significant JSE, which did not differ between robotic and human partner. Analysis of the results further indicates that the JSE obtained in the robotic condition was not modified after manipulating the virtual robotic hand. These results suggest that the human vs. non-human appearance of the partner is not a determinant of joint action performance in virtual settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

694,A non-mentalistic cause-based heuristic in human social evaluations,"In situations where an agent unintentionally causes harm to a victim, the agent's (harmless) intention typically carries more weight than his/her (harmful) causal role. Therefore, healthy adults typically judge leniently agents responsible for an accident. Using animated cartoons, we show, however, that in the presence of a difficult concurrent task, this result is reversed: the agent's harmless intention is given less weight than her harmful causal role, inducing participants to judge harshly the accidental agent. This was found even though cognitive load did not selectively impair the detection of intentions over causal roles. Not only is this finding evidence that the social/moral evaluation system relies on two dissociable components, but it also demonstrates that these components are asymmetrical, the causal component being more intuitive than the intentional component, and the full integration of the two requiring central cognitive resources.

698,Application of Expectancy Violations Theory to communication with and judgments about embodied agents during a decision-making task,"Because users treat embodied agents (EAs) as social actors, users hold expectations about human-to-EA communication (HtEAC) similar to those in human-to-human communication. This study extends Expectancy Violations Theory (EVT) to examine how different forms of interfaces that confirm or violate user expectations affect the communication process, social judgments, ability to influence, and accuracy of recall associated with HtEAC. Positive violations of expectancy are acts or characteristics of the EA that are unexpected but evaluated favorably by the human partner. Results suggest that when the EA deviates from expectations, effects on the HtEAC process and related outcomes can be more pronounced. EAs evaluated as positive violations had more favorable effects on task attractiveness than other human or EA interaction partners. As predicted by EVT, EA interactions that were positively evaluated elicited more perceived connectedness, feelings of being understood/receptivity, and dependability than those EA interactions evaluated negatively. However, negative violations did not produce worse outcomes than negative confirmations. EVT offers a useful lens for examining the communication effects of HtEAC and points to benefits of creating EAs that evoke positive violations of expectancy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This project examined whether a Virtual Interactive Training Agent (ViTA) system would improve job interviewing skills in individuals with autism and developmental disabilities (N = 32). A linear mixed model was employed to evaluate adjusted least square mean differences of means scores on the Marino Interview Assessment Scale (MIAS) across different time points. The mean score of MIAS over all questions increased between the first ViTA session and the final face-to-face interview. Participants developed the ability to identify strengths, self-promote, self-advocate, answer situational questions, and respond to behavioral/social questions as measured by multiple evaluations using the MIAS.","Burke, S.

714,A reappraisal of the uncanny valley: categorical perception or frequency-based sensitization?,"The uncanny valley (UCV) hypothesis describes a non-linear relationship between perceived human-likeness and affective response. The ""uncanny valley"" refers to an intermediate level of human-likeness that is associated with strong negative affect. Recent studies have suggested that the uncanny valley might result from the categorical perception of human-like stimuli during identification. When presented with stimuli sharing human-like traits, participants attempt to segment the continuum in ""human"" and ""non-human"" categories. Due to the ambiguity of stimuli located at a category boundary, categorization difficulty gives rise to a strong, negative affective response. Importantly, researchers who have studied the UCV in terms of categorical perception have focused on categorization responses rather than affective ratings. In the present study, we examined whether the negative affect associated with the UCV might be explained in terms of an individual's degree of exposure to stimuli. In two experiments, we tested a frequency-based model against a categorical perception model using a category-learning paradigm. We manipulated the frequency of exemplars that were presented to participants from two categories during a training phase. We then examined categorization and affective responses functions, as well as the relationship between categorization and affective responses. Supporting previous findings, categorization responses suggested that participants acquired novel category structures that reflected a category boundary. These category structures appeared to influence affective ratings of eeriness. Crucially, participants' ratings of eeriness were additionally affected by exemplar frequency. Taken together, these findings suggest that the UCV is determined by both categorical properties as well as the frequency of individual exemplars retained in memory.","Burleigh, T.

716,Does the uncanny valley exist? An empirical test of the relationship between eeriness and the human likeness of digitally created faces,"The uncanny valley theory (UVT) (Mori, 1970) proposes that when stimuli are defined by a near-perfect resemblance to humans they cause people to experience greater negative affect relative to when they have perfect human likeness (HL) or little to no HL. Empirical research to support this non-linear relationship between negative affect and HL has been inconclusive, however, and a satisfactory causal explanation has not yet emerged to explain existing findings. In two studies, we examined the relationship between HL and eeriness using digital human faces. First, we examined the relationship between HL and eeriness while controlling for extraneous variation in stimulus appearance. We created two HL continua by manipulating the facial proportions and polygon count of several digital human models. Second, we proposed and tested two causal hypotheses regarding the uncanny valley phenomenon that we refer to as category conflict and feature atypicality. We created two additional HL continua by manipulating the skin coloration and category membership of models. Across these continua we introduced an atypical feature. Our results suggest that HL is linearly related to emotional response, except under conditions where HL varies by category membership, suggesting that previous empirical findings might be explained as a category conflict.

719,Team-based curriculum design as an agent of change,"Curriculum design in higher education environments, namely the consideration of aims, learning outcomes, syllabus, pedagogy and assessment, can often be ad hoc and driven by informal cultural habits. Academics with disciplinary expertise may be resistant to (or ignorant of) pedagogical approaches beyond existing practice. In an environment where there is a need to develop online activities for students, one way to counter this friction is through a team-based approach underpinned by design-thinking. A design-thinking team brings together content, pedagogical and technical expertise to examine and resolve curriculum design issues. This paper explores a number of case studies in which such teams developed units of study and programmes for online delivery. The paper looks at the possibilities that the team approach can be a vehicle to instigate cultural change within and beyond the team; that is, from an individualist to a collective approach and ownership of the curriculum and its design, maintenance and continuous improvement.","Burrell, A.

723,,"Introduction: Help4Mood is an interactive system with an embodied virtual agent (avatar) to assist in self-monitoring of patients receiving treatment for depression. Help4Mood supports self-report and biometric monitoring and includes elements of cognitive behavioural therapy.We aimed to evaluate system use and acceptability, to explore likely recruitment and retention rates in a clinical trial and to obtain an estimate of potential treatment response with a view to conducting a future randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods: We conducted a pilot RCT of Help4Mood in three centres, in Romania, Spain and Scotland, UK. Patients with diagnosed depression (major depressive disorder) and current mild/moderate depressive symptoms were randomised to use the system for four weeks in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone. Results: Twenty-seven individuals were randomised and follow-up data were obtained from 21 participants (12/13 Help4Mood, 9/14 TAU). Half of participants randomised to Help4Mood used it regularly (more than 10 times); none used it every day. Acceptability varied between users. Some valued the emotional responsiveness of the system, while others found it too repetitive. Intention to treat analysis showed a small difference in change of Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-2) scores (Help4Mood –5.7 points, TAU –4.2). Post-hoc on-treatment analysis suggested that participants who used Help4Mood regularly experienced a median change in BDI-2 of –8 points. Conclusion: Help4Mood is acceptable to some patients receiving treatment for depression although none used it as regularly as intended. Changes in depression symptoms in individuals who used the system regularly reached potentially meaningful levels.

735,Emergent learning focused teachers and their ecological complexity worldview,"Although Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU) has gained ground, pedagogical models are sustainable only when situated in a comprehensive worldview and consistent epistemology. After considering the five values orientations offered by Jewett, Bain, and Ennis, the authors conclude that ecological integration offers a useful starting point in this regard, but taking this a step further, they offer a worldview that they call ecological complexity, woven together from social constructivism, complexity, and ecological thinking. Since the authors argue that teachers who espouse this worldview focus on emergent learning, they have coined the term emergent learning focused (ELF) teacher to describe the pedagogical approaches that might result. These encourage the spontaneous play seen in the schoolyard, playground, or village green as opposed to work in the factory. ELF teachers encourage learners to develop holistically as they construct meaning, positioning themselves in the ecosphere of which they form an integral part. The authors apply ecological complexity to Inventing Games, in which learners invent and refine games within the TGfU classifications. They argue that as learners work together to invent and develop ownership of their games, they engage in a cognitive apprenticeship that prepares them for life in the wider community. Specifically, learners develop core social and emotional learning skills in a process that the authors have termed situated ethics. As game play structures and constraints work in balance to produce disturbances, learners adapt and game play evolves. Learners learn to navigate these adaptations and evolutions by creating sustainable democratic processes. Teachers who operate from an ecological complexity worldview see all educational agents-learners, teachers, administrators, curriculum, school, community, and culture-as parts of a sustainable learning system. The authors conclude by offering the building blocks they believe might move this system closer to sustainability in games education.","Butler, J. I.",0,10.1080/13573322.2012.680435,280
738,The influence of a bystander agent's beliefs on children's and adults' decision-making process,"The ability to attribute and represent others' mental states (e.g., beliefs; so-called ""theory of mind"") is essential for participation in human social interaction. Despite a considerable body of research using tasks in which protagonists in the participants' attentional focus held false or true beliefs, the question of automatic belief attribution to bystander agents has received little attention. In the current study, we presented adults and 6-year-olds (N = 92) with an implicit computer-based avoidance false-belief task in which participants were asked to place an object into one of three boxes. While doing so, we manipulated the beliefs of an irrelevant human-like or non-human-like bystander agent who was visible on the screen. Importantly, the bystander agent's beliefs were irrelevant for solving the task. Still, children's decision making was significantly influenced by the bystander agent's beliefs even if this was a non-human-like self-propelled object. Such an influence did not become obvious in adults' deliberate decisions but occurred only in their reaction times, which suggests that they also processed the bystander agent's beliefs but were able to suppress the influence of such beliefs on their behavior regulation. The results of a control study (N = 53) ruled out low-level explanations and confirmed that self-propelledness of agents is a necessary factor for belief attribution to occur. Thus, not only do humans spontaneously ascribe beliefs to self-propelled bystander agents, but those beliefs even influence meaningful decisions in children. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

740,The effects of physical luminance on colour discrimination in dogs: A cautionary tale,"Due to the composition of the cone photoreceptors in the retina of dogs, it has been proposed they might demonstrate human-like red/green colour blindness. However, some assessments have shown that dogs may still be able to distinguish between red and green. This suggests that dogs may be differentiating between the two colours on the basis of their brightness. To further explore this issue, the present investigation tested dogs' abilities to differentiate between two colours at different physical luminance levels. Seven dogs were trained on a simultaneous size discrimination task in which two circles were presented on a monitor. The colours of the circles were then varied such that dogs would choose one stimulus if they could discriminate between two colours and a different stimulus if they could not. Four experiments were conducted. The first presented dogs with yellow, blue, green, and red stimuli at their maximum red, green, and blue (RGB) values. All seven dogs were equally proficient at discriminating between red and green, yellow and blue, and black and white stimuli as no difference in performance was observed (p = 0.52). In Experiments 2-4, the four colours were presented with equal physical luminance across three different intensities. All seven dogs successfully discriminated between all four colours when the colours were isoluminant at 34.6 cd/m(2) as no differences in performance was observed (p = 0.10). When presented with isoluminant stimuli at 41.9 cd/m(2), a difference was observed between conditions, with the dogs failing to detect red stimuli presented on a green background compared to the achromatic controls (p = 0.03). When presented with stimuli at 49.3 cd/m(2), a difference was again observed between conditions, but this time the dogs were unable to detect blue stimuli presented on a yellow background compared to the achromatic controls (p < 0.01). These findings demonstrate that luminance levels of stimuli can affect colour discrimination and what dogs are able to see on computer screens. These results have important implications in how cognition is studied in dogs through the use of presenting stimuli on monitors.","Byosiere, S. E.",0,10.1016/j.applanim.2019.01.004,282

This study analyzes the strategic alliance mechanism in the ICT industry, taking the view that active strategic alliances should be pursued for co-evolution between the companies in an open ecosystem. Based on previous studies and expert opinions, the objectives of a strategic alliance are classified into main evaluation categories such as strategy-oriented, cost-oriented, resource-oriented and learning-oriented, and the detailed subcategories are presented. Through an analysis of the ecosystem of the ICT industry, multimedia contents (production, distribution), platform (cloud computing, mobile cloud computing), network (wired network, wireless network), device (home electronics, mobile) are identified as the agents to be analyzed. By applying the analytic network process (ANP) based on the above, the priority of the objectives of strategic alliances in the ICT industry is determined by the agent. This study is expected to promote the development of a business model and co-opetition between the companies to create sustainable competitive advantages in the future open ecosystem, and to contribute to the creation of corporate and national profits.","Byun, J.",0,10.1007/s11042-017-5059-1,283
747,,"Three-dimensional (3D) modeling of human anatomy has been extensively studied and used in various industries over the last several decades. With applications in surgical training and simulation, forensics, and human animation in entertainment, it is no surprise to learn that a multitude of high fidelity 3D computer aided design (CAD) models of human body parts are readily available to the public. Due to the nature of some of these applications, it is the prevailing notion that these models should be able to reproduce every motion and function of its human counterpart and therefore typically exhibit a large workspace/degrees-of-freedom (DOF). It is the hypothesis of this project that a combination of a number of sub-workspaces is the best option to reproduce a large percentage of the clinically desired motions for rehabilitation of the upper extremity. Existing CAD models of a human arm were studied and evaluated to create a reduced DOF, anthropomorphic arm model which is able to accomplish the following motions used in occupational therapy of the human arm: reach, shrug, and hunch. The performance of the reduced DOF CAD model has been compared to the motion of an actual human arm using a Qualysis motion capture system to validate the hypothesis. Future research involves adding skin to the CAD models to create a photorealistic 3D model that will be used as a virtual limb. In conjunction with mixed reality technologies, the virtual limb will be used in action-observation rehabilitation of stroke patients.","Caballero, Rachel",0,,284

In the same light, humans must also understand the messages that are being communicated to them by robots, including nonverbal messages. We conducted a Web-based video study wherein participants interpreted the iconic gestures and emblems produced by an anthropomorphic robot. Out of the 15 robotic gestures presented, we found 6 that can be accurately recognized by the human observer. These were nodding, clapping, hugging, expressing anger, walking, and flying. We review these gestures for their meaning from literature on human and animal behavior. We conclude by discussing the possible implications of these gestures for the design of social robots that are able to have engaging interactions with humans.","Cabibihan, J.

751,Cohesion as a Principle for Perceiving Objecthood Does It Apply to Animate Agents?,"Previous research found that cohesion manipulations (e.g., splitting an object into two parts) may have deleterious effects on infants' object representation. The present study investigated whether the cohesion principle is relevant only when assessing the continuity of inanimate objects, or whether it is equally fundamental for the perception and representation of animate agents. In two experiments, we assessed 8-month-old infants' tracking behavior in events in which an agent (an animated snail) was either split in half, fused together, or simply changed its shape. Infants managed to individuate fused snails and snails that had changed their shape, but failed to track split snails, even in a perception-based paradigm. This suggests that the effects of cohesion manipulation apply to animate agents as well as inanimate objects. Moreover, these results suggest that infants' inability to track split snails is not a consequence of a violation of core principles, but rather a consequence of the increased processing demands that arise when they are tracking multiple entities moving in different directions.","Cacchione, T.",0,10.1024/1421-0185/a000164,286
753,First Impressions in Human-Agent Virtual Encounters,"In greeting encounters, first impressions of personality and attitude are quickly formed and might determine important relational decisions, such as the likelihood and frequency of subsequent encounters. An anthropomorphic user interface is not immune to these judgments, specifically when exhibiting social interaction skills in public spaces. A favorable impression may help engaging users in interaction and attaining acceptance for long-term interactions. We present three studies implementing a model of first impressions for initiating user interactions with an anthropomorphic museum guide agent with socio-relational skills. We focus on nonverbal behavior exhibiting personality and interpersonal attitude. In two laboratory studies, we demonstrate that impressions of an agent's personality are quickly formed based on proximity, whereas interpersonal attitude is conveyed through smile and gaze. We also found that interpersonal attitude has greater impact than personality on the user's decision to spend time with the agent. These findings are then applied to a museum guide agent exhibited at the Boston Museum of Science. In this field study, we show that employing our model increases the number of visitors engaging in interaction.","Cafaro, A.",0,10.1145/2940325,287
756,Modeling and Communicating the Conceptual Intent of Geo-Analytical Tasks for Human-GIS Interaction,"One of the fundamental issues of geographical information science is to design GIS interfaces and functionalities in a way that is easy to understand, teach, and use. Unfortunately, current geographical information systems (including ArcGIS) remains very difficult to use as spatial analysis tools, because they organize and expose functionalities according to GIS data structures and processing algorithms. As a result, GIS interfaces are conceptually confusing, cognitively complex, and semantically disconnected from the way human reason about spatial analytical activities. In this article, we propose an approach that structures GIS analytical functions based on the notion of analytical intent. We describe an experiment that replaces ArcGIS desktop interface with a conversational interface, to enable mixed-initiative user-system interactions at the level of analytical intentions. We initially focus on the subset of GIS functions that are relevant to finding what's inside as described by Mitchell, but the general principles apply to other types of spatial analysis. This work demonstrates the feasibility of delegating some spatial thinking tasks to computational agents, and also raises future research questions that are key to building a better theory of spatial thinking with GIS.","Cai, G.

759,On the formulation of competitive negotiations in Web applications: The Latin-American market case,"Work on electronic negotiation has motivated the development of systems with strategies specifically designed to establish protocols for buying and selling goods on the Web. On the one hand, there are systems where agents interact with users through dialogues and animations, helping them to find products while learning from their preferences to plan future transactions. On the other hand, there are systems that employ knowledge-bases to determine the context of the interactions and to define the boundaries inherently established by the e-Commerce. This paper introduces the idea of developing an agent with both capabilities: negotiation and interaction in an e-Commerce application via virtual reality (with a view to apply it in the Latin-American market, where both the technological gap and an inappropriate approach to motivate electronic transactions are important factors). We address these issues by presenting a negotiation strategy that allows the interaction between an intelligent agent and a human consumer with Latin-American idiosyncrasy and by including a graphical agent to assist the user on a virtual basis. We think this may reduce the impact of the gap created by this new technology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Cairo, O.",0,10.1016/j.eswa.2011.09.122,289
763,,"The vision of personal robot assistants continues to become more realistic with technological advances in robotics. The increase in the capabilities of robots, presents boundless opportunities for them to perform useful tasks for humans. However, it is not feasible for engineers to program robots for all possible uses. Instead, we envision general-purpose robots that can be programmed by their end-users. Learning from Demonstration (LfD), is an approach that allows users to program new capabilities on a robot by demonstrating what is required from the robot. Although LfD has become an established area of Robotics, many challenges remain in making it effective and intuitive for naive users. This thesis contributes to addressing these challenges in several ways. First, the problems that occur in teaching-learning interactions between humans and robots are characterized through human-subject experiments in three different domains. To address these problems, two mechanisms for guiding human teachers in their interactions are developed: embodied queries and teaching heuristics . Embodied queries, inspired from Active Learning queries, are questions asked by the robot so as to steer the teacher towards providing more informative demonstrations. They leverage the robot's embodiment to physically manipulate the environment and to communicate the question. Two technical contributions are made in developing embodied queries. The first is Active Keyframe-based LfD — a framework for learning human-segmented skills in continuous action spaces and producing four different types of embodied queries to improve learned skills. The second is Intermittently-Active Learning in which a learner makes queries selectively, so as to create balanced interactions with the benefits of fully-active learning. Empirical findings from five experiments with human subjects are presented. These identify interaction-related issues in generating embodied queries, characterize human question asking, and evaluate implementations of Intermittently-Active Learning and Active Keyframe-based LfD on the humanoid robot Simon. The second mechanism, teaching heuristics, is a set of instructions given to human teachers in order to elicit more informative demonstrations from them. Such instructions are devised based on an understanding of what constitutes an optimal teacher for a given learner, with techniques grounded in Algorithmic Teaching. The utility of teaching heuristics is empirically demonstrated through six human-subject experiments, that involve teaching different concepts or tasks to a virtual agent, or teaching skills to Simon. With a diverse set of human subject experiments, this thesis demonstrates the necessity for guiding humans in teaching interactions with robots, and verifies the utility of two proposed mechanisms in improving sample efficiency and final performance, while enhancing the user interaction.","Cakmak, Maya",0,,290

Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names.

767,A framework for the assessment of synthetic personalities according to user perception,"Endowing artificial conversational agents with personality is a very promising way to obtain more believable user interactions with robots and computers. However, although many authors have studied how to create an agent's personality and how it affects performance and user satisfaction, less attention has been paid to assess whether the designed agent's personality corresponds to the users' perception, whether it is easily recognizable, and what is the effect that the user's own personality has in the discrimination of the agents' personality. In this paper we present an assessment framework to address these issues in an integrated way, which in our opinion offers enough flexibility to consider the diversity of application domains and evaluation approaches that can be found in the literature. The framework is based on numerical measures, which facilitate the interpretation of results and makes it possible to compare and rank different agents with respect to the user's perception of the rendered personality. In addition, we have developed a tool that implements the framework, which may be very useful for researchers in order to easily evaluate different agent personalities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

770,,"This dissertation explores the first ten years of the Uruguayan public school system. Postcolonial Orientales believed public schools would assist them in building a new society, one ideologically conceived as a voluntary association of formally equal individuals. The new society contrasted with the corporate and overtly hierarchical sistema colonial , hence the pedagogical mission to create a new type of man, the idealized and homogenized citizen. The 1830s witnessed the increasing ascendancy of the state over all educational matters, resulting in the partial displacement of traditional pedagogical agents, practices and institutions, such as the family and the Church. The new republic was responsible for building schoolhouses, recruiting and training teachers, and standardizing elementary education under a single set of pedagogical and organizational rules. In order to achieve its standardizing goals, the government enforced the implementation of Lancaster's monitorial school, a pedagogical institution perceived as the best to rapidly produce a future generation of citizens. This work also examines the role of teachers and the mobilization of the local communities, the pueblos and vecindarios, whose ideological commitment was crucial for the success of the new educational project. Public school teachers developed their occupational identity as state agents, surrogate parents, and priests of a modern kind; they connected students, families and parochial communities to the universalistic ideals of a ""higher"" cosmopolitan culture. Apart from spreading literacy and instilling scholarly ideals of cultivation, meritocratic individualism, and progress-oriented agency, the modern school also emerged as a prolonged initiation ritual, a rationalized and intentional process of socialization which incorporated young children into the envisioned national community.","Camou Viacava, Juan Andres",0,,293
771,,"Motion planning, or enabling agents to navigate around a virtual environment autonomously, is an essential requirement for video games and simulations. A well implemented motion planning technique can create a realistic and immersive user experience. If motion planning is not implemented properly, agents will exhibit unrealistic behavior and cause a distraction for the user. Motion planning is often difficult to implement due to the agents' movement capabilities and the complexity of the virtual environment in which the agents exist. In a traditional three dimensional video game in which the agents are bound by gravity, the agents' motion takes place mostly in the XZ-plane. In other words, the agents' degree of freedom (DOF) is three. In this case, motion planning is translated into a two-dimensional problem, which is relatively easier to compute. However, when the agents can move in any three dimensional direction or to any three dimensional position in space, motion planning is much more complex. Meta!Blast is a three dimensional educational video game. Implementing motion planning in Meta!Blast is challenging for three reasons: The first reason is the agents have at least six degrees of freedom and can be translated or rotated about any axis in the three dimensional virtual environment. The second reason is the agents exist in a dense environment with many irregularly shaped models that need to be considered during planning. Lastly, Meta!Blast will be deployed in the high school classroom where computer hardware resources are limited, eliminating some planning techniques found in the literature. This thesis provides a practical solution for high DOF agents in dense environments using a combination of octree space partitioning, A* path-planning, and steering behaviors.","Campbell, Princess Jahmeka",0,,294
772,Simulating archaeologists? Using agent-based modelling to improve battlefield excavations,"The study of material culture generated by military engagements has created an emergent sub-discipline of archaeological studies centred on battlefields. This approach has developed a particular and sophisticated methodology that is able to deal with the fact that archaeologists will often not find either structures or a useful stratigraphical record on the site, as the material remains of the battle will basically be metallic objects carried by combatants. It is therefore rather complicated not only to test hypotheses about battle events based on archaeological data, but also to validate the methodology used. Here we propose the use of agent-based models to explore these issues in the case of eighteenth-century battlefield archaeology. The simulation is divided into four different steps. Firstly, a battle is simulated in order to generate realistic virtual archaeological remains left by an engagement between two armies of this era. We then simulate the loss of information that the passing of time produces in the battlefield. The third step involves simulating the archaeological survey, enabling us to explore different survey strategies and the impact on the interpretation of the event itself. Finally, we design a confidence index in order to compare the results of the different virtual excavations using spatial analysis and statistics. The results show that the methodology is fully functional in terms of understanding a battle, and it allows us to suggest new strategies to improve fieldwork and to develop new ways of exploring these particular archaeological sites. It is concluded that the described approach illustrates how simulation can be used to explore methodological issues of archaeological science. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We have compared three collaboration strategies (A-peer-to-peer complementariness, B-concentration process and C-virtual cooperation networks) that were defined on the basis of literature and on empirical evidence. Strategies are introduced exogenously in the simulation. The aims of this paper are twofold: (i) to analyze the importance of the networking effects; and (ii) to test the differences among collaboration strategies. It was possible to conclude that profit is associated with higher stock of knowledge and with smaller network diameter. In addition, concentration strategies are more profitable and more efficient in transmitting knowledge through the network. These processes reinforce the stock of knowledge and the profit of the firms located in the centers of the networks.","Campos, P.",0,10.1007/s10614-013-9376-9,296
778,Learning by failure vs learning by habits Entrepreneurial learning micro-strategies as determinants of the emergence of co-located entrepreneurial networks,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explain the emergence of collaboration networks in entrepreneurial clusters as determined by the way entrepreneurs exchange knowledge and learn through business transactions needed to implement temporary supply chains in networks of co-located firms. Design/methodology/approach - A socio-computational approach is adopted to model business transactions and supply chain formation in Marshallian industrial districts (IDs). An agent-based model is presented and used as a virtual lab to test the hypotheses between the firms' behaviour and the emergence of structural properties at the system level. Findings - The simulation findings and their validation based on the comparison with a real world cluster show that the topological properties of the emerging network are influenced by the learning strategies and decisionmaking criteria firms use when choosing partners. With reference to the specific case of Marshallian IDs it is shown that inertial learning based on history and past collaboration represents in the long term a major impediment for the emergence of hubs and of a network topology that is more conducive to innovation and growth. Research limitations/implications - The paper offers an alternative view of entrepreneurial learning (EL) as opposed to the dominant view in which learning occurs as a result of exceptional circumstances (e.g. failure). The results presented in this work show that adaptive, situated, and day-by-day learning has a profound impact on the performance of entrepreneurial clusters. These results are encouraging to motivate additional research in areas such as in modelling learning or in the application of the proposed approach to the analysis of other types of entrepreneurial ecosystems, such as start-up networks and makers' communities. Practical implications - Agent-based model can support policymakers in identifying situated factors that can be leveraged to produce changes at the macro-level through the identification of suitable incentives and social networks re-engineering. Originality/value - The paper presents a novel perspective on EL and offers evidence that micro-learning strategies adopted and developed in routine business transactions do have an impact on firms' performances (survival and growth) as well as on systemic performances related to the creation and diffusion of innovation in firms networks.","Cannavacciuolo, L.",0,10.1108/ijebr-11-2015-0238,297
782,,"Electronic sound artists and musicians, in their choice of the tools of their craft, have a close, working relationship with a specific form of mass-produced commodity, that of technological audio devices. Like other manufactured goods, they originate from a global production system that is historically exploitative, and environmentally unsustainable. The nature of electronic and digital technology, however, warrants an additional layer of scrutiny: they are beholden to the expectations of continuous technological improvement and obsolescence. Unlike musicians who perform on a finite number of cherished instruments that are used for decades, electronic musicians' tools are very often subject to the whims and relentless change associated with technologically-driven economic forces. Computer musicians especially, must consistently adapt to and purchase new software and hardware to avoid losing critical functionality and compatibility. The digital musician's position in this process opens questions of principle, regarding the ethical defensibility of self- expressive acts relative to the net negative effect caused by their contribution to technological production methods that promote suffering and global destruction. To counter these continuing tendencies, I offer a reading of new materialist theory with an eye toward how it may be specifically applied to electronic and digital musicians. New materialism projects a monistic perception of the world, in which the differentiation between humans, non-humans, and objects is called into question. Additionally, matter is seen, not as inert, but as being comprised of action, capable of effecting change in the physical world. This dissolution of boundaries is further extended to broader global systems of culture, capital and polity, connecting the very small to the very large. In this way, the ethical consequences of larger systems of influence become intrinsic to physical objects. Applied to technological audio devices, porous boundaries allow a vision of audio technology that is inclusive of all the bodies with which it has come in contact, and urges a limited sense of anthropomorphic identification with its users. This sense of interaction is extended into the realm of audio feedback, in which all audio processors, regardless of their intended functionality, contribute to a common sonic end. Seen in this way, sound technology that was once subject to the whims of constant development, becomes imbued with a personal sense of vitality, making it more difficult to be perceived as a disposable and obsolete.","Cantrell, Joe Leo",0,,298
783,Shared Resources: Engineering Students' Emerging Group Understanding of Thermodynamic Work,"Background We have developed several interactive virtual laboratories (IVLs) based on a sequence of agent-based molecular simulations designed to target specific threshold concepts to help students learn thermodynamics. We previously analyzed learning in the IVLs from a cognitive perspective, seeking to repair students' misconceptions; however, that perspective provided limited information for iteratively improving the IVLs. Purpose In this study, we shift to a sociocultural perspective to identify student learning resources activated during their engagement in the Thermodynamic Work IVL. We seek to identify the productive social and environmental triggers through which students develop conceptual ideas using technology in a social setting. Method We conducted emergent lexical coding on a cohort of 187 students' textual responses as they completed the IVL in a studio setting. We then analyzed the discursive and technology interactions of four students from different groups using video recordings. Results Coding results show distributions of students' activated resources. Almost all of the students demonstrated productive ideas, and almost all also revealed opportunities to learn more. Through the detailed studies, we illustrate the moment-by-moment interactions of students with one another and with technology to describe how they activate and share resources. These interactions are conceptualized and illustrated through the construct of shared resources. We relate shared resources to processes of knowledge co-construction and knowledge transfer, and discuss implications for instructional practice and educational technology design. Conclusions The resources framework helps us recognize productive ideas in students' evolving understanding of thermodynamic work Shared resources allows for elaboration of the interwoven cognitive and social aspects of learning.","Cao, Y.",1,10.1002/jee.20237,299

786,A Universal Ankle-Foot Prosthesis Emulator for Human Locomotion Experiments,"Robotic prostheses have the potential to significantly improve mobility for people with lower-limb amputation. Humans exhibit complex responses to mechanical interactions with these devices, however, and computational models are not yet able to predict such responses meaningfully. Experiments therefore play a critical role in development, but have been limited by the use of product-like prototypes, each requiring years of development and specialized for a narrow range of functions. Here we describe a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis system that enables rapid exploration of a wide range of dynamical behaviors in experiments with human subjects. This emulator comprises powerful off-board motor and control hardware, a flexible Bowden cable tether, and a lightweight instrumented prosthesis, resulting in a combination of low mass worn by the human (0.96 kg) and high mechatronic performance compared to prior platforms. Benchtop tests demonstrated closed-loop torque bandwidth of 17Hz, peak torque of 175 Nm, and peak power of 1.0 kW. Tests with an anthropomorphic pendulum ""leg"" demonstrated low interference from the tether, less than 1 Nm about the hip. This combination of low worn mass, high bandwidth, high torque, and unrestricted movement makes the platform exceptionally versatile. To demonstrate suitability for human experiments, we performed preliminary tests in which a subject with unilateral transtibial amputation walked on a treadmill at 1.25 ms(-1) while the prosthesis behaved in various ways. These tests revealed low torque tracking error (RMS error of 2.8 Nm) and the capacity to systematically vary work production or absorption across a broad range (from -5 to 21 J per step). These results support the use of robotic emulators during early stage assessment of proposed device functionalities and for scientific study of fundamental aspects of human-robot interaction. The design of simple, alternate end-effectors would enable studies at other joints or with additional degrees of freedom.","Caputo, J. M.",0,10.1115/1.4026225,301
788,YPAR and Critical Epistemologies: Rethinking Education Research,"Knowledges from academic and professional research-based institutions have long been valued over the organic intellectualism of those who are most affected by educational and social inequities. In contrast, participatory action research (PAR) projects are collective investigations that rely on indigenous knowledge, combined with the desire to take individual and/or collective action. PAR with youth (YPAR) engages in rigorous research inquiries and represents a radical effort in education research to value the inquiry-based knowledge production of the youth who directly experience the educational contexts that scholars endeavor to understand. In this chapter, we outline the foundations of YPAR and examine the distinct epistemological, methodological, and pedagogical contributions of an interdisciplinary corpus of YPAR studies and scholarship. We outline the origins and disciplines of YPAR and make a case for its role in education research, discuss its contributions to the field and the tensions and possibilities of YPAR across disciplines, and close by proposing a YPAR critical-epistemological framework that centers youth and their communities, alongside practitioners, scholars, and researchers, as knowledge producers and change agents for social justice.","Caraballo, L.",0,10.3102/0091732x16686948,302

Generally trust metrics endorse the principle ""the higher the trust, the more legitimate that user will be""; a consequence is that getting trusted must require some effort, otherwise all participants would easily achieve high trustworthiness. In this work we study how a user can achieve and preserve a good trust and what costs it requires over time; we also investigate some heuristics that allow reducing the complexity in exploring the rank-effort space especially for large networks.","Carchiolo, V.",0,,303
796,,"Particle transport of radionuclide photons using the Monte Carlo N-Particle computer code can be used to determine a portal monitor's photon detection efficiency, in units of counts per photon, for internally deposited radionuclides. Good agreement has been found with experimental results for radionuclides that emit higher energy photons, such as Cs-137 and Co-60. Detection efficiency for radionuclides that emit lower energy photons, such as Am-241, greatly depend on the effective discriminator energy level of the portal monitor as well as any attenuating material between the source and detectors. This evaluation uses a chi-square approach to determine the best fit discriminator level of a non-spectroscopic portal monitor when the effective discriminator level, in units of energy, is not known. Internal detection efficiencies were evaluated experimentally using an anthropomorphic phantom with NIST traceable sources at various internal locations, and by simulation using MCNP5. The results of this research find that MCNP5 can be an effective tool for simulation of photon detection efficiencies, given a known discriminator level, for internally and externally deposited radionuclides. In addition, MCNP5 can be used for bounding personnel doses from either internally or externally deposited mixtures of radionuclides.","Carey, Matthew Glen",0,,304
797,Inadvertent leaks: exploration via agent-based dynamic network simulation,"A significant volume of information leaks in organizations are inadvertent, a form of information spillage. Because the leakage of information is driven by the complex interaction of technology, social, and behavioral factors, we use a hybrid agent-based and dynamic network model, Construct, to simulate the flow of sensitive information in knowledge-driven organizations. Because interaction patterns often change when an organization is under stress, we simulate stress to the organization with effect-based (reliability and integrity) crisis scenarios. Using a virtual experiment, we vary the crisis scenarios, organization's structure, IT connections, and pressure to separate personnel based on security ratings. Our experiment suggests that the organization's structure, IT connections, separation pressure, and typical performance all influence how much an organization suffers from inadvertent leakage. In evaluating how organizations respond to crisis, organizations with stove-piped IT tend to clamp down on leakage in response to the crisis, while organizations with Mesh IT tend to have more leakage. Integrity crises tend to decrease leakage; while reliability crises tend to increase leakage in organizations, especially those with Mesh-based IT.","Carley, K. M.",0,10.1007/s10588-016-9215-3,305
799,The effects of animated pedagogical agents in an English-as-a-foreign-language learning environment,"Animated pedagogical agents (APAs) have frequently been used as a powerful addition to learning environments, since APAs have been known to facilitate learning. APAs can present various features, such as voice, movements, gestures and pointing, and researchers have sought to verify specifically which features of agents effectively contribute to learning. Previous studies have studied these features by comparing different degrees of agent embodiment in the evaluation of the image effect (i.e., students learn more when learning systems have visual APAs), the embodied agent effect (i.e., fully embodied agents that deliver instruction aurally and use gestures to improve learning outcomes in text-only learning systems), the modality effect (i.e., oral instruction contributes to the learning process), and the expressiveness effect (i.e., fully embodied agents promote more effective learning than static ones). Some of these studies have investigated the image, embodied agent and modality effects in the same learning environment, but they were not the same studies that investigated the expressiveness effect. The expressiveness effect allows us to separate the movements of the agent from its other features, such as the agent's image, so investigating this effect is as important as investigating the other effects. We are not aware of any studies that investigated all of these four effects within the same learning system, nor that evaluated any of these effects in language learning environments. Accordingly, this paper describes the design, implementation, and analysis of an APA designed to evaluate the abovementioned effects. The APA was integrated into a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) system to teach English as a foreign language to Brazilian students. A total of 72 Brazilian undergraduate students were divided into four groups, each of which used a different version of the APA in the same CALL system: no agent, a voice-only agent, a static agent, or a fully embodied agent. We compared students' gain scores (i.e., difference between pre- and posttest scores) across groups to evaluate each of the four effects. Though the outcomes of our study supported the presence of the embodied agent and modality effects, we were not able to detnonstrate the image or expressiveness effects in the experiment. Our results indicate that the voice of the agent might contribute more positively to learning than movements, gestures and pointing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

801,,"A study design has been developed that employs a dual modeling approach to identify factors associated with facility-level cancer screening improvement and how this is mediated by the use of clinical decision support. This dual modeling approach combines principles of (1) Health Informatics, (2) Cancer Prevention and Control, (3) Health Services Research, and (4) Organizational Change/Theory. The study design builds upon the constructs of a conceptual framework developed by Jane Zapka, namely, (1) organizational and/or practice settings, (2) provider characteristics, and (3) patient population characteristics. These constructs have been operationalized as measures in a 2005 HRSA/NCI Health Disparities Cancer Collaborative inventory of 44 community health centers. The first, statistical models will use: sequential, multivariable regression models to test for the organizational determinants that may account for the presence and intensity-of-use of clinical decision support (CDS) and information systems (IS) within community health centers for use in colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening. A subsequent test will assess the impact of CDS/IS on provider reported cancer screening improvement rates. The second, computational models will use a multi-agent model of network evolution called CONSTRUCT® to identify the agents, tasks, knowledge, groups, and beliefs associated with cancer screening practices and CDS/IS use to inform both CDS/IS implementation and cancer screening intervention strategies. This virtual experiment will facilitate hypothesis-generation through computer simulation exercises. The outcome of this research will be to identify barriers and facilitators to improving community health center facility-level cancer screening performance using CDS/IS as an agent of change. Stakeholders for this work include both national and local community health center IT leadership, as well as clinical managers deploying IT strategies to improve cancer screening among vulnerable patient populations.","Carney, Timothy Jay",0,,307
802,Hypothesis generation using network structures on community health center cancer-screening performance,"Research objectives: Nationally sponsored cancer-care quality-improvement efforts have been deployed in community health centers to increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer-screening rates among vulnerable populations. Despite several immediate and short-term gains, screening rates remain below national benchmark objectives. Overall improvement has been both difficult to sustain over time in some organizational settings and/or challenging to diffuse to other settings as repeatable best practices. Reasons for this include facility-level changes, which typically occur in dynamic organizational environments that are complex, adaptive, and unpredictable. This study seeks to understand the factors that shape community health center facility-level cancer-screening performance overtime. This study applies a computational-modeling approach, combining principles of health-services research, health informatics, network theory, and systems science. Methods: To investigate the roles of knowledge acquisition, retention, and sharing within the setting of the community health center and to examine their effects on the relationship between clinical decision support capabilities and improvement in cancer-screening rate improvement, we employed Construct-TM to create simulated community health centers using previously collected point-in-time survey data. Construct-TM is a multi-agent model of network evolution. Because social, knowledge, and belief networks co-evolve, groups and organizations are treated as complex systems to capture the variability of human and organizational factors. In Construct-TM, individuals and groups interact by communicating, learning, and making decisions in a continuous cycle. Data from the survey was used to differentiate high-performing simulated community health centers from low-performing ones based on computer-based decision support usage and self-reported cancer-screening improvement. Results: This virtual experiment revealed that patterns of overall network symmetry, agent cohesion, and connectedness varied by community health center performance level. Visual assessment of both the agent-to-agent knowledge sharing network and agent-to-resource knowledge use network diagrams demonstrated that community health centers labeled as high performers typically showed higher levels of collaboration and cohesiveness among agent classes, faster knowledge-absorption rates, and fewer agents that were unconnected to key knowledge resources. Conclusions and research implications: Using the point-in-time survey data outlining community health center cancer-screening practices, our computational model successfully distinguished between high and low performers. Results indicated that high-performance environments displayed distinctive network characteristics in patterns of interaction among agents, as well as in the access and utilization of key knowledge resources. Our study demonstrated how non-network-specific data obtained from a point-in-time survey can be employed to forecast community health center performance over time, thereby enhancing the sustainability of long-term strategic-improvement efforts. Our results revealed a strategic profile for community health center cancer-screening improvement via simulation over a projected 10-year period. The use of computational modeling allows additional inferential knowledge to be drawn from existing data when examining organizational performance in increasingly complex environments.

809,,"In early childhood mathematics, strategy-use is an important indicator of children's conceptual understanding and is a strong predictor of later math performance. Strategy instruction is common in many national curricula, yet is virtually absent from most math software. The current study describes the design of one software activity teaching single-digit addition strategies. The study explores the effectiveness of the software in detecting the strategies first-graders use and teaching them to use more efficient strategies. Instead of a business-as-usual control group, the study explores the effects of one aspect of the software: the pedagogical agent, investigating whether multiple agents are more effective than a single agent when teaching about multiple strategies. The study finds that while children do not accurately report their own strategies, the software log is able to detect the strategies that children use and is particularly adept at detecting the effective use of an advanced strategy with a model that performs 67% better than chance. Overall, children improve in their accuracy, speed, and use of advanced strategies. Of the three teaching tools available to the children, the count on tool was most effective in encouraging use of an advanced strategy, highlighting a need to revise the other tools. Low-performers correctly used advanced strategies more frequently across the six sessions, while mid-performers improved after just one session and high-performers' correct use of an advanced strategy was consistent across the sessions. Whether a student saw lessons featuring a single agent or multiple agents did not have strong effects on performance. More research is needed to improve the strategy detection models, refine the tools and lessons, and explore other features of the software.","Carpenter, Kara Kilmartin",1,,309
810,Is That a Human? Categorization (Dis) Fluency Drives Evaluations of Agents Ambiguous on Human-Likeness,"A fundamental and seemingly unbridgeable psychological boundary divides humans and nonhumans. Essentialism theories suggest that mixing these categories violates ""natural kinds."" Perceptual theories propose that such mixing creates incompatible cues. Most theories suggest that mixed agents, with both human and nonhuman features, obligatorily elicit discomfort. In contrast, we demonstrate top-down, cognitive control of these effects-such that the discomfort with mixed agents is partially driven by disfluent categorization of ambiguous features that are pertinent to the agent. Three experiments tested this idea. Participants classified 3 different agents (humans, androids, and robots) either on the human-likeness or control dimension and then evaluated them. Classifying on the human-likeness dimensions made the mixed agent (android) more disfluent, and in turn, more disliked. Disfluency also mediated the negative affective reaction. Critically, devaluation only resulted from disfluency on human-likenessand not from an equally disfluent color dimension. We argue that negative consequences on evaluations of mixed agents arise from integral disfluency (on features that are relevant to the judgment at-hand, like ambiguous human-likeness). In contrast, no negative effects stem from incidental disfluency (on features that do not bear on the current judgment, like ambiguous color backgrounds). Overall, these findings support a top-down account of why, when, and how mixed agents elicit conflict and discomfort.","Carr, E. W.",0,10.1037/xhp0000304,310
815,ROBUSTNESS AND SEPARATION IN MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCREENING,"A principal wishes to screen an agent along several dimensions of private information simultaneously. The agent has quasilinear preferences that are additively separable across the various components. We consider a robust version of the principal's problem, in which she knows the marginal distribution of each component of the agent's type, but does not know the joint distribution. Any mechanism is evaluated by its worst-case expected profit, over all joint distributions consistent with the known marginals. We show that the optimum for the principal is simply to screen along each component separately. This result does not require any assumptions (such as single crossing) on the structure of preferences within each component. The proof technique involves a generalization of the concept of virtual values to arbitrary screening problems. Sample applications include monopoly pricing and a stylized dynamic taxation model.","Carroll, G.",0,10.3982/ecta14165,311
816,,"Vibration induced by walking pedestrians has motivated research in the civil engineering community for many years. An area within this broad field that has received particular attention is the dynamic interaction that can occur between pedestrians and laterally flexible bridge structures. Perhaps the most notable example occurring on the opening day of London's Millennium Bridge. The enduring interest in this research problem is fuelled by two of its key features; (i) the sensitivity and adaptability of human balance to lateral motion and (ii) the spatial and temporal variation in flow characteristics exhibited by a pedestrian crowd. Both of these features are addressed herein. In this project an experimental campaign was executed with the aim of identifying the interaction mechanism by which pedestrians produce force harmonics, that resonate with the oscillating structure on which they walk. These so-called self-excited forces have been experimentally identified by others but the underlying reason for their existence has remained an open question. In an effort to address this, human balance behaviour while walking on a laterally oscillating treadmill was recorded using 3-dimensional motion capture equipment. Subsequent analysis revealed that human response to sinusoidal base motion is dominated by periodic alteration of foot placement position. This produces amplitude modulation of the lateral component of the ground reaction force and is ultimately responsible for the self-excited force harmonics. It was further revealed that human centre of mass motion while walking on an oscillating structure is predominantly passive. The passive inverted pendulum model is thus an excellent model of pedestrian frontal plane balance. The second facet of this work is concerned with developing a crowd-structure interaction model that builds upon the current state of the art. The model presented utilises the understanding of human-structure interaction identified above and employs an agent-based modelling approach. Thus, the resulting 'virtual crowd' is capable of simulating key crowd features, such as inter-subject variability and emergent velocity-density flow behaviour. Using this model, it is shown that the experimentally identified human-structure interaction mechanism can lead to large amplitude lateral deck oscillations, consistent with field observations reported in the literature. The model successfully predicts the multi-mode instability of Bristol's Clifton Suspension Bridge in the absence of step frequency tuning among the crowd. This provides supporting evidence for the model's validity. The work described above has resulted in a clearer understanding of the feedback between pedestrian balance behaviour and bridge response. Furthermore, the modelling techniques developed have potential for application in the wider study of crowd-induced vibration of dynamically susceptible structures.","Carroll, Seàn P.",0,,312
817,Socio-Contextual Constraints for Human Approach with a Mobile Robot,"The efficiency of human-robot collaborative task completion benefits from seamless interactions. Robots that act in a shared environment with humans, can improve the initiation of such interactions by externalizing the intention of accompanying motions. Especially within robot locomotion the ability to convey intentions non-verbally is beneficial for interaction initiation and thus for mutual collision avoidance and the reduction of interferences. This work examines specific trajectory features that provide the required natural movements and support intention conveyance. The named correlations are investigated in the social context of robot locomotion for a pro-active robot-to-human approach. Trajectories that aim to clearly convey this intention of the robot are planned based on optimal control principles. Within a subject study different features like path shape and orientation for robot-to-human approach trajectories are evaluated in their performance of supporting intention conveyance. Results show that the perceived naturalness and the comprehensibility of robot-to-human approach motions is significantly higher for trajectories with human-like features.","Carton, D.",0,10.1007/s12369-016-0394-3,313
821,The neural time course of evaluating self-initiated joint attention bids,"Background: During interactions with other people, we constantly evaluate the significance of our social partner's gaze shifts in order to coordinate our behaviour with their perspective. In this study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the neural time course of evaluating gaze shifts that signal the success of self-initiated joint attention bids. Method: Nineteen participants were allocated to a ""social"" condition, in which they played a cooperative game with an anthropomorphic virtual character whom they believed was controlled by a human partner in a nearby laboratory. Participants were required to initiate joint attention towards a target. In response, the virtual partner shifted his gaze congruently towards the target - thus achieving joint attention - or incongruently towards a different location. Another 19 participants completed the same task in a non-social ""control"" condition, in which arrows, believed to be controlled by a computer program, pointed at a location that was either congruent or incongruent with the participant's target fixation. Results: In the social condition, ERPs to the virtual partner's incongruent gaze shifts evoked significantly larger P350 and P500 peaks compared to congruent gaze shifts. This P350 and P500 morphology was absent in both the congruent and incongruent control conditions. Discussion: These findings are consistent with previous claims that gaze shifts differing in their social significance modulate central-parietal ERPs 350 ms following the onset of the gaze shift. Our control data highlights the social specificity of the observed P350 effect, ruling out explanations pertaining to attention modulation or error detection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

824,Beliefs about human agency influence the neural processing of gaze during joint attention,"The current study measured adults' P350 and N170 ERPs while they interacted with a character in a virtual reality paradigm. Some participants believed the character was controlled by a human (avatar condition, n=19); others believed it was controlled by a computer program (agent condition, n=19). In each trial, participants initiated joint attention in order to direct the character's gaze toward a target. In 50% of trials, the character gazed toward the target (congruent responses), and in 50% of trials the character gazed to a different location (incongruent response). In the avatar condition, the character's incongruent gaze responses generated significantly larger P350 peaks at centro-parietal sites than congruent gaze responses. In the agent condition, the P350 effect was strikingly absent. Left occipitotemporal N170 responses were significantly smaller in the agent condition compared to the avatar condition for both congruent and incongruent gaze shifts. These data suggest that beliefs about human agency may recruit mechanisms that discriminate the social outcome of a gaze shift after approximately 350ms, and that these mechanisms may modulate the early perceptual processing of gaze. These findings also suggest that the ecologically valid measurement of social cognition may depend upon paradigms that simulate genuine social interactions.","Caruana, N.",0,10.1080/17470919.2016.1160953,315
827,,"Recent neuroimaging studies have observed that the neural processing of social cues from a virtual reality character appears to be affected by ""intentional stance"" (i.e., attributing mental states, agency, and ""humanness""). However, this effect could also be explained by individual differences or perceptual effects resulting from the design of these studies. The current study used a new design that measured centro-parietal P250, P350, and N170 event-related potentials (ERPs) in 20 healthy adults while they initiated gaze-related joint attention with a virtual character (“Alan”) in two conditions. In one condition, they were told that Alan was controlled by a human; in the other, they were told that he was controlled by a computer. When participants believed Alan was human, his congruent gaze shifts, which resulted in joint attention, generated significantly larger P250 ERPs than his incongruent gaze shifts. In contrast, his incongruent gaze shifts triggered significantly larger increases in P350 ERPs than his congruent gaze shifts. These findings support previous studies suggesting that intentional stance affects the neural processing of social cues from a virtual character. The outcomes also suggest the use of the P250 and P350 ERPs as objective indices of social engagement during the design of socially approachable robots and virtual agents.

829,Human agency beliefs influence behaviour during virtual social interactions,"In recent years, with the emergence of relatively inexpensive and accessible virtual reality technologies, it is now possible to deliver compelling and realistic simulations of human-to-human interaction. Neuroimaging studies have shown that, when participants believe they are interacting via a virtual interface with another human agent, they show different patterns of brain activity compared to when they know that their virtual partner is computer-controlled. The suggestion is that users adopt an ""intentional stance'' by attributing mental states to their virtual partner. However, it remains unclear how beliefs in the agency of a virtual partner influence participants' behaviour and subjective experience of the interaction. We investigated this issue in the context of a cooperative ""joint attention'' game in which participants interacted via an eye tracker with a virtual onscreen partner, directing each other's eye gaze to different screen locations. Half of the participants were correctly informed that their partner was controlled by a computer algorithm (""Computer'' condition). The other half were misled into believing that the virtual character was controlled by a second participant in another room (""Human'' condition). Those in the ""Human'' condition were slower to make eye contact with their partner and more likely to try and guide their partner before they had established mutual eye contact than participants in the ""Computer'' condition. They also responded more rapidly when their partner was guiding them, although the same effect was also found for a control condition in which they responded to an arrow cue. Results confirm the influence of human agency beliefs on behaviour in this virtual social interaction context. They further suggest that researchers and developers attempting to simulate social interactions should consider the impact of agency beliefs on user experience in other social contexts, and their effect on the achievement of the application's goals.","Caruana, N.",0,10.7717/peerj.3819,317
832,,"Automated story generation is a desired feature in games and interactive media because it can control how a virtual world evolves so that it can be adapted to the players' choices. In order to have variety and quality in the generated stories, previous works have relied on simulation‐based storytelling, in which a story is generated as their characters, represented as agents, try to achieve their goals. One challenge of this approach is to make the agents act more like human characters and less like omniscient intelligent beings. In this article, we present a perception model for simulation‐based story generation that introduces errors into characters' knowledge, (mis)leading them to non‐optimal, but still coherent, believable actions. The perception is executed using a description of the virtual world's elements using physical characteristics, and a pattern matching process that associates combinations of physical characteristics with predefined combinations of attributes, which are allowed to be wrong, and consequently may result in non‐perfect interpretations of the world. We developed a story generation system from the proposed model and tested it with a version of the Little Red Riding Hood story, famous for its perception failure. Our results show interesting variations for the traditional known ending. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)","Carvalho, David B.",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/coin.12088,318
837,,"Learning to program for the first time can be a daunting process, fraught with difficulty and setback. The novice learner is faced with learning two skills at the same time each that depends on the other; they are how a program needs to be constructed to solve a problem and how the structures of a program work towards solving a problem. In addition the learner has to develop practical skills such as how to design a solution, how to use the programming development environment, how to recognise errors, how to diagnose their cause and how to successfully correct them. The nature of learning how to program a computer can cause frustration to many and some to disengage before they have a chance to progress. Numerous authorities have observed that novice programmers make the same mistakes and encounter the same problems when learning their first programming language. The learner errors are usually from a fixed set of misconceptions that are easily corrected by experience and with appropriate guidance. This thesis demonstrates how a virtual animated pedagogical agent, called MRCHIPS, can extend the Beliefs-Desires-Intentions model of agency to provide mentoring and coaching support to novice programmers learning their first programming language, Python. The Cognitive Apprenticeship pedagogy provides the theoretical underpinning of the agent mentoring strategy. Case-Based Reasoning is also used to support MRCHIPS reasoning, coaching and interacting with the learner. The results indicate that in a small controlled study when novice learners are assisted by MRCHIPS they are more productive than those working without the assistance, and are better at problem solving exercises, there are also manifestations of higher of degree of engagement and learning of the language syntax.","Case, Desmond Robert",1,,319
838,Transgender Inclusion in University Nondiscrimination Statements: Challenging Gender-Conforming Privilege through Student Activism,"This case study focuses on policy change efforts to challenge gender-conforming privilege and gain protections for transgender individuals in higher education. This participatory action research centered on a facultystudent partnership in activism as the team worked to include the terms gender identity and expression in the university nondiscrimination policies to promote justice and equity for transgender students on campus. Using an approach we refer to as critical liberatory feminist pedagogy, this study examined the psychological, social, and institutional processes influencing student leadership for change and faculty pedagogical methods for encouraging student-initiated activism beyond the classroom. Student and faculty change agents described obstacles to change, action strategies, and the influence of privilege and power dynamics on the institutional change process. The insights gained from the collaborative facultystudent partnership are presented to inform others seeking innovative pedagogical practices and to create avenues for challenging privilege and power imbalances.","Case, K.

842,The Story of the Raven and the Robot,"The aim of this paper is to study the relationship of companion robots to the uncanny, using popular depictions of these robots. I start by presenting a few companion robots (& SECT;1), then try and define the idea of companion robots (using advertisements for these robot in & SECT;2 and with reference to M. Mori's hypothesis about the ""Uncanny Valley"" in & SECT;3). From Hoffmann's ""Der Sandmann,"" humanlike machines have been associated with uncarminess. On the contrary, companion robots are designed to be the least uncanny creatures or the most endearing ones. Of course, it is a bit uncanny to specifically design un-uncanny creatures. In the second half of my paper (& SECT;4, & SECT;5, & SECT;6, and & SECT;7), I discuss various scenes of our life with robots where the uncanny seems to creep back again. In fact, the companion robot is, as in Poe's poem, our contemporary Raven, with which a bond is formed that will be lifted-nevermore.","Cassou-Nogues, P.",0,,321
843,Expressive Copying Behavior for Social Agents: A Perceptual Analysis,"Successful human interaction commonly involves prototypical exchanges where interactors are engaged, synchronized, and harmonious in their behaviors. The copying of aspects of the other's behavior, at different levels, seems central to establishing and maintaining such empathic connections. Yet, many questions remain unanswered, particularly how it is possible to reflect the same affective content back to the other when the actual motion itself is not exactly the same as theirs. This paper presents a perceptual study in which emotional gestures conducted by an actor were mapped onto synthesized versions generated by an embodied virtual agent. Copying is at the expressive level, where qualities such as the fluidity or expansiveness of gestures are considered, rather than exact low-level motion matching. Participants were later asked to rate the emotional content of video recordings of both the original and the synthesized gestures. A statistical analysis shows that, in most cases, participants associated the emotional content of the agent's gestures with that intended to be expressed by the original actor. The results suggest that a combination of the type of movement performed and its quality is important for successfully communicating emotions.","Castellano, G.",0,10.1109/tsmca.2011.2172415,322
847,Uncovering the role of virtual agents in co-creation contexts: An application to the online wine business,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the roles of virtual agents in a virtual co-creation context by exploring their influence on online trust. An empirical study is conducted in the French online wine business to analyse the impacts of different dimensions of virtual agents on generating online trust. Design/methodology/approach Primary data were collected through a questionnaire targeting French online wine shoppers. Findings The results demonstrate a positive effect of the utility and hedonic functions of virtual agents on online trust. The findings also confirm the moderating role of the perceived risk. Research limitations/implications The authors' convenience sample shows a bias towards a lack of familiarity with virtual agents. Practical implications Wine business actors need to consider their customers' profiles in order to better adapt virtual agents' functionality and hence improve their customers' level of online trust while reducing their risk perception. Additionally, understanding virtual agents' roles can help identify the underlying mechanisms that emerge in a co-creation process. Originality/value The study contributes to a better understanding of the human dimension of co-creation by examining the different roles of virtual agents as sources of customers' online trust.","Castellano, S.",0,10.1108/md-04-2017-0444,323
851,,"One of the most prominent and potentially transformative trends in society today is machines becoming more human-like, driven by progress in artificial intelligence. How this trend will impact individuals, private and public organizations, and society as a whole is still unknown, and depends largely on how individual consumers choose to adopt and use these technologies. This dissertation focuses on understanding how consumers perceive, adopt, and use technologies that blur the line between human and machine, with two primary goals. First, I build on psychological and philosophical theories of mind perception, anthropomorphism, and dehumanization, and on management research into technology adoption, in order to develop a theoretical understanding of the forces that shape consumer adoption of these technologies. Second, I develop practical marketing interventions that can be used to influence patterns of adoption according to the desired outcome. This dissertation is organized as follows. Essay 1 develops a conceptual framework for understanding what AI is, what it can do, and what are some of the key antecedents and consequences of its’ adoption. The subsequent two Essays test various parts of this framework. Essay 2 explores consumers’ willingness to use algorithms to perform tasks normally done by humans, focusing specifically on how the nature of the task for which algorithms are used and the human-likeness of the algorithm itself impact consumers’ use of the algorithm. Essay 3 focuses on the use of social robots in consumption contexts, specifically addressing the role of robots’ physical and mental human-likeness in shaping consumers’ comfort with and perceived usefulness of such robots. Together, these three Essays offer an empirically supported conceptual structure for marketing researchers and practitioners to understand artificial intelligence and influence the processes through which consumers perceive and adopt it. Artificial intelligence has the potential to create enormous value for consumers, firms, and society, but also poses many profound challenges and risks. A better understanding of how this transformative technology is perceived and used can potentially help to maximize its potential value and minimize its risks.","Castelo, Noah",0,,324
852,"Effects of form and motion on judgments of social robots' animacy, likability, trustworthiness and unpleasantness","One of robot designers' main goals is to make robots as sociable as possible. Aside from improving robots' actual social functions, a great deal of effort is devoted to making them appear lifelike. This is often achieved by endowing the robot with an anthropomorphic body. However, psychological research on the perception of animacy suggests another crucial factor that might also contribute to attributions of animacy: movement characteristics. In the current study, we investigated how the combination of bodily appearance and movement characteristics of a robot can alter people's attributions of animacy, likability, trustworthiness, and unpleasantness. Participants played games of Tic-Tac-Toe against a robot which (1) either possessed a human form or did not, and (2) either exhibited smooth, lifelike movement or did not. Naturalistic motion was judged to be more animate than mechanical motion, but only when the robot resembled a human form. Naturalistic motion improved likeability regardless of the robot's appearance. Finally; a robot with a human form was rated as more disturbing when it moved naturalistically. Robot designers should be aware that movement characteristics play an important role in promoting robots' apparent animacy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

855,"""C'Mon dude!"": Users adapt their behaviour to a robotic agent with an attention model","Social cues facilitate engagement between interaction participants, whether they be two (or more) humans or a human and an artificial agent such as a robot. Previous work specific to human-agent/robot interaction has demonstrated the efficacy of implemented social behaviours, such as eye-gaze or facial gestures, for demonstrating the illusion of engagement and positively impacting interaction with a human. We describe the implementation of THAMBS, The Thinking Head Attention Model and Behavioural System, which is used to model attention controlling how a virtual agent reacts to external audio and visual stimuli within the context of an interaction with a human user. We evaluate the efficacy of THAMBS for a virtual agent mounted on a robotic platform in a controlled experimental setting, and collect both task- and behavioural-performance variables, along with self-reported ratings of engagement. Our results show that human subjects noticeably engaged more often, and in more interesting ways, with the robotic agent when THAMBS was activated, indicating that even a rudimentary display of attention by the robot elicits significantly increased attention by the human. Back-channelling had less of an effect on user behaviour. THAMBS and back-channelling did not interact and neither had an effect on self-report ratings. Our results concerning THAMBS hold implications for the design of successful human-robot interactive behaviours. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

862,Rapport with Virtual Agents: What Do Human Social Cues and Personality Explain?,"Rapport has been recognized as an important aspect of relationship building. While rapport in the context of human-human interaction has been widely studied, how it can be established and maintained in human-agent interaction has been studied only recently. Our study investigates how social cues and personality of a human interacting with an agent can be used for automatic prediction of rapport in this context. We conduct experiments with two emotional virtual agents. Alongside the audio-visual data, we also collect human personality measures and two measures of rapport: self-reported rapport and rapport judged by observers. The social cues, such as turn-taking patterns and facial expressions are extracted from audio-visual data. Our results show that the most significant cues that infer the rapport judgments are the number of turn-taking cues and pauses. We also find that some of the significant social cues related to rapport are similar to those reported in previous psychology literature. We also confirm previous findings on how human personality plays an important role in perceiving the interaction with agents-people who score high in extraversion and agreeableness report higher rapport with both agents. Finally, the rapport prediction results suggest that automatic analysis of social phenomena in human-agent interaction could be a feasible method for agent evaluation.","Cerekovic, A.",0,10.1109/taffc.2016.2545650,327
865,,"Many contemporary computer games, notably action and role‐playing games, represent an interesting class of navigation‐intensive dynamic real‐time simulations inhabited by autonomous intelligent virtual agents (IVAs). Although higher level reasoning of IVAs in these domains seems suited for action planning, planning is not widely adopted in existing games and similar applications. Moreover, statistically rigorous study measuring performance of planners in decision making in a game‐like domain is missing. Here, five classical planners were connected to the virtual environment of Unreal Development Kit along with a planner for delete‐free domains (only positive preconditions and positive effects). Performance of IVAs employing those planners and IVAs with reactive architecture was measured on a class of game‐inspired test environments of various sizes and under different levels of external interference. The analysis has shown that planning agents outperform reactive agents if (i) the size of the problem is small or if (b) the environment changes are either hostile to the agent or infrequent. In delete‐free domains, specialized approaches are inferior to classical planners because the lower expressivity of delete‐free domains results in lower plan quality. These results can help to determine when planning is advantageous in games and for IVAs control in other dynamic real‐time environments.

869,Integrating a cognitive computational model of planning and decision-making considering affective information,"Planning and decision-making are two of the cognitive functions involved in the solution of problems. These functions, among others, have been studied from the point of view of a new field known as cognitive informatics focused on the development of cognitive architectures, autonomous agents, and human robots that are capable of showing human-like behavior. We present an exhaustive study of current biological and computational models proposed in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive informatics. Also, we present a deep review of the brain areas involved in planning, decision-making, and affection. However, the majority of the proposed computational models are seeking to mimic human external behavior. This paper aims to contribute to the cognitive informatics field with an innovative cognitive computational model of planning and decision-making. The two main differences of our model with respect to the current models in the literature are: (i) our model considers affective and motivational information as a basic and essential trigger in planning and decision-making processes; (ii) our model attempts to mimic both the internal human brain as well as the external human behavior. We developed a computational model capable of offering a direct mapping from human brain areas to computational modules of our model. Thus, in this paper we present our model from a conceptual, formal, and computational approach in order to show how our proposal must be implemented. Finally, a set of tests were conducted in order to validate our proposal. These tests show an interesting comparison between the behavior of our prototype and the behavior exhibited by some people involved in a case study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

876,The influence of environmental aesthetics on economic value of housing: an empirical research on virtual environments,"Previous studies on house prices tend to focus on parameters such as location, size and view. Such studies ignored the influence of environmental aesthetics on house prices. Considering the scientific evidence that showed a significant effect of environmental aesthetic on people's environmental preference and behaviour, this study aims to investigate the influence of environmental aesthetic on estimated house prices. Twelve computer-simulated residential environments were created. Computer-simulated images vary on three categories to manipulate complexity and coherence along a street: (1) building location (attached, detached and both), (2) building height (same and different) and (3) building setback (same and different). Forty-seven university students viewed the computer-simulated environments and answered questions to evaluate aesthetic and economic values of each street. For the aesthetic value, participants evaluated the extent to which the environment is arousing, pleasant, exciting, relaxing, complex, coherent and safe. For the economic value, participants estimated market price (for sale and for rent) of a specific apartment on a computer simulation of a residential street. Results showed that estimated sale price was influenced by excitement, coherence and pleasantness; estimated rental price was influenced by complexity, arousal, coherence and pleasantness. This study aimed to pave the way for such studies by introducing an inspiring methodology and highlighting the importance of environmental aesthetics on house prices. Moreover, the findings have applied value for planners, urban designers and real estate agents.","Cetintahra, G. E.",0,10.1007/s10901-014-9413-6,331

In this case, avatar trust, the learners' perceived trust in the avatar instructor, plays an important role in learners' perceived intentions to participate in the e-learning activities. We assumed that social presence positively affects participation intention (PI) through avatar trust. The main purpose of this study is to empirically validate this hypothesis. Using two types of avatars as a moderating factor, our hypothesis was tested against 200 valid questionnaires. We found that social presence had a statistically significant influence on perceived PI through avatar trust, and that an attractive avatar type sheds stronger moderating effect on paths between social presence and avatar trust, and path between trust and participation than does an expert avatar type.","Chae, S.

881,,"The rapid escalation of technology and the widespread emergence of modern technological equipments have resulted in the generation of humongous amounts of digital data (in the form of images, videos and text). This has expanded the possibility of solving real world problems using computational learning frameworks. However, while gathering a large amount of data is cheap and easy, annotating them with class labels is an expensive process in terms of time, labor and human expertise. This has paved the way for research in the field of active learning. Such algorithms automatically select the salient and exemplar instances from large quantities of unlabeled data and are effective in reducing human labeling effort in inducing classification models. To utilize the possible presence of multiple labeling agents, there have been attempts towards a batch mode form of active learning, where a batch of data instances is selected simultaneously for manual annotation. This dissertation is aimed at the development of novel batch mode active learning algorithms to reduce manual effort in training classification models in real world multimedia pattern recognition applications. Four major contributions are proposed in this work: (i) a framework for dynamic batch mode active learning, where the batch size and the specific data instances to be queried are selected adaptively through a single formulation, based on the complexity of the data stream in question, (ii) a batch mode active learning strategy for fuzzy label classification problems, where there is an inherent imprecision and vagueness in the class label definitions, (iii) batch mode active learning algorithms based on convex relaxations of an NP-hard integer quadratic programming (IQP) problem, with guaranteed bounds on the solution quality and (iv) an active matrix completion algorithm and its application to solve several variants of the active learning problem (transductive active learning, multi-label active learning, active feature acquisition and active learning for regression). These contributions are validated on the face recognition and facial expression recognition problems (which are commonly encountered in real world applications like robotics, security and assistive technology for the blind and the visually impaired) and also on collaborative filtering applications like movie recommendation.","Chakraborty, Shayok",0,,333
882,,"This thesis aims at defining a new learning method to improve knowledge acquisition for intelligent tutoring systems. Learning is a complex phenomenon interlinking both emotional and cognitive mechanisms on conscious and unconscious levels. We are interested in understanding the unconscious mechanisms involved in human reasoning for knowledge acquisition. The importance of these unconscious processes is well documented in neuroscience, but remains largely unexplored in our research field. In this thesis, we put forward a new pedagogical approach in the field of education based on a taxonomy of human perception in neuroscience. We show that this method improves on reasoning which in turn enhances overall learning and inductive capabilities for knowledge acquisition in a problem solving environment. In a first part, we present the implementation of our new method in a tutorial system to improve reasoning hence leading to better learning. Furthermore, acknowledging the importance of emotional mechanisms in learning, we therefore recorded, in this first part, the emotional reactions of users using physiological sensors. The effectiveness of our method for learning and its positive impact on emotions has been validated on 31 participants. In a second part, we go further in our research and enhance our approach in order to improve reasoning for a better induction of knowledge. Induction in a bottom-up logical reasoning approach where one constructs general rules from observed examples.

883,Putting the Art in Artificial: Aesthetic Responses to Computer-Generated Art,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technology increasingly becomes a feature of everyday life, it is important to understand how creative acts, regarded as uniquely human, can be valued if produced by a machine. The current studies sought to investigate how observers respond to works of visual art created either by humans or by computers. Study 1 tested observers' ability to discriminate between computer-generated and man-made art, and then examined how categorization of art works impacted on perceived aesthetic value, revealing a bias against computer-generated art. In Study 2 this bias was reproduced in the context of robotic art; however, it was found to be reversed when observers were given the opportunity to see robotic artists in action. These findings reveal an explicit prejudice against computer-generated art, driven largely by the kind of art observers believe computer algorithms are capable of producing. These prejudices can be overridden in circumstances in which observers are able to infer anthropomorphic characteristics in the computer programs, a finding which has implications for the future of artistic AI.","Chamberlain, R.",0,10.1037/aca0000136,335
887,An experimental approach to study the physiology of natural social interactions,"The classical experimental methodology is ill-suited for the investigation of the behavioral and physiological correlates of natural social interactions. A new experimental approach combining a natural conversation between two persons with control conditions is proposed in this paper. Behavior, including gaze direction and speech, and physiology, including electrodermal activity, are recorded during a discussion between two participants through videoconferencing. Control for the social aspect of the interaction is provided by the use of an artificial agent and of videoed conditions. A cover story provides spurious explanations for the purpose of the experiment and for the recordings, as well as a controlled and engaging topic of discussion. Preprocessing entails transforming raw measurements into boxcar and delta functions time series indicating when a certain behaviour or physiological event is present. The preliminary analysis presented here consists in finding statistically significant differences between experimental conditions in the temporal associations between behavioral and physiological time series. Significant results validate the experimental approach and further developments including more elaborate analysis and adaptation of the paradigm to functional MRI are discussed.","Chaminade, T.",0,10.1075/is.18.2.06gry,336
888,Atypical modulation of hypothalamic activity by social context in ASD,"High-functioning individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),and age- and verbal IQ-matched controls (CTL) were fMRI scanned when playing ""stone paper scissors"". They believed they were playing against three different opponents: a Human, a Robot endowed with an artificial intelligence attempting to win the game, and a Computer running a random number generator. No differences between ASD and CTL reached significance in canonical mentalizing regions, in the medial prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction. In contrast, activity in a cluster located in the left hypothalamus, attributed to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PHN), increased in the CTL, but not ASD, group when participants played against the human compared to the artificial agent. The left temporoparietal junction (ITPJ), that has been previously associated with anthropomorphization, influenced this PHN cluster activity differently between groups, with a significantly negative functional connectivity when CTL played against the robot and when ASD participants played against the human. Brain activity results are consistent with the hypothesis that hypothalamus-secreted neurohormones, including oxytocin, could support motivation for social interactions and be impaired in autism. Brain connectivity results suggest that cortical encoding of social context information, putatively related to anthropomorphism, has a reversed effect on hypothalamus activity in autism.

Only typically developing controls depicted the expected preference for biological motion when rendered with human, but not cartoon, characters. Despite performing the task to report a preference, children with autism depicted neither normal nor reversed anthropomorphic bias, suggesting that they are not sensitive to the congruence of form and motion information when observing computer-animated agents' actions.","Chaminade, T.",0,10.1177/1362361313512425,338
898,,"Critical consciousness represents the transformation from a passive target of oppression to an active agent with greater capacity to analyze and negotiate conditions of oppression. It has been considered as an antidote for oppression that can liberate people from oppressive ideologies and empower them to challenge social injustice. Despite that critical consciousness has often been discussed in pedagogical literature and applied in community interventions, very few studies have attempted to empirically examine the psychological benefits brought by critical consciousness. The three articles in this dissertation aim to understand whether and how critical consciousness functions as an internal resource for psychological resilience (article 1), social resistance (article 2), and civic development (article 3). Article 1 examines the resilience effects of critical consciousness in protecting against stigma-related stressors among a sample of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals. Findings showed that LGBT individuals with higher level of critical consciousness were likely to resist the internalization of negative stereotypes associated with their sexual identity, which could buffer the effect of felt stigma on psychological distress. Drawing on the sociopolitical development theory, article 2 utilizes cross-sectional and prospective cohort research designs to examine the liberating and empowering mechanisms through which critical consciousness gives rise to collective action for LGBT rights. Results indicated that critical consciousness were associated with lower level of oppressive ideology and higher level of collective efficacy among LGBT individuals and cisgender heterosexual individuals. This in turn contributed to stronger intention to participate in collective action to resist sexual orientation-and/or gender identity- (SOGI-) based oppression. Grounded on the empowerment theory, article 3 investigates the effect of critical consciousness and sociopolitical control on civic engagement and well-being among emerging adults in Hong Kong and mainland China using cross-regional and cross-lagged panel designs. Findings indicated that sociopolitical control but not critical consciousness was related to greater civic engagement and better well-being among emerging adults. Theoretically speaking, this dissertation fills the literature gap by empirically revealing the benefits of critical consciousness on psychological resilience to oppressive experience and collective resistance to social injustice. The present research is a significant endeavor in providing quantitative evidence on the effects of critical consciousness. It extends the scope of critical consciousness from the reflection of oppressive experiences to the recognition of oneself as the perpetrators of oppression. As effective social change requires collaborative efforts between different groups in the society, it is equally important to understand the effects of critical consciousness on members of oppressed and dominant groups. Practically speaking, critical consciousness can serve as a target for intervention in different settings. Findings indicate the potential of cultivating critical consciousness as a resilience resource among students and clients with oppressed identities in educational and clinical settings to transform their oppressive experience and protect them from poor mental health. In addition, it informs civil society organizations and advocacy groups on the ways to enhance public awareness of oppressive systems and promote participation in collective action to eradicate unjust social arrangements by leveraging critical consciousness. Given that oppression is deeply entrenched in hegemonic ideologies and unequal power relations, only with praxis (i.e., reflection and action) can wellness and justice be simultaneously achieved.","Chan, Chun Ho",0,,339

Focusing on co-enactment as a critical feature of scaffolding activities, we introduce ""reverse scaffolding"", wherein experts enact for novices only what they ""know"" to do rather than what they ""do not know"" to do. We demonstrate our approach by discussing a novel technological learning activity, Giant Steps for Algebra, wherein students construct models of realistic narratives. We argue for the method's potential via reporting on findings from mixed-methods analyses of a quasi-experimental implementation with 40 students.","Chase, Kiera",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11858-015-0710-7,342
905,Virtual agents in retail web sites: Benefits of simulated social interaction for older users,"This study investigates the benefits of simulated social interaction (social presence) through virtual agents for older users' experience in retail Web sites, particularly with respect to age-related barriers to the adoption of online retailing. In Study 1, through four focus group interviews, we identified six social-psychological barriers to the adoption of online shopping among older users (mean age of 73 years). These included barriers relating to perceived risks, trust, social support, familiarity, experience, and search. In Study 2, a laboratory experiment with older users (mean age of 69 years) demonstrated that embedding a virtual agent that serves search and navigational/procedural support functions in the online store leads to increased perceived social support, trust, and patronage intention for the online store. Mediational analyses further revealed that the effect of virtual agents: (1) on trust is mediated by perceived social support; and (2) on patronage intentions is mediated in part by trust and perceived risks. The study provides important implications on the design of virtual agents for older users of e-commerce applications, and on building online trust and e-service patronage through virtual agents.

A task-competency and reciprocity perspective for older adults","This study investigates whether social-versus task-oriented interaction of virtual shopping assistants differentially benefits low versus high Internet competency older consumers with respect to social (perceived interactivity, trust), cognitive (perceived information load), functional (self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness), and behavioral intent (website patronage intent) outcomes in an online shopping task. A total of 121 older adults (61-89 years) participated in a laboratory experiment with a 2 (digital assistant interaction style: (social-vs. task-oriented) x 2 (user Internet competency: low vs. high) x 2 (user exchange modality: text vs. voice) between-subjects design. The results revealed that users Internet competency and the digital assistant's conversational style had significant interaction effects on social, functional, and behavioral intent outcomes. Social-oriented digital assistants lead to superior social outcomes (enhanced perceptions of two-way interactivity and trust in the integrity of the site) for older users with high Internet competency, who need less task-related assistance. On the other hand, low-competency older users showed significantly superior cognitive (lower perceived information load) and functional outcomes (greater perceived ease and self-efficacy of using the site) when the digital assistant employed a task-oriented interaction style. Theoretical and agent design implications are discussed.","Chattaraman, V.",0,10.1016/j.chb.2018.08.048,344
912,Understanding Emotions in Text Using Deep Learning and Big Data,"Big Data and Deep Learning algorithms combined with enormous computing power have paved ways for significant technological advancements. Technology is evolving to anticipate, understand and address our unmet needs. However, to fully meet human needs, machines or computers must deeply understand human behavior including emotions. Emotions are physiological states generated in humans as a reaction to internal or external events. They are complex and studied across numerous fields including computer science. As humans, on reading ""Why don't you ever text me!"", we can either interpret it as a sad or an angry emotion and the same ambiguity exists for machines as well. Lack of facial expressions and voice modulations make detecting emotions in text a challenging problem. However, in today's online world, humans are increasingly communicating using text messaging applications and digital agents. Hence, it is imperative for machines to understand emotions in textual dialogue to provide emotionally aware responses to users. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Learning based approach to detect emotions- Happy, Sad and Angry in textual dialogues. The essence of our approach lies in combining both semantic and sentiment based representations for more accurate emotion detection. We use semi-automated techniques to gather large scale training data with diverse ways of expressing emotions to train our model. Evaluation of our approach on real world dialogue datasets reveals that it significantly outperforms traditional Machine Learning baselines as well as other off-the-shelf Deep Learning models.","Chatterjee, A.",0,10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.029,345
918,Familiar faces rendered strange: Why inconsistent realism drives characters into the uncanny valley,"Computer-modeled characters resembling real people sometimes elicit cold, eerie feelings. This effect, called the uncanny valley, has been attributed to uncertainty about whether the character is human or living or real. Uncertainty, however, neither explains why anthropomorphic characters lie in the uncanny valley nor their characteristic eeriness. We propose that realism inconsistency causes anthropomorphic characters to appear unfamiliar, despite their physical similarity to real people, owing to perceptual narrowing. We further propose that their unfamiliar, fake appearance elicits cold, eerie feelings, motivating threat avoidance. In our experiment, 365 participants categorized and rated objects, animals, and humans whose realism was manipulated along consistency-reduced and control transitions. These data were used to quantify a Bayesian model of categorical perception. In hypothesis testing, we found reducing realism consistency did not make objects appear less familiar, but only animals and humans, thereby eliciting cold, eerie feelings. Next, structural equation models elucidated the relation among realism inconsistency (measured objectively in a two-dimensional Morlet wavelet domain inspired by the primary visual cortex), realism, familiarity, eeriness, and warmth. The fact that reducing realism consistency only elicited cold, eerie feelings toward anthropomorphic characters, and only when it lessened familiarity, indicates the role of perceptual narrowing in the uncanny valley.","Chattopadhyay, D.",0,10.1167/16.11.7,346
920,,"Human relationships have long been studied by scientists from domains like sociology, psychology, literature, etc. for understanding people's desires, goals, actions and expected behaviors. In this dissertation we study inter-personal relationships as expressed in natural language text. Modeling inter-personal relationships from text finds application in general natural language understanding, as well as real-world domains such as social networks, discussion forums, intelligent virtual agents, etc. We propose that the study of relationships should incorporate not only linguistic cues in text, but also the contexts in which these cues appear. Our investigations, backed by empirical evaluation, support this thesis, and demonstrate that the task benefits from using structured models that incorporate both types of information. We present such structured models to address the task of modeling the nature of relationships between any two given characters from a narrative. To begin with, we assume that relationships are of two types: cooperative and non-cooperative. We first describe an approach to jointly infer relationships between all characters in the narrative, and demonstrate how the task of characterizing the relationship between two characters can benefit from including information about their relationships with other characters in the narrative. We next formulate the relationship-modeling problem as a sequence prediction task to acknowledge the evolving nature of human relationships, and demonstrate the need to model the history of a relationship in predicting its evolution. Thereafter, we present a data-driven method to automatically discover various types of relationships such as familial, romantic, hostile, etc. Like before, we address the task of modeling evolving relationships but don't restrict ourselves to two types of relationships. We also demonstrate the need to incorporate not only local historical but also global context while solving this problem. Lastly, we demonstrate a practical application of modeling inter-personal relationships in the domain of online educational discussion forums. Such forums offer opportunities for its users to interact and form deeper relationships. With this view, we address the task of identifying initiation of such deeper relationships between a student and the instructor. Specifically, we analyze contents of the forums to automatically suggest threads to the instructors that require their intervention. By highlighting scenarios that need direct instructor-student interactions, we alleviate the need for the instructor to manually peruse all threads of the forum and also assist students who have limited avenues for communicating with instructors. We do this by incorporating the discourse structure of the thread through latent variables that abstractly represent contents of individual posts and model the flow of information in the thread. Such latent structured models that incorporate the linguistic cues without losing their context can be helpful in other related natural language understanding tasks as well. We demonstrate this by using the model for a very different task: identifying if a stated desire has been fulfilled by the end of a story.","Chaturvedi, Snigdha",0,,347

The agent is aiming to provide cognitive support to users with learning difficulties and attention disorders and is designed to accommodate self regulated learning elements. We review the basic principles of self regulated learning which, in turn, act as a basis for designing and implementing our system. Kolb's learning cycle is used to provide a framework upon which agents' pedagogical behaviour is constructed. A study between 24 students from higher education with learning difficulties and attention disorders is presented. The learning particularities of this special group that contradict with the principles of self regulated learning are reported. The study refers to students in higher education, in the domain of information technology. The analysis of results indicates that emotional agents improve communication between users of the particular learning group and learning environments by providing cognitive support through behavioural communication, compared to agents with neutral behaviour.","Chatzara, K.",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10639-014-9320-1,348

The goal of this dissertation was to design, implement, and evaluate an affective agent that provides affective support in real-time in order to enrich the student’s learning experience and performance by inducing and/or maintaining a productive learning path. This work combined research and best practices from affective computing, intelligent tutoring systems, and educational technology to address the design and implementation of an affective agent and corresponding pedagogical interventions. It included the incorporation of the affective agent into an Exploratory Learning Environment (ELE) adapted for this research. A gendered, three-dimensional, animated, human-like character accompanied by text- and speech-based dialogue visually represented the proposed affective agent. The agent’s pedagogical interventions considered inputs from the ELE (interface, model building, and performance events) and from the user (emotional and cognitive events). The user’s emotional events captured by biometric sensors and processed by a decision-level fusion algorithm for a multimodal system in combination with the events from the ELE informed the production-rule-based behavior engine to define and trigger pedagogical interventions. The pedagogical interventions were focused on affective dimensions and occurred in the form of affective dialogue prompts and animations. An experiment was conducted to assess the impact of the affective agent, Hope, on the student’s learning experience and performance. In terms of the student’s learning experience, the effect of the agent was analyzed in four components: perception of the instructional material, perception of the usefulness of the agent, ELE usability, and the affective responses from the agent triggered by the student’s affective states. Additionally, in terms of the student’s performance, the effect of the agent was analyzed in five components: tasks completed, time spent solving a task, planning time while solving a task, usage of the provided help, and attempts to successfully complete a task. The findings from the experiment did not provide the anticipated results related to the effect of the agent; however, the results provided insights to improve diverse components in the design of affective agents as well as for the design of the behavior engines and algorithms to detect, represent, and handle affective information.","Chavez Echeagaray, Maria Elena",0,,350
926,Personality of social robots perceived through the appearance,"Past research showed that people are able to perceive the personality of others at zero acquaintances. There are two main ways, verbal and non-verbal methods, which play an important role for one in perceiving personality of others. Extensive research was conducted in relating personality with verbal, paralinguistic and gestures cues. However, there are not much research, to our knowledge, that relates the appearance and perceived personality of robots. The main objective of this research is to relate individual design features with big five perceived personality of the robots. We used the results of rated perceptions across 100 pictorial images of robots and relate the results with the 40 individual design features using General Linear Model (GLM). The initial results of the GLM analysis showed that participants' rating of personality of robot fell along the dimension of perceived friendliness which is a common rotation of extroversion and agreeableness. Some relationships were found between humanlike design features and perceived friendliness of robots. Since participants are more familiar with humans, participants perceived robots with humanlike features friendlier than the others. Some other findings such as color and surface material were found related with participants' perceived friendliness as well. In the future, we will work on the analysis of the main and interaction effects of individual features on user's perceived friendliness.","Chee, B. T. T.",0,10.3233/wor-2012-0168-272,351

Progress toward realistic simulation of human appearance, behavior, and interaction in the fields of robotics and computer-graphics has been accompanied by interest in the Uncanny Valley Hypothesis. The UVH posits that the use of anthropomorphic realism in the design of characters and objects (e.g., robots, prostheses) might have a counterproductive effect. Instead of enhancing subjective experience of the character or object, certain degrees of greater realism might unsettle the observer and induce a negative affective state. This state is marked by feelings of personal disquiet and a sense of strangeness (i.e., an uncanny effect). Mori did not develop the UVH further or subject his idea to empirical test.

937,"Perceptual discrimination difficulty and familiarity in the Uncanny Valley: more like a ""Happy Valley""","The Uncanny Valley Hypothesis (UVH) predicts that greater difficulty perceptually discriminating between categorically ambiguous human and humanlike characters (e.g., highly realistic robot) evokes negatively valenced (i.e., uncanny) affect. An ABX perceptual discrimination task and signal detection analysis was used to examine the profile of perceptual discrimination (PD) difficulty along the UVH' dimension of human likeness (DHL). This was represented using avatar-to-human morph continua. Rejecting the implicitly assumed profile of PD difficulty underlying the UVH' prediction, Experiment 1 showed that PD difficulty was reduced for categorically ambiguous faces but, notably, enhanced for human faces. Rejecting the UVH' predicted relationship between PD difficulty and negative affect (assessed in terms of the UVH' familiarity dimension), Experiment 2 demonstrated that greater PD difficulty correlates with more positively valenced affect. Critically, this effect was strongest for the ambiguous faces, suggesting a correlative relationship between PD difficulty and feelings of familiarity more consistent with the metaphor happy valley. This relationship is also consistent with a fluency amplification instead of the hitherto proposed hedonic fluency account of affect along the DHL. Experiment 3 found no evidence that the asymmetry in the profile of PD along the DHL is attributable to a differential processing bias (cf. other-race effect), i.e., processing avatars at a category level but human faces at an individual level. In conclusion, the present data for static faces show clear effects that, however, strongly challenge the UVH' implicitly assumed profile of PD difficulty along the DHL and the predicted relationship between this and feelings of familiarity.","Cheetham, M.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01219,354
940,"Arousal, valence, and the uncanny valley: psychophysiological and self-report findings","The main prediction of the Uncanny Valley Hypothesis (UVH) is that observation of humanlike characters that are difficult to distinguish from the human counterpart will evoke a state of negative affect. Well-established electrophysiological [late positive potential (LPP) and facial electromyography (EMG)] and self-report [Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)] indices of valence and arousal, i.e., the primary orthogonal dimensions of affective experience, were used to test this prediction by examining affective experience in response to categorically ambiguous compared with unambiguous avatar and human faces (N = 30). LPP and EMG provided direct psychophysiological indices of affective state during passive observation and the SAM provided self-reported indices of affective state during explicit cognitive evaluation of static facial stimuli. The faces were drawn from well-controlled morph continua representing the UVH' dimension of human likeness (DHL). The results provide no support for the notion that category ambiguity along the DHL is specifically associated with enhanced experience of negative affect. On the contrary, the LPP and SAM-based measures of arousal and valence indicated a general increase in negative affective state (i.e., enhanced arousal and negative valence) with greater morph distance from the human end of the DHL. A second sample (N = 30) produced the same finding, using an ad hoc self-rating scale of feelings of familiarity, i.e., an oft-used measure of affective experience along the UVH' familiarity dimension. In conclusion, this multi-method approach using well-validated psychophysiological and self-rating indices of arousal and valence rejects for passive observation and for explicit affective evaluation of static faces the main prediction of the UVH.","Cheetham, M.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00981,355
944,,"Human survival critically relies on communicating a broad set of social messages including physical states and mental states. The prerequisite for any successful social communication is the shared knowledge between the sender and the receiver about what and how a specific social signal is used. To communicate the broad set of social messages in daily life, human beings have developed complex facial movement patterns as one of the most important and powerful social signals. With increasing globalization, cross-cultural interactions are fast becoming integral to modern life, which presents increasing pressure for cross-cultural communication. Specifically, a broad set of facial expressions including conversational facial expressions is critical for clear communication because they guide the flow of social exchanges. Yet, our knowledge of such facial movement patterns is relatively limited in terms of their functions in different cultural context – for example, whether these important everyday facial expressions are understood across cultures or cause cross-cultural confusions. In this thesis, I explored how facial movement patterns are used in Western and East Asian culture to communicate a broad set of social messages including physical states and mental states. Specifically, I objectively characterized the structure of dynamic facial expression patterns using 4D computer graphics and a data-driven social psychophysics method. I then examined the role of culture in signaling and receiving facial expressions using the signal detection theory and Mutual Information analysis. Together, my results reveal for the first time how specific facial movement patterns are used to communicate a broad set of social messages in Western and East Asian culture and how culture shapes the signalling and perception of such facial expressions in cross-cultural communication. Finally, I discussed the implication of my results in the field of psychology, computer science and social robotics, with links to my future work on developing a mathematical model of face social signalling and transfer this knowledge to socially and culturally sensitive conversational agents.","Chen, Chaona",0,,356

This study proposes an agent-based mechanism that integrates problem-solving and inquiry-based instructions to help students better understand complex scientific concepts and to sustain their motivation to learn science. In this study, a quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance and feasibility of our proposed mechanism.

953,Toward a Brain-Inspired System: Deep Recurrent Reinforcement Learning for a Simulated Self-Driving Agent,"An effective way to achieve intelligence is to simulate various intelligent behaviors in the human brain. In recent years, bio-inspired learning methods have emerged, and they are different from the classical mathematical programming principle. From the perspective of brain inspiration, reinforcement learning has gained additional interest in solving decision-making tasks as increasing neuroscientific research demonstrates that significant links exist between reinforcement learning and specific neural substrates. Because of the tremendous research that focuses on human brains and reinforcement learning, scientists have investigated how robots can autonomously tackle complex tasks in the form of making a self-driving agent control in a human-like way. In this study, we propose an end-to-end architecture using novel deep-Q-network architecture in conjunction with a recurrence to resolve the problem in the field of simulated self-driving. The main contribution of this study is that we trained the driving agent using a brain-inspired trial-and-error technique, which was in line with the real world situation. Besides, there are three innovations in the proposed learning network: raw screen outputs are the only information which the driving agent can rely on, a weighted layer that enhances the differences of the lengthy episode, and a modified replay mechanism that overcomes the problem of sparsity and accelerates learning. The proposed network was trained and tested under a third-party OpenAI Gym environment. After training for several episodes, the resulting driving agent performed advanced behaviors in the given scene. We hope that in the future, the proposed brain-inspired learning system would inspire practicable self-driving control solutions.","Chen, J. N.",0,10.3389/fnbot.2019.00040,359
957,,"Object discovery and representation lies at the heart of computer vision, and therefore it has attracted widespread interest in the past several decades. Early efforts were largely based on single template models, bag-of-visual-word models, and part-based models. To represent the intra-class variety of the same type of object and address partial occlusion problem in images, more complex object representations, like attribute-based and part-based models, have been proposed. The advent of the Internet, however, enables one to obtain a comprehensive set of images describing the same object as viewed from different angles and perspectives, and its natural association with other objects. This opens up new opportunities and challenges: Given that for the first time we have millions of exemplars of an object embedded in its natural context, can one effectively mimic human-like cognition and build up prototypes (comprising parts, their different views, and their spatial relationships) for each object category? The well-known supervised approach relies heavily on well labeled image datasets and it (i) is still prohibitively hard for image labeling to catch up with the speed of image crawling, and (ii) does not lead to succinct prototype models for each category, which can then be used to locate object instances in a query. In my dissertation, we investigated the open problem of constructing part-based object representation models from very large scale image databases in an unsupervised manner. To achieve this goal, we first define a network model from a full Bayesian setting. This augmented network model has spatial information in it, and is scale invariant throughout any image resolution variations in the learning set. This network model is able to find visual templates of the same part with dramatically different visual appearances, which, in existing models, have to be added manually or using text information from the Internet. We show that the global spatial structure of the underlying and unknown objects can be restored completely from the recorded pairwise relative position data. We also developed an approach to learn the graphical model in a completely unsupervised manner from a large set of unlabeled data, and the corresponding algorithm to do detection using the learned model. We also apply our algorithm to various crawled and archived datasets, show that our approach is computationally scalable and can construct part-based models much more efficiently than those presented in the recent computer vision literature.","Chen, Lichao",0,,360

It occurs in many dialog applications, such as intelligent tutors, virtual games, health communication systems and human-robot cooperation. Off-task speech input to computers presents both challenges and opportunities for such dialog systems. On the one hand, off-task speech contains informal conversational style and potentially unbounded scope that hamper accurate speech recognition. On the other hand, an automated agent capable of detecting off-task speech could track users’ attention and thereby maintain the intended conversation by bringing a user back on task; also, knowledge of where off-task speech events are likely to occur can help the analysis of automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors. Related work has been done in confidence measures for dialog systems and detecting out-of-domain utterances. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the type of off-task speech being detected and generality of features capturing off-task speech. In addition, we know of no published research on detecting off-task speech in children’s interactions with an automated agent. The goal of this research is to fill in these blanks to provide a systematic study of off-task speech, with an emphasis on child-machine interactions. To characterize off-task speech quantitatively, we used acoustic features to capture its speaking style; we used lexical features to capture its linguistic content; and we used contextual features to capture the relation of off-task speech to nearby utterances. Using these features, we trained an off-task speech detector that yielded 87% detection rate at a cost of 10% false positives on children’s oral reading. Furthermore, we studied the generality of these types of features by detecting off-task speech in data from four tutorial tasks ranging from oral reading to prompted free-form responses. In addition, we examined how the features help detect adults' off-task speech in data from the CMU Let's Go bus information system. We show that lexical features detect more task-related off-task speech such as complaints about the system, whereas acoustic features detect more unintelligible speech and non-speech events such as mumbling and humming. Moreover, acoustic features tend to be more robust than lexical features when switching domains. Finally, we demonstrate how off-task speech detection can improve the performance on application-relevant metrics such as predicting fluency test scores in oral reading and understanding utterances in the CMU Let's Go bus information system.","Chen, Wei",0,,361
959,,"This thesis investigates the influence of social networks on traveler behavior and the application of mining big social media data in transportation. It consists of four distinct contributions. Each examines a different dimension of traveler choices or phenomenon in transportation situations. The first study explores information diffusion through social networks and its impact on the formation of user attitudes that influence their behavior, especially towards sustainable transportation. The objective of this research is to present a model of social network-based attitude diffusion in the context of activity and travel choice behavior. The principal mechanisms that contribute to attitude formation are first identified and then mathematical models are developed to capture these processes. The primary contributions of this research are (1) modeling attitude diffusion according to social and learning mechanisms and (2) the evolution of these attitudes over time in a lattice neighborhood social network. The agent-based framework presented is sufficiently general and flexible to allow the building of a more complete representation of information diffusion and attitude formation within activity and travel behavior choice dimensions (e.g., mode choice or departure time choice). The framework allows extending the presented approach with additional social network structures, information sources, and social interaction mechanisms in the physical and virtual realms, or extending and modifying the presented approach to simulate the impact of information-based management strategies. This research develops an application to adopt a new Park-and-Ride (P&R) alternative in four types of social networks. The second study investigates the impact of social networks on drivers’ route choice behavior. Route choice is a daily question that drivers face under varying traffic conditions. Although a variety of studies have focused on route choice behavior, actual route choice behavior on real-world networks and the mechanisms that govern it have eluded complete characterization. Part of the difficulty has been the growing availability of multiple information sources that may influence drivers’ route choices, precluding the collection of adequate observational data. In addition, with the continuing emergence of new forms and sources of information, such as social media with varying degrees of interactivity, engagement, and immediacy, existing frameworks and models for representing these choices and the influence of new information sources have been lacking. This study uses an agent-based modeling approach to investigate the effects of social influence on drivers’ route choice. The drivers communicate with each other in the same social network and this information is combined with their previous experiences. The first aim of this study is to investigate the impact of social network connectivity and information exchange on route choice. The second is to characterize when all drivers in the social network are satisfied with their route choices. The simulation results show that a boundedly rational equilibrium is achieved when all drivers in the given social network are satisfied with their current route choices.

Using data from an online location-based social network, the aim is to explore the spatiality of destinations in the context of social networks and the social network influence on travelers’ destination choice. Analysis results show that social relationships play a role in travelers’ destination choice and that distance between friends plays a strong role in social networks as in location choice.

That is, as opposed to being constructed through reflective processes, brand personality traits seem to exist a priori inside consumers' minds, such that the authors are able to predict what brand a person is thinking about solely on the basis of the relationship between brand personality associations and brain activity. These findings represent an important advance in the application of neuroscientific methods to consumer research, moving from work focused on cataloging brain regions associated with marketing stimuli to testing and refining constructs central to theories of consumer behavior.","Chen, Y.

966,We care about you: Incorporating pet characteristics with educational agents through reciprocal caring approach,"Although different educational agents have been proposed to facilitate student learning, most of them operate from a ""smart"" (i.e., intelligent and autonomous) perspective. Recently, a so-called ""non-smart"" perspective is also attracting increasing interest, and is now regarded as a topic worthwhile of researching. To this end, this study utilizes a reciprocal caring approach for the development of a pet-styled educational agent, named My-Pet, designed to help elementary school students learn Chinese idioms. The effects of the reciprocal caring approach are evaluated in two experiments. The results indicate that the My-Pet system could enhance students' relationship with educational agents, but do not contribute to students' learning achievement and efficiency. Based on these results, some implications on the value aspect of motivation and reflections on the further design of educational agents are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

967,When educational agents meet surrogate competition: Impacts of competitive educational agents on students' motivation and performance,"The design of educational agents increasingly attracts researchers' attention recently. One of major reasons is that educational agents could enhance student learning in various aspects. Although research in this area has mushroomed, such research mainly emphasizes on students in higher education. It is still unclear how educational agents influence young student learning. In addition, competition is a significant element, but fewer studies take competition into account while designing educational agents. Although some studies have indicated that educational agents in competitive environments has positive effects on students' perception and attribution, its impacts on students' motivation and performance are unclear. Thus, the study develops an integrative agent that combines educational and competitive elements for young students, and further examines its influences, in terms of motivation and learning performance. The results revealed that such competitive educational agents could enhance students' motivation and learning performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Chen, Z.

969,"Representations of Animal Companions on Student Learning Perception: Static, Animated and Tangible","Educational agents (including animal companions) are a kind of interface agent, which is a significant component in educational systems, and has great impacts on student learning. However, with the development of emerging technologies (e.g., tangible technology), few studies have yet investigated how tangible technology can be used to combine with animal companions to foster student learning and interaction. In addition, different representation styles of animal companions on student learning are also seldom investigated. To address these research questions, this paper develops a My-Dragon system which blends tangible and animal companions for maximizing young student interaction. The system is further evaluated by an empirical study by eighteen pupils compared with a static and an animated version. The results reveal that such a tangible system is of benefit to the student learning perception in terms of attention, emotion, and interaction aspects. Some implications on findings and future system development are also discussed.","Chen, Z. H.",1,,367
971,,"‘Education’ is widely regarded as the primary agent of transformation towards ‘sustainable development (SD). In England, ‘Education for Sustainable Development’ (ESD) has been an established part of the National Curriculum, but in secondary schools, the subject of music, which seems to have great potential for helping in creating interest and awareness of SD to foster responsible behaviours, appears more often to be ignored. There is a growing enthusiasm for, and anecdotal recognition of, the benefits of using music in the teaching of SD issues to young people amongst educators and musicians. However, no in-depth ESD empirical research with regard to music education and few ESD good practices currently exist. To this end, the PhD, which examines the pedagogical potential of music in ESD and the role of music as a learning medium in the development of students’ capacities necessary for a more sustainable future, fills this research gap. An ethnographical intervention, informed by constructionist and symbolic interactionist approaches, is employed in this project. Sets of music-SD lessons in the lower stages of four secondary schools in London boroughs were analysed as case studies of how SD might be taught in music classrooms. Evidence suggested that it is feasible and beneficial to embed SD into the secondary music curriculum. The findings demonstrated that a transformative pedagogical approach in ESD was achieved by combining different methods for integration, including listening, composing and performing pieces of music, raps and songs on SD and creating and performing junk instruments, with a range of strategies of ESD, such as discussion, audio and visual activities, brainstorming and co-operative work, in a holistic process. For some students, compared with the traditional subjects for ESD, such as geography and science, the particular ways of learning SD within the musical context seemingly resulted in their higher level of enthusiastic, active, participative, affective and transformative learning, and thus positively affected the achievement of the outcomes of ESD, which was manifested in the development of their SD-related understandings, skills, attitudes and potential behaviours.","Cheng, Yusi",0,,368
972,,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the causative organism for a wide range of infectious diseases from superficial skin infections to dangerous bacteremias. Six pathogens named ESKAPE pathogens are responsible for majority of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. MRSA is the single most prevalent ESKAPE pathogen. Many of the nosocomial MRSA strains are multi-drug resistant, and even methicillin-sensitive strains can be deadly. S. aureus has recently taken on a new role in causing an escalating number of community-acquired infections in non-hospitalized persons without predisposing risk factors. Due to the increase in the number of infections caused by multi-drug resistant S. aureus and its possible use as a biowafare / bioterrorism agent, new therapeutic agents acting through novel mechanisms are sorely needed. This research project is directed towards the discovery of new inhibitors of S. aureus surface enzyme, sortase A (SrtA) as potential antibacterial agents to treat S. aureus infections. Sortases play a crucial role in the early stages of S. aureus pathogenesis by modulating bacterium's ability to adhere to host tissues via surface proteins anchored to the bacterial cell wall. Specifically, SrtA catalyzes the cleavage of the amide bond between threonine and glycine of the LPETG structural motif of surface proteins during cell wall anchoring. Thus, inhibiting the function of SrtA can disrupt the formation of surface protein assembly and make the bacteria less virulent. S. aureus mutants lacking SrtA are reported to be defective in establishing infection in animal models. Thus, SrtA is a valid target for the discovery of drugs that act against S. aureus. Utilizing the high resolution X-ray crystal structures of S. aureus SrtA and its complex with substrate LPETG, we have conducted inhibitor design studies to identify new inhibitors of SrtA. In silico virtual screening of commercial small molecule libraries against the SrtA active site using the software, FlexX resulted in the identification of several new low micromolar inhibitors of SrtA. Structure activity relationship studies on these lead compounds has led to improvement in enzyme inhibitory activity. Additional studies have been conducted to gain insight in to the molecular mechanism of SrtA inhibition by the lead compounds.","Chenna, Bala Chandra",0,,369
973,Confucius computer: a philosophical digital agent for intergenerational philosophical play,"Confucianism is commonly defined as ""... a system of philosophical, ethical and political thought based on the teachings of Confucius,''which originated through the teachings of Confucius during the sixth-century BCE. It is a way of life or a philosophy of human nature that considers human relationships as the foundation of the society. Confucius teachings had highly influenced the development of several cultures in Asia, making Confucianism an intangible cultural heritage. In this paper, we are re-acquainting users with an intangible heritage that is part of their everyday, by developing a system that permits experiencing Confucius teachings virtually and interactively. The system can measure philosophical intent of the human and generate meaningful philosophical answers. It is also aimed for intergenerational sharing of Confucius heritage through a simple interactive process with the virtual sage making the experience enjoyable and entertaining. Previous research in natural language processing (NLP) mainly focused on the understanding and delivering of human natural language accurately. In this research, we explored how to apply NLP to model the knowledge and teachings of Confucius, through the natural conversation between human and computer. This virtual Confucius, a chat agent that generates outputs based on Confucius teachings, using a series of algorithms and techniques to improve the matching accuracy between user input and computer output, introduces a novel way of interacting with intangible cultures. Our user evaluation results revealed that there is a positive correlation between relevance and enjoyment, finding their experiences interacting with virtual Confucius very encouraging. Adults who participated in experiencing the virtual Confucius together with their children believed that this system has the potential to improve intergenerational interactions through shared play.","Cheok, A.

976,,"Cancer is a complex group of distinct genetic disease having common hallmarks. Cancer is characterized by abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth, and may acquire the ability to migrate and invade other parts of the body. The common hallmarks of cancer include limitless replication potential, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, self-sufficiency in growth signals, evading apoptosis, tissue invasion and metastasis, and sustained angiogenesis. Mono polar spindle 1 kinase (Mps1 kinase) is an essential mitotic kinase with multiple functions in cell division. Mps1 kinase plays an important role in spindle assembly checkpoint. It is also involved in centrosome duplication, SMAD signaling, post-mitotic checkpoints, DNA damage response and cytokinesis. The mRNA levels of Mps1 kinase are upregulated in several human cancers including bladder, anaplastic thyroid, breast, lung, esophagus, and prostate. Recently, it has been reported that high levels of Mps1 kinase are correlated with high histologic grade breast cancer. Mps1-Comp1, one of the designed Mps1 kinase inhibitors, demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity with moderate selectivity to PTEN deficient breast cancer cells. Other designed Mps1 kinase inhibitors, such as Mps1-Comp10 and Mps1-Comp13, also showed potent antiproliferative activities across different breast cancer cell lines. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family proteins, has important roles in cell division and inhibition of apoptosis. Several clinical studies have shown that elevated levels of survivin correlates with aggressiveness of the disease and resistance to radiation and chemotherapeutic treatments. The disruption of functional survivin along its dimer interface with a small molecule is hypothesized to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and sensitize them to therapeutic agents and radiation. Survivin dimerization modulators were designed by computational modeling using Abbott8 as the lead molecule. Two of the most potent survivin modulators, LLP3 and LLP9 at concentrations between 50 and 100 nM, caused delay in mitotic progression and major mitotic defects in proliferating human umbilical vein endothelial cells and prostate cancer cells. Jumonji C containing demethylases (JMJD2) are a group of enzymes that demethylate all three states of lysine methylation in histone. JMJD2 family of proteins, especially JMJD2A, JMJD2B and JMJD2C, has been found to be overexpressed in many cancers. Virtual high throughput screening was employed to identify inhibitors of JMJD2 enzymes. Among the tested compounds, LLJI3 and 28-34 exhibit inhibitory activity against JMJD2 family of enzymes. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic disorders in Caucasians. Cystic fibrosis is caused due to mutation to the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common mutation is the deletion of amino acid 508 (phenylalanine) which accounts for 70% of the mutations worldwide. Respiratory insufficiency is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among CF patients which is caused due to improper functioning of CFTR ion channel. Numerous small molecules were designed that can potentially bind to the druggable binding pocket near V510 of F508 NBD1, using a fragment-based virtual screen approach. Over half of the tested LLCF compounds effectively rescued the misprocessing of delta F508 CFTR in HEK293 cells.","Chettiar, Somsundaram Natrajan",0,,371
977,"Impact of sensory preferences of individuals with autism on the recognition of emotions expressed by two robots, an avatar, and a human","We design a personalized human-robot environment for social learning for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In order to define an individual's profile, we posit that the individual's reliance on proprioceptive and kinematic visual cues should affect the way the individual suffering from ASD interacts with a social agent (human/robot/virtual agent). In this paper, we assess the potential link between recognition performances of body/facial expressions of emotion of increasing complexity, emotion recognition on platforms with different visual features (two mini-humanoid robots, a virtual agent, and a human), and proprioceptive and visual cues integration of an individual. First, we describe the design of the EMBODI-EMO database containing videos of controlled body/facial expressions of emotions from various platforms. We explain how we validated this database with typically developed (TD) individuals. Then, we investigate the relationship between emotion recognition and proprioceptive and visual profiles of TD individuals and individuals with ASD. For TD individuals, our results indicate a relationship between profiles and emotion recognition. As expected, we show that TD individuals that rely more heavily on visual cues yield better recognition scores. However, we found that TD individuals relying on proprioception have better recognition scores, going against our hypothesis. Finally, participants with ASD relying more heavily on proprioceptive cues have lower emotion recognition scores on all conditions than participants relying on visual cues.","Chevalier, P.",0,10.1007/s10514-016-9575-z,372
982,Pilot testing a digital pet avatar for older adults,"Social isolation in older adults is a major public health concern. An embodied conversational agent (ECA) has the potential to enhance older adults' social interaction. However, little is known about older adults' experience with an ECA. In this paper, we conducted a pilot study to examine the perceived acceptance and utility of a tablet-based conversational agent in the form of an avatar (termed ""digital pet"") for older adults. We performed secondary analysis of data collected from a study that employed the use of a digital pet in ten older adults' homes for three months. Most of the participants enjoyed the companionship, entertainment, reminders, and instant assistance from the digital pet. However, participants identified limited conversational ability and technical issues as system challenges. Privacy, dependence, and cost were major concerns. Future applications should maximize the agent's conversational ability and the system's overall usability. Our results can inform future designs of conversational agents for older adults, which need to include older adults as system co-designers to maximize usability and acceptance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

990,Courseware development with animated pedagogical agents in learning system to improve learning motivation,"The addition of animated pedagogical agents (APAs) in computer-assisted learning (CAL) systems could successfully enhance students' learning motivation and engagement in learning activities. Conventionally, the APA incorporated multimedia materials are constructed through the cooperation of teachers and software programmers. However, the thinking and technical gap between two roles, a concept/content provider (teacher) and an implementer (software programmer), may lead to the concept distortion and loss in the final teaching material implementations. This often results in preventing a teacher from preparing his or her own APA-based multimedia learning systems. This study aims to develop a courseware to facilitate the CAL through the combination of the two roles into a single one and then teachers can use it freely by themselves. The courseware can help teachers to develop appropriate multimedia instructional materials incorporating APAs, which attracts students' attention and enhances their interest in learning. Furthermore, in this study two separate trial experiments were conducted to measure the teachers' satisfaction with the courseware and students' learning motivation after using APA-based multimedia learning systems. The results show that the participating teachers were satisfied with the courseware and would like to apply it in their instruction. Moreover, the participating students were strongly motivated by the customized APA-based multimedia learning systems. Therefore, the proposed courseware could give teachers a good opportunity to add pedagogical value to the curriculum, so that students' learning interest and motivation could be enhanced.","Chin, K.

995,,"This study explored the experiences of professors and instructional designers as they interact to design and develop a distance learning course. Six professors from several different universities who reported that their pedagogy improved after these interactions during the conversion process were identified and interviewed, along with the instructional designers with whom they collaborated, to determine what elements of the interaction led to the change in their pedagogical practices. The study used a Hermeneutics phenomenology approach employing a universal instructional design model (Merrill, 2013) and a threat regulation model of trust (Williams, 2007) to shape data collection and analysis. Analysis of the data showed that principles from the instructional design model (Merrill, 2013) were used by the instructional designers to communicate good teaching practices. Strategies from the trust-building model (Williams, 2007) were employed by the instructional designers as well as some of the faculty to reduce threats to collaboration. Faculty reported incorporating a more student-centered approach to their subsequent teaching, based primarily on improved student outcomes in these courses, including satisfaction, engagement, and retention of new knowledge. Four conclusions emerged from the findings: (a) Merrill’s First Principles (2013) is a useful model for explaining student-centered practices in higher education, particularly the principle of using real-world problems in course design, (b) Williams’s trust-building model explains some of the success of the professor/instructional designer interactions, (c) professors valued pedagogical support from experienced instructional designers, who facilitated changes in their thinking about pedagogy, and (d) professors were more likely to make changes in pedagogy when they could anticipate improved learning outcomes. Universities are recommended to implement the use of professional instructional designers and quality frameworks to introduce faculty to student-centered teaching practices. As change agents in the universities, instructional designers should take advantage of the opportunity to impact teaching practices in universities. Further research might explore how faculty incorporate new knowledge acquired as a result of interacting with instructional designers into their teaching. In addition, future studies could examine the incorporation of those features of instructional design that are not reflected in active learning methods, particularly the use of backward design to create connections between learning activities.","Chittur, Debra",0,,376

To do so, a 2 (modality: voice vs. text) x 2 (device: mobile vs. laptop) x 2 (task type: hedonic vs. utilitarian) mixed factorial experimental design was employed. Findings suggest that voice (vs. text) interaction leads to more positive attitudes toward the VA system mediated by heightened perceived human likeness of the VA, but only with utilitarian (vs. hedonic) tasks. Interestingly, laptop (vs. mobile phone) interaction also enhanced perceived human likeness of the VA. This study offers theoretical and practical implications for VA research by exploring the combinational effects of modality, device, and task differences on user perceptions through human-like interactions.","Cho, E.",0,10.1089/cyber.2018.0571,378

The dosimeter consisted of three separate components that are attached to the hinges and the bridge of the occupational worker’s protective eyewear. The produced dosimeter was radiologically calibrated to measure the lens dose on an anthropomorphic phantom of the human head. To supplement the physical design, an algorithm was written that prompts the user to input the element responses of the dosimeter, then estimates the average angle, energy, and resulting lens dose of the exposure by comparing the input with the data acquired during the dosimeter calibration procedure. The performance of the calibrated dosimeter (and the algorithm) was evaluated according to guidelines of the American National Standards Institute, and the dosimeter demonstrated a performance that was in compliance with the standard’s performance criteria which suggests that the design of the eye dosimeter is feasible.","Choi, JungHwan",0,,379

Much less is known, however, about whether people perceive e-signatures to be symbolically equivalent to traditional hand signatures. Results of four studies demonstrate that although functionally the same, e-signatures evoked markedly different psychological reactions than hand signatures. Namely, e-signatures evoked a weaker sense of the signer's presence and involvement. This weaker sense of social presence, in turn, induced negativity: People were more likely to discount the validity of an e-signed application than that of an identical application signed by hand. They also anticipated that e-signed contracts would lead to greater likelihood of contract breaches. This negativity toward e-signatures persisted across five different types of e-signatures, regardless of an individual's level of comfort with technology. Taken together, the studies reveal deeply rooted psychological reactions to a practice that is now prevalent worldwide.","Chou, E. Y.",0,10.1177/1948550614558841,380
1005,,"In the present study, we describe a fingerprinting approach to analyze the time evolution of the MR signal and retrieve quantitative information about the microvascular network. We used a Gradient Echo Sampling of the Free Induction Decay and Spin Echo (GESFIDE) sequence and defined a fingerprint as the ratio of signals acquired pre- and post-injection of an iron-based contrast agent. We then simulated the same experiment with an advanced numerical tool that takes a virtual voxel containing blood vessels as input, then computes microscopic magnetic fields and water diffusion effects, and eventually derives the expected MR signal evolution. The parameter inputs of the simulations (cerebral blood volume [CBV], mean vessel radius [R], and blood oxygen saturation [SO2]) were varied to obtain a dictionary of all possible signal evolutions. The best fit between the observed fingerprint and the dictionary was then determined by using least square minimization. This approach was evaluated in 5 normal subjects and the results were compared to those obtained by using more conventional MR methods, steady-state contrast imaging for CBV and R and a global measure of oxygenation obtained from the superior sagittal sinus for SO2. The fingerprinting method enabled the creation of high-resolution parametric maps of the microvascular network showing expected contrast and fine details. Numerical values in gray matter (CBV = 3.1 ± 0.7%, R = 12.6 ± 2.4 μm, SO₂ = 59.5 ± 4.7%) are consistent with literature reports and correlated with conventional MR approaches. SO₂ values in white matter (53.0 ± 4.0%) were slightly lower than expected. Numerous improvements can easily be made and the method should be useful to study brain pathologies.

1012,Identifying Features that Enhance Older Adults' Acceptance of Robots: A Mixed Methods Study,"Background: With global aging, robots are considered a promising solution for handling the shortage of aged care and companionships. However, these technologies would serve little purpose if their intended users do not accept them. While the socioemotional selectivity theory predicts that older adults would accept robots that offer emotionally meaningful relationships, selective optimization with compensation model predicts that older adults would accept robots that compensate for their functional losses. Objective: The present study aims to understand older adults' expectations for robots and to compare older adults' acceptance ratings for 2 existing robots: one of them is a more human-like and more service-oriented robot and the other one is a more animal-like and more companion-oriented robot. Methods: A mixed methods study was conducted with 33 healthy, community-dwelling Taiwanese older adults (age range: 59-82 years). Participants first completed a semi-structured interview regarding their ideal robot. After receiving information about the 2 existing robots, they then completed the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology questionnaires to report their pre-implementation acceptance of the 2 robots. Results: Interviews were transcribed for conventional content analysis with satisfactory inter-rater reliability. From the interview data, a collection of older adults' ideal robot characteristics emerged with highlights of humanlike qualities. From the questionnaire data, respondents showed a higher level of acceptance toward the more service-oriented robot than the more companion-oriented robot in terms of attitude, perceived adaptiveness, and perceived usefulness. From the mixed methods analyses, the finding that older adults had a higher level of positive attitude towards the more service-oriented robot than the more companion-oriented robot was predicted by higher expectation or preference for robots with more service-related functions. Conclusion: This study identified older adults' preference toward more functional and humanlike robots. Our findings provide practical suggestions for future robot designs that target the older population.","Chu, L.",0,10.1159/000494881,382

Ideally, in interpersonal skills training users will perceive and treat the ECAs the same as they would real people. The perception and treatment of ECAs as real people is known as social presence. This dissertation identifies and explores approaches to increase an ECAs social presence. One approach is to use mixed reality technology to bring the ECA into the physical space and increase its physicality. Three studies were run on physicality. The first two suggested that increasing an ECAs occupancy of the physical space can elicit more realistic treatment of the ECA. These studies also suggested there may be interaction effects between physicality and plausibility, and also matching levels of physicality are important. The third study suggested increasing an ECAs interaction with the physical space does not have an effect on social presence. A qualitative study was also run to identify other factors affecting social presence. This study suggested factors related to an ECAs plausibility, including what the ECA says and how it responds, also affect social presence.

An understanding of emotional interactions would be essential to such robots' behavior. To improve the cognitive and behavior systems of such robots, we propose the use of an artificial topological consciousness that uses a synthetic neurotransmitter and motivation, including a biologically inspired emotion system. A fundamental aspect of a companion robot is a cross communication system that enables natural interactions between humans and the robot. This paper focuses on three points in the development of our proposed framework: (1) the organization of the behavior including inside-state emotion regarding the phylogenetic consciousness-based architecture; (2) a method whereby the robot can have empathy toward its human user's expressions of emotion; and (3) a method that enables the robot to select a facial expression in response to the human user, providing instant human-like 'emotion' and based on emotional intelligence (El) that uses a biologically inspired topological online method to express, for example, encouragement or being delighted. We also demonstrate the performance of the artificial consciousness based on the complexity level and a robot's social expressions that are designed to enhance the users affinity with the robot.

1037,In the shades of the uncanny valley: An experimental study of human-chatbot interaction,"This project has been carried out in the context of recent major developments in botics and more widespread usage of virtual agents in personal and professional sphere. The general purpose of the experiment was to thoroughly examine the character of the human-non-human interaction process. Thus, in the paper, we present a study of human-chatbot interaction, focusing on the affective responses of users to different types of interfaces with which they interact. The experiment consisted of two parts: measurement of psychophysiological reactions of chatbot users and a detailed questionnaire that focused on assessing interactions and willingness to collaborate with a bot. In the first quantitative stage, participants interacted with a chatbot, either with a simple text chatbot (control group) or an avatar reading its responses in addition to only presenting them on the screen (experimental group. We gathered the following psychophysiological data from participants: electromyography (EMG), respirometer (RSP), electrocardiography (ECG), and electrodermal activity (EDA). In the last, declarative stage, participants filled out a series of questionnaires related to the experience of interacting with (chat)bots and to the overall human-(chat)bot collaboration assessment. The theory of planned behaviour survey investigated attitude towards cooperation with chatbots in the future. The social presence survey checked how much the chatbot was considered to be a ""real"" person. The anthropomorphism scale measured the extent to which the chatbot seems humanlike. Our particular focus was on the so-called uncanny valley effect, consisting of the feeling of eeriness and discomfort towards a given medium or technology that frequently appears in various kinds of human-machine interactions. Our results show that participants were experiencing lesser uncanny effects and less negative affect in cooperation with a simpler text chatbot than with the more complex, animated avatar chatbot. The simple chatbot have also induced less intense psychophysiological reactions. Despite major developments in botics, the user's affective responses towards bots have frequently been neglected. In our view, understanding the user's side may be crucial for designing better chatbots in the future and, thus, can contribute to advancing the field of human-computer interaction.

1041,,"Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are three-dimensional porous nanomaterials with a variety of applications, including catalysis, gas storage and separation, and sustainable energy. Their potential as air filtration systems is of interest for designer carbon capture materials. The chemical constituents (i.e. organic ligands) can be functionalized to create rationally designed CO2 sequestration platforms, for example. Hardware and software alike at the bleeding edge of supercomputing are utilized for designing first principles-based molecular models for the simulation of gas sorption in these frameworks. The classical potentials developed herein are named PHAST — Potentials with High Accuracy, Speed, and Transferability, and thus are designed via a ""bottom-up"" approach. Specifically, models for N2 and CH4 are constructed and presented. Extensive verification and validation leads to insights and range of applicability. Through this experience, the PHAST models are improved upon further to be more applicable in heterogeneous environments. Given this, the models are applied to reproducing high level ab initio energies for gas sorption trajectories of helium atoms in a variety of rare-gas clusters, the geometries of which being representative of sorption-like environments commonly encountered in a porous nanomaterial. This work seeks to push forward the state of classical and first principles materials modeling. Additionally, the characterization of a new type of tunable radical metal—carbene is presented. Here, a cobalt(II)—porphyrin complex, [Co(Por)], was investigated to understand its role as an effective catalyst in stereoselective cyclopropanation of a diazoacetate reagent. Density functional theory along with natural bond order analysis and charge decomposition analysis gave insight into the electronics of the catalytic intermediate. The bonding pattern unveiled a new class of radical metal—carbene complex, with a doublet cobalt into which a triplet carbene sigma donates, and subsequent back-bonding occurs into a π* antibonding orbital. This is a different type of interaction not seen in the three existing classes of metal-carbene complexes, namely Fischer, Schrock, and Grubbs. Finally, the virtual engineering of enhanced chemical warfare agent (CWA) detection systems is discussed. As part of a U.S. Department of Defense supported research project, in silico chemical modifications to a previously synthesized zinc-porphyrin, ZnCS1, were made to attempt to achieve preferential binding of the nerve agent sarin versus its simulant, DIMP (diisopropyl methylphosphonate). Upon modification, a combination of steric effects and induced hydrogen bonding allowed for the selective binding of sarin. The success of this work demonstrates the role that high performance computing can play in national security research, without the associated costs and high security required for experimentation.","Cioce, Christian R.",0,,388
1042,,"There is a long last tradition in Artificial Intelligence as use of Robots endowing human peculiarities, from a cognitive and emotional point of view, and not only in shape. Today Artificial Intelligence is more oriented to several form of collective intelligence, also building robot simulators (hardware or software) to deeply understand collective behaviors in human beings and society as a whole. Modeling has also been crucial in the social sciences, to understand how complex systems can arise from simple rules. However, while engineers’ simulations can be performed in the physical world using robots, for social scientist this is impossible. For decades, researchers tried to improve simulations by endowing artificial agents with simple and complex rules that emulated human behavior also by using artificial intelligence (AI). To include human beings and their real intelligence within artificial societies is now the big challenge. We present an hybrid (humanartificial) platform where experiments can be performed by simulated artificial worlds in the following manner: 1) agents' behaviors are regulated by the behaviors shown in Virtual Reality involving real human beings exposed to specific situations to simulate, and 2) technology transfers these rules into the artificial world. These form a closed-loop of real behaviors inserted into artificial agents, which can be used to study real society.

Across the studies, the analyses pursue two themes: (a) the role of agent-based modeling as a synergistic local practice around which we can integrate computational thinking and scientific modeling within digital games and (b) the role of collaboration in leveraging those synergies. We then present a design of a disciplinarily-integrated game that integrates these themes to demonstrate one such possible instantiation of the themes. Finally, we discuss the implications for design and praxis with a particular focus on learning in classrooms across the curriculum. Specifically, we first explore the implications in terms of connecting to teachers' views of practice by framing computational modeling and computational thinking as mathematization. We then explore the implications of shifting from a focus on single players to communities of practice in terms of computational participation as science as practice. We close by exploring the pragmatic and pedagogical affordances of shifting from stand-alone single-topic games to flexible agent-based environments in terms of student development across the curriculum.","Clark, D.

1046,"Cooperative extension and food system change: goals, strategies and resources","Recent attention to communities ""localizing"" food systems has increased the need to understand the perspectives of people working to foster collaboration and the eventual transformation of the food system. University Cooperative Extension Educators (EEs) increasingly play a critical role in communities' food systems across the United States, providing various resources to address local needs. A better understanding of EEs' perspectives on food systems is therefore important. Inspired by the work of Stevenson, Ruhf, Lezberg, and Clancy on the social food movement, we conducted national virtual focus groups to examine EEs' attitudes about how food system change should happen, for what reasons, and who has the resources, power, and influence to effect change. The institutions within which EEs are embedded shape their perceptions of available resources in the community, including authority and power (and who holds them). These resources, in turn, structure EEs' goals and strategies for food system change. We find that EEs envision working within the current food system: building market-centric alternatives that address inequity for vulnerable consumers and producers. EEs bring many resources to the table but do not believe they can influence those who have the authority to change policy. While these findings could suggest EEs' limited ability to be transformative change agents, EEs can potentially connect their efforts with new partners that share perceptions of food system problems and solutions. As EEs increasingly engage in food system work and with increasingly diverse stakeholders, they can access alternative, transformational frames within which to set goals and organize their work.","Clark, J.

1053,African American Mathematics Teachers as Agents in Their African American Students' Mathematics Identity Formation,"Background/Context: Recent research in mathematics education has employed sociocultural and historical lenses to better understand how students experience school mathematics and come to see themselves as capable mathematics learners. This work has identified mathematics classrooms as places where power struggles related to students' identities occur, struggles that often involve students' affiliations with racial, ethnic, and gender categories and the mathematics teacher as a critical agent in students' mathematics identity development. Frameworks for identifying resources that mathematics teachers draw on to teach are evolving, and emerging dimensions of teachers' knowledge, namely knowledge of students' lived experiences and histories, as well as teachers' experiences and identities, are increasingly being considered alongside more traditional dimensions of the knowledge teachers draw on in their practice. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to explore the perspectives and practices of two African American mathematics teachers, Madison Morgan and Floyd Lee, as they support their African American students' mathematics identity formation and development. Participants: At the time of the study, Morgan and Lee were high school mathematics teachers in a large urban school district. Both participants were selected for this analysis because of considerable differences in their life histories, pedagogical approaches, and perspectives. Research Design: Each teacher was observed approximately 25 times and interviewed 9-10 times. The primary data for this analysis consist of a subset of observations and interviews for the purposes of conducting a qualitative cross-case analysis that examines themes, similarities, and differences in Morgan's and Lee's approaches to supporting their students' mathematics identity development. Findings: Morgan's and Lee's experiences, perspectives, and practices characterize two very different perspectives of what constitutes a positive mathematics identity, while both maintain connections to race and racial identities. In both cases, there exists a subtle paradox in the underlying motivations that the teachers communicated in their interviews related to socializing their African American students and the practices they actually employ in their classrooms. Furthermore, both teachers made use of their capacity to serve as models and motivators for students' current and future success in mathematics. Conclusions/Recommendations: If equitable high-quality mathematics instruction is a sincere goal of the mathematics education community, we strongly recommend that researchers further explore the ways that teacher identity, including those dimensions associated with race, class, and gender, serves as an instructional and motivational resource as teachers work to create productive and meaningful learning environments for their students.","Clark, L.

1056,Surprise and human-agent interactions,"Affective Computing aims at improving the naturalness of human-computer interactions by integrating the socio-emotional component in the interaction. The use of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) - virtual characters interacting with humans - is a key answer to this issue. On the one hand, the ECA has to take into account the human emotional behaviours and social attitudes. On the other hand, the ECA has to display socio-emotional behaviours with relevance. In this paper, we provide an overview of computational methods used for user's socio-emotional behaviour analysis and of human-agent interaction strategies by questioning the ambivalent status of surprise. We focus on the computational models and on the methods we use to detect user's emotion through language and speech processing and present a study investigating the role of surprise in the ECA's answer.","Clavel, C.",0,10.1075/rcl.13.2.08cla,394

In this paper we identify and discuss the growing opportunities for cross-disciplinary work that may increase individual advances. Sentiment/opinion detection methods used in human-agent interaction are indeed rare and, when they are employed, they are not different from the ones used in opinion mining and consequently not designed for socio-affective interactions (timing constraint of the interaction, sentiment analysis as an input and an output of interaction strategies). To support our claims, we present a comparative state of the art which analyzes the sentiment-related phenomena and the sentiment detection methods used in both communities and makes an overview of the goals of socio-affective human-agent strategies. We propose then different possibilities for mutual benefit, specifying several research tracks and discussing the open questions and prospects. To show the feasibility of the general guidelines proposed we also approach them from a specific perspective by applying them to the case of the Greta embodied conversational agents platform and discuss the way they can be used to make a more significative sentiment analysis for human-agent interactions in two different use cases: job interviews and dialogs with museum visitors.","Clavel, C.",0,10.1109/taffc.2015.2444846,395

Thirteen pedagogically aware academics from the fields of science and technology participated in thematic interviews in which they were asked to describe change agency. The descriptions were explored utilizing a social theory of learning and categorized with content analysis.

Simultaneous participation in pedagogically oriented communities of practice (PCoP) enables them to promote pedagogical development through brokering at community interfaces. This empirical study explores academics' experiences of acting as informal change agents at the interfaces of DCoP and PCoP during an organizational transition phase of three years. The longitudinal data were collected with interviews of 13 academics from the fields of science and technology. The findings reveal a variety of pedagogical development activities related to shared meanings, practices, identities, and ways of belonging. The activities are aligned with the organizational transition process and enabled by collegial support. The findings indicate that lack of supportive formal leadership may terminate the informal development activities. The resulting model of change agency provides a novel approach to pedagogical development in higher education.","Clavert, M.",0,10.1080/13562517.2018.1451321,397

1070,Structuration: A position-practice perspective and an illustrative study,"Most prior studies of accounting and control based on structuration theory have given primacy to the analysis of the virtual structures of signification, domination and legitimation. We argue that there is scope for researchers to focus on the more concrete aspects of structuration, such as the configuration and articulation of patterns in relations between agents over time. To do so, we advocate the deployment of a position-practice perspective, which comprises four inter-related elements: praxis, positioning, capabilities and trust. We illustrate use of the perspective in a case study of a joint venture between companies engaged in the production and shipment of oil and petroleum products. The position-practice perspective reveals control governed not by equity ownership, but rather a dialectic of control between joint venture partners whose activities are also affected by accountability to powerful institutions in the wider network. Nevertheless, industry practices are mediated by partner organisations, who rely heavily on trust in systems rather than interpersonal trust. Further research is proposed, using composite research strategies, different levels of analysis, and greater diversity in inter-organisational relationships. The position-practice perspective complements previous structuration studies by more clearly focusing on the praxis of situated agents, their positioning relative to others, the stratified pluralism of institutionalised practices, the consequent role of contradiction in social relations, the recursive cycles of disembedding and reembedding that link the local and global, the concrete and the abstract, and the complex and provisional nature of trust in creating order and coordination.

1072,,"This study was an investigation of the effectiveness of an animated pedagogical agent (APA) as a mnemonic device to promote learning and motivation. APAs are animated interface characters that serve as facilitator, guide, expert, coach, and peer in multimedia learning. Cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) suggests that poorly designed materials may impose cognitive barriers to learning and inhibit student motivation. No previous research has employed a mnemonic device APA (MAPA) to determine if learning is enhanced with its use. A convenience sampling of adult learners (N = 63) from an online university participant pool and social networking sites participated in this true experimental quantitative study, and were randomly assigned to MAPA and control groups that both took an online course about mental fitness. Research questions examined the effect of a MAPA on learning and motivation. The dependent variables were measured by 9 confidence questions from the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey and a learning measure based on the course contents. Rank transformation with ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U indicated that MAPA students scored significantly higher on the learning measure than did the control group. T-test comparison of motivation scores revealed no difference in motivation between the groups. Better understanding of MAPAs among instructional designers could increase student learning, satisfaction, and ultimately the retention of online students. In turn, student retention could have positive impacts, such as increased self-efficacy and higher pay for the individual. Student retention could also have community benefits, such as economic growth and decreased need for social services.","Cobb, Carolynn",1,,401
1073,Visitor Comments as Dialogue,"Museum use is a process of ideological negotiation, and thus museum users are active agents, not empty vessels waiting to be filled with curatorial narrative. Ensuing dialogues argue over trivia as well as important ethical issues. Discussants take up topics that range over specific public programs, the object maker's motivations and intentions, the choice of a subject, the phrasing of a caption, or the selection of objects on display. These discussions are held in hushed conversations in crowded galleries, in casual conversations within museum hallways, or with animated gestures on the front steps. In the course of this dialogic social practice, each participant's cultural repertoire is enhanced and grows. Every dialogic event is part of a socio-cultural continuum that will engender other events, with other participants. The comments made by visitors in a visitor comment book are therefore instances of the specificities and the universality of that discussion.","Coffee, K.",0,10.1111/cura.12017,402

Recording and analysis of USVs has broad utility during diverse behavioral tests and can be performed noninvasively in almost any rodent behavioral model to provide rich insights into the emotional state and motor function of the test animal. Despite strong evidence that USVs serve an array of communicative functions, technical and financial limitations have been barriers for most laboratories to adopt vocalization analysis. Recently, deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine hearing and vision, by allowing computers to perform human-like activities including seeing, listening, and speaking. Such systems are constructed from biomimetic, “deep”, artificial neural networks. Here, we present DeepSqueak, a USV detection and analysis software suite that can perform human quality USV detection and classification automatically, rapidly, and reliably using cutting-edge regional convolutional neural network architecture (Faster-RCNN). DeepSqueak was engineered to allow non-experts easy entry into USV detection and analysis yet is flexible and adaptable with a graphical user interface and offers access to numerous input and analysis features. Compared to other modern programs and manual analysis, DeepSqueak was able to reduce false positives, increase detection recall, dramatically reduce analysis time, optimize automatic syllable classification, and perform automatic syntax analysis on arbitrarily large numbers of syllables, all while maintaining manual selection review and supervised classification. DeepSqueak allows USV recording and analysis to be added easily to existing rodent behavioral procedures, hopefully revealing a wide range of innate responses to provide another dimension of insights into behavior when combined with conventional outcome measures.

1078,Social babbling: The emergence of symbolic gestures and words,"Language acquisition theories classically distinguish passive language understanding from active language production. However, recent findings show that brain areas such as Broca's region are shared in language understanding and production. Furthermore, these areas are also implicated in understanding and producing goal-oriented actions. These observations question the passive view of language development. In this work, we propose a cognitive developmental model of symbol acquisition, coherent with an active view of language learning. For that purpose, we introduce the concept of social babbling. In this view, symbols are learned in the same way as goal-oriented actions in the context of specific caregiver-infant interactions. We show that this model allows a virtual agent to learn both symbolic words and gestures to refer to objects while interacting with a caregiver. We validate our model by reproducing results from studies on the influence of parental responsiveness on infants language acquisition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

1080,,"Background: Paralysis or amputation of an arm results in the loss of the ability to orient the hand and grasp, manipulate, and carry objects, functions that are essential for activities of daily living. Brain–machine interfaces could provide a solution to restoring many of these lost functions. We therefore tested whether an individual with tetraplegia could rapidly achieve neurological control of a high-performance prosthetic limb using this type of an interface. Methods: We implanted two 96-channel intracortical microelectrodes in the motor cortex of a 52-year-old individual with tetraplegia. Brain–machine-interface training was done for 13 weeks with the goal of controlling an anthropomorphic prosthetic limb with seven degrees of freedom (three-dimensional translation, three-dimensional orientation, one-dimensional grasping). The participant's ability to control the prosthetic limb was assessed with clinical measures of upper limb function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01364480. Findings: The participant was able to move the prosthetic limb freely in the three-dimensional workspace on the second day of training. After 13 weeks, robust seven-dimensional movements were performed routinely. Mean success rate on target-based reaching tasks was 91·6% (SD 4·4) versus median chance level 6·2% (95% CI 2·0–15·3). Improvements were seen in completion time (decreased from a mean of 148 s [SD 60] to 112 s [6]) and path efficiency (increased from 0·30 [0·04] to 0·38 [0·02]). The participant was also able to use the prosthetic limb to do skilful and coordinated reach and grasp movements that resulted in clinically significant gains in tests of upper limb function. No adverse events were reported. Interpretation: With continued development of neuroprosthetic limbs, individuals with long-term paralysis could recover the natural and intuitive command signals for hand placement, orientation, and reaching, allowing them to perform activities of daily living.

1090,,"In this thesis, a number of problems are looked at predominately in the area of mobile agent communication protocols. Particularly, with the recent uptake of unstructured, large and dynamic networks there is a demand for cheap, ubiquitous and reliable protocols that will assist in the support of the network through tasks such as information dissemination, information search and retrieval, and network monitoring. One of the exciting new possible solutions to this is in the area of mobile agents where by a team of dedicated agents (physical or purely virtual) act independently or within a team on the network in the goal of solving simple, yet highly valuable, tasks. Independent agents may work within the bounds of their environment and without influence from their colleagues to solve simple or potentially complex tasks. Further, the agents may also act independently but in actuality work as a very complex team with simple underlying principles allowing for large scale networks and problems to be handled autonomously. In this work, two problems are investigated in detail, the Rendezvous Problem and Network Patrolling. In the rendezvous problem, the goal is to identify algorithms that will permit two agents to rendezvous within some known or unknown environment. This problem, while at first can feel trivial, it can be incredibly difficult when it is realised that all agents are expected to be identical at wake-up time, and that methods must be found that allow for the breaking of symmetry. This thesis provides an investigation into a number of models and environments and tries to provide optimal algorithms for allow rendezvous to occur. Secondly in the area of network patrolling, this work investigates the problem where there exists an environment, in which parts of it are viewed as being vital to network integrity and as such must be monitored. When there are less agents than vital regions the challenge of identifying traversal routes that minimise idle time becomes apparent. In this work an algorithm is presented that minimises this in the ring environment. Finally, this work also looks at other problems in distributed computing and provides exploratory foundation work that could provide alternative models for routing problems, distributed processing, community identification, and presents a number of open problems.","Collins, Andrew",0,,406

An iterative, automatic effects processing system is coupled to machine-listening components, including the assessment of the ""worthiness"" of intermediate files to continue to a final mixing stage. Generation of the formal structure of output pieces utilizes models derived from a small corpus of exemplar electroacoustic music, and a dynamic time-warping similarity-measure technique drawn from music information retrieval is employed to decide between candidate final mixes. Evaluation of Autocousmatic has involved three main components: the entry of its output works into composition competitions, the public release of the software with an associated questionnaire and sound examples on Sound Cloud, and direct feedback from three highly experienced electroacoustic composers. The article concludes with a discussion of the current status of the system, with regards to ideas from the computational creativity literature, among other sources, and suggestions for future work that may advance the compositional ability of the system beyond its current level and towards human-like expertise.","Collins, N.",0,10.1162/COMJ_a_00135,407
1092,,"Quality Medical Care is at the focus of all health care service providers. Each facility maintains a standard level of care that promises not only a precise diagnosis, but also the correct course of treatment. In part, this is due to the educational training and professional experience of Nurses. For high-risk patients such as children, the level of expertise of a Pediatric Nurse is even more critical in order to guarantee patient safety. Pediatric Nurses do not necessarily have the same level of expertise in critical thinking and overall patient care, however. This can be attributed to variables in teaching institutions, training environments, and even demographic backgrounds. Moreover, the lack of a teaching paradigm that captures the attention of today's technology-savvy student could also be a contributing factor. In this thesis, a learning framework is proposed that serves as an extension to accepted nursing curriculum. This framework is a 2d serious Educational Puzzle game based on the classic board game Clue. Clue involves solving a murder mystery utilizing character interaction and discovery / observation of objects within a given room. I-CARE is similar except this game involves determining a Medical Diagnoses utilizing patient interaction (i.e. character dialogue) and accessing various rooms (i.e. Class Room, Equipment, Patient, Medical Supplies, etc.) in order to deliver medical care. The I-CARE application encapsulates a virtual world that makes use of all perceptual modes (i.e. visual, auditory, and haptic), just like a real Children's Hospital. The framework is developed for a mobile platform using XNA 4.0 technology. It offers a portable world where nurses can develop critical thinking skills and practice delivering quality medical care. With game play, they accumulate a progression of tasks required to deliver an Albuterol treatment to a pediatrics patient. These may not be the most efficient progression of tasks, however. Cultural Algorithms is an agent-based evolutionary method used to computationally determine the most efficient progression of tasks to deliver an Albuterol treatment. It begins by capturing all of the tasks available in the I-CARE virtual world. Next, it describes the rules of how those tasks can come together in terms of pre- and post-conditions of task usage. Finally, these rules are weighted in a manner that allows for task inclusion along with its relative position within the task progression. Cultural Algorithms is shown to be more than an experimental framework. It is also shown to be a learning mechanism as well. Through the execution of 10 runs at 1000 generations each, an analysis of the best learning example is performed. This analysis breaks down the progression of fitness scores over each generation to identify segments of learning. The idea is to not only determine an optimal solution to the stated problem, but to also identify how pediatric nurses learn themselves.","Colon, David L.",0,,408

1094,Comprehension and engagement in survey interviews with virtual agents,"This study investigates how an onscreen virtual agent's dialog capability and facial animation affect survey respondents' comprehension and engagement in ""face-to-face"" interviews, using questions from US government surveys whose results have far-reaching impact on national policies. In the study, 73 laboratory participants were randomly assigned to respond in one of four interviewing conditions, in which the virtual agent had either high or low dialog capability (implemented through Wizard of Oz) and high or low facial animation, based on motion capture from a human interviewer. Respondents, whose faces were visible to the Wizard (and videorecorded) during the interviews, answered 12 questions about housing, employment, and purchases on the basis of fictional scenarios designed to allow measurement of comprehension accuracy, defined as the fit between responses and US government definitions. Respondents answered more accurately with the high-dialog-capability agents, requesting clarification more often particularly for ambiguous scenarios; and they generally treated the high-dialog-capability interviewers more socially, looking at the interviewer more and judging high-dialog-capability agents as more personal and less distant. Greater interviewer facial animation did not affect response accuracy, but it led to more displays of engagement acknowledgments (verbal and visual) and smiles and to the virtual interviewer's being rated as less natural. The pattern of results suggests that a virtual agent's dialog capability and facial animation differently affect survey respondents' experience of interviews, behavioral displays, and comprehension, and thus the accuracy of their responses. The pattern of results also suggests design considerations for building survey interviewing agents, which may differ depending on the kinds of survey questions (sensitive or not) that are asked.","Conrad, F.

1100,,"The Davis–Beirut reaction, which was developed in our laboratory, provides access to a variety of 3-alkoxy-2H-indazoles. A unique aspect of these heterocycles is their ability to be converted into indazolones. As described in chapter 1, we found that reacting oxazino-, oxazolino-, and benzoxazino[3,2-b]indazoles with nucleophiles under microwave conditions, allowed us to synthesize a variety of N 2-substituted indazolones. Additionally, reacting oxazino- and benzoxazino-2 H-indazoles with KI under microwave conditions, resulted in an unexpected ANRORC (Addition of the Nucleophile, Ring-Opening, Ring-Closure) reaction to form isomeric pyroazoloindazolones and indazoloindazolones. Having established that 3-alkoxy-2H-indazoles – available via the Davis — reaction – react with nucleophiles to form N2-substituted indazoles, we began investigating electrophilic addition to these 2H-indazoles. This investigation, which is summarized in chapter 2, resulted in the development of methodology which allows for the conversion of 3-alkoxy-2H-indazoles into N1,N2-disubstituted indazolones by treating with a variety of electrophiles. With certain electrophiles, an AERORC (Addition of the Electrophile, Ring-Opening, Ring-Closure) reaction resulted in indazoloindazolone formation. Further diversification of these products through azide–alkyne cycloaddition chemistry resulted in the generation of two libraries of triazoloindazolones which were sent to the NIH MLSMR (Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository) for high-throughput biological screening. Cycloaddition reactions and one-pot–multistep methods are two of the most powerful methods for generating structural complexity – an important aspect of the drug discovery process. By combining a propargyl bromide-initiated ring-opening of oxazolino-2H-indazoles with a subsequent intramolecular azide–alkyne 1,2-dipolar cycloaddition (IAAC), we have developed a one-pot method for the synthesis of triazolotriazepinoindazolones. An interesting aspect of these novel molecules is their fusion of two heterocycles – indazolone and 1,2,3-triazole – each with well established biological activities. We have also demonstrated that by starting with a 7-bromooxazolino-2 H-indazole, we can diversify these products using palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. This work is described in Chapter 3. Great strides have been made in reducing the overall incidence and death rates resulting from cancer in the United States. One of the most effective treatments has been microtubule-targeting antimitotic drugs such as paclitaxel. Despite these great strides, the emergence of drug-resistant cancer lines is beginning to limit the effectiveness of these drugs. In collaboration with Professor Po-Huang Liang at Academia Sinica, we are in the process of developing an indazolone-based antimitotic agent targeting drug-resistant tumor cells. We began by developing a virtual library of 9,981 “virtual” indazolones which could be synthesized utilizing methods developed in our laboratory. A subsequent virtual docking study resulted in three lead compounds, which were synthesized and screened for anticancer activity. One of these compounds did in fact exhibit anticancer activity and a subsequent SAR (Structure Activity Relationship) study resulted in 12 additional analogs which were also screened for anticancer activity.

They make critical decisions despite profound uncertainty surrounding invasion ecology, surveillance and control technology effectiveness and human behaviour. We propose a spatially-explicit model that can aid response managers in devising and testing management strategies in a virtual world where the costs of failure are negligible. We apply the model in a group-based decision setting in which participants practise responding to fictional disease incursions in a pome fruit production area in Australia. Using the model, the response management group was able to develop mutually satisfactory rules of thumb for the use of quarantine and destruction zones and for when to withdraw resources from eradication efforts.","Cook, D.

1110,Epistemic Modals and Common Ground,"This paper considers some questions related to the determination of epistemic modal domains. Specifically, given situations in which groups of agents have epistemic states that bear on a modal domain, how is the domain best restricted? This is a metasemantic project, in which I combine a standard semantics for epistemic modals, as developed by Kratzer, with a standard story about conversational dynamics, as developed by Stalnaker. I show how a standard framework for epistemic logic can model their interaction. I contend that if groups have epistemic states that bear on the modal domain, as the data suggests, then careful attention must be paid to the method of combination selected for the epistemic states of the individuals within the group. Specifically, there should be some explanation of the flow of information in a group-deliberative setting. Through this study we find a novel explanation of modal disagreement and uptake.","Cook, E.",0,10.1080/0020174x.2013.784476,414
1111,Atypical interference effect of action observation in autism spectrum conditions,"Background Observing incongruent actions interferes with ongoing action execution. This 'interference effect' is larger for observed biological actions than for non-biological actions. The current study used virtual reality to investigate the biological specificity of interference effects of action observation in autism spectrum conditions (ASC). Method High-functioning adults with ASC and age- and IQ-matched healthy controls performed horizontal sinusoidal arm movements whilst observing arm movements conducted by a virtual reality agent with either human or robot form, which moved with either biological motion or at a constant velocity. In another condition, participants made the same arm movements while observing a real human. Observed arm movements were either congruent or incongruent with executed arm movements. An interference effect was calculated as the average variance in the incongruent action dimension during observation of incongruent compared with congruent movements. Results Control participants exhibited an interference effect when observing real human and virtual human agent incongruent movements but not when observing virtual robot agent movements. Individuals with ASC differed from controls in that they showed no interference effects for real human, virtual human or virtual robot movements. Conclusions The current study demonstrates atypical interference effects in ASC.","Cook, J.",0,10.1017/s0033291713001335,415
1116,Hand Gesture and Mathematics Learning: Lessons From an Avatar,"A beneficial effect of gesture on learning has been demonstrated in multiple domains, including mathematics, science, and foreign language vocabulary. However, because gesture is known to co-vary with other non-verbal behaviors, including eye gaze and prosody along with face, lip, and body movements, it is possible the beneficial effect of gesture is instead attributable to these other behaviors. We used a computer-generated animated pedagogical agent to control both verbal and non-verbal behavior. Children viewed lessons on mathematical equivalence in which an avatar either gestured or did not gesture, while eye gaze, head position, and lip movements remained identical across gesture conditions. Children who observed the gesturing avatar learned more, and they solved problems more quickly. Moreover, those children who learned were more likely to transfer and generalize their knowledge. These findings provide converging evidence that gesture facilitates math learning, and they reveal the potential for using technology to study non-verbal behavior in controlled experiments.","Cook, S.

1121,Causally Valid Relationships That Invoke the Wrong Causal Agent: Construct Validity of the Cause in Policy Research,"Internal validity relates to whether the relationship between two variables is causal. Various identification devices are used to infer the validity of this relationship, such as random assignment or regression discontinuity. However, these devices are irrelevant to validly identifying the name, label, or word that should be attached to the cause or to the effect. Yet, a valid causal relationship has little practical value for theory development or practical action unless the cause and effect are correctly labeled. This paper addresses the theory and practice of correctly labeling interventions. We examine the case study of a reform that was universally labeled as video contact with a judge during bail bond hearings. This reform replaced the practice of face-to-face contact between the judge and person charged. A daily comparative interrupted time series with 530 judges over 17 years shows that various indicators of managerial performance improved after the reform but that bail amounts unexpectedly increased. After almost 9 years, the reform was abandoned. In part, this was because the higher bail amounts were thought to result from the video method used to hear cases and not because of the case details themselves, thus compromising fair treatment under the law. A small subset of judges was chosen to implement the new video system, and analysis of the time-varying composition of judges shows that the selected judges set exceptionally high bail amounts even before the reform and also exercised a virtual monopoly of cases immediately after the reform. Since no increase in bail bond amounts was detected in longitudinal analyses of the judges hearing cases both before and after the new system was put in place, it seems that the higher bail amounts were due to time-varying changes in the kinds of judges implementing the new system and not the new system itself. If the valid increase in bail amounts had been cor rectly attributed to the judges rather than to the video, would the positive management gains of the new system have been foregone?","Cook, T.

1124,Listening to equity-seeking perspectives: how students' experiences of pedagogical partnership can inform wider discussions of student success,"Discussions in higher education have proliferated in recent years regarding not only how to recruit a greater diversity of students but also how to support their success. The voices of students themselves, particularly those students traditionally underrepresented in and underserved by higher education, have important contributions to make to these discussions. This article draws on a larger study of the perspectives of undergraduate students who identify as members of equity-seeking groups (e.g., students who are racialized, LGBTQ+ and first generation) and who have collaborated with faculty in a bi-college, classroom-focused, pedagogical partnership program in the United States. Using constant comparison/grounded theory, I analyzed these students' responses to a question about how participating in this program affected their sense of themselves as students. The themes that emerged across students' responses included how participation in pedagogical partnership (1) fosters important affective experiences in relation to all faculty and to fellow students, (2) informs students' academic engagement in their own classes and (3) contributes to students' sense of their evolution as active agents in their own and others' development. Both affirming and expanding established understandings of what contributes to student success presented in the literature on belonging, engagement and persistence, these themes have implications for how we might support the success of a diversity of students both within and beyond formal pedagogical partnership.","Cook-Sather, A.",0,10.1080/07294360.2018.1457629,418

1130,A computational model of the integration of landmarks and motion in the insect central complex,"The insect central complex (CX) is an enigmatic structure whose computational function has evaded inquiry, but has been implicated in a wide range of behaviours. Recent experimental evidence from the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and the cockroach (Blaberus discoidalis) has demonstrated the existence of neural activity corresponding to the animal's orientation within a virtual arena (a neural `compass'), and this provides an insight into one component of the CX structure. There are two key features of the compass activity: an offset between the angle represented by the compass and the true angular position of visual features in the arena, and the remapping of the 270 degrees visual arena onto an entire circle of neurons in the compass. Here we present a computational model which can reproduce this experimental evidence in detail, and predicts the computational mechanisms that underlie the data. We predict that both the offset and remapping of the fly's orientation onto the neural compass can be explained by plasticity in the synaptic weights between segments of the visual field and the neurons representing orientation. Furthermore, we predict that this learning is reliant on the existence of neural pathways that detect rotational motion across the whole visual field and uses this rotation signal to drive the rotation of activity in a neural ring attractor. Our model also reproduces the `transitioning' between visual landmarks seen when rotationally symmetric landmarks are presented. This model can provide the basis for further investigation into the role of the central complex, which promises to be a key structure for understanding insect behaviour, as well as suggesting approaches towards creating fully autonomous robotic agents.","Cope, A.

1144,"""I Choose... YOU!"" Membership preferences in human-robot teams","Although groups of robots are expected to interact with groups of humans in the near future, research related to teams of humans and robots is still scarce. This paper contributes to the study of human-robot teams by describing the development of two autonomous robotic partners and by investigating how humans choose robots to partner with in a multi-party game context. Our work concerns the successful development of two autonomous robots that are able to interact with a group of two humans in the execution of a task for social and entertainment purposes. The creation of these two characters was motivated by psychological research on learning goal theory, according to which we interpret and approach a given task differently depending on our learning goal. Thus, we developed two robotic characters implemented in two robots: Emys (a competitive robot, based on characteristics related to performance-orientation goals) and Glin (a relationship-driven robot, based on characteristics related to learning-orientation goals). In our study, a group of four (two humans and two autonomous robots) engaged in a card game for social and entertainment purposes. Our study yields several important conclusions regarding groups of humans and robots. (1) When a partner is chosen without previous partnering experience, people tend to prefer robots with relationship-driven characteristics as their partners compared with competitive robots. (2) After some partnering experience has been gained, the choice becomes less clear, and additional driving factors emerge as follows: (2a) participants with higher levels of competitiveness (personal characteristics) tend to prefer Emys, whereas those with lower levels prefer Glin, and (2b) the choice of which robot to partner with also depends on team performance, with the winning team being the preferred choice.","Correia, F.",0,10.1007/s10514-018-9767-9,425
1150,,"This thesis revisits Stanley Milgram’s “cyranoid method” of interactive social psychological experimentation (Milgram, 2010a) and explores the technique’s empirical potential in several domains. The central component of the method is speech shadowing, a procedure that involves a person (the shadower) repeating in real-time words they receive through an innerear monitor by-way-of radio-relay from a remote source. Speech shadowing effectively creates a hybrid agent (a “cyranoid”) composed of the body of one individual (the shadower) and the “mind” (or more precisely, the words) of another (the source). Interactants naïve to this manipulation perceive speech shadowers as autonomous communicators, and this perceptual bias (the “cyranic illusion”) affords researchers the ability to inspect the effects of separately altering the physical (outer) and dispositional (inner) elements of an interlocutor’s identity in contexts involving spontaneous and unscripted face-to-face dialog. Four articles and two additional chapters have been developed for this thesis. Chapter 1, “Introducing and situating the cyranoid method” presents an overview of the cyranoid method alongside an analysis of documents pertaining to the method contained in the Stanley Milgram Papers archive at Yale University and situates the method in the context of the demise of the classical paradigm, or “golden age,” of social psychology. Chapter 2 (Article 1), “Replicating Milgram” (published in the Journal of Social Psychology under the title “Revisiting Milgram’s cyranoid method: Experimenting with hybrid human agents”), examines the cyranic illusion through replications of two of Milgram’s original pilot studies and discusses the method’s potential as a means of conducting person perception. Chapter 3 (Article 2), “Echoborgs: Cyranoids with computer program sources” (published in Frontiers in Psychology under the title “A truly human interface: Interacting face-to-face with someone whose words are determined by a computer program”), expands upon the traditional cyranoid method by exploring situations wherein a conversational agent (a computer program designed to mimic a human interlocutor) sources for a human shadower, thereby producing a special type of cyranoid known as an “echoborg”; the article places the echoborg within the context of android science, a field that uses humanlike machines as stimuli in social psychological research in order to explore various aspects of human interaction (Ishiguro & Nishio, 2007). Chapter 4 (Article 3), “Using echoborgs to assess intersubjective effort in human-agent dialog” (accepted for publication pending minor revisions in Computers in Human Behavior), combines conversation analysis techniques (e.g., Schegloff, 1992, 1993) with the echoborg method to investigate factors that influence how people repair misunderstandings that arise during dialog with conversational agents. Chapter 5 (Article 4), “Cyranoids in first-person, self-experimental research” (published in Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science under the title “The researcher as experimental subject: Using self-experimentation to access experiences, understand social phenomena, and stimulate reflexivity”), explores the history of researcher-as-subject self-experimentation in social psychology and illustrates how the cyranoid method can be used as a first-person means of directly experiencing the consequences of a transformed social identity through systematic self-experimentation. Finally, Chapter 6, “Cyranoid ethics,” discusses the various ethical concerns involved in cyranoid research, outlines how they were mitigated in the current thesis, and offers suggestions for ensuring positive research participant experience.

1151,A truly human interface: interacting face-to-face with someone whose words are determined by a computer program,"We use speech shadowing to create situations wherein people converse in person with a human whose words are determined by a conversational agent computer program. Speech shadowing involves a person (the shadower) repeating vocal stimuli originating from a separate communication source in real-time. Humans shadowing for conversational agent sources (e.g., chat bots) become hybrid agents (""echoborgs"") capable of face-to-face interlocution. We report three studies that investigated people's experiences interacting with echoborgs and the extent to which echoborgs pass as autonomous humans. First, participants in a Turing Test spoke with a chat bot via either a text interface or an echoborg. Human shadowing did not improve the chat bot's chance of passing but did increase interrogators' ratings of how human-like the chat bot seemed. In our second study, participants had to decide whether their interlocutor produced words generated by a chat bot or simply pretended to be one. Compared to those who engaged a text interface, participants who engaged an echoborg were more likely to perceive their interlocutor as pretending to be a chat bot. In our third study, participants were naive to the fact that their interlocutor produced words generated by a chat bot. Unlike those who engaged a text interface, the vast majority of participants who engaged an echoborg did not sense a robotic interaction. These findings have implications for android science, the Turing Test paradigm, and human computer interaction. The human body, as the delivery mechanism of communication, fundamentally alters the social psychological dynamics of interactions with machine intelligence.","Corti, K.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00634,427
1153,Co-constructing intersubjectivity with artificial conversational agents: People are more likely to initiate repairs of misunderstandings with agents represented as human,"This article explores whether people more frequently attempt to repair misunderstandings when speaking to an artificial conversational agent if it is represented as fully human. Interactants in dyadic conversations with an agent (the chat bot Cleverbot) spoke to either a text screen interface (agent's responses shown on a screen) or a human body interface (agent's responses vocalized by a human speech shadower via the echoborg method) and were either informed or not informed prior to interlocution that their interlocutor's responses would be agent-generated. Results show that an interactant is less likely to initiate repairs when an agent-interlocutor communicates via a text screen interface as well as when they explicitly know their interlocutor's words to be agent-generated. That is to say, people demonstrate the most ""intersubjective effort"" toward establishing common ground when they engage an agent under the same social psychological conditions as face-to-face human human interaction (i.e., when they both encounter another human body and assume that they are speaking to an autonomously-communicating person). This articles methodology presents a novel means of benchmarking intersubjectivity and intersubjective effort in human-agent interaction. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1155,Emotional Storytelling Using Virtual and Robotic Agents,"In order to create effective storytelling agents three fundamental questions must be answered: first, is a physically embodied agent preferable to a virtual agent or a voice-only narration? Second, does a human voice have an advantage over a synthesised voice? Third, how should the emotional trajectory of the different characters in a story be related to a storyteller's facial expressions during storytelling time, and how does this correlate with the apparent emotions on the faces of the listeners? The results of two specially designed studies indicate that the physically embodied robot produces more attention to the listener as compared to a virtual embodiment, that a human voice is preferable over the current state of the art of text-to-speech, and that there is a complex yet interesting relation between the emotion lines of the story, the facial expressions of the narrating agent, and the emotions of the listener, and that the empathising of the listener is evident through its facial expressions. This work constitutes an important step towards emotional storytelling robots that can observe their listeners and adapt their style in order to maximise their effectiveness.","Costa, S.",0,10.1142/s0219843618500068,429

These algorithms often focus on the accomplishment of specific tasks analogous to human vision such as scene awareness, object detection, object recognition, and object tracking. Joining forces with cognitive neuroscientists has steered much of this research towards the development of algorithms that not only accomplish the required tasks, but endeavor to do so in a biologically inspired fashion. Still, development and evaluation of these so-called neuromorphic algorithms is often done in isolation, with little regard given to the rest of the system necessary to make this human-like system a reality. This dissertation provides a framework for the current and future development of complex and highly integrated multi-algorithm vision systems. This framework not only enables the composition of such systems, but enables seamless development and integration of improved algorithmic modules. In addition to this high-level system composition framework, the Cerebrum tool, targeted at development of hardware-accelerated architectures is detailed in this work. This tool enables the creation of such hardware-based accelerators by researchers and engineers without specific or detailed knowledge of the target hardware platform. In addition to the framework and tools, this dissertation also details the analysis, development and evaluation of hardware accelerators for HMAX object recognition and AIM saliency detection. Armed with this intelligent framework and algorithmic accelerators, demonstrations of vision systems that leverage multiple algorithms are constructed and evaluated. Hierarchical object classification, leveraging the benefits of Exemplar SVM and accelerated HMAX is shown to provide performance superior to either algorithm in isolation. Furthermore, a more complex system, targeting the domain of personal retail assistance is composed and demonstrated for the benefit of visually impaired persons. With an eye towards future systems, this dissertation also serves to evaluate and explore a number of technologies whose time is coming. New transistors, such as Tunnel FETs, and novel architectures, such as coupled oscillator arrays, are examined to identify benefits and concerns in their use for the development of future visual systems, both at the algorithmic and circuit/component level. This work also explores the potential for inclusion of additional data modalities, such as audio, for a more effective understanding of scene awareness. The flexibility of the framework described here enables the inclusion of these emerging devices, architectures, and modalities alongside traditional software and hardware-accelerated implementations within a unified system in order to develop, evaluate, and deploy all of the components required for any given visual system.","Cotter, Matthew Joseph",0,,430

1161,Nominated actions and their targeted agents in Finnish conversational directives,"In this paper, we explore how future actions are nominated as well as how agents (performers) of future actions are targeted in Finnish conversational directive sequences. The question of agency is particularly worth exploring in Finnish, where subjects need not always be expressed and where special constructions, e.g. with zero-person forms, exist for leaving personal reference open. When used in directive action sequences, the zero-person construction has consequences for the degree of certainty with which the action is nominated, because a modal verb of necessity or desirability is typically involved. Modal constructions in first-position turns have the property that they can be interpreted either as directives, i.e. as having consequences for the behavior of the interlocutor, or as epistemic judgments. Recipients of modal-construction turns with zero-person forms thus have the option of treating the prior turn as a directive by nominating themselves as agents, or as an epistemic judgment by co-evaluating the necessity/desirability of the nominated action. Zero-person forms and modal constructions in both initiating and responsive positions serve as resources for Finnish speakers to locally negotiate the distribution of deontic rights and agency.

The models that we implemented correspond to different approaches to emotions: a categorical approach, a dimensional approach, a cognitive approach, and a social approach. We explain how we implemented and evaluated these models in our Multimodal Affective and Reactive Character framework.

1165,Joint Attention Simulation Using Eye-Tracking and Virtual Humans,"This article analyses the issues pertaining to the simulation of joint attention with virtual humans. Gaze represents a powerful communication channel illustrated by the pivotal role of joint attention in social interactions. To our knowledge, there have been only few attempts to simulate gazing patterns associated with joint attention as a mean for developing empathic virtual agents. Eye-tracking technologies now enable creating non-invasive gaze-contingent systems that empower the user with the ability to lead a virtual human's focus of attention in real-time. Although gaze control can be deliberate, most of our visual behaviors in everyday life are not. This article reports empirical data suggesting that users only have partial awareness of controlling gaze-contingent displays. The technical challenges induced by detecting the user's focus of attention in virtual reality are reviewed and several solutions are compared. We designed and tested a platform for creating virtual humans endowed with the ability to follow the user's attention. The article discusses the advantages of simulating joint attention for improving interpersonal skills and user engagement. Joint attention plays a major role in the development of autism. The platform we designed is intended for research and treatment of autism and tests included participants with this disorder.","Courgeon, M.",0,10.1109/taffc.2014.2335740,434
1169,"Voice anthropomorphism, interlocutor modelling and alignment effects on syntactic choices in human - computer dialogue","The growth of speech interfaces and speech interaction with computer partners has made it increasingly important to understand the factors that determine users' language choices in human computer dialogue. We report two controlled experiments that used a picture-naming-matching task to investigate whether users in human computer speech-based interactions tend to use the same grammatical structures as their conversational partners, and whether such syntactic alignment can impact strong default grammatical preferences. We additionally investigate whether beliefs about system capabilities that are based on partner identity (i.e. human or computer) and speech interface design cues (here, voice anthropomorphism) affect the magnitude of syntactic alignment in such interactions. We demonstrate syntactic alignment for both dative structures (e.g., give the waitress the apple vs. give the apple to the waitress), where there is no strong default preference for one or other structure (Experiment 1), and noun phrase structures (e.g., a purple circle vs. a circle that is purple), where there is a strong default preference for one structure (Experiment 2). The tendency to align syntactically was unaffected by partner identity (human vs. computer) or voice anthropomorphism. These findings have both practical and theoretical implications for HCI by demonstrating the potential for spoken dialogue system behaviour to influence users' syntactic choices in interaction. As well as verifying natural corpora findings, this work also highlights that priming and cognitive mechanisms that are unmediated by beliefs about partner identity could be important in understanding why people align syntactically in human - computer dialogue.

1174,"Education, Francisation, and Shifting Colonial Priorities at the Ursuline Convent in Seventeenth-Century Quebec","One of the goals of the nuns at the Ursuline convent in seventeenth-century Quebec was to Frenchify Indigenous students. This paper presents a new way of interpreting the question of whether the Ursulines succeeded or failed in their efforts at francisation by reading Marie de l'Incarnation's concerns with her order's progress against a broader history of French colonial policy. When royal authorities in France and their agents in New France started to demand that missionaries do more to compel people to replace Indigenous customs with French ones, the Ursulines remained committed to a different approach. Students at the Ursuline convent school retained many Indigenous practices, and the nuns recognized that they had to adapt their pedagogical approaches to fit the realities of daily life in Canada. In facing changing French ideals about assimilation, the Ursulines crafted careful responses by using an additive and accommodationist approach that shows the complexity of francisation within a variegated and dynamic French colonial experience.","Cowan, M.",0,10.3138/chr.99.1.1,436
1175,Deconstructing PI for the ages: Explicit instruction vs. practice in young and older adult bilinguals,"The current study considered effects of PI (explicit information and practice) in two populations: older (age 60+) and young adults (age 19-27), all of whom were late English/Spanish bilinguals. Twenty-one participants completed a computer-based lesson on Latin morphosyntax, namely the assignment of the thematic roles agent and patient. Treatment consisted of a vocabulary lesson, an interactive pre-practice grammar explanation, and input-based task-essential practice (Loschky and Bley-Vroman 1993: 123-163) that followed PI principles (VanPatten 2004). Interpretation, production, and grammaticality judgment tests were used as pre, immediate post, and delayed posttests. Additionally, a grammar test was administered immediately following the grammar lesson (but before practice). Results show that young adults benefit more than older adults from explicit instruction alone and maintain this advantage in interpretation tasks after practice. Crucially, though, practice eliminated some age effects, as the young adults' original advantage was not present on immediate posttests of grammaticality judgment or production, nor was it maintained on any delayed posttest, largely due to a decrease in young adults' accuracy from immediate to delayed posttest. Results are discussed in terms of pedagogical implications of PI practice for different populations and the idea of the flipped classroom.","Cox, J. G.",0,10.1515/iral-2015-0011,437
1177,,"My research broadly has two strands. The first has contributed to work on young children’s use of representational practices, showing how children’s drawing activities are grounded in intention and meaning-making in social contexts. In drawing attention to what children do and how they actively use visual representation it added new insights to theoretical work on learning in a socio-cultural framework where learning is understood as participation in social practices; as joint activity, mediated by other people and cultural activities and artefacts. The second strand was based in these understandings of learning but explored, and also developed communicative practices in classrooms and children’s role in decision-making. The research investigated the extent of the children’s democratic engagement and the development of a more democratically participatory space where they can exercise agency both as learners and as participants in democratic communities. This work also contributed in new ways to children’s agency as researchers. I argue that these two strands are inter-related, a position also represented in my sole-authored book (Cox 2011). In relation to development in pedagogical practices across important areas of teachers’ work, including classroom interaction and communication, curriculum and assessment, I argue in this book that principles can be based in socio-cultural ways of theorising learning, as well as in democratic values, suggesting more ‘participative’ (empowered) participation. Using research evidence and argument I show how changes in classroom practices can be appropriated by conventional theorisations of learning (person-to-person accounts) and existing cultures of ‘schooling’, limiting children’s learning. I explore the tensions that arise, especially in a wider context of performance-driven, market-led policies. An underlying theme is that a shift towards socio-cultural understandings of learning might help to resolve these tensions and achieve changes in practices in possibly transformative ways, creating a more educational culture and embracing the idea of children as agents of cultural change. I aim, in the commentary, to convey the thematic connections and contributions across my work in relation to my role as teacher educator as well as researcher.","Cox, Susan",0,,438
1178,Reconsidering the voice effect when learning from a virtual human,"The current paper investigates an essential design component of virtual humans, the voice they communicate with, by examining the impact of varied voice types. A standard voice effect has held that human voices should be paired with virtual humans. The current study revisits this effect. In a randomized trial, virtual humans used one of three voice types (classic and modern text-to-speech engines, as well as human voice) to present information to a sample of participants from an online population. The impact of each voice type on learning, cognitive load, and perceptions of the virtual human were examined. The study found that the modern voice engine produced significantly more learning on transfer outcomes, had greater training efficiency, and was rated at the same level as an agent with a human voice for facilitating learning and credibility while outperforming the older speech engine. These results call into question previous results using older voice engines and the claims of the voice effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Craig, S.

There is still a need for systematic research into their effectiveness. The current study investigates the positioning of a virtual human's gestures when guiding the learner through a multimedia presentation. Using predictions based on the spatial contiguity principle of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, learners were presented with a multimedia environment presented by a virtual human that did not gesture to guide the learning, gestured with item-specific gestures, or made general gestures close to the item area. The study randomly assigned 77 participants to one of the three conditions. The results indicated that having an agent perform gestures that are specifically targeting the elements discussed or in close vicinity can improve retention. These findings are taken as partial support for of the application of the spatial contiguity principle to virtual humans within multimedia environments.","Craig, S. D.",1,10.1177/0735633115585927,440
1184,"""Our school system is trying to be agrarian"": educating for reskilling and food system transformation in the rural school garden","School gardens and garden-based learning continue to gain great popularity in the United States, and their pedagogical potential, and ability to impact students' fruit and vegetable consumption and activity levels have been well-documented. Less examined is their potential to be agents of food system reskilling and transformation. Though producer and consumer are inextricably linked in the food system, and deskilling of one directly influences the other, theorists often focus on production-centered and consumption-centered deskilling separately. However, in a school garden, the production/consumption disconnect is erased, by virtue of the design of the site itself and how it is utilized by the actors within it. School gardens provide the critical component of education in alternative food networks, and contribute to the producer/consumer reskilling that is a necessary part of food system transformation. We conducted a case study of an established school garden program during its transition from autonomous non-profit to official, district-funded program of a rural school district in the Midwest. By participating in the full seed to plate life cycle of a garden crop, students in the garden were actively involved in the reconnection of producer and consumer, while educators were fostering in students an appreciation for fresh, healthy foods and actively challenging the McDonaldization of both students' diets and education. Based upon these findings, we argue that school gardens in rural areas could leverage the dominant role of rural America in developing and shifting food system paradigms.","Cramer, S.

1187,Rewriting the Battles of Algiers: Ephemeral Tactics in the City at War,"Following conventions in metropolitan France, colonial Algiers was a city of posted proclamations. During the war for independence, officially declared in 1954, posters supporting French Algeria transformed buildings into agents of propaganda. Counterclaims by the National Liberation Front advocating Algeria's independence were scrawled on walls throughout the city, and later aggressively contested by the far-right Secret Army Organization's own poster campaign. New housing estates were animated by painted inscriptions and more fleeting actions, from choreographed illuminations to coordinated choruses from apartment balconies. Here Henri Lefebvre's analysis of the ephemeral provides a critical framework for understanding how urban spaces were given multivalent meanings. Such ephemeral tactics challenged the logic of buildings designed as structures of containment to reimagine them as sites of collective resistance. These performative interventions served to actively produce a conjectural space, one in which it became possible to envision a different future for the city and its residents.","Crane, S.",0,10.1177/1206331215616084,442

We present an embodied agent (Rachael) that simulates a health professional and attempts to help people improve their fruit and vegetable consumption. Emotional and unemotional versions of the agent were developed to examine how user perceptions of the agent changed over an intervention period of 49 days and in turn how this influenced fruit and vegetable consumption. Results found that whilst participants consumed more daily portions of fruit and vegetables over the intervention period and reduced their consumption gains post-intervention, there was no significant difference in consumption gains over time between those who interacted with the emotional or unemotional agents. Qualitative feedback, however, highlighted a strong preference for the emotional agent. A novelty effect was also observed where the agents were perceived more positively initially and less so over time.","Creed, C.",0,10.1093/iwc/iwt064,444

1194,On predicting learning styles in conversational intelligent tutoring systems using fuzzy decision trees,"Intelligent Tutoring Systems personalise learning for students with different backgrounds, abilities, behaviours and knowledge. One way to personalise learning is through consideration of individual differences in preferred learning style. OSCAR is the name of a Conversational Intelligent Tutoring System that models a person's learning style using natural language dialogue during tutoring in order to dynamically predict, and personalise, their tutoring session. Prediction of learning style is undertaken by capturing independent behaviour variables during the tutoring conversation with the highest value variable determining the student's learning style. A weakness of this approach is that it does not take into consideration the interactions between behaviour variables and, due to the uncertainty inherently present in modelling learning styles, small differences in behaviour can lead to incorrect predictions. Consequently, the learner is presented with tutoring material not suited to their learning style. This paper proposes a new method that uses fuzzy decision trees to build a series of fuzzy predictive models combining these variables for all dimensions of the Felder Silverman Learning Styles model. Results using live data show the fuzzy models have increased the predictive accuracy of OSCAR-CITS across four learning style dimensions and facilitated the discovery of some interesting relationships amongst behaviour variables.

Pixel-wise topographical statistical analysis of Laetoli footprint morphology, compared with results from experimental studies of footprint formation; foot-pressure measurements in bipedalism of humans and non-human great apes; and computer simulation techniques, indicate that most of these functional features were already present, albeit less strongly expressed than in ourselves, in the maker of the Laetoli G-1 footprint trail, 3.66 Mya.

The design of the rules which enable the ECA to respond intelligently to different types of interruptions was informed by manually analysed real data from human-human dialogue. The rules represent recoveries from interruptions as two-part structures: an address followed by a resumption. The system is robust enough to manage long, multi-utterance turns by both user and system, which creates good opportunities for the user to interrupt while the ECA is speaking.","Crook, N.",0,10.1007/s12193-012-0090-z,448

1216,The shaping of social perception by stimulus and knowledge cues to human animacy,"Although robots are becoming an ever-growing presence in society, we do not hold the same expectations for robots as we do for humans, nor do we treat them the same. As such, the ability to recognize cues to human animacy is fundamental for guiding social interactions. We review literature that demonstrates cortical networks associated with person perception, action observation and mentalizing are sensitive to human animacy information. In addition, we show that most prior research has explored stimulus properties of artificial agents (humanness of appearance or motion), with less investigation into knowledge cues (whether an agent is believed to have human or artificial origins). Therefore, currently little is known about the relationship between stimulus and knowledge cues to human animacy in terms of cognitive and brain mechanisms. Using fMRI, an elaborate belief manipulation, and human and robot avatars, we found that knowledge cues to human animacy modulate engagement of person perception and mentalizing networks, while stimulus cues to human animacy had less impact on social brain networks. These findings demonstrate that self-other similarities are not only grounded in physical features but are also shaped by prior knowledge. More broadly, as artificial agents fulfil increasingly social roles, a challenge for roboticists will be to manage the impact of pre-conceived beliefs while optimizing human-like design.","Cross, E.

1221,A neurocognitive investigation of the impact of socializing with a robot on empathy for pain,"To what extent can humans form social relationships with robots? In the present study, we combined functional neuroimaging with a robot socializing intervention to probe the flexibility of empathy, a core component of social relationships, towards robots. Twenty-six individuals underwent identical fMRI sessions before and after being issued a social robot to take home and interact with over the course of a week. While undergoing fMRI, participants observed videos of a human actor or a robot experiencing pain or pleasure in response to electrical stimulation. Repetition suppression of activity in the pain network, a collection of brain regions associated with empathy and emotional responding, was measured to test whether socializing with a social robot leads to greater overlap in neural mechanisms when observing human and robotic agents experiencing pain or pleasure. In contrast to our hypothesis, functional region-of-interest analyses revealed no change in neural overlap for agents after the socializing intervention. Similarly, no increase in activation when observing a robot experiencing pain emerged post-socializing. Whole-brain analysis showed that, before the socializing intervention, superior parietal and early visual regions are sensitive to novel agents, while after socializing, medial temporal regions show agent sensitivity. A region of the inferior parietal lobule was sensitive to novel emotions, but only during the pre-socializing scan session. Together, these findings suggest that a short socialization intervention with a social robot does not lead to discernible differences in empathy towards the robot, as measured by behavioural or brain responses. We discuss the extent to which long-term socialization with robots might shape social cognitive processes and ultimately our relationships with these machines.

1236,,"Future cancer registry systems will be provided on elastic and scalable systems in order to cost effectively allow for data sharing agreements to be realized. In order to develop systems to link the various disciplines of the health care industry, it is proposed that modeling and simulation techniques be used to reduce risk and improve the rate of adoption. A novel hybrid agent-based modeling simulation engine, PyModel, is developed to simulate load data for basic workflow operations in existing systems to produce models of larger scale information systems without the requirement to build full-scale prototype systems. This may reduce the risks involved with implementing large-scale health informatics systems. A number of experiments are conducted in which a virtual machine encapsulated system is constructed to provide either web or Grid based servers, acted upon by web or Grid based clients. Workflow load data were recorded and used as a basic load building block to model larger and more complex system configurations. Additional tests were performed to indicate other performance features of a Grid based interface's suitability for providing scalable database services for public health surveillance networks. The experiments resulted in three core results. The first illustrates that the computer model closely matches calibration data for multiple web servers retrieving data from a single web server. The second instance of multiple client web services interfacing against multiple web service appliances also calibrates against real world observed data. The third significant result shows a close correlation between real world observed data against a model comprising of multiple Grid clients interfacing to multiple Grid services in both appliance and standalone configurations. The experiments show that the configurations of both web and Grid clients interfacing to respective appliances calibrates closely with real world measurements for the same configurations. The observed data supplies the model with building blocks for simulating parallelized models of both web and Grid based services. The use of black box performance and load data to simulate systems of a more complex configuration in a scalable manner is more effective than building a traditional agent based model.","Cryer, Martin Eric",0,,453
1237,ARTIE: An Integrated Environment for the Development of Affective Robot Tutors,"Over the last decade robotics has attracted a great deal of interest from teachers and researchers as a valuable educational tool from preschool to highschool levels. The implementation of social-support behaviors in robot tutors, in particular in the emotional dimension, can make a significant contribution to learning efficiency. With the aim of contributing to the rising field of affective robot tutors we have developed ARTIE (Affective Robot Tutor Integrated Environment). We offer an architectural pattern which integrates any given educational software for primary school children with a component whose function is to identify the emotional state of the students who are interacting with the software, and with the driver of a robot tutor which provides personalized emotional pedagogical support to the students. In order to support the development of affective robot tutors according to the proposed architecture, we also provide a methodology which incorporates a technique for eliciting pedagogical knowledge from teachers, and a generic development platform. This platform contains a component for identiying emotional states by analysing keyboard and mouse interaction data, and a generic affective pedagogical support component which specifies the affective educational interventions (including facial expressions, body language, tone of voice,...) in terms of BML (a Behavior Model Language for virtual agent specification) files which are translated into actions of a robot tutor. The platform and the methodology are both adapted to primary school students. Finally, we illustrate the use of this platform to build a prototype implementation of the architecture, in which the educational software is instantiated with Scratch and the robot tutor with NAO. We also report on a user experiment we carried out to orient the development of the platform and of the prototype. We conclude from our work that, in the case of primary school students, it is possible to identify, without using intrusive and expensive identification methods, the emotions which most affect the character of educational interventions. Our work also demonstrates the feasibility of a general-purpose architecture of decoupled components, in which a wide range of educational software and robot tutors can be integrated and then used according to different educational criteria.","Cuadrado, L.

1240,A note of caution regarding anthropomorphism in HCI agents,"Universal usability is an important component of HCI, particularly as companies promote their products in increasingly global markets to users with diverse cultural backgrounds. Successful anthropomorphic agents must have appropriate computer etiquette and nonverbal communication patterns. Because there are differences in etiquette, tone, formality, and colloquialisms across different user populations, it is unlikely that a generic anthropomorphic agent would be universally appealing. Additionally, because anthropomorphic characters are depicted as capable of human reasoning and possessing human motivations, users may ascribe undue trust in these agents. Trust is a complex construct that exerts an important role in a user's interactions with an interface or system. Feelings and perceptions about an anthropomorphic agent may impact the construction of a mental model about a system, which may lead to inappropriate calibrations of automation trust that is based on an emotional connection with the anthropomorphic agent rather than on actual system performance.

1242,,"We live in a populous world. Furthermore, as social animals, we participate in activities which draw us together into shared spaces – office buildings, city sidewalks, parks, events (e.g., religious, sporting, or political), etc. Models that can predict how crowds of humans behave in such settings would be valuable in allowing us to analyze the designs for novel environments and anticipate issues with space utility and safety. They would also better enable robots to safely work in a common environment with humans. Furthermore, credible simulation of crowds of humans would allow us to populate virtual worlds, helping to increase the immersive properties of virtual reality or entertainment applications. We propose a new model for pedestrian crowd simulation: Pedestrian Velocity Obstacles (PedVO). PedVO is based on Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA), a local navigation algorithm for computing optimal feasible velocities which simultaneously avoid collisions while still allowing the agents to progress toward their individual goals. PedVO extends ORCA by introducing new models of pedestrian behavior and relationships in conjunction with a modified geometric optimization planning technique to efficiently simulate agents with improved human-like behaviors. PedVO introduces asymmetric relationships between agents through two complementary techniques: Composite Agents and Right of Way. The former exploits the underlying collision avoidance mechanism to encode abstract factors and the latter modifies the optimization algorithm's constraint definition to enforce asymmetric coordination. PedVO further changes the optimization algorithm to more fully encode the agent's knowledge of its environment, allowing the agent to make more intelligent decisions, leading to a better utilization of space and improved flow. PedVO incorporates a new model, which works in conjunction with the local planning algorithm, to introduce a ubiquitous density-sensitive behavior observed in human crowds – the so-called “fundamental diagram.” We also provide a physically-plausible, interactive model for simulating walking motion to support the computed agent trajectories. We evaluate these techniques by simulating various scenarios, such as pedestrian experiments and a challenging real-world scenario: simulating the performance of the Tawaf, an aspect of the Muslim Hajj.","Curtis, Sean",0,,456
1243,,"Agent‐oriented pedagogies have been used in teaching concepts related to complex systems dynamics. However, little research has systematically explored the role of a strong agency‐oriented focus on understanding of complex, dynamic ecological systems. This study analyzed seventh graders' (n = 216) explanations of a complex ecological scenario. The findings show that students were more likely to generate agentive than nonagentive explanations and students who adopted an agentive framing were least likely to understand the complex causal dynamics of two environmental scenarios, eutrophication in a pond and acid rain in a forest. Furthermore, students' initial inclination toward agency‐oriented explanation on the assessment was predictive of their performance on a postassessment following an instructional opportunity to learn about ecosystems dynamics; a strong agency orientation corresponded to less complex interpretations of the dynamics of the ecosystems. The results suggest that a strongly agentive perspective may limit students' ability to learn complex systems dynamics and that the pedagogical advantages of agent‐based approaches may not be without limitations.

1247,The Anthropomorphic Analogy: Humanising musical machines in the early modern and contemporary eras,"Since the late twentieth century, the development of cybernetics, physical computing and robotics has led artists and researchers to create musical systems that explore the relationship between human bodies and mechanical systems. Anthropomorphic musical robots and bodily integrated 'cyborg' sensor interfaces explore complementary manifestations of what we call the 'anthropomorphic analogy', which probes the boundary between human artificer and artificial machine, encouraging listeners and viewers to humanise non-musical machines and understand the human body itself as a mechanical instrument. These new approaches to the anthropomorphic analogy benefit from historical contextualisation. At numerous points in the history of Western art music, philosophers, critics, composers, performers and instrument designers have considered the relationship between human musician and musical instrument, often blurring the line between the two. Consideration of historical examples enriches understandings of anthropomorphism in contemporary music technology. This article juxtaposes the anthropomorphic analogy in contemporary musical culture with manifestations of anthropomorphism in early seventeenth-century Europe. The first half of the seventeenth century witnessed a flourishing of instrumentality of all sorts. Musical instruments were linked with the telescope, the clock, the barometer, the paintbrush, and many other instruments and machines, and these came to be understood as vehicles for the creation of knowledge. This flourishing of instrumental culture created new opportunities for contemplation and aesthetic wonder, as theorists considered the line between human being and machine - between nature and artifice. Manifestations of the anthropomorphic analogy in seventeenth-century conceptions of musical instruments help to contextualise and explain similar articulations of the anthropomorphic analogy in the present day.","Cypess, R.",0,10.1017/s1355771818000043,458

The novel pyrrole-based compounds targeting the colchicine site were docked into the receptor using HINT as a rescoring function. Two distinct binding modes dictated by the size and shape of a subpocket were predicted to differentiate the highly active compounds from the weak ones. Of the residues predicted to participate in binding for the active binding mode, Cys241β was revealed to form a weak but critical hydrogen bond with the ligand. A larger collection of colchicine-site agents, biologically tested in the same laboratory including our pyrrole-based compounds were subject to 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study. Using results on docking the pyrrole compounds as a guide, relative binding poses and QSAR models were built to facilitate ligand design and optimization. A new 3D modeling approach was introduced to visually highlight the unique features of highly active compounds and the commonality of all compounds in the dataset using HINT maps and successfully tested on the colchicine-site agents. These results will provide valuable guidance in the future design and development of new colchicine-site agents. To incorporate tautomerism within HINT, we proposed and developed two workflow approaches: a general search tool using a simple and intuitive algorithm analyzing hydrogen shift patterns to identify and enumerate tautomeric structures, and a database that contains commonly observed tautomeric structures. The first approach was designed for small-scale docking studies and the second approach was designed for large-scale virtual screening. The tautomer module in HINT will give more accurate modeling results when the compound encountered is able to tautomerize.","Da, Chenxiao",0,,461
1253,"Ruminative minds, wandering minds: Effects of rumination and mind wandering on lexical associations, pitch imitation and eye behaviour","This study demonstrates that rumination is reflected in two behavioural signals that both play an important role in face-to-face interactions and provides evidence for the negative impact of rumination on social cognition. Sixty-one students were randomly assigned either to a condition in which rumination was induced or to a control condition. Their task was to play a speech-based word association game with an Embodied Conversational Agent during which their word associations, pitch imitation and eye movements were measured. Two questionnaires assessed their ruminative tendencies and mind wandering thoughts, respectively. Rumination predicted differences in task-related mind wandering, polarity of lexical associations, pitch imitation, and blinks while mind wandering predicted differences in saccades. This outcome may show that rumination has a negative impact on certain aspects of social interactions.","da Silva, M. R. D.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0207578,462
1256,,"This study examined teachers’ literacy and technology integration in their design of Internet-based lessons for Grade 1-6 students using a tool that scaffolds the design process to focus on Internet resources and reading strategies. Twenty-six teachers’ lessons on a public database were analyzed for design orientation, goals, curricular integration, linked web site characteristics, reading strategies, and student response. Findings suggested that the tool shaped teachers’ designs, supporting embedding of Internet multimodal resources and comprehension strategies in online lessons. Teachers’ dominant design orientation was to provide students with a multimodal immersion experience to enhance understanding and engagement with literature or other subject-matter. The majority of teachers took advantage of reading strategies support, with more than one half customizing pedagogical agents. Few teachers used web evaluation or media literacies support. The potential for educative design tools is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Dalton, Bridget",0,,463
1258,,"Everyday face-to-face social interaction is increasingly being supplemented by computer- and video-mediated communication. With mediation, however, comes the potential loss of important non-verbal cues. It is therefore important to attempt to maintain the quality of the mediated interaction, such that it retains as many of the aspects of a real-world interaction as possible. Social presence is a measure of how similar a mediated interaction is to face-to-face, the most socially present situation, in terms of perceptions of and behaviour towards an interlocutor. Social presence can be mediated by many factors, one of which is mutual gaze, and social perceptions of an interlocutor are also thought to be related to task performance. For a successful interaction, therefore, an optimum amount of mutual gaze for maximising social presence and task performance is desirable. This research aims to investigate the relationship between mutual gaze, task performance and social presence, in order to discover the ideal conditions under which a successful mediated interaction can occur. Previous gaze research paradigms have involved one conversational partner staring continuously at the other, and the resulting mutual gaze being measured. It is hypothesised that this method may actually suppress mutual gaze, primarily due to social reasons. It is potentially, therefore, not the optimum experimental design for mutual gaze research. The first study in this thesis used eye-tracking to explore this hypothesis and investigate the relationship between mutual gaze and task performance. A suitable paradigm was developed, based on that used in previous research into eye movements and non-verbal communication. Two participants – Instruction Giver (IG) and Instruction Follower (IF) – communicated via avatars in Second Life to solve simple arithmetic tasks. There were two between-participant looking conditions: staring (the IG’s avatar stared continuously at the IF); and notstaring, (IG’s avatar looked at IF and task-relevant objects). Constant staring did, indeed, show evidence of decreasing mutual gaze within the dyad. Mutual gaze was positively correlated with task performance scores, but only in the not-staring condition. When not engaged in mutual gaze, the IF looked more at task-related objects in the not-staring condition than in the staring condition; this suggests that social factors are likely to be driving the gaze aversion in the staring condition. Furthermore, there are no task-related benefits to staring. The second study explored further how much looking by one person at another will maximise both mutual gaze and task performance between the dyad. It also investigated the relationship between mutual gaze, task performance and both manipulated and perceived social presence. Individual participants interacted with a virtual agent within the Second Life paradigm previously used in the human-human study. Participants were either told they were interacting with a computer (i.e. an agent) or another human (an avatar). This provided the between-participants manipulated social presence variable, or agency. The virtual agent was programmed to look at the participant during either 0%, 25%, 50% or 75% of the interaction, providing the within-participants variable looking condition. The majority of effects were found in the 75% looking condition, including the highest mutual gaze uptake and the highest social presence ratings (measured via a questionnaire). Although the questionnaire did not detect any differences in social presence between the agent and avatar condition, participants were significantly faster to complete the tasks in the avatar condition than in the agent condition. This suggests that behavioural measures may be more effective at detecting differences in social presence than questionnaires alone. The results are discussed in relation to different theories of social interaction. Implications and limitations of the findings are considered and suggestions for future work are made.","Dalzel-Job, Sara",0,,464

1260,Attitudinal Change in Elderly Citizens Toward Social Robots: The Role of Personality Traits and Beliefs About Robot Functionality,"Attitudes toward robots influence the tendency to accept or reject robotic devices. Thus it is important to investigate whether and how attitudes toward robots can change. In this pilot study we investigate attitudinal changes in elderly citizens toward a tele-operated robot in relation to three parameters: (i) the information provided about robot functionality, (ii) the number of encounters, (iii) personality type. Fourteen elderly residents at a rehabilitation center participated. Pre encounter attitudes toward robots, anthropomorphic thinking, and personality were assessed. Thereafter the participants interacted with a tele-operated robot (Telenoid) during their lunch (c. 30 min.) for up to 3 days. Half of the participants were informed that the robot was teleoperated (IC) whilst the other half were naive to its functioning (UC). Post-encounter assessments of attitudes toward robots and anthropomorphic thinking were undertaken to assess change. Attitudes toward robots were assessed with a new generic 35-items questionnaire (attitudes toward social robots scale: ASOR-5), offering a differentiated conceptualization of the conditions for social interaction. There was no significant difference between the IC and UC groups in attitude change toward robots though trends were observed. Personality was correlated with some tendencies for attitude changes; Extraversion correlated with positive attitude changes to intimate personal relatedness with the robot (r = 0.619) and to psychological relatedness (r = 0.581) whilst Neuroticism correlated negatively (r = 0.582) with mental relatedness with the robot. The results tentatively suggest that neither information about functionality nor direct repeated encounters are pivotal in changing attitudes toward robots in elderly citizens. This may reflect a cognitive congruence bias where the robot is experienced in congruence with initial attitudes, or it may support action-based explanations of cognitive dissonance reductions, given that robots, unlike computers, are not yet perceived as action targets. Specific personality traits may be indicators of attitude change relating to specific domains of social interaction. Implications and future directions are discussed.","Damholdt, M.

1267,Anthropomorphism in Human-Robot Co-evolution,"Social robotics entertains a particular relationship with anthropomorphism, which it neither sees as a cognitive error, nor as a sign of immaturity. Rather it considers that this common human tendency, which is hypothesized to have evolved because it favored cooperation among early humans, can be used today to facilitate social interactions between humans and a new type of cooperative and interactive agents - social robots. This approach leads social robotics to focus research on the engineering of robots that activate anthropomorphic projections in users. The objective is to give robots ""social presence"" and ""social behaviors"" that are sufficiently credible for human users to engage in comfortable and potentially long-lasting relations with these machines. This choice of 'applied anthropomorphism' as a research methodology exposes the artifacts produced by social robotics to ethical condemnation: social robots are judged to be a ""cheating"" technology, as they generate in users the illusion of reciprocal social and affective relations. This article takes position in this debate, not only developing a series of arguments relevant to philosophy of mind, cognitive sciences, and robotic AI, but also asking what social robotics can teach us about anthropomorphism. On this basis, we propose a theoretical perspective that characterizes anthropomorphism as a basic mechanism of interaction, and rebuts the ethical reflections that a priori condemns ""anthropomorphism-based"" social robots. To address the relevant ethical issues, we promote a critical experimentally based ethical approach to social robotics, ""synthetic ethics,"" which aims at allowing humans to use social robots for two main goals: self-knowledge and moral growth.","Damiano, L.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00468,467
1269,Human-Like Sequential Learning of Escape Routes for Virtual Reality Agents,"The Piper Alpha disaster (1988) witnessed 167 casualties. The offshore safety guidelines developed afterward highlighted the need for effective and regular training to overcome the problems in evacuation procedures. Today, virtual environments are effective training platforms due to high-end audio/visual and interactive capabilities. These virtual environments exploit agents with human-like steering capabilities, but with limited or no capacity to learn routes. This work proposes a sequential route learning methodology for agents that resembles the way people learn routes. The methodology developed here exploits a generalized stochastic Petri-net based route learning model iteratively. The simulated results are compared with the route learning strategies of human participants. The data on human participants were collected by the authors from an earlier study in a virtual environment. The main contribution lies in modeling people's route learning behavior over the course of successive exposures. It is found that the proposed methodology models human-like sequential route learning if there are no easy detours from the original escape route. Although the model does not accurately capture individual learning strategies for all decision nodes, it can be used as a model of compliant, rule-following training guides for a virtual environment.","Danial, S.

1273,,"In this thesis, we report on research work concerning various aspects of interaction between an android head and its environment. The research aims at building a reusable framework of interaction through facial expressions and vision which can be used for a wide range of humanoid robotic heads. The framework contains specially programmed modules that enable the android head to effectively interact with its environment via facial expressions and neck-eye coordinated motion. The object detection and tracking module enables the android head to detect and track objects and users through coordinated motions of neck and eye. The module has the capability of using multiple cameras in order to track a target. This helps for building a wider coverage of tracking area. We present the work conducted in implementing and evaluating several controller algorithms to imitate human-like tracking in an android head. The facial expressions learning and imitation module comprises different methods for generating facial expressions in the android head. This module uses batch training of neural networks and can automatically recalibrate facial expressions for the android, a very tedious and time consuming process. This helps in carrying out realistic conversations with users. During conversation, lip syncing capabilities in an android head is of utmost importance for making it human-like. In the thesis, we also discuss the necessity of having a proper lip sync module in place and the ""McGurk effect"" to be avoided during conversation.","Das, Sumit Kumar",0,,469
1274,A recommender agent based on learning styles for better virtual collaborative learning experiences,"Almost unlimited access to educational information plethora came with a drawback: finding meaningful material is not a straightforward task anymore. Based on a survey related to how students find additional bibliographical resources for university courses, we concluded there is a strong need for recommended learning materials, for specialized online search and for personalized learning tools. As a result, we developed an educational collaborative filtering recommender agent, with an integrated learning style finder. The agent produces two types of recommendations: suggestions and shortcuts for learning materials and learning tools, helping the learner to better navigate through educational resources. Shortcuts are created taking into account only the user's profile, while suggestions are created using the choices made by the learners with similar learning styles. The learning style finder assigns to each user a profile model, taking into account an index of learning styles, as well as patterns discovered in the virtual behavior of the user. The current study presents the agent itself, as well as its integration to a virtual collaborative learning environment and its success and limitations, based on users' feedback.

1280,The Sense of Agency Is More Sensitive to Manipulations of Outcome than Movement-Related Feedback Irrespective of Sensory Modality,"The sense of agency describes the ability to experience oneself as the agent of one's own actions. Previous studies of the sense of agency manipulated the predicted sensory feedback related either to movement execution or to the movement's outcome, for example by delaying the movement of a virtual hand or the onset of a tone that resulted from a button press. Such temporal sensorimotor discrepancies reduce the sense of agency. It remains unclear whether movement-related feedback is processed differently than outcome-related feedback in terms of agency experience, especially if these types of feedback differ with respect to sensory modality. We employed a mixed-reality setup, in which participants tracked their finger movements by means of a virtual hand. They performed a single tap, which elicited a sound. The temporal contingency between the participants' finger movements and (i) the movement of the virtual hand or (ii) the expected auditory outcome was systematically varied. In a visual control experiment, the tap elicited a visual outcome. For each feedback type and participant, changes in the sense of agency were quantified using a forced-choice paradigm and the Method of Constant Stimuli. Participants were more sensitive to delays of outcome than to delays of movement execution. This effect was very similar for visual or auditory outcome delays. Our results indicate different contributions of movement-versus outcome-related sensory feedback to the sense of agency, irrespective of the modality of the outcome. We propose that this differential sensitivity reflects the behavioral importance of assessing authorship of the outcome of an action.","David, N.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0161156,471
1285,Connecting the dots: how personal need for structure produces false consumer pattern perceptions,"The human tendency to recognize patterns even when none exist is shown to have applications in consumer behavior. The current research demonstrates that as one's personal need for structure (PNS) increases (i.e., requiring predictability and disfavoring uncertainty), false consumer pattern perceptions emerge. Construal level moderates this relationship such that as abstract mindsets (high construal) seek out underlying explanations and enhance, concrete mindsets (low construal) evaluate consumer-related stimuli in terms of its contextual elements and therefore attenuate the effect. Types of consumer patterns are characterized by false expectations about the performance of a cellular phone (study 1), the association of human characteristics toward personal computers (study 2), and the development of beliefs in corporate conspiracy theories (study 3). This research has implications for practitioners and academics as it expands on the literature related to false pattern perceptions by investigating it through the lens of consumer decision-making.","Davidson, A.",0,10.1007/s11002-014-9332-z,472
1287,,"This thesis highlights the research and findings of a PhD project designed to investigate whether mimicry!, Genetic Programming and computer game technologies could be used to create controllers for artificial humans that encourage anthropomorphic behaviour. From an initial broad research focus, the project eventually concentrated on the anthropomorphic attributes of behaviours demonstrated by Non-Player Characters (NPCs) used by computer games. In a deliberate attempt to uncover a viable alternative to existing mechanisms, the project sought to apply Artificial Intelligence systems more commonly used in academic Computer Science research to a computer game context. As part of this research, a new Artificial Intelligence mechanism was developed, (UK Patent Application No. 1012243.0), which combined elements of Genetic Programming and mimicry. The new mechanism was subsequently dubbed 'Genetic Profiling' and forms the core research presented herein. To further investigate the Genetic Profiling mechanism a number of environments were required either to act as evaluation test-beds or as an integral part of the new Artificial Intelligence strategy by supplying raw behavioural data from real people. The iWorld concept outlined in this document categorises these augmented environments, which could exist as physical, virtual or mixed-reality entities. Several iWorlds were created for use by this project, including the deployment of a Massive Multiuser Online (MMO) environment. Each was used to evaluate different implementations of the Genetic Profiling mechanism, including several possible strategies for generating and representing artificial behavioural data. Most of these iWorlds were customised to evaluate the performance of generated NPC controllers with special regard to a specific aspect of computer game design. In addition to extensive quantitative testing, the anthropomorphic attributes of artificial Genetic Profiling NPC controllers were evaluated qualitatively, using a bespoke testing strategy inspired by the 'Turing Test' experiments. Furthermore, to provide additional grounding and justification, models and theories from Psychology concerning human personalities were adapted to allow better representation and analysis of generated behaviours. Inspired by this research, the project proposes a hierarchical architecture describing the structure and contents of artificial human personalities generated using the Genetic Profiling mechanism. By grounding the artificial behaviours produced by Genetic Profiling in this way it was possible to identify sets of rudimentary Traits in artificial personalities, based upon the behavioural content generated for NPC controllers. At the time of writing, in addition to a patent application the research performed by this project and results from some of its investigations have provided content for a number of peer-reviewed international conference and journal papers. Essentially, the research presented in this document details the first-steps of a new paradigm for potentially allowing NPCs present in computer games to behave more like human players. As such, based upon this initial ground-world, there are several possible directions and augmentations that could potentially be made to the Genetic Profiling mechanism, should this project be continued in the future.","Davies, M.

1288,,"Research suggests that the commercialization of technological innovation is a key lever of successful entrepreneurship (Datta, Mukherjee, & Jessup, 2015). Through novel innovations, new educational technology (EdTech) businesses create new markets that offer impactful products and services to catalyze learning in schools (Singer, 2015). New public K-12 school curricula, demanding workforce requirements, and increasing global competition underscore several factors that continue to push United States educators and government agencies to seek new technology solutions in hopes of solving educational problems (Kovalskys, 2016). As the enrollment of public K-12 students steadily increases along with the need to develop a competitive 21st-century workforce, the EdTech market continues to attract investors and new businesses that are eager to capitalize on the next commercialized offer. Given the complex nature of businesses and school environments, a qualitative multi-case study was employed to understand how EdTech start-up businesses design their products and strategies to promote use and adoption by school decision-makers and teachers in a public K-12 school. The need for this study was underscored by data that show entrepreneurs, investors, and educators increasingly devoting significant time and money in EdTech companies, while historical trends show that the use and adoption of new technologies in the classroom are low (Bakir, 2015; Barshay, 2014; Newton, 2016). Numerous studies, although narrow in focus, point to the limited use and adoption of EdTech in the classroom as a problem that plagues entrepreneurial businesses and schools (Byers & Frey, 2012; Zhao, 2017). The theoretical framework that guided this study combined user perception factors proposed by Davis’s (1986) technology acceptance model and knowledge components identified by Koehler and Mishra’s (2009) technological pedagogical and content knowledge framework within the context of an ecosystem construct, as presented by Zhao and Frank (2003). This study found that educational technology businesses prioritize activities that demonstrate value and use of products or services to promote use and adoption by school decision-makers and teachers in a public K-12 school ecosystem, as both school decision-makers and teachers use learned value to promote use and adoption of the educational technology along the chain of agents.","Davis, Dowayne D.",0,,474
1289,,"Prior research has examined underrepresented students in engineering from a deficit-oriented perspective. Black students are the most vulnerable subgroup in engineering due to low undergraduate completion rates and low participation in the workforce. We know that successful Black engineering students exist, and often thrive, at highly selective and competitive and predominantly White institutions (PWIs). These institutions can be unwelcoming and unsupportive environments for Black students, exposing them to risk factors that threaten their success. This qualitative study examines the lives and collegiate experiences of 57 Black undergraduate engineering students at 15 PWIs with highly-competitive engineering programs across six states through semi-structured in-person or virtual interviews. The goal of this study is to understand the individual and institutional factors that most contributed to their persistence, retention, academic success, and completion of their programs. Portraiture served as the methodological framework for its ability to capture the complex and multi-dimensional nature of the human experience. Seven themes emerged as representative of the Black engineering experience: (1) foundations in engineering; (2) adapting to college STEM rigor; (3) building community; (4) peer mentoring and support; (5) navigating the racial climate; (6) identifying institutional priorities; and (7) obstacles. The empirical conclusions from this study are as follows: formalized and extemporaneous collegiate communities helped Black engineering students adapt to college environments and reduce the risk of attrition; quality of pre-college math and science experiences influenced but were not determinative of future success; diversity strategies were perceived as ineffective and disingenuous; and the global racial climate had direct and potentially damaging effects for race relations on local campuses.

Given the high risks, modeling and simulation (M&S) plays a significant role in planning and training for the spectrum of -derivate scenarios. Existing reactor models are largely legacy, stove-piped designs lacking interoperability between themselves and other M&S tools for emergency preparedness system evaluation and training. Unmanned systems present a growing area of technology promising significant improvement in response and mitigation. To bridge the gap between current and future models, we propose a conceptual model (CM) for integrating live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) models with nuclear disaster and mitigation models utilizing a system-of-systems (SoS) approach. The CM offers to synergistically enhance current reactor and dispersion simulations with intervening avatar and agent simulations. The SoS approach advances life cycle stages including concept exploration, system design, engineering, training, and mission rehearsal.

1296,,"Animated pedagogical agents (APAs) are lifelike characters in computer-based environments that help to facilitate learning through social interactions (Son, 2014). APAs are useful when designing multimedia presentations because of the flexibility with agent design, the ability to perform multiple roles, and the affordance to be manually manipulated for better learning opportunities. However, one area that has been sparsely researched to date with APAs is the act of gesturing. APA studies routinely use deictic gestures, but ignore the potential role of iconic, beat, and metaphoric gestures. If APAs are to simulate human-like interaction, then APAs need to incorporate deictic, iconic, metaphoric, and beat gestures into their speech. This study examined APAs in three conditions: full gestures, deictic only gestures, and no gesture conditions. In the full gesture condition, the APA was designed to use body sway, facial expressions, eye blinks, lip synchronization, and a variety of gestures such as deictic, iconic, metaphoric, and beat gestures. The deictic only gesture condition used body sway, facial expressions, eye blinks, and lip synchronization, but only used deictic gestures – to replicate the common gesture design of APAs. The no gesture control condition included body sway, facial expressions, eye blinks, and lip synchronization, but all gestures were eliminated. Social acceptance was measured by the completion of the Korean agent persona instrument (Ryu, 2012) and analyzed with a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). No significant difference was found in learning outcomes across conditions. However, APAs in the full gesture condition supported the person effect as they were found to be significantly more human-like and engaging than APAs in the no gesture condition. Stepwise multiple regression analysis found evidence that social acceptance factors “human-like” and “engaging” had negative associations with learning outcome scores. This research provides evidence that APAs with full gesture capabilities have the ability to increase social perception by learners.","Davis, Robert Otto",1,,479

1305,,"Recent developments in neuroimaging research support the increased use of naturalistic stimulus material such as film, avatars, or androids. These stimuli allow for a better understanding of how the brain processes information in complex situations while maintaining experimental control. While avatars and androids are well suited to study human cognition, they should not be equated to human stimuli. For example, the uncanny valley hypothesis theorizes that artificial agents with high human-likeness may evoke feelings of eeriness in the human observer. Here we review if, when, and how the perception of human-like avatars and androids differs from the perception of humans and consider how this influences their utilization as stimulus material in social and affective neuroimaging studies. First, we discuss how the appearance of virtual characters affects perception. When stimuli are morphed across categories from non-human to human, the most ambiguous stimuli, rather than the most human-like stimuli, show prolonged classification times and increased eeriness. Human-like to human stimuli show a positive linear relationship with familiarity. Secondly, we show that expressions of emotions in human-like avatars can be perceived similarly to human emotions, with corresponding behavioral, physiological and neuronal activations, with exception of physical dissimilarities. Subsequently, we consider if and when one perceives differences in action representation by artificial agents versus humans. Motor resonance and predictive coding models may account for empirical findings, such as an interference effect on action for observed human-like, natural moving characters. However, the expansion of these models to explain more complex behavior, such as empathy, still needs to be investigated in more detail. Finally, we broaden our outlook to social interaction, where virtual reality stimuli can be utilized to imitate complex social situations.

1307,A conceptual affective design framework for the use of emotions in computer game design,"The purpose of this strategy of inquiry is to understand how emotions influence gameplay and to review contemporary techniques to design for them in the aim of devising a model that brings current disparate parts of the game design process together. Emotions sit at the heart of a game player's level of engagement. They are evoked across many of the components that facilitate gameplay including the interface, the player's avatar, non-player characters and narrative. Understanding the role of emotion in creating truly immersive and believable environments is critical for game designers. After discussing a taxonomy of emotion, this paper will present a systematic literature review of designing for emotion in computer games. Following this, a conceptual framework for affective design is offered as a guide for the future of computer game design.","de Byl, P.",1,10.5817/cp2015-3-4,485
1308,Recognizing signals of social attitude in interacting with Ambient Conversational Systems,"Ambient Intelligence systems require a natural and personalized experience in interacting with services provided by the environment. In this view, the interaction may happen either in a pervasive way, through a combination of devices embedded in the environment, or using a conversational interface acting as an environment concierge. In the latter case, the interface can be embodied in a conversational agent able to involve users in a human-like conversation and to establish a social relation with them. Developing such an Ambient Conversational System (ACS) requires a model of the user that considers not only the cognitive ingredients of his mental state, but also extra-rational factors such as affect, engagement, attitudes. This paper describes a multimodal framework for recognizing the social attitude of users during the interaction with an embodied agent in a smart environment. In particular, we started from the analysis and annotation of advisory dialogs between humans and then we used the annotated corpus to build a framework for recognizing the social attitude in multimodal dialogs with an ACS. Results of the study show an acceptable performance of the framework in recognizing and monitoring the social attitude during the dialog with anACS. We also compared results of the analysis of human-human interactions with respect to the human-ACS interaction and, even if the level of initiative of subjects during the dialog was lower in this lattermodality, the difference in the average number of social moves was not significant, thus showing that subjects probably were keen to establish a social relation with the conversational agent.","De Carolis, B.",0,10.1007/s12193-013-0143-y,486
1310,The Influence of Prior Expectations of a Robot's Lifelikeness on Users' Intentions to Treat a Zoomorphic Robot as a Companion,"We are, at our roots, social creatures who are designed to bond with others. Given that robots are expected to increasingly serve humans in social roles, insight into the psychological aspects of our relationships with robots is becoming more relevant. Earlier findings indicate a strong role of a robot's perceived lifelikeness and gender for human-robot companionships. In an experimental study, we tested whether an individual's gender (male vs. female) and prior expectation of a robot's lifelikeness (high vs. low) influence the effect of preconditions originally identified for human friendship formation (i.e., proximity, physical attraction, similarity, reciprocal liking, intimacy) on the individual's intention to treat a zoomorphic robot as a companion. Our results show that when people have high prior expectations of a robot's lifelikeness, similar variables that explain why people establish relationships with each other are better able to explain their intentions to treat such a zoomorphic robot as a companion. Thus, companion robots should have a lifelike appearance, which does not necessarily mean a humanlike appearance. Moreover, men and women focus on different preconditions for human friendship formation when they evaluate their intentions to treat zoomorphic robots as companions. This means that developers of companion robots should be aware of these gender differences in bonding, and men and women may even prefer different designs, in terms of either appearance or behavior, for their companion robots.","de Graaf, M.

1312,Why Would I Use This in My Home? A Model of Domestic Social Robot Acceptance,"Many independent studies in social robotics and human-robot interaction have gained knowledge on various factors that affect people's perceptions of and behaviors toward robots. However, only a few of those studies aimed to develop models of social robot acceptance integrating a wider range of such factors. With the rise of robotic technologies for everyday environments, such comprehensive research on relevant acceptance factors is increasingly necessary. This article presents a conceptual model of social robot acceptance with a strong theoretical base, which has been tested among the general Dutch population (n = 1,168) using structural equation modeling. The results show a strong role of normative believes that both directly and indirectly affect the anticipated acceptance of social robots for domestic purposes. Moreover, the data show that, at least at this stage of diffusion within society, people seem somewhat reluctant to accept social behaviors from robots. The current findings of our study and their implications serve to push the field of acceptable social robotics forward. For the societal acceptance of social robots, it is vital to include the opinions of future users at an early stage of development. This way future designs can be better adapted to the preferences of potential users.","de Graaf, M. M. A.",0,10.1080/07370024.2017.1312406,488

1320,"Anthropomorphization of artificial agents leads to fair and strategic, but not altruistic behavior","With robots playing an increasing role in our daily lives, our emotional responses to them have become an active subject of study. The process of anthropomorphization, ascribing human affordances to non-human objects, is thought to play a large role in human-robot interaction. However, earlier studies have relied largely on experimenter's manipulation of anthropomorphism, and the use of virtual robots. The aim of this study was to investigate peopleas fairness preference and strategic and altruistic behavior toward different opponents (a human, a semi-humanoid and a spider-like robot, and a laptop) in two economic games. Anthropomorphization questionnaires and mood measures were also administered. Our findings suggest that fairness preference and strategic behavior are not predicted by the opponent's physical appearance, but instead predicted by individual differences in the tendency to anthropomorphize others. Altruistic behavior, on the other hand, is affected by the opponent's physical appearance.","de Kleijn, R.",0,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2018.09.008,490
1324,The effect of context-dependent information and sentence constructions on perceived humanness of an agent in a Turing test,"In a Turing test, a judge decides whether their conversation partner is either a machine or human. What cues does the judge use to determine this? In particular, are presumably unique features of human language actually perceived as humanlike? Participants rated the humanness of a set of sentences that were manipulated for grammatical construction: linear right-branching or hierarchical center-embedded and their plausibility with regard to world knowledge. We found that center-embedded sentences are perceived as less humanlike than right-branching sentences and more plausible sentences are regarded as more humanlike. However, the effect of plausibility of the sentence on perceived humanness is smaller for center-embedded sentences than for right-branching sentences. Participants also rated a conversation with either correct or incorrect use of the context by the agent. No effect of context use was found. Also, participants rated a full transcript of either a real human or a real chatbot, and we found that chatbots were reliably perceived as less humanlike than real humans, in line with our expectation. We did, however, find individual differences between chatbots and humans. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","de Kleijn, R.",0,10.1016/j.knosys.2018.10.006,491
1327,The role of information technology for building virtual environments to integrate crowdsourcing mechanisms into the open innovation process,"Information technology enabled the development of the virtual environment, allowing collaboration with external agents and leveraging the open innovation process. Crowdsourcing is an example of this new environment, using collaboration to enhance capabilities and relationships and as a way to accelerate innovation. However, companies are still searching for the best way to apply the crowdsourcing to internal processes to create value. Based on this context, the general objective of this research is to analyze how Brazilian companies have integrated crowdsourcing mechanisms into the open innovation process. To achieve the objectives, case studies conducted in two Brazilian organizations from different sectors were applied. The results contribute to a better understanding of the adopted crowdsourcing mechanism and the adequate technological aspects that enable the operation of the open innovation process.","de Mattos, C.

1330,,"Recent decades have seen increased interest on the role of emotional expression in human-computer interaction. However, despite a growing number of empirical findings reported in the literature, the results are still inconclusive about the mechanism for the social effects of emotion. This dissertation studies how emotion displays in computers impact people's decision-making and proposes a mechanism for such effects based on appraisal theories of emotion. In appraisal theories, emotion displays arise from cognitive appraisal of events with respect to one's goals (e.g., is this event congruent with my goals? Who is responsible for this event?). According to the pattern of appraisals that occurs, different emotions are experienced and displayed. Since displays reflect the agent's intentions through the appraisal process, we argue people infer, from emotion displays, how computer agents are appraising the ongoing interaction and, from this information, make inferences about the agents' intentions. We refer to this theory as reverse appraisal. To support it, several empirical studies are presented where participants engage in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with virtual agents that, though following the same strategy to choose their actions, display emotions in the face that are consistent with either cooperative or competitive goals. The results confirm that emotion displays impact people's decision making and people cooperate more with cooperative agents. Consistent with reverse appraisal's prediction that what is critical for the effects is not the emotion but the underlying appraisals, the results also show that the same display (e.g., a smile) can lead to opposite effects on cooperation depending on the context in which it is shown. A final study shows that people can successfully retrieve, from emotion displays, information about how agents are appraising the ongoing interaction; moreover, these perceptions of appraisal are shown to mediate the effect of emotion displays on perceptions of the agents' likelihood of cooperation. Having established the theoretical foundations of reverse appraisal, the dissertation presents several computational models of decision-making in the prisoner's dilemma. These models were developed by applying statistical and machine learning techniques on the data collected in the studies. Experimental results show that, as expected, computer models can better replicate human behavior in the original studies if they take into consideration the counterpart's appraisals and emotion displays. In addition, the dissertation also contributes a platform for creating realistic embodied agents that can display emotion. This platform was used in all studies to implement the experimental manipulations and can be used as a research tool to study human-agent and human-human interaction. Finally, the dissertation discusses the implications of reverse appraisal and the reported social effects of emotion for human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, decision and emotion theory.","de Melo, Celso Miguel",0,,493
1331,Humans versus Computers: Impact of Emotion Expressions on People's Decision Making,"Recent research in perception and theory of mind reveals that people show different behavior and lower activation of brain regions associated with mentalizing (i.e., the inference of other's mental states) when engaged in decision making with computers, when compared to humans. These findings are important for affective computing because they suggest people's decisions might be influenced differently according to whether they believe emotional expressions shown in computers are being generated by algorithms or humans. To test this, we had people engage in a social dilemma (Experiment 1) or negotiation (Experiment 2) with virtual humans that were either perceived to be agents (i.e., controlled by computers) or avatars (i.e., controlled by humans). The results showed that such perceptions have a deep impact on people's decisions: in Experiment 1, people cooperated more with virtual humans that showed cooperative facial displays (e.g., joy after mutual cooperation) than competitive displays (e.g., joy when the participant was exploited) but, the effect was stronger with avatars (d = .601) than with agents (d = .360); in Experiment 2, people conceded more to angry than neutral virtual humans but, again, the effect was much stronger with avatars (d = 1.162) than with agents (d = .066). Participants also showed less anger towards avatars and formed more positive impressions of avatars when compared to agents.","de Melo, C. M.",0,10.1109/taffc.2014.2332471,494
1334,,"Models describing human-automation interaction propose that trust in machines is uniquely different from trust in humans. Alternatively, some claim these differences disappear if machines are designed in likeness of humans. With the advent of cognitive agents, entities that are neither machine nor human, this dichotomous distinction may no longer be appropriate. Four experiments were designed to examine these opposing viewpoints directly by varying the humanness of agents on a cognitive-agent spectrum. In a controlled version of an automated decision-aid paradigm, agents provided recommendations on a pattern recognition task. Results showed that in early trials, compliance was higher with machine-like agents compared to human-like agents. This difference disappeared as familiarity with agents increased. When agents were portrayed as competitive, trust and compliance decreased for human-like agents compared to cooperative human-like agents, but no such differences were observed between machine-like agents. Immediate trial-by-trial performance feedback resulted in more appropriate trust and compliance compared to delayed cumulative performance feedback. Humane feedback that was either encouraging on high performance trials and apologetic in low performance trials resulted in higher compliance with agents compared to sessions without such feedback. These findings suggest that differences between cognitive agents are strong in novel, ambiguous situations, but disappear with direct performance observations. Decision aids may require a machine-like design if high performance can be guaranteed, but may need to exhibit human-like features when the outcome is uncertain and initial expectations need to be lowered. This work presents a step towards a general human-agent trust theory that can account for observed differences between types of agents.","de Visser, Ewart Jan",0,,495
1335,"A Little Anthropomorphism Goes a Long Way: Effects of Oxytocin on Trust, Compliance, and Team Performance With Automated Agents","Objective: We investigated the effects of exogenous oxytocin on trust, compliance, and team decision making with agents varying in anthropomorphism (computer, avatar, human) and reliability (100%, 50%). Background: Authors of recent work have explored psychological similarities in how people trust humanlike automation compared with how they trust other humans. Exogenous administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide associated with trust among humans, offers a unique opportunity to probe the anthropomorphism continuum of automation to infer when agents are trusted like another human or merely a machine. Method: Eighty-four healthy male participants collaborated with automated agents varying in anthropomorphism that provided recommendations in a pattern recognition task. Results: Under placebo, participants exhibited less trust and compliance with automated aids as the anthropomorphism of those aids increased. Under oxytocin, participants interacted with aids on the extremes of the anthropomorphism continuum similarly to placebos but increased their trust, compliance, and performance with the avatar, an agent on the midpoint of the anthropomorphism continuum. Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence that administration of exogenous oxytocin affected trust, compliance, and team decision making with automated agents. These effects provide support for the premise that oxytocin increases affinity for social stimuli in automated aids. Application: Designing automation to mimic basic human characteristics is sufficient to elicit behavioral trust outcomes that are driven by neurological processes typically observed in human-human interactions. Designers of automated systems should consider the task, the individual, and the level of anthropomorphism to achieve the desired outcome.","de Visser, E. J.",0,10.1177/0018720816687205,496
1343,Almost Human: Anthropomorphism Increases Trust Resilience in Cognitive Agents,"We interact daily with computers that appear and behave like humans. Some researchers propose that people apply the same social norms to computers as they do to humans, suggesting that social psychological knowledge can be applied to our interactions with computers. In contrast, theories of human-automation interaction postulate that humans respond to machines in unique and specific ways. We believe that anthropomorphism-the degree to which an agent exhibits human characteristics-is the critical variable that may resolve this apparent contradiction across the formation, violation, and repair stages of trust. Three experiments were designed to examine these opposing viewpoints by varying the appearance and behavior of automated agents. Participants received advice that deteriorated gradually in reliability from a computer, avatar, or human agent. Our results showed (a) that anthropomorphic agents were associated with greater trust resilience, a higher resistance to breakdowns in trust; (b) that these effects were magnified by greater uncertainty; and c) that incorporating human-like trust repair behavior largely erased differences between the agents. Automation anthropomorphism is therefore a critical variable that should be carefully incorporated into any general theory of human-agent trust as well as novel automation design.","de Visser, E.

1350,"From ""automation' to ""autonomy': the importance of trust repair in human-machine interaction","Modern interactions with technology are increasingly moving away from simple human use of computers as tools to the establishment of human relationships with autonomous entities that carry out actions on our behalf. In a recent commentary, Peter Hancock issued a stark warning to the field of human factors that attention must be focused on the appropriate design of a new class of technology: highly autonomous systems. In this article, we heed the warning and propose a human-centred approach directly aimed at ensuring that future human-autonomy interactions remain focused on the user's needs and preferences. By adapting literature from industrial psychology, we propose a framework to infuse a unique human-like ability, building and actively repairing trust, into autonomous systems. We conclude by proposing a model to guide the design of future autonomy and a research agenda to explore current challenges in repairing trust between humans and autonomous systems.Practitioner Summary: This paper is a call to practitioners to re-cast our connection to technology as akin to a relationship between two humans rather than between a human and their tools. To that end, designing autonomy with trust repair abilities will ensure future technology maintains and repairs relationships with their human partners.","de Visser, E.

1353,,"For humanoid robots to function in changing environments, they must be able to maintain balance similar to human beings. At present, humanoids recover from pushes by the use of either the ankles or hips and a rigid body. This method has been proven to work, but causes excessive strain on the joints of the robot and does not maximize on the capabilities of a humanlike body. The focus of this paper is to enable advanced dynamic balancing through torque classification and balance improving positional changes. For the robot to be able to balance dynamically, external torques must be determined accurately. The proposed method of this paper uses current sensing feedback at the humanoids power source to classify external torques. Through understanding the current draw of each joint, an external torque can be modeled. After being modeled, the external torque can be nullified with balancing techniques. Current sensing has the advantage that it adds detailed feedback while requiring small adjustments to the robot. Also, current sensing minimizes additional sensors, cost, and weight to the robot. Current sensing technology lies between the power supply and drive motors, thus can be implement without altering the robot. After an external torque has been modeled, the robot will undertake balancing positions to reduce the instability. The specialized positions increase the robot's balance while reducing the workload of each joint. The balancing positions incorporate the humanlike body of the robot and torque from each of the leg servos. The best balancing positions were generated with a genetic algorithm and simulated in Webots. The simulation environment provided an accurate physical model and physics engine. The genetic algorithm reduced the workload of searching the workspace of a robot with ten degrees of freedom below the waist. The current sensing theory was experimentally tested on the TigerBot, a humanoid produced by the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). The TigerBot has twenty three degrees of freedom that fully simulate human motion. The robot stands at thirty-one inches tall and weighs close to nine pounds. The legs of the robot have six degrees of freedom per leg, which fully mimics the human leg.

1368,,"In this thesis, the author explores and develops new attributes for machine performers and merges the trans-disciplinary fields of the performing arts and artificial intelligence. The main aim is to redefine the term “embodiment” for robots on the stage and to demonstrate that this term requires broadening in various fields of research. This redefining has required a multifaceted theoretical analysis of embodiment in the field of artificial intelligence (e.g. the uncanny valley), as well as the construction of new robots for the stage by the author. It is hoped that these practical experimental examples will generate more research by others in similar fields. Even though the historical lineage of robotics is engraved with theatrical strategies and dramaturgy, further application of constructive principles from the performing arts and evidence from psychology and neurology can shift the perception of robotic agents both on stage and in other cultural environments. In this light, the relation between representation, movement and behaviour of bodies has been further explored to establish links between constructed bodies (as in artificial intelligence) and perceived bodies (as performers on the theatrical stage). In the course of this research, several practical works have been designed and built, and subsequently presented to live audiences and research communities. Audience reactions have been analysed with surveys and discussions. Interviews have also been conducted with choreographers, curators and scientists about the value of machine performers. The main conclusions from this study are that fakery and mystification can be used as persuasive elements to enhance agency. Morphologies can also be applied that tightly couple brain and sensorimotor actions and lead to a stronger stage presence. In fact, if this lack of presence is left out of human replicants, it causes an “uncanny” lack of agency. Furthermore, the addition of stage presence leads to stronger identification from audiences, even for bodies dissimilar to their own. The author demonstrates that audience reactions are enhanced by building these effects into machine body structures: rather than identification through mimicry, this causes them to have more unambiguously biological associations. Alongside these traits, atmospheres such as those created by a cast of machine performers tend to cause even more intensely visceral responses. In this thesis, “embodiment” has emerged as a paradigm shift – as well as within this shift – and morphological computing has been explored as a method to deepen this visceral immersion. Therefore, this dissertation considers and builds machine performers as “true” performers for the stage, rather than mere objects with an aura. Their singular and customized embodiment can enable the development of non-anthropocentric performances that encompass the abstract and conceptual patterns in motion and generate – as from human performers – empathy, identification and experiential reactions in live audiences.","Demers, Louis-Philippe",0,,501
1369,,"Drawing upon literary and rhetorical analysis, cultural studies, and critical race theory, ""Civil Rights Shakespeares"" investigates the poet's presence within American racial discourses during the civil rights/black power era, tracing the poet's protean signification within this contentious phase of American race relations. I contend in the first chapter that Shakespeare's frequent enlistment in debates surrounding racial politics in postwar America is anything but incidental. In an investigation of Julius Caesar's programmatic dissemination among tenth grade students within early-twentieth-century mass education, I explore the poet's role as an agent of European ethnic consolidation. First, I trace Shakespeare's use within schools of the 1920s and `30s as a homogenizing force thought capable of uniting a diverse constituency of distinct immigrant groups under the rubric of a nascent white American culture rooted in English values and aesthetics; I turn then to the poet's subsequent conscription in support of an emergent socio-political project in which racial conflict in America was concentrated along an increasingly dualistic black/white racial axis. Shakespeare's implication in the furtherance of this large-scale racial realignment, I argue, helps account for the poet's reflexive insertion into moments of black and white racial contest in the ensuing years. Building upon these associations in chapter two, I read numerous instances of Shakespearean citation within civil rights discourses as evidence of a wider, pedagogically determined inclination within the American consciousness to correlate Shakespeare with a specifically white form of political dominion. In an analysis of Shakespeare's functionality within the rhetoric of important civil rights and black power figures including Malcolm X, Dr. Marin Luther King Jr., Eldridge Cleaver, and H. Rapp Brown, as well as within the segregationist addresses of Bull Connor, George Wallace, and members of the Ku Klux Klan, I examine the often-contradictory work Shakespeare is made to perform for a wide and varied constellation of ideologically oppositional constituencies. The second half of my project concerns theatrical adaptations and appropriations that capitalize upon Shakespeare's racially charged signification within the civil rights era. The third chapter looks at a 1971 musical adaptation of The Two Gentlemen of Verona produced for New York's Public Theatre as it is enlisted in contemporary debates regarding racial essentialism, black aesthetics, and the politics of accommodation. Chapter four considers Amiri Baraka's Slave and Dutchman (1964), two thematically interrelated plays that self-consciously enact a kind of appropriative violence upon Shakespeare's Othello. Reading Baraka's Black Nationalist poetics in light of early modern revenge narratives, I explore how these two classic works of experimental twentieth-century theatre function as retributive attacks upon one of western literature's foundational racial myths. In the conclusion, I respond to writer/director Rod Carley's late-twentieth-century adaptation, The Othello Project, which relocates Shakespeare's tragedy to the American South during the mid-1960s. Discussing the production's explicitly pedagogical aims, I turn finally to Shakespeare's continued dominance within mass education, examining several ways this power might be harnessed within the theatre in the service of a progressive racial politics.","Demeter, Jason M.",0,,502
1370,,"As feedback is an important part of learning and motivation, we investigate how to adapt the feedback of a conversational agent to learner personality (as well as to learner performance, as we expect an interaction effect between personality and performance on feedback). We investigate two aspects of feedback. Firstly, we investigate whether the conversational agent should employ a slant (or bias) in its feedback on particular test scores to motivate a learner with a particular personality trait more effectively (for example, using “you are slightly below expectations” versus “you are substantially below expectations” depending on learner conscientiousness). Secondly, we investigate which emotional support messages the conversational agent should use (for example: using praise, emotional reflection, reassurance or advice) given learner personality and performance. We investigate the adaptation of this feedback to a learner personality, in particular the traits in the Five Factor Model. Five experiments were run where participants gave progress feedback and emotional support to students with different personalities and test scores. The type of emotional support given varied between different personalities (e.g. neurotic individuals with poor grades received more emotional reflection). Two algorithms were created using different methods to describe the adaptations and evaluated on how well they described the experimental data using DICE scores. A refined algorithm was created based on the results. Finally, we ran a qualitative study with teachers to investigate the algorithm’s effectiveness and further refine the algorithm.

1373,,"Motivation is important for learners. As the provision of education moves increasingly towards online delivery, keeping motivation high is a key challenge. The lack of personalized approaches traditionally delivered by human tutors increases drop out rates. This thesis investigates how a conversational agent, taking the role of a virtual tutor, could deliver personalised feedback on performance to learners. It also investigates the most effective emotional support to incorporate in this feedback in order to maintain learner motivation. How learners respond to feedback depends on many factors. We focus on learner personality as our adaptation criterion, in particular Generalized Self Efficacy (GSE) and the Five Factor model (FFM). First, based on the literature, the thesis establishes how the core concepts of motivation, affective state, feedback and personality relate to one another, and discusses other research into learner motivation and feedback. Our main methodology is the User-as-Wizard method where we model how people adapt to personality in the real world when giving feedback to learners. An algorithm is then developed to encapsulate these adaptations, and is then evaluated. To achieve this, we required a way to express different learner personalities in a controlled way. Personality can be described by many models, but one of the most popular and reliably validated is the Five-Factor Model. In this model, the personality of an individual is described by a score for each of the five dimensions or 'traits'. There are numerous self-report questionnaires for these traits, indicated by a measure of agreement with certain adjectives on a scale. To express the traits at polarized levels, we produced and validated ten stories, two for each of the traits, expressing only that trait at high and low level. These stories were based on the adjectives used in the IPIP-NEO questionnaire. We also created two polarized stories for Generalized Self Efficacy. Subsequently, we investigated how people use different slants (or bias) in performance feedback, depending on learner personality. We designed two experiments, in which participants took the role of a teacher. Participants were shown the learner's personality (through the personality story) and a set of test scores on a range of topics. We provided different ways of describing the learner's performance which could result in positive, neutral or negative slants (e.g. “you are slightly below my expectations” on a score of 10% is positive, and “you are substantially below my expectations” is neutral). The type of slant was established by a focus group of experts prior to the experiments. We found some evidence that slanting was used for very low test scores for students with low GSE, and positive slanting for conscientious students who had only just failed a test. Next, we investigated supplementing slant with emotional support. A set of emotional support statements was generated and categorized. A series of five experiments was run where participants gave feedback to students with differing personality traits (using the FFM stories) and test scores. Participants could provide the same performance feedback (with associated slant) from the previous experiments, and could choose to supplement this with the validated emotional support statements. The type of emotional support given did indeed vary between different personalities (e.g. neurotic individuals with poor grades received more emotional reflection), and an algorithm was created to describe these adaptations. Finally, we ran a qualitative study with teachers and students to investigate the algorithm's effectiveness. During the course of the thesis we also developed a methodology for generating, validating and investigating the use of Emotional Support for other domains. This has already been applied in research to persuade older adults to participate in social interactions and to support Community First Responders and carers when experiencing various stressors.","Dennis, Matthew Gordon",0,,504
1374,,"Planning motion is an essential component for any autonomous robotic system. An intelligent agent must be able to efficiently plan collision-free paths in order to move through its world. Despite its importance, this problem is PSPACE-Hard which means that even planning motions for simple robots is computationally difficult. State-of-the-art approaches trade completeness (always able to provide a solution if one exists or report none exists) for probabilistic completeness (probabilistically guaranteed to find a solution if one exists but cannot report if none exists) and improved efficiency. These methods use sampling-based techniques to design a sequence of motions for the robot. However, as these methods are random in nature, the probability of their success is directly related to the expansiveness, or openness, of the underlying planning space. In other words, narrow passages, complex systems, and various constraints make planning with these methods difficult. On the other hand, humans can often determine approximate solutions for these difficult solutions quickly. In this research, we explore user-guided planning in which a human operator works together with a sampling-based motion planner. By having a human-in-the-loop, a human can steer a sampling-based planner towards a solution. This strategy can provide benefits to many applications such as computer-aided design and virtual prototyping, to name a few. We begin by classifying and creating simple models of common user-guided and heuristic-guided motion planning methods. Our models encompass three forms of user input: configuration-based, path-based, and region-based input. We compare and contrast these approaches and motivate our choice of a region-based collaborative framework. Through this analysis, we gain insight into user-guided planning and further motivate methods that harness low interface complexity and work entirely in workspace, which is most natural to a human operator. Further, we extend the theory of expansiveness to analyze the various types of user inputs. Our novel region-based collaboration framework takes advantage of human intuition by allowing a user to define regions in the workspace to bias and/or constrain the search space of a sampling-based motion planner. This approach allows a user to bias a high dimensional search with low dimensional input, supports intermittent user hints, and empowers a user to customize motion solutions. Finally, we extend region steering to both non-holonomic robotic systems and a human-inspired approach to motion planning. Our results show that this region-based framework can aid many variants of sampling-based planning, reduce computation time, support solution customization, and can be used to develop advanced heuristic methods for solving motion planning problems. We provide experiments exemplifying our approach in planning motions for complex robotic applications such as mobile manipulators, car-like, and free-flying robots.","Denny, Jory London",0,,505
1375,"Being an ""agent provocateur': utilising online spaces for teacher professional development in virtual simulation games","This article details the results of an action research study which investigated how teachers used online learning community spaces to develop and support their teaching and learning of the Jewish Court of All Time (JCAT), a web-mediated, character-playing, simulation game that engages participants with social, historical and cultural curricula. The nature of reflection that was generated in the asynchronous and synchronous professional development spaces is discussed. Data analysis of online discussion and chat transcripts revealed that two forms of reflection were generated: reflection on self-as-teacher (juggling roles, responsibility, teaching challenges) and reflection on students (socio-cognitive and relational dimensions). The results speak to the importance of selecting online spaces that support the overall objectives of the professional development, as well as provide a rich forum to discuss the game in question. Having both asynchronous and synchronous spaces allows teachers the freedom to express themselves in multiple ways. Findings guide instructional design, generate insight on the interaction of online spaces and support teachers in how they learn and teach virtual simulation game experiences.","deNoyelles, A.",0,10.1080/1475939x.2015.1049652,506
1377,"Demythologising the educational past: an attempt to assess the ""power of education"" in the Congo (DRC) with a nod to the history of interwar pedagogy in Catholic Flanders","This keynote consists of two parts. The first part offers some general observations from the past related to the power (and eventual powerlessness) of education. The aim is to create a framework with which the specific case, discussed in the second part, must be interpreted. Furthermore, it is emphasised that almost every pedagogical intervention which harboured the explicit aim of ""forming"" subjects had in itself a very normative and disciplinary nature. Yet these objectives, imposed from above, seldom functioned in the day-to-day reality as they were conceived by the opinion-makers and education agents. The educational activity's political-ideological, fundamental principles do not allow us to directly deduce exactly what was retained by those subjected to the educational activity on the shop floor. The downside of the ""power"" of any education is indeed the ""empowerment"" of the individual. Whether one is happy for man to attain this quality or not, pedagogical interventions can give rise to emancipatory effects, even if they are intended to be primarily disciplinary. The Congo is naturally a prime case that would enable us to further explore this question. On the one hand, after independence, the pursuit of power over education was exposed in the continuity of colonial principles as well as in the struggle between the state and the church during the Mobutu regime. On the other hand, the dictatorial regime did not prevent the Congolese from becoming empowered through education; however, it appears as though a certain methodical utilitarianism was never far off.","Depaepe, M.",0,10.1080/00309230.2014.987790,507

We conducted a web-based survey (N =151) with standardized pictures of 40 robots which were evaluated. A cluster analysis revealed six clusters of robots. We were able to identify different groups of robots which were rated significantly different on six dimensions. Interestingly, in two clusters robots were rated both low in human-likeness and low in “mechanical” indicating that in future research these adjectives should be used separately. The robots in those clusters with a high mean concerning “Threatening” are almost all bi-pedal robots. In contrast to the humanoid robots (cluster 5), the android robots (clusters 3 and 4) were rated higher on “Familiarity”, and on “Likability” although all three clusters (3, 4, and 5) were rated as “Threatening” which contrasts the uncanny valley hypothesis. Moreover, the data in the present study could not be explained by a cubic function as would be suggested by the graph proposed by Mori, but rather by linear or quadratic relationships.

1381,A framework for modelling the complexities of food and water security under globalisation,"We present a new framework for modelling the complexities of food and water security under globalisation. The framework sets out a method to capture regional and sectoral interdependencies and cross-scale feedbacks within the global food system that contribute to emergent water use patterns. The framework integrates aspects of existing models and approaches in the fields of hydrology and integrated assessment modelling. The core of the framework is a multi-agent network of city agents connected by infrastructural trade networks. Agents receive socio-economic and environmental constraint information from integrated assessment models and hydrological models respectively and simulate complex, socio-environmental dynamics that operate within those constraints. The emergent changes in food and water resources are aggregated and fed back to the original models with minimal modification of the structure of those models. It is our conviction that the framework presented can form the basis for a new wave of decision tools that capture complex socio-environmental change within our globalised world. In doing so they will contribute to illuminating pathways towards a sustainable future for humans, ecosystems and the water they share.","Dermody, B. J.",0,10.5194/esd-9-103-2018,509
1388,,"While there has been an increasing focus in the research literature that examines how individuals act and react across mediated spaces in the modern, networked, and participatory era, the perspectives of immigrant students are largely missing from the research. This results in unexamined spaces where more can be learned about how technology supports and enhances immigrant students’ identities and sense of belonging, their engagement in civic matters, and their ability to speak back to harmful narratives and discourse through their thoughtful critique of media messages. This dissertation aims to fill this gap and to inform teachers, teacher educators, policymakers, and others about approaches they can use to build upon transnational immigrant youths’ already-present critical media literacies within and beyond school in further support of youths’ belonging in both virtual and face to face encounters. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the relationship between critical media literacies, civic engagement, and immigrant youths’ sense of belonging. The dissertation is a qualitative case study that asked: What identities do three immigrant and refugee youth in a multicultural studies class draw upon to enact critical media literacies within and beyond school? How do they do this? and What internal and external factors influence how a teacher supports his students’ critical media literacies? How do these factors relate to the teacher’s pedagogy? This dissertation’s methodological approach and research questions were rooted in Mihailidis’s 5A’s of Media Literacy (2014) framework that conceptualizes approaches to media literacy in a continuum, moving from access to awareness, assessment, appreciation, and action. The dissertation draws on four main data sources: 1) one-on-one interviews with focal students and their teacher, 2) classroom observations, 3) teacher-produced curricular materials, and 4) student-produced artifacts. I argue that the three focal youth called upon their transnational experiences, their religious affiliation, and the languages they knew other than English to critique and re-frame public narratives about immigrants, refugees, and Muslims. However, the findings also revealed the limitations of youths’ civic action given their marginalization within school and society. Furthermore, this study demonstrates a disconnect between a teacher’s pedagogical practices and youths’ already-present practices. While a classroom teacher was supportive of his students’ media literacies, more work could have been done to help students address issues of power, privilege, inequities, and oppression. This dissertation’s findings therefore enhance understandings about what might be done to further support transnational youths’ rights to have their voices recognized, so they can more fully embrace their roles as active change agents in the world.","Deroo, Matthew Ryan",0,,510
1389,The affective outcomes of using influence tactics in embodied conversational agents,"In this study, we highlight the theoretical underpinnings of human impression management tactics and link them to current research in embodied conversational agents. Specifically, we incorporated impression management behaviors into an embodied conversational agent in order to show that different influence strategies affect user perceptions, and how those perceptions might be moderated by user gender. We programmed the agent to use two human impression management techniques (ingratiation and self-promotion) and had the agent interact with 88 users. After the interaction, users reported their perceptions of the system's power, trustworthiness, expertise, and attractiveness. The impression management techniques altered users' perceptions and these perceptions were moderated by gender differences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Derrick, D.

Through my research, I found that musicians, sound designers, and multimedia artists are not only creative agents, but must also balance aesthetic preferences with the affordances and constraints of audio software. My inquiry combines multiple research methods. Ethnographic data gathered from participant observation and interviews with software developers, interaction designers, and electronic musicians in Southern California has revealed the extent to which digital producers increasingly borrow the tools and techniques of artists working across media platforms. Close readings and technical analyses of specific software have allowed me trace new genealogies in the evolution of music technology. Finally—influenced by the praxis-based approach of digital humanities—the creation of original software and digital applications has made it possible for me to bridge the gap between theoretical and technical perspectives on music and media production. By applying the techniques of media theory, computer science, design, and digital humanities to critical practices in media art in the twenty-first century, the project brings to bear shifting understandings of cultural objects as they increasingly converge with computational processes.","D'Errico, Michael Anthony",0,,512
1392,Effects of Gender on Perception and Interpretation of Video Game Character Behavior and Emotion,"Gender in video games is a popular topic. However, the focus is usually on how gender is portrayed within games. In this paper, we examine the effects of players' gender on the perception of virtual character behavior and emotion based on the results of two user studies involving story-based games. The first study compared players' perception of virtual character behaviors. We analyzed perceived differences both by gender and by gaming experience. In this study, we found that female gamers were more appreciative of complex behaviors than male gamers. In the second study, we examined the influence of gender on player' ability to identify the emotion being displayed by a virtual character. We found that most emotions were identified comparably, with the exception of anger. Female players were significantly better at identifying angry characters compared to male players. We also investigated any perception differences between emotions expressed by male and female virtual characters, but we did not identify any statistically significant differences. Overall, the studies suggest that there are differences in how male and female players perceive virtual characters, and if game designers want players to perceive these characters in a certain way, they should consider the gender of targeted players.","Desai, N.",0,10.1109/tciaig.2016.2570006,513

1398,,"Design of robot swarms inspired by self-organization in social insect groups is currently an active research area with a diverse portfolio of potential applications. This thesis is focused on the development of control laws for swarm of robots inspired by ant foraging. Particularly, this work presents control laws for efficient area coverage by a robot swarm in a 2D spatial domain, inspired by the unique dynamical characteristics of ant foraging. The novel idea pursued in the effort is that dynamic, adaptive switching between Brownian motion and Levy flight in the stochastic component of the search increases the efficiency of the search and area coverage. The study is motivated by behaviors of certain biological studies who exhibit searching patterns modeled using Levy flight. Influence of different pheromone (the virtual chemotactic agent that drives the foraging) threshold values for switching between Levy flights and Brownian motion is studied using two performance metrics - area coverage and visit entropy. The results highlight the advantages of the switching strategy for the control framework, particularly in cases when the object of the search is scarce in quantity or getting depleted in real-time.","Deshpande, Aditya Milind",0,,515
1399,Detecting the Trustworthiness of Novel Partners in Economic Exchange,"Because trusting strangers can entail high risk, an ability to infer a potential partner's trustworthiness would be highly advantageous. To date, however, little evidence indicates that humans are able to accurately assess the cooperative intentions of novel partners by using nonverbal signals. In two studies involving human-human and human-robot interactions, we found that accuracy in judging the trustworthiness of novel partners is heightened through exposure to nonverbal cues and identified a specific set of cues that are predictive of economic behavior. Employing the precision offered by robotics technology to model and control humanlike movements, we demonstrated not only that experimental manipulation of the identified cues directly affects perceptions of trustworthiness and subsequent exchange behavior, but also that the human mind will utilize such cues to ascribe social intentions to technological entities.","DeSteno, D.",0,10.1177/0956797612448793,516
1406,Walking in the uncanny valley: importance of the attractiveness on the acceptance of a robot as a working partner,"The Uncanny valley hypothesis, which tells us that almost-human characteristics in a robot or a device could cause uneasiness in human observers, is an important research theme in the Human Robot Interaction (HRI) field. Yet, that phenomenon is still not well-understood. Many have investigated the external design of humanoid robot faces and bodies but only a few studies have focused on the influence of robot movements on our perception and feelings of the Uncanny valley. Moreover, no research has investigated the possible relation between our uneasiness feeling and whether or not we would accept robots having a job in an office, a hospital or elsewhere. To better understand the Uncanny valley, we explore several factors which might have an influence on our perception of robots, be it related to the subjects, such as culture or attitude toward robots, or related to the robot such as emotions and emotional intensity displayed in its motion. We asked 69 subjects (N = 69) to rate the motions of a humanoid robot (Perceived Humanity, Eeriness, and Attractiveness) and state where they would rather see the robot performing a task. Our results suggest that, among the factors we chose to test, the attitude toward robots is the main influence on the perception of the robot related to the Uncanny valley. Robot occupation acceptability was affected only by Attractiveness, mitigating any Uncanny valley effect. We discuss the implications of these findings for the Uncanny valley and the acceptability of a robotic worker in our society.","Destephe, M.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00204,517
1412,Envy freedom and prior-free mechanism design,"We consider the provision of an abstract service to single-dimensional agents. Our model includes position auctions, single-minded combinatorial auctions, and constrained matching markets. When the agents' values are drawn independently from a distribution, the Bayesian optimal mechanism is given by Myerson [1] as a virtual-surplus optimizer. We develop a framework for prior-free mechanism design and analysis. A good mechanism in our framework approximates the optimal mechanism for the distribution if there is a distribution; moreover, when there is no distribution this mechanism still provably performs well. We define and characterize optimal envy-free outcomes in symmetric single-dimensional environments. Our characterization mirrors Myerson's theory. Furthermore, unlike in mechanism design where there is no point-wise optimal mechanism, there is always a point-wise optimal envy-free outcome. Envy-free outcomes and incentive-compatible mechanisms are similar in structure and performance. We therefore use the optimal envy-free revenue as a benchmark for measuring the performance of a prior-free mechanism. A good mechanism is one that approximates the envy-free benchmark on any profile of agent values. We show that good mechanisms exist, and in particular, a natural generalization of the random sampling auction of Goldberg et al. [2] is a constant approximation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Though policing actions have a dissuasive impact on criminal behavior, they can also have unpredictable and even undesirable effects such as displacement of crime hot-spots. This paper presents an agent-based simulation model that generates artificial street-crime data which can be used to test different policing strategies in a virtual environment. The model can thus evaluate the strategies' effectiveness and collateral effects before putting them into practice and provide support for the policing decision-making process. Based on this model, a crime simulator was implemented in Repast Simphony and a series of test simulations on fictitious and real cities were carried out. The proposed formulation was successfully validated, confirming its potential as a powerful tool for the study of street crime. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

1417,Conversations about the elections on Twitter: Towards a structural understanding of Twitter's relation with the political and the media field,"This study uses network analysis to examine Twitter's level of autonomy from external influences, being the political and the media field. The conceptual framework builds upon Bourdieu's field theory, appropriated on social media as mediated social spaces. The study investigates conversation patterns on Twitter between political, media and citizen agents during election times in Belgium. Through the comparison of conversational practices with the positions users hold as political, media or citizen agents, we understand how the former is related to the latter. The analysis of conversation patterns (based on replies and mentions) shows a decentralized and loosely knit network, in which primarily citizen agents are present. Nonetheless, the prominence of citizens in the debate, mentions or replies to political and media agents are significantly higher, placing them more centrally in the network. In addition, politicians and media actors are closely connected within the network, and reciprocal communication of these established agents is significantly lower compared to citizen agents. We understand different aspects of autonomy related to the presence, positions and practices of the agents on Twitter and their relative positions as politicians, media or citizens. To conclude, we discuss the promises of Bourdieu's relational sociology and the limitations of our study. The approach proposed here is an attempt to integrate existing work and evolve towards a systematic understanding of the interrelations between political, media and citizen agents in a networked media environment.","D'Heer, E.",0,10.1177/0267323114544866,520
1419,Visual cues of motion that trigger animacy perception at birth: the case of self-propulsion,"Self-propelled motion is a powerful cue that conveys information that an object is animate. In this case, animate refers to an entity's capacity to initiate motion without an applied external force. Sensitivity to this motion cue is present in infants that are a few months old, but whether this sensitivity is experience-dependent or is already present at birth is unknown. Here, we tested newborns to examine whether predispositions to process self-produced motion cues underlying animacy perception were present soon after birth. We systematically manipulated the onset of motion by self-propulsion (Experiment 1) and the change in trajectory direction in the presence or absence of direct contact with an external object (Experiments 2 and 3) to investigate how these motion cues determine preference in newborns. Overall, data demonstrated that, at least at birth, the self-propelled onset of motion is a crucial visual cue that allowed newborns to differentiate between self- and non-self-propelled objects (Experiment 1) because when this cue was removed, newborns did not manifest any visual preference (Experiment 2), even if they were able to discriminate between the stimuli (Experiment 3). To our knowledge, this is the first study aimed at identifying sensitivity in human newborns to the most basic and rudimentary motion cues that reliably trigger perceptions of animacy in adults. Our findings are compatible with the hypothesis of the existence of inborn predispositions to visual cues of motion that trigger animacy perception in adults.","Di Giorgio, E.",0,10.1111/desc.12394,521

1427,Pediatric Head and Neck Dynamics in Frontal Impact: Analysis of Important Mechanical Factors and Proposed Neck Performance Corridors for 6-and 10-Year-Old ATDs,"Objective: Traumatic injuries are the leading cause of death of children aged 1-19 in the United States and are principally caused by motor vehicle collisions, with the head being the primary region injured. The neck, though not commonly injured, governs head kinematics and thus influences head injury. Vehicle improvements necessary to reduce these injuries are evaluated using anthropomorphic testing devices (ATDs). Current pediatric ATD head and neck properties were established by scaling adult properties using the size differences between adults and children. Due to the limitations of pediatric biomechanical research, computational models are the only available methods that combine all existing data to produce injury-relevant biofidelity specifications for ATDs. The purpose of this study is to provide the first frontal impact biofidelity corridors for neck flexion response of 6- and 10-year-olds using validated computational models, which are compared to the Hybrid III (HIII) ATD neck responses and the Mertz flexion corridors. Methods: Our virtual 6- and 10-year-old head and neck multibody models incorporate pediatric biomechanical properties obtained from pediatric cadaveric and radiological studies, include the effect of passive and active musculature, and are validated with data including pediatric volunteer 3 g dynamic frontal impact responses. We simulate ATD pendulum testsused to calibrate HIII neck bending stiffnessto compare the pediatric model and HIII ATD neck bending stiffness and to compare the model flexion bending responses with the Mertz scaled neck flexion corridors. Additionally, pediatric response corridors for pendulum calibration tests and high-speed (15 g) frontal impacts are estimated through uncertainty analyses on primary model variables, with response corridors calculated from the average SD response over 650 simulations. Results and Conclusions: The models are less stiff in dynamic anterioposterior bending than the ATDs; the secant stiffness of the 6- and 10-year-old models is 53 and 67 percent less than that of the HIII ATDs. The ATDs exhibit nonlinear stiffening and the models demonstrate nonlinear softening. Consequently, the models do not remain within the Mertz scaled flexion bending corridors. The more compliant model necks suggest an increased potential for head impact via larger head excursions. The pediatric anterioposterior bending corridors developed in this study are extensible to any frontal loading condition through calculation and sensitivity analysis. The corridors presented in this study are the first based on pediatric cadaveric data and provide the basis for future, more biofidelic, designs of 6- and 10-year-old ATD necks.","Dibb, A.

1437,Avatar’s neurobiological traces in the self-concept of massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) addicts,"Psychometric studies suggest that observed self-concept deficits in addicted massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) are compensated through the replacement of their ideal (i.e., how an individual would like to be) by their own avatar (i.e., graphical agent in the virtual world). Neurobiological studies indicate that increased identification with their own avatar in regular MMORPG gamers is possibly reflected by enhanced avatar-referential brain activation in the left angular gyrus (AG). However, the neurobiological correlates reflecting the relations of the avatar to addicted gamers’ self and ideal are still unexplored. Therefore, we compare these relations between addicted and nonaddicted MMORPG gamers. A sample of n = 15 addicted and n = 17 nonaddicted players underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while completing a Giessen-Test (GT)-derived paradigm assessing self-, ideal-, and avatar-related self-concept domains. Neurobiological analyses included the comparisons avatar versus self, avatar versus ideal, and avatar versus self, ideal. Psychometrically, addicts showed significantly lower scores on the self-concept subscale of ‘social resonance,’ that is, social popularity. In all avatar-related contrasts, within-group comparisons showed addicted players to exhibit significantly higher brain activations in the left AG. The between-groups comparisons revealed avatar-related left AG hyperactivations in addicts. Our results may suggest that addicted MMORPG players identify significantly more with their avatar than nonaddicted gamers. The concrete avatar might increasingly replace the rather abstract ideal in the transition from normal- controlled to addictive-compulsive MMORPG usage.

As a consequence, perceived or anticipated imitation facilitates own action control and, at the same time, imitation boosts social affiliation and rapport with others. It has previously been suggested that basic mechanisms of associative learning can account for behavioural effects of imitation, whereas a possible role of associative learning for affiliative processes is poorly understood at present. Therefore, this study examined whether contingency and contiguity, the principles of associative learning, affect also the social effects of imitation. Two experiments yielded evidence in favour of this hypothesis by showing more social affiliation in conditions with high contingency (as compared to low contingency) and in conditions of high contiguity (compared to low contiguity).","Dignath, D.",0,10.1007/s00426-017-0854-x,526
1473,From Participants to Agents: Grounded Simulation as a Mixed-Method Research Design,"This paper introduces a mixed-method research design for investigating complexity of social reality. The research design integrates grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) and social simulation and is therefore called grounded simulation (GS). GS starts with in-depth investigations of complex social phenomena from perspectives of people who experience them. These investigations follow principles of grounded theory and enquire into contexts that research participants describe and the way they make sense of action in these contexts. Data analysis progresses inductively and outwards, from narratives of people who are at the centre of the phenomena to emerging constructs and theories. While the grounded theory fieldwork would have its own research outputs, its selected findings can be then carried to agent-based models for further investigation of social complexity. By representing social and economic agents, their contexts and actions as closely as possible, GS shortens the distance between research participants, who have real life experiences of the subject being modelled, and the virtual agents. Knowledge production in social simulation progresses generatively and upwards, moving from interactions at the individual level to emergent properties at the macro-level. GS experiments are thus suitable for studying the societal implications of meanings that emerge from the data collected in grounded theory. The paper illustrates how this research design can be used, by referring to a GS study on diffusion of innovations.","Dilaver, O.",0,10.18564/jasss.2724,527
1474,,"Estimating 3D human pose from monocular images is an important and challenging problem in computer vision with numerous applications including human-computer interaction, human activity recognition, biomechanical analysis, and security. Existing state-of-the-art methods utilize statistical learning models that are inherently limited because they require sufficient training data that does not often include uncommon pose articulations or subject proportions. In addition, these methods often return global average case results and cannot easily leverage anthropomorphic, kinematic, and other physics-based constraints. However, a prior model-based search can be computationally prohibitive due to the combinatorially large set of plausible joint combinations. We combine statistical learning-based approaches with a prior part-based model into a hybrid constrained optimization that leverages strengths of both approaches. The method guarantees a plausible human pose while also resolving local ambiguities among body parts. Qualitative evaluation of the proposed methods on human pose datasets show improvement in reconstruction accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art methods.","Dilsizian, Mark",0,,528
1475,,"This thesis proposes and evaluates a computational model of a neocortical column, which exhibits qualities expected of biological intelligence. The model is based upon three neuroscience hypotheses: the first one suggests that each column transforms its input into a unique context, with each of its mini-columns deriving a representative orthogonal state in the shared context; the second hypothesis suggests that glia cells are the principal learning agent of the nervous system through a process compared to Bayesian probabilistic inference, while neural networks are primarily recognizers of the knowledge glia maintains; the third hypothesis suggests an intimate relationship between the first two. We offer a biological explanation for observed Bayesian characteristics of human-like intelligence, and for the neural basis of symbols and structure. The derived model is Bayesian, parallelized, and does not require complicated parameter space searching. Evaluated on popular machine learning datasets, it shows remarkably innate incremental learning properties. We also present a method for incremental Metropolis-Hastings which significantly outperforms particle filters, has an innate and transparent concept drift handling ability, and removes the need to consider burn-in stages.","Dimkovski, Martin",0,,529

The paper recognizes current research in HPE and refers to the long-standing positioning of (successful) ""learning"" at the forefront of subjects, activities and curriculum (Hayes, Capel, Katene, & Cook, 2006).

It argues that foregrounding educative outcomes requires knowledge building in relation to curriculum, pedagogy and assessment; that the significance of the interplay and alignment of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment is key to attaining educative outcomes; and that the notions of cumulative and segmented learning (Maton, 2011) in HPE deserve exploration. A text analysis of sections of the Consultation document will be utilized to demonstrate how learning is potentially the bonding agent, how curriculum documents make it legitimate (or not) and how comprehensive and developmental learning are situated in the text. In addition, excerpts from a case study of student and teacher voices in one school event is utilized to raise and provoke discussion about student learning, perceptions about learning in HPE and raise challenges about the interplay between curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. The final section of the paper proposes challenges for teachers of HPE with issues to consider in generating ""pedagogic action"" (Penney, 2013) for educative outcomes in HPE.","DinanThompson, Maree",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/18377122.2013.801106,530
1477,"The effects of multiple-pedagogical agents on learners' academic success, motivation, and cognitive load","In computer-assisted instruction, primary causes for the main problems are student's feeling lonely and lack of social learning environment. Pedagogical agents, which could enable students to use software, have been developed and integrated into instructional software to remove the obstacles mentioned. The main purpose of the study is to compare the effects of a fixed pedagogical agent and multi pedagogical agents left to students' choice on dependent variables. Additionally, it has also been examined if computer assisted instruction software without pedagogical agent has any effects on dependent variables. The study seeks to investigate both learners' agent preferences and the effects of pedagogical agents on learners' academic success, motivation and cognitive load. For the purpose of the study, four groups were formed. The first group used educational software via fixed agent, the second group used educational software with the option to choose among several agents whereas the third group used educational software without agent and the fourth group received the same education through traditional way. The academic success refers to MS Excel program literacy. The findings revealed no statistically significant difference between fixed and multi pedagogical agents in terms of dependent variables. However, the designs with agents were found to have positive effects on learners' motivation, academic success and cognitive load. The results also indicated that pedagogical agents should be used in all computer-assisted instruction software. Another finding of the study is that the students in younger age groups tend to prefer the same gender agent as theirs. Furthermore, feedback from participants showed that users of multi pedagogical agents would like to conceive their own pedagogical agents. Accordingly, it is suggested that learners should be provided with programs that can be personalized depending on learners' needs and preferences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

1479,EXPLORATORY INVESTIGATION OF ATTITUDES TOWARDS ASSISTIVE ROBOTS FOR FUTURE USERS,"This paper presents an experiment that sought to investigate opinions and attitudes towards assistive robots by French people, users and future users. 217 participants were recruited. They were divided into four age groups: 67 children (vertical bar M vertical bar age= 9.2 years), 35 teenagers (vertical bar M vertical bar age= 14.5 years), 37 young adults (vertical bar M vertical bar age= 22.2 years), and 28 seniors (vertical bar M vertical bar age= 68.3 years). Each participant was individually asked to perform three tasks: first, s/he was asked to explain what is a robot to her/ him; second, s/he was asked to complete our French version of the Negative Attitudes Towards Robots Scale (NARS); third, s/he was asked to classify eight robots shown in videos. The main results obtained were as follows: spontaneously, a robot is defined according to three dimensions, vertical bar i.e vertical bar., its qualities (or properties), its physical appearance, and its usefulness; there is a significant impact of the age on ""naive"" mental representations of robots; there is no impact of gender on attitudes and preferences; younger respondents (children) rated significantly more positive attitudes towards robots than the other age group (teenagers, young adults, and seniors); our French version of NARS is validated for French adults, but NARS does not seem to be adapted to young people. Regardless of age and gender, participants preferred robots that had animal-like shapes and/or are small humanoid robots; robots with anthropomorphic or humanoid characteristics were less preferred. Implications for the design of future assistive robots are discussed.","Dinet, J.",0,10.3917/th.772.0105,532

1485,General theory of stigmergy: Modelling stigma semantics,"Stigmergy is a biological term used when discussing a sub-set of insect swarm-behaviour describing the apparent organisation seen during their activities. Stigmergy describes a communication mechanism based on environment-mediated signals which trigger responses among the insects. This phenomenon is demonstrated in the behaviour of ants and their food gathering process when following pheromone trails, where the pheromones are a form of environment-mediated communication. What is interesting with this phenomenon is that highly organised societies are achieved without an apparent management structure. Stigmergy is also observed in human environments, both natural and engineered. It is implicit in the Web where sites provide a virtual environment supporting coordinative contributions. Researchers in varying disciplines appreciate the power of this phenomenon and have studied how to exploit it. As stigmergy becomes more widely researched we see its definition mutate as papers citing original work become referenced themselves. Each paper interprets these works in ways very specific to the research being conducted. Our own research aims to better understand what improves the collaborative function of a Web site when exploiting the phenomenon. However when researching stigmergy to develop our understanding we discover a lack of a standardised and abstract model for the phenomenon. Papers frequently cited the same generic descriptions before becoming intimately focused on formal specifications of an algorithm, or esoteric discussions regarding sub-facets of the topic. None provide a holistic and macro-level view to model and standardise the nomenclature. This paper provides a content analysis of influential literature documenting the numerous theoretical and experimental papers that have focused on stigmergy. We establish that stigmergy is a phenomenon that transcends the insect world and is more than just a metaphor when applied to the human world. We present from our own research our general theory and abstract model of semantics of stigma in stigmergy. We hope our model will clarify the nuances of the phenomenon into a useful road-map, and standardise vocabulary that we witness becoming confused and divergent. Furthermore, this paper documents the analysis on which we base our next paper: Special Theory of Stigmergy: A Design Pattern for Web 2.0 Collaboration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

1488,,"As collaboration among teams that are distributed in time and space is becoming increasingly important, there is a need to understand the efficacy of tools available to support that collaboration. This study employs a combination of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model to compare four different technologies used to support the task of collaboratively creating and editing a report. The characteristics of the four technologies operationalize different collaborative processes and quality of the editor enabling the examination of how well each addresses previously identified challenges to electronic collaboration. The study compared the use of MS Word combined with emailing the document among collaborators, Twiki, Google Docs, and Office Live by university students to collaboratively write a research paper. The study measured Task-Technology Fit, Perceived Ease of Use, and Perceived Usefulness of the technologies. The findings suggest that certain technological factors associated with the collaborative tool can impact effective use of the tool. A powerful interface with which the user has some experience is necessary, and support for distributed collaboration can be the distinguishing factor in making a tool an effective collaborative writing and editing technology. Our study suggests that Word/email and Google Docs outperform Twiki and Office Live due to tool experience and superior Task-Technology Fit that may be due to the sophistication of the writing and editing tool, support for collaboration, and the clarity of the collaboration process. We speculate that the surprisingly poor showing for Office Live is due to mixing a familiar editing interface with a collaborative model that is different from students' mental model of collaboration, leading to a phenomenon similar to the ""Uncanny Valley,"" which is the experience of many people when interacting with humanoid robots and animations that have very good, but not perfect, realism.","Dishaw, Mark T.",0,,536
1492,,"This thesis presents identification of abstracted dynamics of haptic based human control policies and human responses in guiding/following using hard reins in low visibility conditions. The extracted haptic based guidance policies can be implemented on a robot to guide a human in low visibility conditions like in indoor fire-fighting, disaster response, and search and rescue. Firstly, the thesis presents haptic based guidance in Human-human interactions. The control policies were modeled by a simple linear Auto-Regressive model (AR). It was found that the guiding agent’s control policy can be modeled as a 3rd order predictive AR system and the human follower can be modeled as a 2nd order reactive AR system. Secondly, the human follower’s dynamics were modeled by a time varying virtual damped inertial system to understand how trust in the guider is reflected by physical variables. Experimental results on human trust showed that the coefficient of virtual damping is most sensitive to the follower’s trust. Thirdly, the thesis evaluates human-robot interactions when the control policy identified from human guiders was implemented on a planar 1-DoF robotic arm to perturb the blindfolded subjects’ most dominant arm to guide them to a desired position in leftward/rightward directions. Experiments were carried with naive and trained subjects. Humans’ behavior in leftward/rightward movements are asymmetric for naive subjects and symmetric for trained subjects. Moreover, it was found that naive subjects elicit a 2nd order reactive behavior similar to human demonstration experiments. However, trained subjects developed a 2nd order predictive following behavior. Furthermore, naive and trained subjects’ arm muscle activation is significantly different in leftward/rightward arm perturbation. Finally, the thesis presents how humans trained in primitive haptic patterns given using a wearable sleeve, can recognize their shifts and linear combinations.","Dissanayake Mudiyanselage, Anuradha Ranasinghe",0,,537

It then demonstrates how this perspective may be employed in the case of the ethnopolitical conflict in Georgia. The resulting analysis points to several important processes that animate the constant pulsation of the conflict field even when arms are calm and contribute to the dynamic and becoming nature of the conflict and its dynamic (re-)assembling. It illuminates how the visibility function of the assemblage operates and endows with meaning the structure of relations in the conflict field. It traces how the bricolage of Georgian social association transformed over time, notably under Saakashvili, and how it has also been a key element of statebuilding practice in the separatist entities. The analysis moreover demonstrates how the actual instantiations of collective violence form but a fraction of that which takes place in the conflict field, from other forms of political and criminal violence to regime change, state (un-)making through processes of contraction or extension of heterogenous, hybrid' governscapes including some distinctly virtual ones but betraying real political effects. Finally, it expounds how the ethnopolitical conflict assemblage affixes together a variety of agency from human agents to institutions from local to state governments or the international conflict resolution apparatus in addition to the material (nonhuman) actants enrolled in the translation networks populating the conflict field.","Ditrych, O.",0,10.1007/s10308-018-0524-7,538
1494,Confusion can be beneficial for learning,"We tested key predictions of a theoretical model positing that confusion, which accompanies a state of cognitive disequilibrium that is triggered by contradictions, conflicts, anomalies, erroneous information, and other discrepant events, can be beneficial to learning if appropriately induced, regulated, and resolved. Hypotheses of the model were tested in two experiments where learners engaged in trialogues on scientific reasoning concepts in a simulated collaborative learning session with animated agents playing the role of a tutor and a peer student. Confusion was experimentally induced via a contradictory-information manipulation involving the animated agents expressing incorrect and/or contradictory opinions and asking the (human) learners to decide which opinion had more scientific merit. The results indicated that self-reports of confusion were largely insensitive to the manipulations. However, confusion was manifested by more objective measures that inferred confusion on the basis of learners' responses immediately following contradictions. Furthermore, whereas the contradictions had no effect on learning when learners were not confused by the manipulations, performance on multiple-choice posttests and on transfer tests was substantially higher when the contradictions were successful in confusing learners. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","D'Mello, S.",1,10.1016/j.learninstruc.2012.05.003,539
1498,Gaze tutor: A gaze-reactive intelligent tutoring system,"We developed an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that aims to promote engagement and learning by dynamically detecting and responding to students' boredom and disengagement. The tutor uses a commercial eye tracker to monitor a student's gaze patterns and identify when the student is bored, disengaged, or is zoning out. The tutor then attempts to reengage the student with dialog moves that direct the student to reorient his or her attentional patterns towards the animated pedagogical agent embodying the tutor. We evaluated the efficacy of the gaze-reactive tutor in promoting learning, motivation, and engagement in a controlled experiment where 48 students were tutored on four biology topics with both gaze-reactive and non-gaze-reactive (control condition) versions of the tutor. The results indicated that: (a) gaze-sensitive dialogs were successful in dynamically reorienting students' attentional patterns to the important areas of the interface, (b) gaze-reactivity was effective in promoting learning gains for questions that required deep reasoning, (c) gaze-reactivity had minimal impact on students' state motivation and on self-reported engagement, and (d) individual differences in scholastic aptitude moderated the impact of gaze-reactivity on overall learning gains. We discuss the implications of our findings, limitations, future work, and consider the possibility of using gaze-reactive ITSs in classrooms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

1502,,"Learning from Demonstration (or imitation learning) studies how computational and robotic agents can learn to perform complex tasks by observing humans. This closely resembles the way humans learn. For example, children can imitate adults in a variety of domestic tasks, such as pouring milk from a carton to a cup or cleaning a table, and after one or a few observations, they can replicate the action with relative accuracy. This research tests the feasibility of a virtual agent that can process multimodal (linguistic and visual) captures of actions and learn to reenact them in a simulated environment. In particular, this thesis looks into the problem from two perspectives. The first perspective is taken in a realistic setup, in which we will teach learning agents skills by showing real demonstrations of the skills. We will only focus on a small set of actions involving spatial primitives. The objective is for agents to learn to perform complex action skills from a limited amount of training samples. We will also try to teach agents in an interactive environment, in which immediate feedback is provided to agents to correct them in due time. The second perspective is taken in a synthetic setup. In this setup, a parallel corpus mapping natural language instructions to demonstrations is generated by soliciting human descriptions for complex action demonstrations in a two-dimensional simulator. The problem is framed in a sequence to sequence translation framework. We will discuss the difference between the two perspectives, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of corresponding learning frameworks. The system is composed of the following components: a. an event capture annotation tool that captures human interaction with objects using Kinect ® sensor; b. an event representation learning method using recurrent neural networks with qualitative spatial representation feature extraction; c. action reenacting algorithms using reinforcement learning and sequence to sequence methods; d. evaluation methods using 2-D and 3-D simulators.","Do, Tuan",0,,541
1503,,"Virtual gaming environments mediate interaction between players within a game and/or between a player and the game itself to make gameplay more enjoyable. Although game designers strive to achieve a delicate balance between content and interaction that promotes player enjoyment, sometimes players want to take actions that would result in this balance being broken.Many games simply prevent player actions that will put the game in an undesired state at the expense of player agency.More recent approaches attempt to accommodate player actions by adapting the game, but this solution has limited applicability. In this work, we introduce an alternative way to reduce the tension between player actions and authorial constraints by unobtrusively influencing player behavior to promote player actions that align with authorial intentions. This enables players choosing author-desired actions out of their own volition, therefore preserving player agency. Subtly influencing player behavior is also useful to make games easier or harder, and we also present examples of behavior influence techniques that can be used to alter players’ performance, effectively controlling the game’s difficulty. As an extension, we can use behavior influence techniques to inspect how player behavior changes and compare it to a known baseline, allowing authors to obtain additional insight about their players, such as determining if players are actively attentive and engaged, or if players are likely to be automated agents instead of human players. We also introduce a taxonomy that partitions behavior influence on two categories. The first category corresponds to the type of behavior being affected in terms of level of abstraction: inputlevel or semantic. The second category of the taxonomy classifies the motivation for wanting to modify player behavior, or its purpose: narrative, difficulty, or scrutiny. Through a series of case studies,we showexamples of unobtrusive behavior influence in virtual gaming environments across both types of behavior and with all three purposes in our taxonomy.","Dominguez, Ignacio Xavier",0,,542
1504,,"Khatso (kha55tso31 [special characters omitted]; also Katso, Kazhuo [special characters omitted], Gazhuo [special characters omitted] and Yunnan Mongolian; ISO 639-3:kaf) is an endangered Ngwi (or Yi) language spoken in Xingmeng, a single farming village in Yunnan, China. Khatso speakers, who number about 5600 people, are descendants of the Mongolian soldiers Kublai Khan brought to Yunnan in the 13th century, and they still identify as Mongolian today. The language has evolved considerably through language contact, however, and is now considered part of the central branch of the Ngwi language family within the Tibeto-Burman phylum. Almost all of the Khatso are bilingual in Mandarin or the local Yunnan dialect, because that is the only way to communicate with outsiders. Chinese is also the only language used in school and mastering it is necessary to pursue an education or find employment outside the town. Children continue to learn the language, but many parents teach them Chinese first and Khatso second. Moreover, there is no writing system; the language is not supported by print media or technology. As a result, the vitality of the language is eroding rapidly. This dissertation is part of larger project to document Khatso in order to help preserve and revitalize the language. The research and analysis presented in this dissertation differ significantly from previous efforts to describe the language. In addition to identifying the basic building blocks - phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and the lexicon - there is an emphasis on capturing Khatso the way it is spoken in daily life. Natural language data were gathered during nearly a year of fieldwork in Xingmeng, via both audio and video recordings, creating a large multimedia corpus of the language. Transcriptions of the recordings formed the foundation for the investigation, which follows a discourse-functional approach to linguistic analysis. As a result, this grammar is the most comprehensive analysis of Khatso yet, providing an in-depth look at the features, structures and systems that interact to comprise this unique language. It is also the first major study of the language in English. Khatso is a tonal language that is both analytic and isolating. The phonology is similar to that of most Ngwi languages, with the exception of its relatively large eight-tone system. Tone sandhi is triggered by a variety of phonological, syntactic and discourse factors. There is very little morphology in the language, and most of the lexicon consists of monosyllabic and disyllabic monomorphemes. There is a rich classifier system, which also marks number and specific reference. Typical word order is SV/APV, though there is a great deal of flexibility in discourse. Simple noun modifiers follow nouns, but relative clauses precede them. Serial verb constructions are frequent, and may describe one- and two-event situations. There is no verbal inflection; the aspectual system is indicated by grammatical particles. There is also no evidential system, but both the interrogative and emphatic marker inventories include morphemes that convey epistemic information. The most fundamental feature of Khatso is the fact that it is a pragmatics-based language, meaning that verbal semantics and discourse context are often more crucial than syntax in comprehending the language. Topic-comment structures and zero anaphora are frequent, regularly creating utterances in which key information is underspecified or absent. Some constructions, such as pragmatic agent marking, are triggered only when the context is ambiguous. And, many particles and constructions in Khatso are multifunctional, relying on context to clarify meaning. Essentially, syntax sets the stage for several potential interpretations and only the flow of information in a specific utterance points to the correct choice. Moreover, some constructions are only identifiable through contextual analysis, such as the many clause-combining structures that link phrases pragmatically without syntactic integration.

1505,You cannot speak and listen at the same time: a probabilistic model of turn-taking,"Turn-taking is a preverbal skill whose mastering constitutes an important precondition for many social interactions and joint actions. However, the cognitive mechanisms supporting turn-taking abilities are still poorly understood. Here, we propose a computational analysis of turn-taking in terms of two general mechanisms supporting joint actions: action prediction (e.g., recognizing the interlocutor's message and predicting the end of turn) and signaling (e.g., modifying one's own speech to make it more predictable and discriminable). We test the hypothesis that in a simulated conversational scenario dyads using these two mechanisms can recognize the utterances of their co-actors faster, which in turn permits them to give and take turns more efficiently. Furthermore, we discuss how turn-taking dynamics depend on the fact that agents cannot simultaneously use their internal models for both action (or messages) prediction and production, as these have different requirements-or, in other words, they cannot speak and listen at the same time with the same level of accuracy. Our results provide a computational-level characterization of turn-taking in terms of cognitive mechanisms of action prediction and signaling that are shared across various interaction and joint action domains.","Donnarumma, F.",0,10.1007/s00422-017-0714-1,544

However, as people get older, age-related impairments to working memory and cognition, as well as sensory impairments, mean that older adults struggle to adopt new information technology systems, which have become integral to everyday life in recent years. The research presented here investigates, across a series of three large scale experiments, how Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) can be used in virtual world applications, addressing three important domains of application space, to understand how ECAs may be used to engage with older users. The Virtual Banking Experiment investigates whether or not ECA gender or age portrayal has an effect on overall usability of virtual world applications for older users. The results of the experiment show that older users do not exhibit a significant preference for a particular ECA gender, however they do exhibit a preference for interacting with younger ECAs when compared with older ECAs in these applications. Results of the Entertainment Experiment show that scripting the interaction, between older users and ECAs in a virtual world quiz game, significantly improved the usability of these virtual world gaming applications employing ECAs as interlocators. The Social Support Experiment investigated three styles of providing advice to older users as part of a virtual advice bureau service. The results of the experiment show that older users prefer to receive advice from ECAs that has not been presented as having been obtained from real-world experiences.","Doolin, Simon Peter",0,,545
1510,,"Situated within the context of the January 25 Egyptian Revolution and the subsequent socio-political transitions, this dissertation focuses on the experiences of 24 university students and educators in Egypt, particularly emphasizing meanings and actions of participatory citizenship and citizenship education. Through a hermeneutic phenomenological qualitative approach, I explore how the experiences of the January 25 Egyptian Revolution and subsequent events impacted the perceptions and actions of participatory citizenship for university students and educators in Egypt; To what extent does university students and educators in Egypt perceive their actions of participatory citizenship; and How do university students and educators conceive the current role of the university in fostering citizenship education? I conclude that participants learn what it means to be a citizen from various sources, and practice those ideas in multiple spaces. The Revolution and subsequent socio-political events, in combination with other influences, have significantly impacted the perceptions of participatory citizenship for participants. And despite a number of challenges to participatory citizenship, the Revolution and subsequent socio-political events provided a critical pedagogical workshop where participatory citizenship was learned and practiced. The Revolution and subsequent events have also impacted teacher attitudes and pedagogies. The participants reveal a connection between social and political events and their perceptions and experiences of teaching and learning, and perceive teaching and learning as a political act of citizenship. Furthermore, participants perceive the university as important site where students can be change agents, where critical thinking is valued and promoted, where the university is seen as an essential part of the public sphere, where student empowerment is nurtured, and as a space where relevant pedagogy, peace education and the construction of good humans can occur. To enhance university citizenship education in Egypt, participants call on universities to focus on faculty and student development, civic engagement programs and international opportunities.","Dorio, Jason Nunzio",0,,546
1511,,"Evolution in the area of mobile computing has been phenomenal in the last few years. The exploding increase in hardware power has enabled multimodal mobile interfaces to be developed. These interfaces differ from the traditional graphical user interface (GUI), in that they enable a more “natural” communication with mobile devices, through the use of multiple communication channels (e.g., multi-touch, speech recognition, etc.). As a result, a new generation of applications has emerged that provide human-like assistance in the user interface (e.g., the Siri conversational assistant (Siri Inc., visited 2010)). These conversational agents are currently designed to automate a number of tedious mobile tasks (e.g., to call a taxi), but the possible applications are endless. A domain of particular interest is that of Cultural Heritage, where conversational agents can act as personalized tour guides in, for example, archaeological attractions. The visitors to historical places have a diverse range of information needs. For example, casual visitors have different information needs from those with a deeper interest in an attraction (e.g., - holiday learners versus students). A personalized conversational agent can access a cultural heritage database, and effectively translate data into a natural language form that is adapted to the visitor’s personal needs and interests. The present research aims to investigate the information needs of a specific type of visitors, those for whom retention of cultural content is important (e.g., students of history, cultural experts, history hobbyists, educators, etc.). Embodying a conversational agent enables the agent to use additional modalities to communicate this content (e.g., through facial expressions, deictic gestures, etc.) to the user. Simulating the social norms that guide the real-world human-to-human interaction (e.g., adapting the story based on the reactions of the users), should at least theoretically optimize the cognitive accessibility of the content. Although a number of projects have attempted to build embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for cultural heritage, little is known about their impact on the users’ perceived cognitive accessibility of the cultural heritage content, and the usability of the interfaces they support. In particular, there is a general disagreement on the advantages of multimodal ECAs in terms of users’ task performance and satisfaction over nonanthropomorphised interfaces. Further, little is known about what features influence what aspects of the cognitive accessibility of the content and/or usability of the interface. To address these questions I studied the user experiences with ECA interfaces in six user studies across three countries (Greece, UK and USA). To support these studies, I introduced: a) a conceptual framework based on well-established theoretical models of human cognition, and previous frameworks from the literature. The framework offers a holistic view of the design space of ECA systems b) a research technique for evaluating the cognitive accessibility of ECA-based information presentation systems that combine data from eye tracking and facial expression recognition. In addition, I designed a toolkit, from which I partially developed its natural language processing component, to facilitate rapid development of mobile guide applications using ECAs. Results from these studies provide evidence that an ECA, capable of displaying some of the communication strategies (e.g., non-verbal behaviours to accompany linguistic information etc.) found in the real-world human guidance scenario, is not affecting and effective in enhancing the user’s ability to retain cultural content. The findings from the first two studies, suggest than an ECA has no negative/positive impact on users experiencing content that is similar (but not the same) across different locations (see experiment one, in Chapter 7), and content of variable difficulty (see experiment two, in Chapter 7). However, my results also suggest that improving the degree of conte","Doumanis, Ioannis",1,,547

Animated pedagogical agents (APA) are computer characters embodied with speech, gestures, or movement (Sweller, Ayres, & Kalyuga, 2011), which according to cognitive-affective theory of learning with media (CATLM; Moreno, 2005; Moreno & Mayer, 2007), can provide a mechanism for triggering situational interest in reading materials through different arousal conditions. In this study, perceptual arousal and inquiry arousal were implemented in two different levels within four APA conditions: high perceptual arousal and high inquiry arousal condition, high perceptual and low inquiry condition, low perceptual and high inquiry condition, and low perceptual and low inquiry condition. Study outcome variables included situational interest, cognitive load, and reading comprehension. Situational interest is a psychological construct defined as a specific person-to-topic relationship, which is triggered by the instructional environment during the first stage of a 4-phase model of interest development (Hidi & Renninger, 2006; Krapp, 2002). In this study, situational interest was operationally defined as a self-reported degree of attention and an affective reaction to environmental stimuli; situational interest was measured using a 6-item, 5-point Likert-scale instrument adopted from Rotgans and Schmidt’s (2011b) experiment. Cognitive load is defined in cognitive load theory as a mental effort in working memory, part of which may contribute to formation of mental schemas in long-term memory structures (Sweller et al., 1998, p. 259). In this study, three types of cognitive load were examined, including extraneous cognitive load, intrinsic cognitive load, and germane cognitive load. The three types of cognitive load were operationally defined as self-reported complexity, clarity and effectiveness of the presentation, and increase in knowledge and understanding of a topic. The three types of cognitive load were measured using a 10-item, 11-point Likert-scale questionnaire, which was validated in prior studies (Leppink et al., 2013). The last outcome variable, reading comprehension, was measured using multiple-choice recall and understanding questions included with each original text passage. This study did not find any evidence of perceptual or inquiry arousal effects on situational interest, however, disordinal interaction between perceptual and inquiry arousal levels on germane cognitive load was found. Also, a main effect of inquiry arousal levels on reading comprehension was discovered.","Drobisz, Jack",1,,549

To fully understand the nature and depth of contemporary far-right movements, we need to examine more closely the distinctive ideological movements that inform and animate them. This article explores one specific articulation of these movements: US paleoconservatism. Although relatively unknown in the mainstream media, this anti-establishment strain of radical conservatism has provided intellectual ammunition to a wide range of agents and ideological forces challenging the prevailing liberal order nationally and internationally, including important parts of the anti-liberal politics of foreign policy under President Donald Trump.","Drolet, J.

1518,Dead Celebrity (Deleb) Use in Marketing: An Initial Theoretical Exposition,"The market for dead celebrities (Delebs) is large and growing. According to recent estimates, it is now worth $2.25 billion in annual licensing and royalty revenues (CBC, 2013; Kirsta, 2012). The practice is now so prevalent that Forbes began its annual ranking, in 2001, of the postmortem earnings of the ""top-earning dead celebrities."" In this paper, the author examines this practice and does the following. First, key terms are defined. Next, some of the major similarities and differences between living and dead celebrities are looked at. Following this, six major streams of theory that might pertain to Delebs are examined. They are used to explain (a) why Delebs remain popular in the consumption culture (""Nostalgia"" theory), (b) why Deleb possessions are often in demand (""Celebrity Contagion"" theory), (c) why many people willingly accept the products of Deleb morphing and reanimation efforts, even though they know they are not real (the ""Pleasure of Imagination""), (d), why Deleb morphing and reanimation efforts sometimes fail with some audiences (the ""Savanna Principle""), (e) how Deleb reanimations are typically perceived by human audiences (the ""Uncanny Valley""), and (f) how Delebs should be properly used by marketers (""Fit"" theory). The author concludes with some key principles learned, in addition to looking at the limitations of this paper and future directions for Deleb research.

1519,,"Construction project teams have been criticized to be incapable of delivering projects in a predictable and reliable manner. A major issue is contemporary construction practice doesn't encourage a closer cooperation among project participants. Hence as addressed by a variety of industry wide reports, the real challenge of the construction industry is to move from the current modus operandi to a more collaborative approach. To achieve this goal, knowledge should be advanced to fully capture the processes of cooperation in construction settings. This dissertation is intended to provide an innovative insight into the dynamics of cooperation in construction that we couldn't access before. The basic hypothesis of this dissertation is that cooperation at the individual level among construction project team members can significantly affect team performance. In particular, diverse cooperative behaviors of project participants and corresponding micro-level processes may determine project team performance in certain scenarios. To test this hypothesis, a conceptual framework was developed to capture relevant components of interpersonal cooperation; then an ABM (Agent-Based Modeling) simulation platform, named VOICE (Virtual Organizational Imitation for Construction Enterprises) was developed for exploratory simulation experiments. VOICE allows the investigators to design an artificial construction organization just like engineers designing a bridge. It is also able to visualize project team performance by real time performance dashboards and 3D graphs. Two case studies were conducted using VOICE to illustrate its capacity in investigating realistic cooperation related issues in construction. The first case study investigated intra-team cooperation in an estimating team. Specifically, certain cooperation related management actions—job acquiring, coordination, and team communication—were examined to check their influences on the estimating team performance in DBB (Design Bid Build) projects. The second case study extended the investigation to a cross-functional context where conditions become more complex. Simulation experiments were performed based on a real case between a proposal team and an engineering team in an EPC (Engineering Procurement and Construction) construction enterprise. The effects of goal congruence, as well as the implications of time pressure, task dependence and micro-management were examined based on a series of uncertainty analyses. The findings have supported the basic hypothesis of this research that cooperation at the individual level plays a vital role in affecting construction project team performance. It was also found the investigation of cooperation in construction settings to be nontrivial because of the complex interactions of cooperative behaviors and processes. This research is anticipated to constitute a stepping stone for further investigations of cooperation in construction: for academics, it is expected that the simulation approach and findings of this research would attract more scholars' attention to the behavioral and attitudinal aspects of cooperation in construction settings; for industry, the simulation platform VOICE could be used as a decision support tool for decision makers of project management to tackle with cooperation related issues.","Du, Jing",0,,552
1520,Virtual Organizational Imitation for Construction Enterprises: Agent-Based Simulation Framework for Exploring Human and Organizational Implications in Construction Management,"Numerous efforts have been made to investigate organizational and human implications in construction management. Despite the major contribution of these efforts, future research efforts should be able to capture complex interactions of social processes in the construction environment. This paper proposes the use of agent-based modeling (ABM) to study the interactions of organizational and human factors and their effects on construction performance. Literature was used to identify the main model components and inputs. A simulation model, virtual organizational imitation for construction enterprises (VOICE), was built to explore how construction performance emerges from microlevel construction processes and work-related behaviors. A case study was conducted to investigate several managerial scenarios. Results demonstrate the need to understand social and managerial effects on the performance of construction processes. Results were verified and validated against multifold sources. VOICE is expected to be an effective approach to investigating the organizational and human interactions of construction organizations.

1522,Using Agent-Based Modeling to Investigate Goal Incongruence Issues in Proposal Development: Case Study of an EPC Project,"A root cause of inefficiency in project proposal development is goal incongruence; i.e., different perceptions of behavioral standards and ranking of management criteria among stakeholders. Given the complexity of the unexpected behavioral and institutional consequences of goal incongruence, better understanding is required about the mechanism and impacts of goal incongruence during proposal development. This paper introduces a case study conducted on a large construction company. A behavioral simulation model previously developed by the authors, virtual organizational imitation for construction enterprises, was tailored to investigate goal incongruence issues in the proposal development of an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) project. Specifically, the direct impacts of goal incongruence were investigated, in addition to the combined implications of time pressure, task dependence, and micro-management. It was found that an investigation of multiple human behaviors in a more comprehensive and more systematic manner is necessary for understanding goal incongruence concerns in project proposal development. This work contributes to the simulation school in the area of construction engineering and management by introducing a more comprehensive and systematic behavioral simulation.

1524,,"This dissertation investigates two aspects of texture in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century string-quartet expositions. The first is the combination of one or more string parts into larger textural strands (as when the viola and cello join together to form one accompaniment). The second issue involves what I call textural roles—the various archetypal functions (such as melody, counter-melody, or accompaniment) that lines can carry out. These two musical phenomena—textural strands and textural roles—are examined empirically, using data from both a corpus of string-quartet expositions and a survey with human subjects. Chapters 2 and 3 deal with textural strands. In Chapter 2, I examine four simple acoustic cues—onset and offset synchrony, coordinated frequency modulation, and harmonic overlap—that are known to affect auditory stream segregation, the perceptual process by which textural strands are likely heard. I demonstrate that the textural strands in the exposition corpus—as well as those identified by subjects in the survey—can be largely explained by way of these four cues. Chapter 3 investigates several more complex acoustic cues, most of which derive from uniquely musical phenomena like harmony and meter. I present evidence that these cues would provide listeners little if any benefit in perceiving textural strands in string quartets. Chapter 4 addresses textural roles, making the argument that these roles are established by the information content (in the formal, information-theoretic sense) of musical lines. I propose a computational model of the information content a listener would perceive in a musical line. I then use this model to demonstrate that information content is higher in lines that play certain textural roles. Chapter 5 builds on the arguments of Chapter 4, presenting evidence that information content helps to establish not only textural roles but also what Edward T. Cone called leading virtual agents.","Duane, Ben",0,,555
1525,Agency and Information Content in Eighteenth- and Early Nineteenth-Century String-Quartet Expositions,"This article examines the phenomenon in which musical lines establish what Edward T. Cone calls virtual agents, making the argument that listeners are more likely to ascribe such agency to lines that have high information content (in the formal, information-theoretic sense). I use a computational model, which I have proposed elsewhere, to estimate the information content a listener would perceive when listening to a piece of music. I then compare this model's output to traditional musical analyses of several string-quartet expositions, demonstrating a qualitative correlation between the information content of these expositions and the virtual agents therein. Additionally, I assemble a larger corpus of expositions, many of which deploy virtual agents in a similar manner. Using formal statistical analysis, I show that these similarities can be traced back to the expositions' information content. Thus, both qualitative and quantitative evidence suggest a connection between information and agency in music.","Duane, B.",0,10.1215/00222909-1546976,556

Therefore, an understanding of whether and how to implement the variety of multimedia technology in nursing education is fundamental. Method: This study compares the effectiveness of online computer-based simulations designed using three alternative multimedia approaches-video, animation, and agent-based visualizations-on Learning of clinical reasoning skills. Participants in this study were undergraduate nursing students (n = 97). Results: Learning gains were significantly higher for simulation that incorporated exploration of agent-based visualizations than for video- and animation-based visualizations. Interestingly, Low achievers made significantly higher Learning gains after Learning with agent-based simulation than high academic achievers. Conclusion (s): This study proposes that visualizations play an important role in the effectiveness of Learning with computer-based multimedia environments. Learning with agent-based visualizations was superior to Learning with animation- and video-based visualizations. (C) 2019 International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning.

1527,"New community in a new space: artificial, natural, created, contested. An idea from a golf estate in Johannesburg","Attention is constantly devoted to the question of living together and sharing spaces, which is often translated as a matter of social and spatial segregation and belonging to a community. New spatial, social and institutional geographies have emerged as a potential cornerstone of separateness and togetherness in South Africa with the emergence of the gated community. This article tackles the concept of community within the space of a golf estate (a type of gated community) located in the West Rand, Johannesburg. It aims to understand new geographies of the city through an analysis of the organisation and social life inside and outside the estate. The notion of community is explored by looking at the system engendered by the main legal actor within the estate, the Homeowners Association (HOA). It will be argued that some of these new spaces are made neutral through the action of the HOA, an agent that institutionally constructs a communitarian lifestyle, accepted and contested simultaneously by the residents. Through the formalisation of a system in which holiday-style living is promoted, life is represented as real to the residents but lived in a virtual way when linked to broader societal and urban changes, thus reframing the notion of segregation.","Duca, F.",0,10.1080/02533952.2013.796122,558
1528,A massacred village community? Agent-based modelling sheds new light on the demography of the Neolithic mass grave of Talheim,"The virtual experiments presented below reveal the counterintuitive archaeological demography of the Neolithic mass grave of Talheim and underline the importance of distinguishing between the demographic structures of living and dead populations, as well as between attritional and catastrophic mortality patterns. We utilise a new agent-based modelling approach called Population & Cemetery, Simulator based on the NetLogo programming language and the Behaviour Composer of the modelling4all project, which allows us to extrapolate from dead to living populations and vice versa. Contrary to received opinion, we argue that the population of the Neolithic mass grave holds specific demographic information only, as it represents a pure catastrophic mortality pattern, i.e. a living population at a single point in time rather than the population of a conventional cemetery. The first experiments illustrate why the published demographic data (e.g. mortality, life expectancy, mean age at death) is misleading. It is illogical to utilise mortality tables devised for conventional (attritional) cemeteries in the case of living populations. Modelled populations with the published mortality rates of the massacre site are, furthermore, unable to stand up to plausible human demographic circumstances. In the second part, we evaluate the actual demographic information content of the Talheim sample. Comparative modelling illustrates that the Talheim population appears to be similar to possible living populations based on the mortuary record of Schwetzingen, an isochronal site of the Linear Pottery Culture (LBK), and Barenthal, a site which dates back to the early medieval period (7th to 10th centuries). It is therefore very likely that the Talheim population is a representative sample of a living population in the LBK and might even represent a massacred village community in its entirety.","Duering, A.",0,10.1127/anthranz/2014/0450,559
1530,Motivation matters: Interactions between achievement goals and agent scaffolding for self-regulated learning within an intelligent tutoring system,"this study, we examined the influence of achievement goals and scaffolding on self-regulated learning (SRL) and achievement within MetaTutor, a multi-agent intelligent tutoring system. Eighty-three (N = 83) undergraduate students were randomly assigned to either a control or prompt and feedback condition and engaged in a 1-h learning session with MetaTutor to learn about the human circulatory system. Process and product data were collected from all participants prior to, during, and following the session. MANCOVA analyses revealed that students in the prompt and feedback condition deployed more SRL strategies and spent more time viewing relevant science material compared to students in the control condition. Results also revealed a significant interaction between achievement goals and condition on achievement outcomes, such that learners adopting a dominant performance-approach demonstrated higher achievement in the prompt and feedback condition. Findings are discussed in relation to the role of motivation in self-regulated learning within computer-based learning environments. Implications for the design of pedagogical agents are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Duffy, M. C.",1,10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.041,560
1532,The human dynamic clamp as a paradigm for social interaction,"Social neuroscience has called for new experimental paradigms aimed toward real-time interactions. A distinctive feature of interactions is mutual information exchange: One member of a pair changes in response to the other while simultaneously producing actions that alter the other. Combining mathematical and neurophysiological methods, we introduce a paradigm called the human dynamic clamp (HDC), to directly manipulate the interaction or coupling between a human and a surrogate constructed to behave like a human. Inspired by the dynamic clamp used so productively in cellular neuroscience, the HDC allows a person to interact in real time with a virtual partner itself driven by well-established models of coordination dynamics. People coordinate hand movements with the visually observed movements of a virtual hand, the parameters of which depend on input from the subject's own movements. We demonstrate that HDC can be extended to cover a broad repertoire of human behavior, including rhythmic and discrete movements, adaptation to changes of pacing, and behavioral skill learning as specified by a virtual ""teacher."" We propose HDC as a general paradigm, best implemented when empirically verified theoretical or mathematical models have been developed in a particular scientific field. The HDC paradigm is powerful because it provides an opportunity to explore parameter ranges and perturbations that are not easily accessible in ordinary human interactions. The HDC not only enables to test the veracity of theoretical models, it also illuminates features that are not always apparent in real-time human social interactions and the brain correlates thereof.","Dumas, G.",0,10.1073/pnas.1407486111,561
1536,,"It is estimated that 2-8% of college students (approximately 1 in 20) report clinically significant diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Typically, those with verifiable diagnoses of ADHD are eligible to receive certain accommodations through the university which, in theory, put them on even footing with their peers; however there has been very little research done to actively address the needs of these students in the context of the composition classroom itself. To address this gap, in this dissertation I discuss the rhetorical positioning and identity construction of ADHD in the contemporary American university and ways in which composition courses in particular can more effectively institute practices aimed at enabling cognitively diverse students to succeed. The first goal of this dissertation is to better understand origins of the current medical/pathological rhetorical treatment of ADHD and the ways in which this approach affects college students with ADHD. Specifically, I look at the history of ADHD discourse to demonstrate how ADHD has come to be discussed through the lens of medical and pathological language and how such language has been adopted by contemporary colleges and universities through accommodations offerings and diagnostic protocols. The second goal of this dissertation is to advocate for ways that agents within composition programs can improve pedagogy and course design in such a way as to better meet the needs of these neurodiverse students. In particular, I discuss a cognitively accessible approach to teaching composition that focuses on metacognitive awareness as well as a “prototyping pedagogy.” Owing to the difficulty of addressing individuals’ cognitive needs – even when there exists a specific diagnosis each case is deeply idiosyncratic – the goal for both of these pedagogical approaches is to enable students to better recognize their own cognitive strengths and weaknesses and to actively seek out technologies, physical spaces, and writing processes that best enable them to compose successfully. From this dissertation I have identified three general takeaways: 1) institutional language surrounding neurodiversity needs to improve, 2) more effort can/should be placed on the academic success of neurodiverse students in colleges and universities, and 3) pedagogical approaches tailored to the needs of ADHD students are also beneficial for most if not all other students, regardless of cognitive ability. It is this last takeaway that is perhaps most important to emphasize. I argue that as we make conscious efforts to improve the cognitive accessibility of composition programs, we are simultaneously improving the overall quality of composition pedagogy for all students, regardless of cognitive ability or diagnostic status.","Dunn, Samuel James",0,,562
1537,,"Many city planners, developers, real estate agents, and planning academics have been strong proponents of compact, mixed-use, New Urbanist developments. They point to the research that shows that younger generations will favor the revitalized mixed use, dense, urban downtown centers advocated by urbanists like Jane Jacobs and Richard Florida over newly developed, spacious, quiet suburbs In fact, recent research on ICT and driving suggests that the advent of the smart phone and ubiquitous computing (Ubicomp) may be indeed influencing the lifestyle and preference of young adults, who rather than driving are substituting shopping, social, entertainment, and other trips with virtual trips. The question is whether this substitution of car with virtual trips would be likely to occur in dense downtown or as Joel Kotkin argues, in ""smart"" suburbs. Using survey data, this study explores the relationship between ICT usage, perceptions on driving, and preferences for current and future residential place -the latter operationalized in terms of New Urbanist transect zones. It tests the hypothesis that the more an individual's usage of ICT and the more negative the individual's perception of driving, the higher the individual's preference for dense urban downtowns—controlling for age and other demographic factors. Furthermore, the study hypothesizes that individuals' preferences for current versus future place of residence remain constant over time (i.e., in five, ten and twenty years preference projections). Contrary to expectations, the survey data analysis did not support the hypothesized relationships. Instead, it suggests a relationship between age and driving perceptions that is more supportive of Joel Kotkin's argument for Nerdistans and ""smart suburbs."" In addition, the data suggests that the preferences for future residential environments varies over time and that the majority of the Millennial generation in this study favor less dense rather than more dense, central locations. Finally, the data does not reflect any significant relationships between ICT usage and Residential Preference.","Duong, Steven Trieu",0,,563

1547,Enhancing Scientific Reasoning and Discussion with Conversational Agents,"This paper investigates the use of conversational agents to scaffold online collaborative learning discussions through an approach called academically productive talk (APT). In contrast to past work on dynamic support for collaborative learning, which has involved using agents to elevate the conceptual depth of collaborative discussion by leading students in groups through directed lines of reasoning, this APT-based approach lets students follow their own lines of reasoning and promotes productive practices such as explanation of reasoning and refinement of ideas. Two forms of support are contrasted, namely, Revoicing support and Feedback support. The study provides evidence that Revoicing support resulted in significantly more intensive reasoning exchange between students in the chat and significantly more learning during the chat than when that form of support was absent. Another form of support, namely, Feedback support increased expression of reasoning while marginally decreasing the intensity of the interaction between students and did not affect learning.","Dyke, G.",1,10.1109/tlt.2013.25,565

This article takes a particular depth example - the case of the genetic condition of sickle cell - and, drawing upon anthropological, archaeological and sociological evidence of the sickle cell body in history, appraises early, and later, Latourian ideas. The article concludes that while methodologically useful in drawing attention to the complicated links of humans, animals and things, concerns remain about Latourian ontological claims. Limitations include an empiricist failure to account for absence; an insufficiently robust conception of emergence; an unwarranted curtailment of counterfactual human knowledge; a lack of concern for serial 'undeserving losers'; a tendency to accord excessive freedoms to human actors; and a lack of a conception of how things may be considered as agents rather than actants.","Dyson, S.

1552,,"Scripting, defined as the mechanization of business processes through automated tools or orchestrated responses, has played a significant role in shaping call center activities and the resultant customer relationship. However, findings of industry research have shown that the use of scripting to maximize operational efficiency has had a disempowering effect on call center employees by lowering their job-skill and knowledge requirements. Grounded in the concepts of knowledge management and knowledge transfer, this study explored the experiences of frontline call center employees on the effects of scripting on customer problem solving. A single-case study design with semistructured interviews was used with a population of 20 frontline employees in a North American call center to gather insights. Thematic analysis was applied to the interview data using nodes to identify emerging themes and insights. Three major themes emerged: First, although scripting had contributed to improved service quality and operational efficiency, scripted practices undermined the use of team knowledge and limited the amount of shared information. Second, the employees requested that call center scripted solutions be more intuitive and better aligned to knowledge requirements. Third, the employees suggested that an object-oriented approach to solution management be used, one that could better leverage communities of practices and collective team knowledge sharing within the organization. This object-oriented approach to solution management may promote virtual knowledge flow and the building of subject matter expertise that could elicit higher agent engagement and problem ownership. The proposed object-oriented approach to knowledge sharing is important to management, as it could help facilitate knowledge reuse and improved organizational performance.","Dzuba, Roman",0,,567
1553,,"This paper discusses a pilot project held at Middlesex University to enhance students' writing skills through literature teaching. It argues that literature teaching can offer a profound contribution to work-based learning and lifelong education: first, by showing students how effective arguments are constructed; second, by inspiring students to use their reading to improve their writing; third, by offering an ethical guide in the workplace and, broadly speaking, in all areas of life. Moreover, literature teaching should help students become more energized by the challenges of argument, contradictions and complexity, as well as provide them with the means to formulate and then trust their aesthetic judgement. Using literature as a pedagogical tool, teachers can inspire ""educational connoisseurship"" in their students by teaching them to become active and autonomous, evaluative and critical agents in their own education. This paper presents the results of the pilot, showing the substantive contribution the study of certain essayists and novelists made to the students' perceptions of what makes good writing, how they might replicate it and how literature can offer an ethical guide throughout their working lives.

1554,A Virtual Agent to Support Individuals Living With Physical and Mental Comorbidities: Co-Design and Acceptability Testing,"Background: Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems. This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual's levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent. Objective: This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content. Methods: We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care. Results: Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone. Conclusions: Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.","Easton, K.",0,10.2196/12996,569

We address the potential synergies between planning and implementing an ABM on the one hand, and the endeavor of pre-registration on the other. We introduce ABMs as tools for both the generation and the improvement of theory, testing of hypotheses, and for extending traditional experimental approaches by facilitating the investigation of social processes from the intra-individual all the way up to the societal level. We describe examples of ABMs in social psychology, including a detailed description of the CollAct model of social learning. Finally, limitations and drawbacks of agent-based modeling are discussed.

1568,Reach Out and Touch Someone: Anticipatory Sensorimotor Processes of Active Interpersonal Touch,"Anticipating the sensorimotor consequences of an action for both self and other is fundamental for action coordination when individuals socially interact. Somatosensation constitutes an elementary component of social cognition and sensorimotor prediction, but its functions in active social behavior remain unclear. We hypothesized that the somatosensory system contributes to social haptic behavior as evidenced by specific anticipatory activation patterns when touching an animate target (human hand) compared with an inanimate target (fake hand). fMRI scanning was performed during a paradigm that allowed us to isolate the anticipatory representations of active interpersonal touch while controlling for nonsocial sensorimotor processes and possible confounds because of interpersonal relationships or socioemotional valence. Active interpersonal touch was studied both as skin-to-skin contact and as object-mediated touch. The results showed weaker deactivation in primary somatosensory cortex and medial pFC and stronger activation in cerebellum for the animate target, compared with the inanimate target, when intending to touch it with one's own hand. Differently, in anticipation of touching the human hand with an object, anterior inferior parietal lobule and lateral occipital-temporal cortex showed stronger activity. When actually touching a human hand with one's own hand, activation was stronger in medial pFC but weaker in primary somatosensory cortex. The findings provide new insight on the contribution of simulation and sensory prediction mechanisms to active social behavior. They also suggest that literally getting in touch with someone and touching someone by using an object might be approached by an agent as functionally distinct conditions.","Ebisch, S. J.

1572,,"Comments on an article by Betsy Sparrow and Ljubica Chatman (see record 2013-43956-002). The target article by the authors covers an impressively broad array of studied and to be studied effects of being online on people’s information processing. The interpersonal sharing of inner states and mutual influence are key topics of the social and cognitive psychology of interpersonal communication. The target article refers recurrently to memory as a key outcome of potential effects of Internet use, which is perfectly justified given memory’s fundamental role in social cognition. In other respects, the target article is even more comprehensive than one might expect given the focus on social cognition stated in the title. Indeed, phenomena like the search and comprehension of information are often studied outside the field of social cognition, understood as either cognition about social objects or cognition with other social subjects. The current author concludes that the target article provides important, multifaceted input for advancing the study of Internet influences in various domains of cognitive and social psychology. There are only a few topics that could be added to the picture. For instance, there is a sizable body of research on the antecedents and consequences of anthropomorphizing electronic devices, computers, or virtual agents, that is, perceiving and treating them as humanlike interaction partners (Echterhoff, Bohner, & Siebler, 2006; Epley, Waytz, & Cacioppo, 2007; Nass & Moon, 2000). Anthropomorphizing virtual or electronic agents, which are omnipresent on the Internet, induces users to form a social connection with them and engage in a variety of social behaviors (Echterhoff et al., 2006; Epley et al., 2007), including politeness (Nass, Moon, & Carney, 1996) or reciprocation of self-disclosure (Moon, 2000).

Increasingly, ""students and instructors are not only talking 'through' machines, but also [talking] 'to them', and 'within them'"" (Edwards & Edwards, in press, p. 185). Instructional communication scholars have much to contribute to the theory and practice of human-machine communication (HMC). Important instructional concepts (e.g., immediacy, credibility, confirmation, motivation, learning) will be present in every interaction when one of the actors is replaced with a machine or when the interaction happens in a simulated world. Little is known however of how to promote effectiveness for both instructors and students in HMC. The authors believe artificial intelligence, social robotics, and virtual worlds are three areas instructional communication research should explore. They argue that while HMC is in its infancy, there is much to be gained by instructional communication researchers gearing up for this emerging line of research. As in the face-to-face classroom, the field would shed light on future possibilities and ways to foster better teaching and learning with machine agents and in machine worlds.","Edwards, Autumn",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03634523.2017.1349915,573
1575,Use of an Interactive Computer Agent to Support Breastfeeding,"Mothers need consistent, sustained information and support to develop and meet personal breastfeeding goals, but often receive insufficient assistance and conflicting and incorrect advice. The use of technology may be helpful in supplementing existing health care professional breastfeeding education and support efforts. We developed and evaluated a computer-based animated, interactive agent designed to provide breastfeeding information and support to mothers interested in breastfeeding. A randomized controlled study of a first-generation system was conducted to determine the feasibility of (1) use of the Computer Agent; (2) the recruitment plan; and (3) the planned outcome evaluation (assessing the impact of the intervention on intent to breastfeed, attitudes towards breastfeeding, and breastfeeding self-efficacy). The pilot study (N = 15) showed that the use of the Computer Agent, the recruitment plan, and the planned outcome evaluation were all feasible. Mothers who used the Computer Agent had greater intentions to exclusively breastfeed after exposure to the Agent (intent to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months 1-7 scale score of 6.14 (post) vs. 5.14 (pre); p < 0.05). Non-statistically significant trends in improvement with use of the Computer Agent breastfeeding support system were also seen in the between subjects analyses of intent to breastfeed and breastfeeding self-efficacy. The pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of using a Computer Agent to support breastfeeding mothers and informed the design of a larger randomized clinical trial. An interactive Computer Agent may be helpful in improving rates of exclusive breastfeeding, particularly when there is not adequate health care professional support.","Edwards, R.

Rooted in theories of community mental health, social support, and pedagogy, the article describes the recruitment process, training, and supervision given to the organization's adolescent ""caretakers"" to ensure that they will develop the attitudes and skills needed in their therapeutic interactions with children. Particular emphasis is placed on ""in vivo"" supervisory processes derived from the organization's pedagogical model. The model's usefulness is not limited to training adolescent therapeutic caretakers and is readily applicable to training professional or nonprofessional helpers in a variety of settings (e.g., collaborative partnerships with schools and community agencies where personnel are trained to serve directly or in an auxiliary role as therapeutic change agents).","Eismann, E.

1581,The Sound of Trust: Voice as a Measurement of Trust During Interactions with Embodied Conversational Agents,"Trust is a critical component in effective collaboration, decision-making and negotiation. The goal of effective team leaders should be to send signals and messages that increase trust. We attempt to determine if signals can vary perceptions of trustworthiness and if nonverbal behaviors, such as the voice, contain indicators of trust. In order to investigate the relationship between trust and vocal dynamics, this article presents a study that explores how the voice, measured unobtrusively, reflects a person's current level of perceived trust. We used an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to maximize consistency and control in questioning, timing, and interviewer nonverbal behavior, thus eliminating potential confounds that may be introduced due to interaction adaptation. Participants () completed a face-to-face interview with the ECA and reported their perceptions of the ECA's trustworthiness. The results of the study revealed that vocal pitch was inversely related to perceived trust, but temporally variant; vocal pitch early in the interview reflected trust. The ECA was perceived as more trustworthy when smiling. While the results of this research suggest a relationship between vocal pitch and perceived levels of trust, more work needs to be done to clarify the causal relationship. Similarly, additional study needs to be done in order to integrate additional behavioral measurements that account for variation across diverse situations, people, and cultures.","Elkins, A.

1583,State paranoia and urban cycling,"Consistent with a continuum approach to mental health, a growing body of research has established that paranoia occurs in the general population. The stress-vulnerability model would predict an association between environments high in threat and the presence of state paranoia, even in those with low dispositional trait paranoia. The present research examines whether urban cycling, a naturalistic environment high in interpersonal threat, is associated with state paranoia - operationalised as an explicit perception that other road users intend the agent harm. 323 members of the general population who regularly cycled in London completed measures of state and trait paranoia, anxiety, depression and stress. The majority of the general population sample (70%) reported experiencing state paranoia during urban cycling, and there was no association between state paranoia and trait paranoia. Reported state paranoia was higher during urban cycling than when using the London underground (a lower threat environment) and reported state paranoia on the underground was associated with trait paranoia. The findings are consistent with the stress-vulnerability model of everyday paranoia.","Ellett, L.",0,10.1016/j.psychres.2018.03.035,577
1586,Understanding service quality in a virtual travel community environment,"Technological innovations in the tourism industry have significantly influenced the communication channels between service providers and potential travelers. Virtual travel communities (VTCs) are now popular and influential venues for tourism information sharing, yet little is known about membership behavior. The purpose of this study is to test a new model of VTC beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors using structural equation modeling. The model integrates measures proven in traditional consumer behavior theory, such as satisfaction, trust, and brand attitude, with behavioral measures unique to the virtual domain, such as stickiness. The results of an online survey of members of C-Trip, a Chinese VTC, indicate that the quality of the community significantly influences member satisfaction and trust. However, trust does not directly influence site stickiness or intention to transact. Member satisfaction significantly influences site stickiness, whereas trust influences brand attitude, which in turn influences intention to transact. These relationships suggest a service blueprint for site owners to ultimately stimulate online transactions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

1589,,"This thesis interrogates the emergence of a universal modern idea of childhood in the Madras Presidency between 1920 and 1942. It considers the construction and uses of ‘childhood’ as a conceptual category and the ways in which this informed intervention in the lives of children, particularly in the spheres of education and juvenile justice. Against a background of calls for national self-determination, the thesis considers elite debates about childhood as specifically ‘Indian’, examining the ways in which ‘the child’ emerged in late colonial South India as an object to be reformed and as a ‘human becoming’ or future citizen of an independent nation. Social reform in late colonial India is often assumed to be an area of conflict, particularly informed by racial difference. Children are seen as key targets in the competition between the colonial state and Indian politicians and professionals. However, a detailed study of the 1920 Madras Children Act and 1920 Elementary Education Act reveals the development of consensual decisions in regard to child welfare and the expansion of a ‘social’ realm, which existed outside the political. Dyarchy profoundly changed the nature of government and in policy areas related to children the ‘state’ was Indian in character, action and personnel. This thesis contends that the discursive emergence of ‘the child’ was complicated when legislation was implemented. By tracing implementation it demonstrates the extent to which modern childhood was a symbolic claim, rather than political commitment to children. Tracing the interactions between adults in authority - whether as parents, teachers, politicians or civil society activists – the thesis explores the extent to which the avowedly universal category of childhood was subsumed beneath other identities based on class, caste and gender. Understanding childhood through a variety of administration reports, political debates and pedagogical journals reflects the views and actions of adults. By utilising the remembered experience of middle-class children in autobiographies and the layered archival evidence of aristocratic children under the jurisdiction of the Court of Wards, the thesis balances adult discourses with an awareness of children as historical agents. It considers the ways in which children learned, played and interacted with each other. Finally, therefore, it charts the limits of adult authority and the ways differing identities were experienced in the lives of children in southern India in the early twentieth century.","Ellis, Catriona Priscilla",0,,579
1590,Feasibility of a Virtual Exercise Coach to Promote Walking in Community-Dwelling Persons with Parkinson Disease,"Objective: The short-term benefits of exercise for persons with Parkinson disease (PD) are well established, but long-term adherence is limited. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of a virtual exercise coach to promote daily walking in community-dwelling persons with Parkinson disease. Design: Twenty subjects with Parkinson disease participated in this phase 1, single-group, nonrandomized clinical trial. The subjects were instructed to interact with the virtual exercise coach for 5 mins, wear a pedometer, and walk daily for 1 mo. Retention rate, satisfaction, and interaction history were assessed at 1 mo. Six-minute walk and gait speed were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Results: Fifty-five percent of the participants were women, and the mean age was 65.6 yrs. At the study completion, there was 100% retention rate. The subjects had a mean satisfaction score of 5.6/7 (with 7 indicating maximal satisfaction) with the virtual exercise coach. Interaction history revealed that the participants logged in for a mean (SD) of 25.4 (7) days of the recommended 30 days. The mean adherence to daily walking was 85%. Both gait speed and the 6-min walk test significantly improved (P < 0.05). No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Sedentary persons with Parkinson disease successfully used a computer and interacted with a virtual exercise coach. Retention, satisfaction, and adherence to daily walking were high for 1 mo, and significant improvements were seen in mobility.","Ellis, T.",0,10.1097/PHM.0b013e31828cd466,580
1596,,"Substance use disorders (SUDs) are pervasive in the United States, with 20.1 million cases in 2016, of which only 19% receive treatment. SUDs permeate all medical specialties and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of every chief complaint. Acknowledging the salience of SUDs provides a unique opportunity for early identification and intervention. Thus, SUDs should be reflected prominently in the history of the present illness rather than in the social history. To this effect, we propose the inclusion of Use (U) in the history of present illness and incorporating “U” into the pedagogical mnemonic of OPQRST that is commonly used in medical training. Obtaining this history will help determine if and which abused substances may be contributing to the chief complaint. We also suggest the incorporation of an additional acronym, SORTED, to account for the various domains of Use, including Street (illicit drugs), OTCs (over-the-counter medications), Rx (prescriptions, including nonmedicinal use of pharmaceutical drugs), Tobacco (including e-cigarettes), EtOH (alcohol), and Dietary (caffeine, vitamins, and herbal supplements) agents. We discuss how utilizing OPQRSTU will help reshape the way medical students think about SUDs and will facilitate detection and diagnosis of all domains of SUDs.

1599,,"Human protein kinases belong to a large and diverse enzyme family that contains more than 500 members. Deregulation of protein kinases is associated with many disorders, and this is why protein kinases are attractive targets for drug discovery. Due to the high conservation of the ATP binding pocket among this family, designing specific and/or selective inhibitors against certain member(s) is challenging. Several studies have been conducted on protein kinases to validate them as suitable drug targets. Although there are numerous target-validated protein kinases, the efforts to develop small molecule inhibitors have so far led to only a limited number of therapeutic agents and drug candidates. In our studies, we tried to understand the basic structural features of protein kinases using available computational tools. There are wide structural variations between different states of the same protein kinase that affect the enzyme specificity and inhibition. Many protein kinases do not yet have an available X-ray crystal structure and have not yet been validated to be drug targets. For these reasons, we developed a new homology modeling approach to facilitate modeling non-crystallized protein kinases and protein kinase states. Our homology modeling approach was able to model proteins having long amino acid sequences and multiple protein domains with reliable model quality and a manageable amount of computational time. Then, we checked the applicability of different docking algorithms (the routinely used computational methodology in virtual screening) in protein kinase studies. After performing the basic study of kinase structure modeling, we focused our research on cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). We prepared a non-redundant database from 303 available CDK2 PDB structures. We removed all structural anomalies and proceeded to use the CDK2 database in studying CDK2 structure in its different states, upon ATP, ligand and cyclin binding. We clustered the database based on our findings, and the CDK2 clusters were used to generate protein ligand interaction fingerprints (PLIF). We generated a PLIF-based pharmacophore model which is highly selective for CDK2 ligands. A virtual screening workflow was developed making use of the PLIF-based pharmacophore model, ligand fitting into the CDK2 active site and selective CDK2 shape scoring. We studied the structural basis for selective inhibition of CDK2 and GSK-3β. We compared the amino acid sequence, the 3D features, the binding pockets, contact maps, structural geometry, and Sphoxel maps. From this study we found 1) the ligand structural features that are required for the selective inhibition of CDK2 and GSK-3β, and 2) the amino acid residues which are essential for ligand binding and selective inhibition. We used the findings of this study to design a virtual screening workflow to search for selective inhibitors for CDK2 and GSK-3β. Because protein–protein interactions are essential in the function of protein kinases, and in particular of CDK2, we used protein–protein docking knowledge and binding energy calculations to examine CDK2 and cyclin binding. We applied this study to the voltage dependent calcium channel 1 (VDAC1) binding to Bax. We were able to provide important data relevant to future experimental researchers such as on the possibility of Bax to cross biological membranes and the most relevant amino acid residues in VDAC1 that interact with Bax.","Elokely, Khaled M.",0,,582
1600,,"In order to motivate the design of legged machines that walk as humans do, this thesis investigates how leg muscles and tendons work mechanically during level-ground human walking at self-selected speeds. I hypothesize that quasi- passive, series-elastic clutch units spanning the knee joint in a musculoskeletal arrangement can capture the dominant mechanical behaviors of the human knee in level-ground walking. As a preliminary evaluation of this hypothesis, I develop an under-actuated model of the human leg in walking where each muscle-tendon unit spanning the knee joint is represented as a simple linear spring in series with a clutch. I vary model parameters, or spring constants and clutch engagement times, using an optimization scheme that minimizes ankle and hip actuator work while still maintaining human-like knee mechanics. For model evaluation, kinetic and kinematic gait data are employed from nine participants walking across a level-ground surface at self-selected gait speeds. With this under-actuated leg model, I find good agreement between model quasi-passive knee torque and experimental knee values, suggesting that a knee actuator is not necessary for level-ground robotic ambulation at self-selected gait speeds. As a further evaluation of the hypothesis of spring-like muscle-tendon behavior about the knee joint, a forward dynamics control scheme for the under-actuated model is developed. Hill-type muscle models are employed to model the ankle soleus and hip monoarticular muscles. Further, the model's series-elastic clutches are engaged with a simple state machine based on electromyography (EMG) data from the literature. Muscles are controlled with simple feedback controls representing the reflexive architecture of the human neuromuscular system. Following an optimization procedure, the model is shown to predict joint and muscle biomechanics, as well as the metabolism of walking humans, supporting the idea that muscle-tendon units spanning the human knee joint mainly operate as spring elements during neural activation, affording the relatively high metabolic walking economy of humans.

1601,Analysis of and feedback on phonetic features in pronunciation training with a virtual teacher,"Pronunciation errors may be caused by several different deviations from the target, such as voicing, intonation, insertions or deletions of segments, or that the articulators are placed incorrectly. Computer-animated pronunciation teachers could potentially provide important assistance on correcting all these types of deviations, but they have an additional benefit for articulatory errors. By making parts of the face transparent, they can show the correct position and shape of the tongue and provide audiovisual feedback on how to change erroneous articulations. Such a scenario however requires firstly that the learner's current articulation can be estimated with precision and secondly that the learner is able to imitate the articulatory changes suggested in the audiovisual feedback. This article discusses both these aspects, with one experiment on estimating the important articulatory features from a speaker through acoustic-to-articulatory inversion and one user test with a virtual pronunciation teacher, in which the articulatory changes made by seven learners who receive audiovisual feedback are monitored using ultrasound imaging.","Engwall, O.",1,10.1080/09588221.2011.582845,584

The current study examined the relationships between trust in robots and anthropomorphism of robots, intention to work with robots and preference of automation levels. For this purpose, 102 caregivers who work for elder care in a nursing home (aged between 19 and 40) participated in an experimental study. According to the results, anthropomorphism of robots did not make any difference in terms of trust in them. Trust in robots was significantly related to intention to work and preference of automation levels.

Methods: Effective doses were calculated and compared from optically stimulated dosimeter measurements and a previously validated protocol using anthropomorphic adult and child phantoms scanned with the Accuitomo 170 (J. Morita, Japan) and MiniCAT (Xoran Technologies, Ann Arbor, MI) CBCT machines. Results: Average child phantom doses (440 and 117 µSv) were 60% and 56% greater than the adult doses from the Accuitomo 170 and MiniCAT units respectively. Thyroid dose, particularly to the child, had a significant contribution to the overall dose. Conclusion: Effective dose for the two units increased as FOV increased. The child dose, especially the thyroid, increased when compared to the adult phantom. Child protocols and the smallest FOV helps reduce the child's effective dose.","Erickson, Robert Todd",0,,586
1605,Moderators of the disapproval of peer punishment,"Recent studies have found disapproval of peer punishment of norm violations. This seems puzzling, given the potential benefits peer punishers contribute to the group. We suggest part of the answer is that peer punishers tend to come across as aggressive and as such may be viewed as more problematic than beneficial to have around. We used simple computer animations of geometric shapes to enact 15 precise variations of social sanctions against a norm violator. More than 1,800 subjects were recruited to watch an animation and judge the behavior and character of the animated agents. They also completed a trait aggression measure. Across the variations peer punishment was typically disapproved of, especially when severe or openly aggressive, and especially by subjects low on trait aggression. We conclude that there seems to be a social norm against peer punishment and that dislike of aggressiveness seems to be part of the reason why.","Eriksson, K.",0,10.1177/1368430215583519,587
1608,,"Human-machine interactions increased its importance through graphical user interface applications from human-computer interactions. Later, these interfaces applied on human-like machines, and human-robot interactions (HRI) have been born. Increased demand and accessibility on these robots brought a new era of domestic robots. The innovations on the smart environments and the Internet of things devices made domestic robots a member of our social environment. The aptitude for identifying the emotional states of others and responding to exposed emotions are important aspect of human social intelligence. Robots are expected to be prevalent in society in the near future to assist humans in various tasks. HRI is of critical importance in the assistive robotics sector. Smart digital assistants and assistive robots fail quite often when a request is not well-defined verbally. When the assistant fails to provide services as desired, the person may exhibit an emotional response such as anger or frustration through the changes in their voice or on their facial expression. As interactive robots focus on serving human users with special tasks in their daily activities, it is critical for robots to understand not only the language, but also human psychology. In this dissertation, a novel affection-based perception architecture for HRI is presented, where the robot is expected to recognize human emotional states for encouraging a natural bonding between the human and the robotic artifact. The system built upon high level of heterogeneity including a low-cost 3D printed humanoid robot torso and an unmanned ground vehicle. The research aims to improve HRI by using the advantages of machine and deep learning approaches for emotion detection, decision-making and object identification. Furthermore, it emphasizes the multi-modal approaches for user specific emotion recognition problems in a dynamic environment.","Erol, Berat Alper",0,,588
1609,Describing Events: Changes in Eye Movements and Language Production Due to Visual and Conceptual Properties of Scenes,"How can a visual environment shape our utterances? A variety of visual and conceptual factors appear to affect sentence production, such as the visual cueing of patients or agents, their position relative to one another, and their animacy. These factors have previously been studied in isolation, leaving the question about their interplay open. The present study brings them together to examine systematic variations in eye movements, speech initiation and voice selection in descriptions of visual scenes. A sample of 44 native speakers of German were asked to describe depicted event scenes presented on a computer screen, while both their utterances and eye movements were recorded. Participants were instructed to produce one-sentence descriptions. The pictures depicted scenes with animate agents and either animate or inanimate patients who were situated to the right or to the left of agents. Half of the patients were preceded by a visual cue - a small circle appearing for 60 ms on a blank screen in the place of patients. The results show that scenes with left-rather than right-positioned patients lead to longer speech onset times, a higher probability of passive sentences and looks toward the patient. In addition, scenes with animate patients received more looks and elicited more passive utterances than scenes with inanimate patients. Visual cueing did not produce significant changes in speech, even though there were more looks to cued vs. non-cued referents, demonstrating that cueing only impacted initial scene scanning patterns but not speech. Our findings demonstrate that when examined together rather than separately, visual and conceptual factors of event scenes influence different aspects of behavior. In comparison to cueing that only affected eye movements, patient animacy also acted on the syntactic realization of utterances, whereas patient position in addition altered their onset. In terms of time course, visual influences are rather short-lived, while conceptual factors have long-lasting effects.","Esaulova, Y.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00835,589
1612,Needs and challenges in human computer interaction for processing social emotional information,"Demand for and delivery so far of sophisticated computational instruments able to recognize, process and store relevant interactional signals, as well as interact with people, displaying suitable autonomous reactions appropriately sensitive to environmental changes, have produced great expectations in Information Communication Technology (ICT). Knowing what an appropriate continuation of an interaction is depends on detecting the addresser's register and a machine interface unable to assess differences will have difficulty managing interactions.

1615,Artificial Communication? The Production of Contingency by Algorithms,"Discourse about smart algorithms and digital social agents still refers primarily to the construction of artificial intelligence that reproduces the faculties of individuals. Recent developments, however, show that algorithms are more efficient when they abandon this goal and try instead to reproduce the ability to communicate. Algorithms that do not ""think"" like people can affect the ability to obtain and process information in society. Referring to the concept of communication in Niklas Luhmann's theory of social systems, this paper critically reconstructs the debate on the computational turn of big data as the artificial reproduction not of intelligence but of communication. Self-learning algorithms parasitically take advantage be it consciously or unaware of the contribution of web users to a ""virtual double contingency."" This provides society with information that is not part of the thoughts of anyone, but, nevertheless, enters the communication circuit and raises its complexity. The concept of communication should be reconsidered to take account of these developments, including (or not) the possibility of communicating with algorithms.","Esposito, E.",0,10.1515/zfsoz-2017-1014,591
1616,An analysis of transitivity in Cheyenne,"Verbal typology in Cheyenne has traditionally been analyzed following the terminology that Bloomfield used in 1946 in order to describe Proto-Algonquian verbal classes. That terminology mixed two syntactic concepts, namely valence and transitivity, in order to refer to the different types of verb in Algonquian languages. Although in Cheyenne the verbal paradigms are available in a number of excellent sources (Petter 1952; Meeussen 1962; Leman 1980b; Russell 1987), this article attempts to provide a more comprehensive description of the verbal system in Cheyenne by classifying Cheyenne predicates into three groups in terms of their semantic valence, that is the number of core arguments they require: (1) one-place predicates, which are accompanied by only one core argument, (2) two-place predicates, which have two core arguments, and (3) three-place predicates, which include up to three core arguments. This classification will prove more accurate than the traditional four-way division, since it captures better the existence of four further distinct verbal paradigms, namely those illustrated by the construction including an inanimate subject and an animate patient, the Unspecified Agent construction, and the ditransitive constructions with inanimate theme, and the ditransitive construction with theme. On the other hand, the study of three-place predicates will occupy a special place in the last part of the article, since it raises interesting questions, such as the number of arguments coded in the verb, the semantic role played by these arguments, and the possible existence of alternations and splits. Furthermore, the analysis of ditransitive constructions will allow us to classify this type of predicate in Cheyenne in terms of the concept of alignment, which refers to the comparison of the properties of the core arguments of the predicate.","Esteban, A.

1617,How do novice teachers in Finland perceive their professional agency?,"This study investigated novice teachers' perceptions of their professional agency during the initial years of their work in schools. The research questions were: (i) How do novice teachers perceive their professional agency within their work, and what do they see as the main restrictions and resources affecting that agency? (ii) How do novice teachers perceive their professional agency in the construction and renegotiation of their professional identities, and what do they see as the main restrictions and resources affecting their sense of agency? In theoretical terms, we adhere to a subject-centered sociocultural approach. This implies understanding subjects as active agents from a developmental perspective, with attention also given to professional identities. The subjects of this study were 13 qualified primary-level class teachers who had worked from one to five years as class teachers in Finnish primary schools. Data from open-ended interviews with the novice teachers were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings indicated that all the novice teachers perceived strong agency in their opportunities to apply and develop pedagogical practices within the classroom. However, they had a much weaker sense of agency as regards the social management of the classroom. When the teachers entered into the practical school context, most of them became aware that they would have to renegotiate their professional identities. This involved re-assessing their professional ideals and ethical standards. The major perceived constraint emerged from their lack of competence in providing support for the children's psychological well-being. The role of the school principal was seen crucial for the novice teachers' work in the schools: the principal was seen as acting as a resource but also as a constraint on the teacher's sense of professional agency, both at the individual and school levels. In addition, close collaboration and support from other teachers in difficult everyday situations was seen as crucial for the teachers' survival in the practical school context. The study provides insights into the challenges and constraints affecting novice teachers' sense of professional agency, and on the resources and support that they need in their first years at work.","Etelapelto, A.",0,10.1080/13540602.2015.1044327,593
1620,An experimental psychological perspective on social robotics,"Why should an experimental psychologist bother entering a relatively novel field like social robotics and how could the scientific community in social robotics potentially gain from this? This paper highlights the theoretical and practical gains and challenges associated with an interdisciplinary approach when addressing current research questions in human-machine interaction, with a particular focus on social robotics. Three core issues are discussed from an experimental social psychological perspective: First, this paper focuses on the importance of a scientific, theory-driven approach to test causal relationships between key constructs of interest in the domain of human-machine interaction; second, it addresses the need for advancement in the realm of measurement, e.g., in terms of validity. To illustrate, this paper provides an overview of the author's own research in the domain of human-robot interaction in which we have tried to live up to the aforementioned desiderata. Finally, following common Research-Development practice, we argue for bridging the gap between foundational and applied research by testing the validity of the theoretical assumptions and the robustness of our technical platforms in real-world human machine interaction settings.

We fill this gap in the literature by experimentally investigating the effects of facial gender cues on stereotypical trait and application ascriptions to robots. As predicted, the short-haired male robot was perceived as more agentic than was the long-haired female robot, whereas the female robot was perceived as more communal than was the male counterpart. Analogously, stereotypically male tasks were perceived more suitable for the male robot, relative to the female robot, and vice versa. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that gender stereotypes, which typically bias social perceptions of humans, are even applied to robots. Implications for design-related decisions are discussed.","Eyssel, F.",0,10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.00937.x,595
1623,Social categorization of social robots: Anthropomorphism as a function of robot group membership,"Previous work on social categorization has shown that people often use cues such as a person's gender, age, or ethnicity to categorize and form impressions of others. The present research investigated effects of social category membership on the evaluation of humanoid robots. More specifically, participants rated a humanoid robot that either belonged to their in-group or to a national out-group with regard to anthropomorphism (e.g., mind attribution, warmth), psychological closeness, contact intentions, and design. We predicted that participants would show an in-group bias towards the robot that ostensibly belonged to their in-group as indicated by its name and location of production. In line with our hypotheses, participants not only rated the in-group robot more favourably importantly, they also anthropomorphized it more strongly than the out-group robot. Our findings thus document that people even apply social categorization processes and subsequent differential social evaluations to robots.","Eyssel, F.",0,10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02082.x,596
1625,A Methodology for Maintaining Trust in Industrial Digital Ecosystems,"Trust is widely considered to be essential for the smooth functioning of digital ecosystems. However, trust by its very nature, and due to the virtual connection between entities, is extremely fragile. Trust has a life cycle which is composed of building, maintaining, and declining. Given the fragility of trust in virtual environments, it is challenging to work out how to maintain the level of trust (specifically positive trust) between two interacting parties. Once positive trust has been established in the trust building phase, a methodological framework is needed to maintain the existing trust level, so that the relationship may be sustained in the future. In this paper, we present amethodology for maintaining trust in industrial digital ecosystems. The methodology proposes the use of a third party agent, an iterative negotiation process, proactive performance monitoring, and intelligence metrics recalibration of the trust level. In a trust-based relationship, trust can be regarded as having been maintained if the final trust is greater than or equal to initial trust. We demonstrate the validity of the methodology by engineering a prototype setup and running simulations under various operational conditions.","Fachrunnisa, O.",0,10.1109/tie.2011.2173890,597
1627,Assistive Conversational Agent for Health Coaching: A Validation Study,"Objective Poor lifestyle represents a health risk factor and is the leading cause of morbidity and chronic conditions. The impact of poor lifestyle can be significantly altered by individual's behavioral modification. Although there are abundant lifestyle promotion applications and tools, they are still limited in providing tailored social support that goes beyond their predefined functionalities. In addition, virtual coaching approaches are still unable to handle user emotional needs. Our approach presents a human-virtual agent mediated system that leverages the conversational agent to handle menial caregiver's works by engaging users (e.g., patients) in a conversation with the conversational agent. The dialog used a natural conversation to interact with users, delivered by the conversational agent and handled with a finite state machine automaton. Our research differs from existing approaches that replace a human coach with a fully automated assistant on user support. The methodology allows users to interact with the technology and access health-related interventions. To assist physicians, the conversational agent gives weighting to user's adherence, based on prior defined conditions. Materials and Methods This article describes the design and validation of CoachAI, a conversational agent-assisted health coaching system to support health intervention delivery to individuals or groups. CoachAI instantiates a text-based health care conversational agent system that bridges the remote human coach and the users. Results We will discuss our approach and highlight the outcome of a 1-month validation study on physical activity, healthy diet, and stress coping. The study validates technology aspects of our human-virtual agent mediated health coaching system. We present the intervention settings and findings from the study. In addition, we present some user-experience validation results gathered during or after the experimentation. Conclusions The study provided a set of dimensions when building a human-conversational agent powered health intervention tool. The results provided interesting insights when using human-conversational agent mediated approach in health coaching systems. The findings revealed that users who were highly engaged were also more adherent to conversational-agent activities. This research made key contributions to the literature on techniques in providing social, yet tailored health coaching support: (1) identifying habitual patterns to understand user preferences; (2) the role of a conversational agent in delivering health promoting microactivities; (3) building the technology while adhering to individuals' daily messaging routine; and (4) a socio-technical system that fits with the role of conversational agent as an assistive component. Future Work Future improvements will consider building the activity recommender based on users' interaction data and integrating users' dietary pattern and emotional wellbeing into the initial user clustering by leveraging information and communication technology approaches (e.g., machine learning). We will integrate a sentiment analysis capability to gather further data about individuals and report these data to the caregiver.","Fadhil, A.",0,10.1055/s-0039-1688757,598
1630,,"Empirical research has increasingly turned its attention to distributed cognition. Acts of remembering are embedded in a social, interactional context; cognitive labor is divided between a rememberer and external sources. The present article examines the benefits and costs associated with distributed, collaborative, conversational remembering. Further, we examine the consequences of joint acts of remembering on subsequent individual acts of remembering. Here, we focus on influences on memory through social contagion and socially shared retrieval-induced forgetting. Extending beyond a single social interaction, we consider work that tracks the propagation of socially shared retrieval-induced forgetting throughout larger networks made up of several agents. Although much work has focused on how distributing cognition can augment memory, this is not the primary lesson we draw from the conversational remembering literature. Rather, mnemonic convergence between communicators is a boon to sociality. It allows the formation and maintenance of mnemonic communities, rather than expanding capacity or accuracy of memory per se.

1633,Does anthropomorphism influence customers' switching intentions in the self-service technology failure context?,"Purpose - To enhance customer experiences, firms are increasingly adding human-like features to their self-service technology (SST) machines. To that end, the purpose of the present study is to examine customer interactions with an anthropomorphic machine in a service failure context. Specifically, the authors investigate the joint effects of machine voice, an individual's sense of power and the presence of other customers in influencing customers' switching intentions following an SST failure. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors used a quasi-experimental design in which they manipulated voice type (anthropomorphic vs robotic) and the presence of other customers (present vs absent) in video-based scenarios while measuring customers' sense of power. The scenarios reflected a service failure experience with a self-service kiosk at an airport. The authors tested the hypotheses using PROCESS analyses with the Johnson-Neyman technique. Findings - Consumer reactions to SST failures vary depending on the degree of anthropomorphism associated with an SST machine, an individual's sense of power and the presence of other customers. Research limitations/implications - Field inquiry and an investigation in other SST contexts or of other anthropomorphic features are needed to generalize the findings. Practical implications - Service providers targeting powerful consumers should consider the social presence of others when incorporating anthropomorphic features into their SST facilities. Originality/value - This study is the first to examine consumer responses to service failures in an anthropomorphic SST context.","Fan, A.",0,10.1108/jsm-07-2015-0225,600

The results demonstrate that consumers show varying levels of dissatisfaction with a service failure caused by an anthropomorphic (vs. non-anthropomorphic) self-service machine depending on their levels of interdependent self-construal (high vs. low) and technology self-efficacy (high vs. low). The underlying mechanism is self-blame. The theoretical contributions to the existing service technology research and the emerging anthropomorphism literature are discussed. This research also provides practical guidelines to industry practitioners for more efficient usage of service robots in delivering customer service.","Fan, A. L.",0,10.1080/19368623.2019.1639095,601
1640,E-leadership effectiveness in virtual teams: motivating language perspective,"Purpose - Virtual teams are becoming a norm in current knowledge-based society and offer a wide range of organizational benefits. This paper aims to investigate the effects of leaders' motivating language (ML) and feedback approach on virtual team members' creativity performance. Design/methodology/approach - A 2 x 2 with pre-test and post-test experimental design was employed to explore how to stimulate virtual team members' creativity performance using a group decision support system. Findings The results show that leaders' ML and feedback approach via e-mail instructions have different interaction effects on members' creativity and idea generation performance. Team members receiving direction-giving instructions generate more ideas under the demanding feedback approach and team member receiving instructions with more empathetic language exhibit higher creativity performance under the encouraging feedback approach. Research limitations/implications - Shortcomings of virtual environment and leadership remain the major factors influencing such findings. Since the results are also restrained by the functionality of the utilized software tool, tools for virtual teams are recommended to include features that can support the effective use of team leaders' motivational language. Social implications - Virtual team leaders should provide proper guidance to members using understanding and empathetic wording approach. For task-oriented work, leaders should consider giving more specific instructions and provide constant feedback for completed work. For creative work, leaders should give positive encouragement as feedback or even challenge team members to stimulate their creativity. Additionally, facilitation rules can be set up in advance so that the intelligent agent can timely send out follow-up instructions/feedback. Originality/value - The gained insights beneficially help tool developers for virtual teams build/ enhance their tools based on the need of team leaders. This paper also usefully offers important implications regarding how to motivate virtual team members' creative thinking.","Fan, K. T.",0,10.1108/imds-07-2013-0294,602
1644,Reputation mechanism for e-commerce in virtual reality environments,"The interest in 3D technology and virtual reality (VR) is growing both from academia and industry, promoting the quick development of virtual marketplaces (VMs) (i.e. e-commerce systems in VR environments). VMs have inherited trust problems, e.g. sellers may advertise a perfect deal but doesn't deliver the promised service or product at the end. In view of this, we propose a five-sense feedback oriented reputation mechanism (supported by 3D technology and VR) particularly for VMs. The user study confirms that users prefer VMs with our reputation mechanism over those with traditional ones. In our reputation mechanism, five-sense feedback is objective and buyers can use it directly in their reputation evaluation of target sellers. However, for the scenarios where buyers only provide subjective ratings, we apply the approach of subjectivity alignment for reputation computation (SARC), where ratings provided by one buyer can then be aligned (converted) for another buyer according to the two buyers' subjectivity. Evaluation results indicate that SARC can more accurately model sellers' reputation than the state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

1648,New Agent-Based Egress Model Allowing for Social Relationships,"Many of the models developed to date for human evacuation lack realism because of their inability to adequately simulate social relationships. To begin to address this shortcoming, an agent-based model is proposed based upon a new technique termed scalar field method (SFM). The new method draws on an analogy to a charged particle in an electromagnetic field. In the new model, virtual potential energies (VPEs), that can be made to represent both human will and social relationships, simulate the interactions that occur between an agent and its surrounding entities. Each agent has stochastic characteristics, is independent, and makes autonomous decisions regarding behavior by minimizing the VPE. The proposed model supersedes the pattern-based format of many current ones and provides the potential for greater emergence and variability. Preliminary tests show the ability of the new model to mimic reasonable evacuation behavior, and its potential for exploring the significance of social relationships during egress.","Fang, J.",0,10.1061/(asce)cp.1943-5487.0000532,604
1651,Anthropomorphising driver-truck interaction: a study on the current state of research and the introduction of two innovative concepts,"The general role of personal assistants in form of anthropomorphised conversational, virtual or robotic agents in cars is subject to research since a few years and the first results indicate numerous positive effects of these anthropomorphised interfaces. However, no comprehensive review of the conducted studies has been comprised yet. Furthermore, existing studies on the effect of anthropomorphism mainly focus on passenger cars. This article provides a comprehensive review and summary of the conducted studies and investigates the applicability to commercial transportation, in particular to anthropomorphised interaction between truck driver and truck. In the first part of the article, a literature review describes the details, aspects and various forms of anthropomorphism as well as its observed positives effects. The review focusses on studies referring to anthropomorphism in passenger cars, complemented by relevant research results from non-automotive disciplines. The second part of this article aims to derive innovative and applicable concepts for the anthropomorphised driver-truck interfaces using the Design-Thinking approach: building on a comprehensive literature review to identify user needs and problems, an interdisciplinary expert workshop developed the two first anthropomorphised driver-truck interaction concepts. The paper finishes with carving out the differences between anthropomorphised car-driver and truck-driver interaction. The next step of research will then be the implementation of the developed interaction concepts in a first prototype followed by the respective user evaluation.","Fank, J.",0,10.1007/s12193-019-00296-w,605
1654,,"The future energy grid is expected to operate in a decentralized fashion as a network of autonomous microgrids that are coordinated by a Distribution System Operator (DSO), which should allocate energy to them in an efficient manner. Each microgrid operating in either islanded or grid-connected mode may be considered to manage its own resources. This can take place through auctions with individual units of the microgrid as the agents. This research proposes efficient auction mechanisms for the energy grid, with is-landed and connected microgrids. The microgrid level auction is carried out by means of an intermediate agent called an aggregator. The individual consumer and producer units are modeled as selfish agents. With the microgrid in islanded mode, two aggregator-level auction classes are analyzed: (i) price-heterogeneous, and (ii) price homogeneous. Under the price heterogeneity paradigm, this research extends earlier work on the well-known, single-sided Kelly mechanism to double auctions. As in Kelly auctions, the proposed algorithm implements the bidding without using any agent level private infor-mation (i.e. generation capacity and utility functions). The proposed auction is shown to be an efficient mechanism that maximizes the social welfare, i.e. the sum of the utilities of all the agents. Furthermore, the research considers the situation where a subset of agents act as a coalition to redistribute the allocated energy and price using any other specific fairness criterion. The price homogeneous double auction algorithm proposed in this research ad-dresses the problem of price-anticipation, where each agent tries to influence the equilibri-um price of energy by placing strategic bids. As a result of this behavior, the auction’s efficiency is lowered. This research proposes a novel approach that is implemented by the aggregator, called virtual bidding, where the efficiency can be asymptotically maximized, even in the presence of price anticipatory bidders. Next, an auction mechanism for the energy grid, with multiple connected mi-crogrids is considered. A globally efficient bi-level auction algorithm is proposed. At the upper-level, the algorithm takes into account physical grid constraints in allocating energy to the microgrids. It is implemented by the DSO as a linear objective quadratic constraint problem that allows price heterogeneity across the aggregators. In parallel, each aggrega-tor implements its own lower-level price homogeneous auction with virtual bidding. The research concludes with a preliminary study on extending the DSO level auc-tion to multi-period day-ahead scheduling. It takes into account storage units and conven-tional generators that are present in the grid by formulating the auction as a mixed inte-ger linear programming problem.","Faqiry, Mohammad Nazif",0,,606

1658,A survey of personality and learning styles models applied in virtual environments with emphasis on e-learning environments,"Today, one of the most important and challenging issues in artificial intelligence is modeling human behavior in virtual environments. Furthermore, studying e-learning environments is in great demand in computer science which requires understanding human behaviors. Thus, considering human behavior factors, such as personality, mood, and emotion, and modeling them in e-learning environments is a challenging issue in artificial intelligence. The purpose of this paper is to review the psychological models of personality used in computer science. In addition, the most important applications of personality models and their direct related topics in learning, i.e. learning style issues in e-learning environments, are presented. The study shows that researchers tend to use models that are simple to implement in virtual world and are as comprehensive as possible to cover all the features of human behavior. Finally, we concluded that models such as the Five Factor Model, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality model, and Felder-Silverman learning styles model have the two most important features, which are simplicity and comprehensiveness. These two features have made these psychology models the most favorable in the virtual world.","Fatahi, S.",0,10.1007/s10462-016-9469-7,608

Second, we want to use simulation of virtual agents to artificially generate movements of people in similar situations and validate them using real video sequences. Our main goal is to be able to extract from video sequences and then simulate variations in populations in a coherent way with literature that studies cultural aspects. In addition to the cultural aspects, we also investigate the personality model in the studied videos using OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Finally, we propose a way to simulate the fundamental diagram experiment from other countries using the OCEAN psychological trait model as input.

1666,,"This thesis is a theoretical-empirical study that investigates the consequences and implications of adopting locative media technologies in everyday situations, paying particular attention to the potential strengthening of relationships between locative media and spatial practices of architecture and urban studies. Locative Media is a type of media technology that relates information to location/place, provides sites and occasions for the development of new forms of environmental knowing, spatial and cultural understandings, and arguably constructs new spatial relations with place, place-experience and sense of place. Although there is a vast literature on the socio-spatial and cultural implications of media technologies, social media, social networking sites and other applications accessed through the Internet, there are limited numbers of studies that explore the shift in the ways we understand and relate to virtual materials/information following the emergence of location- based technology, and how those technologies might affect the conventional ways we develop relationships/associations with location/places, or perceive places, or understand spatiality. Tracing the emergence of locative media and the new implications of map/representation, the thesis takes locative media as the subject under scrutiny and investigates the assemblage and interrelationships of the three main ingredients of place/locative media/ agent. The interrelationship of those three ingredients and the social and behavioural norms of using Locative media in real time is explored through an empirical lens using two case studies (individuals using Foursquare/Streetmuseum applications), where three main categories of locative media applications (urban annotation/tagging applications, user-generated maps and social networking applications) are explored. The findings of empirical studies, and issues regarding implications of locative media, are then categorized into thematic chapters: locative media and Image of place, Place-making potentials of new media technologies, locative media and alternative flexible forms of sociability, and finally possibilities of relational place- understanding: In-group experiences. Since the field of locative media is very new, theories and ways of discussing related phenomenon are not yet strongly developed: thus whilst examining existing cases empirically, this thesis also contributes to on-going theoretical discourses regarding place-understanding after new media technologies (tracking the change in place-understanding), and the interconnected issues of spatiality resulting from mediation, embodiment, mobility, technology, and community. Therefore the findings of the empirical studies feed into the process of developing related theories, and construct an argument that locative media could be considered as both Transcendental Technologies (technologies that transcend spatiality, geography and territory) and Socio-Formative Spheres (technologies that form socio-spatial interactions) based on the frames of observation. It also provides an insight into the possible ways that new media technologies can be applied as tools or mediums for architects and urban planners to rewrite the city, to communicate with communities of users, or to adopt those media platforms as site analysis mediums, tools for collecting and sharing site-related information in new, practical ways.","Fazel, Maryam",0,,610
1667,,"This dissertation explores aspects of the Late Antique and Early Medieval periods in the eastern Alpine and northern Adriatic region of Central Europe by integrating archaeological, anthropological, and historical approaches to the past. The themes of technology, identity, and temporality crosscut the three major parts of the thesis: (1) examining continuity and change from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages (c. AD 300 – 900), (2) exploring the complex interplay of social identity, material culture, and embodied practice, and (3) considering the role of the medieval past in contemporary political and historical ideologies. Part One investigates aspects of historical change and continuity in the centuries following the collapse of Roman political authority in Central Europe. These patterns are examined at both the regional and local levels through a variety of archaeological methods. Chapter 2 outlines the historical and archaeological frameworks, assessing aspects of continuity in this region (settlement, demographic, social, etc.), along with processes of 'culture contact' and Christianization. Chapter 3 addresses the question of continuity versus change from the perspective of ceramic technology, utilizing macroscopic and microscopic analyses to examine the manufacture of pottery at four settlements in this region that bridge the Late Antique – Early Medieval transition. Results from the petrographic investigation indicate that coarse-ware ceramics exhibit a high degree of compositional variability across the southeastern Alpine and northern Adriatic region. Chapter 4 constitutes a scalar shift in the examination of change and continuity, providing greater temporal depth in a more localized geographical region. Past human landscapes were reconstructed along sections of the middle Mura river valley in southeastern Austria using a battery of interdisciplinary methods (pedestrian surface collection, soil chemical sampling, and documentary research). The results from the surveys suggest that major demographic changes occurred during the Early Iron Age and High/Late Middle Ages, with comparatively little surviving material traces from Roman and Early Medieval periods. The landscape reconstruction also revealed important long term spatial patterns in terms of settlement, land-use, and human activity beyond individual sites. Part Two situates the historical and archaeological issues outlined in the previous chapters within a broader theoretical framework that considers the relationship between social identity, embodied practice, and material culture. Chapter 5 provides a brief history of anthropological and archaeological conceptualizations of this complex relationship, from the 19th century through current approaches, focusing on the 'materiality' perspectives that have recently gained favor across the social sciences. Chapter 6 builds upon these emerging perspectives by sketching the possibilities for a 'monstrous archaeology', which combines elements of materiality, relational ontology, and complexity theory. It reveals how traditional means of exploring the agent/ structure paradox rely on a problematic understanding of human society and culture that is ultimately divorced from the material world; a more 'symmetrical' approach is forwarded that blurs the ontological divide between humans and nonhumans. Finally, Chapter 7 provides an empirical case study for this new approach, through a detailed investigation of 'barbarian ethnicity' in early medieval history and archaeology. The ceramic data presented in Chapter 3 is revisited in order to examine aspects of technological choice through the chaîne opératoire perspective. Embodied practice, which mediates the co-construction of people and things, is argued to be a more sophisticated alternative to traditional 'ethnic' interpretations of early medieval social identity. Finally, Part Three is comprised of three chapters, each of which explores aspects of the 'power of the past' along thematic axes of social identity, colonialism, and temporality.","Fazioli, Kirk Patrick",0,,611
1668,Mixed Agents Virtual Observation Lenses for Immersive Learning Environments,"3-D virtual worlds and other immersive environments offer features that other learning systems cannot easily replicate. As such, they have the potential to revolutionise the way in which people learn. They are well suited to visualise 3-D objects and their relations to explain complex phenomena. In addition, they enable practical experiments to be performed that are difficult to conduct in the real world. They can also help to facilitate collaborative learning in real-time and enable students to become fully engaged in what they are doing. However, these environments require further exploration to improve their learning affordances. For instance, assessmg students' performance and collecting learning evidence is still in its early stages. This paper is primarily devoted to furthering our understanding of observation and assessment. In so doing, a virtual observation model has been developed to effectively map classroom-based observations with how people can be evaluated in virtual 3-D environments. The observation model has been applied to a multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) and examples that illustrate its potential effectiveness are provided. In essence, our research aims to support and enhance the learning experience by demonstrating the advantages of 3-D virtual worlds as a means for advancing learning processes.","Felemban, S.",0,,612
1672,Development of a Complex Intervention to Improve Adherence to Antidiabetic Medication in Older People Using an Anthropomorphic Virtual Assistant Software,"Introduction: Improving adherence to antidiabetic medication is crucial, resulting in improved health outcomes, cost reduction, and minimization of waste. A lack of underlying theory in existing interventions may explain the limited success in sustaining behavior change. This paper describes the development of a theory and evidence-based complex intervention to improve adherence to oral antidiabetics in older people via a software prototype with an anthropomorphic virtual assistant. Methods: The Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) was used to develop a theoretical understanding of the change process, corresponding to the first phase of the Medical Research Council Framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions. At the BCW core is a model of human behavior (COM-B), which posits that human behavior (B) results from the interaction between capabilities (C), opportunities (0), and motivation (M). Literature-derived medication adherence determinants were mapped onto COM-B components. Then, intervention functions (IFs) were selected employing the APEASE criteria. Finally, standardized behavior change techniques (BCTs) were chosen based on their suitability and their effectiveness on medication adherence trials. The prototype was developed for android devices; its core was implemented in Unity3D, using a female 3D virtual assistant, named Vitoria. Results: Two COM-B components were identified as main targets for behavior change-psychological capability and reflective motivation; these were linked with four IFs- education, persuasion, enablement, and environmental restructuring. Eleven BCTs were, in turn, linked with the IFs. An example of a BCT is ""problem solving""; it requires users to pinpoint factors influencing non-adherence and subsequently offers strategies to achieve the desired behavior. BCTs were operationalized into the dialogues with Vitoria and into supplementary software features. Vitoria communicates with users verbally and non-verbally, expressing emotions. Input options consist of buttons or recording values, such as medication taken. Conclusion: The present approach enabled us to derive the most appropriate BCTs for our intervention. The use of an explicit bundle of BCTs, often overlooked in interventions promoting medication adherence, is expected to maximize effectiveness and facilitates replication. The first prototype is being refined with users and health professionals' contributions. Future work includes subjecting the prototype to usability tests and a feasibility trial.","Felix, I.

1681,Meeting others virtually in a day-to-day setting: Investigating social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars and agents,"Given the increasing use of virtual characters, research is challenged to gain sufficient knowledge on the effects they may have on human cognitions, emotions and behaviors. Thus, this study set out to examine social avoidance tendencies and prosocial behaviors towards human controlled (avatars) and computer controlled entities (agents). A total of N = 95 healthy young adults were randomly assigned to an avatar or agent condition. Participants were exposed to a virtual stranger asking to sit at the table (prosocial behavior) as well as a virtual waiter handing over the false drink (social avoidance). Empathy, interaction anxiety, social and physical presence as well as subjective stress levels were assessed to control for confounding influences. Empathy emerged as a significant predictor of prosocial behavior. Social avoidance, in turn, was not predicted by any of the included variables. Also, there was no effect of agency on social presence, physical presence, social interaction anxiety and stress. Yet, participants showed significantly more social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars. These seemingly contradictory results may be explained by an extension of prior theories: While intuitive responses (e.g., stress) follow the Media Equation Concept (Nass & Moon, 2000), more complex processes (e.g., empathy) may modulate agency dependent responses.

1687,Cyber Buddy Is Better than No Buddy: A Test of the Kohler Motivation Effect in Exergames,"Objective: Although exergames are popular, few people take advantage of the potential of group dynamics to motivate play (and achieve associated health benefits). One motivation gain phenomenon has shown promise for motivating greater effort in partnered exergames: The Kohler effect (working at a task with a more capable partner where one's performance is indispensable to the group). This article examines whether a Kohler effect can be demonstrated in an exergame by exercising with a moderately superior humanoid, software-generated partner. Materials and Methods: Male and female (n = 120; mean age, 19.41 years) college students completed a series of plank exercises using ""CyBuddy Exercise,'' a program developed specifically for this study. In a lab in an academic building, participants completed the exercises individually and, after a rest, were randomly assigned to complete the same exercises again, but with a ""live'' human partner (HP) presented virtually, a nearly-human-like, humanoid partner (NHP), a hardly human-like, software-generated partner (HHP), or a no-partner control condition (IC), with equal numbers in each group (i.e., n = 30). Exercise persistence, perceived exertion, self-efficacy beliefs, enjoyment, and intentions to exercise were recorded and analyzed. Results: A 4x2 analysis of variance on the (Block 2 - Block 1) difference scores showed that a significant Kohler motivation gain was observed in all partner conditions (compared with IC), but persistence was significantly greater with HPs than with either NHP or HHP humanoid partners (P < 0.05). By the conclusion of the study, there were no significant differences among the partnered conditions in perceived exertion, self-efficacy, enjoyment, or future intentions to exercise. Conclusions: These results suggest that a software-generated partner can elicit the Kohler motivation gain in exergames, but not as strongly as a partner who is thought to be human.","Feltz, D.

Although KRAS proteins are difficult to be targeted, most KRAS effectors are kinases which are readily druggable targets. We previously conducted a kinome-wide RNAi screening to identify kinases regulating the proliferation of KRAS mutant PDAC cells. Our screening demonstrated that knockdown of Serine/Threonine Kinase 32B (STK32B) selectively inhibited the proliferation of PDAC cells with mutant KRAS, but not wildtype KRAS. Here, we aimed to further explore the functions of STK32B in PDAC and lay the foundations for development of novel therapeutics. Methods: We profiled STK32B expression in PDAC cell lines and clinical samples by Western Blotting and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. We knocked-out STK23B in PDAC cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and studied its effect on cell proliferation by MTT assay, colony formation ability by colony formation assay and cell transformation ability by soft agar assay. To delineate the transcriptional regulation of STK32B, PDAC cells were treated with inhibitors targeting several downstream pathways of KRAS. To study the kinase-specific functions of STK32B, we first predicted the interacting proteins of STK32B by searching protein-protein interaction network. We identified the post-translational modifications of STK32B by searching PhosphoSitePlus database. We prepared site-specific antibody targeting p-STK32B to validate the modifications by Co-IP experiment and Western Blotting. We uncovered the target genes of STK32B by quantitative proteomic analysis in SW1990 cells with STK32B knockdown. We intratumorally injected siRNA targeting STK32B to validate the druggability of STK32B in PDAC xenograft mouse model. Results: STK32B was selectively expressed in KRAS mutant PDAC cells. The expression of STK32B was significantly higher in PDAC tumor tissues compared to paired adjacent non-tumor tissues (p=0.0061). Knockout of STK32B dramatically inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation rate and cell transformation ability in KRAS mutant cells. Overexpression of STK32B in BXPC3 cells with wild-type KRAS significantly increased cell proliferation, colony formation rate, and cell transformation ability. Knockdown of KRAS reduced the expression of STK32B. MAPK/ERK pathway inhibitors significantly suppressed the expression of STK32B, meanwhile SP1 inhibitor and siRNA targeting SP1 inhibited STK32B expression. ChIP assay showed p-SP1 was enriched at STK32B promoter region. These results suggested that STK32B expression was regulated by the KRAS/MAPK/SP1 axis. Quantitative proteomic analysis suggested that IPO7 and TLN1 as the target genes regulated by STK32B. Our results demonstrated that mTOR was an interacting protein of STK32B through phosphorylating the 378th Serine of STK32B. Correlation analysis showed TLN1 and IPO7 had a better correlation with p-STK32B than total STK32B, suggesting p-STK32B was played a more important role in regulating IPO7 and TLN1 expression. Intratumoral injection of siSTK32B selectively inhibited the KRAS mutant xenograft tumor growth. Lastly, a structure-based virtual screening identified potential inhibitors targeting STK32B. Conclusions: STK32B was an oncogenic kinase regulating cancerous properties in PDAC. STK32B expression was regulated by oncogenic KRAS, while mTOR regulated the activity of STK32B. Our findings suggested the potential therapeutic implications against KRAS mutant cancers via targeting STK32B.","Feng, Huiyi",0,,616
1692,,"This dissertation investigated the effects of text position (i.e. the position that the author of the text who argues in support of a controversial issue), agent roles (tutor versus student), and agent speech acts on source monitoring and how these factors impact memory for information in a learning environment with conversational agents. Previous research on learning from text with conversational agents has supported the claim that agent disagreements stimulate a state of cognitive disequilibrium and confusion in the participants, which leads to deep learning when resolved. Source monitoring is one plausible strategy to resolve conflict engendered from cognitive disequilibrium. This dissertation combines two lines of research (i.e., cognitive disequilibrium and source monitoring) to investigate the interacting effects of agent disagreements with each other, with the texts on controversial topics, and with the participants’ personal positions on topics. Participants read texts that had either a pro or con position regarding a controversial topic while listening to a concurrent disagreeing or agreeing discussion between a teacher and student agent regarding the text. The results showed that participants’ prior belief was the biggest predictor of memory for text overall. In addition, when participants reported a strong stance regarding supporting or not supporting a topic, the agent disagreement did not affect their discriminatory memory for atypical information. On the other hand, when participants reported a neutral stance regarding supporting or not supporting a topic, the agent disagreements assisted the participants in discriminating the surface structure of the text (i.e., the wording and syntax) as well as their summarization. Source memory was not shown to be a mediating factor for learning during cognitive disequilibrium, whereas the nature of the topics had a large mediating factor for all memory measures. The results were discussed in the context of memory models that make predictions on how incongruence with prior beliefs and messages from texts and agents affects recognition and recall differently.","Feng, Shi",0,,617
1693,The uncanny valley effect in typically developing children and its absence in children with autism spectrum disorders,"Robots and virtual reality are gaining popularity in the intervention of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To shed light on children's attitudes towards robots and characters in virtual reality, this study aims to examine whether children with ASD show the uncanny valley effect. We varied the realism of facial appearance by morphing a cartoon face into a human face, and induced perceptual mismatch by enlarging the eyes, which has previously been shown as an effective method to induce the uncanny valley effect in adults. Children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children participated in a two-alternative forced choice task that asked them to choose one they liked more from the two images presented on the screen. We found that TD children showed the effect, i.e., the enlargement of eye size and the approaching realism reduced their preference. In contrast, children with ASD did not show the uncanny valley effect. Our findings in TD children help resolve the controversy in the literature about the existence of the uncanny valley effect among young children. Meanwhile, the absence of the uncanny valley effect in children with ASD might be attributed to their reduced sensitivity to subtle changes of face features and their limited visual experience to faces caused by diminished social motivation. Last, our findings provide practical implications for designing robots and virtual characters for the intervention of children with ASD.","Feng, S. Y.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0206343,618
1700,,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder primarily characterised by chronic infection and inflammation within the lungs. Serine proteases, in particular trypsin-Ilke serine proteases are associated with dehydration of the airways through proteolytiC activation of the Epithelial Sodium Channel (ENaC), leading to a reduction in mucociliary clearance and colonisation of the airways. The development of novel inhibitors and activity-based probes (ABPs) targeting these proteases was hypothesised as potential therapeutic agents and research tools to allow further insights into the disease mechanism. Novel decarboxylated substrate mimetics were designed and synthesised as potential reversible inhibitors of these Channel Activating Proteases (CAPs). This led to the development of a 4-amidinobenzylamine based compound which exhibited selective inhibition of matriptase and trypsin whilst displaying limited effects on other CAPs. An additional approach undertaken was the screen of a fragment library, previously identified through virtual screening as potential inhibitors of prostasin. This approach identified a 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine analogue as a potential lead compound for the development of novel prostasin inhibitors. In the development of novel chemical tools for the detection and characterisation of novel CAPs, a library of broad-spectrum probes featuring a diphenyl ɑ-aminoalkylphosphonate moiety was synthesised. These compounds displayed potent irreversible inhibition with limited cross-reactivity and enabled successful detection of serine proteases utilising 'click-chemistry' techniques. In addition to the application of diphenyl ɑ-aminoalkylphosphonate ABPs, a novel class of irreversible protease inhibitor utilising N-alkyl glycine residues was developed. Consequently, a range of irreversible serine protease inhibitors and activity-based probes were synthesised displaying both broad-spectrum and more specific inhibitory properties. Promisingly, such compounds have displayed similar or improved inhibitory potency in comparison to their diphenyl ɑ-aminoalkylphosphonate counterparts. These compounds have also been applied successfully within Activity-Based ELlSA systems for the quantification of active serine protease. In conclusion, the development of these novel ABPs will aid future research into the proteolytic activation of ENaC and furthermore will allow insight into protease involvement within other disease states and may enable the quantification of protease biomarkers for use within both research and the clinic.","Ferguson, Timothy Edward Gordon",0,,619
1701,Blurring Human-Machine Distinctions: Anthropomorphic Appearance in Social Robots as a Threat to Human Distinctiveness,"The present research aims at gaining a better insight on the psychological barriers to the introduction of social robots in society at large. Based on social psychological research on intergroup distinctiveness, we suggested that concerns toward this technology are related to how we define and defend our human identity. A threat to distinctiveness hypothesis was advanced. We predicted that too much perceived similarity between social robots and humans triggers concerns about the negative impact of this technology on humans, as a group, and their identity more generally because similarity blurs category boundaries, undermining human uniqueness. Focusing on the appearance of robots, in two studies we tested the validity of this hypothesis. In both studies, participants were presented with pictures of three types of robots that differed in their anthropomorphic appearance varying from no resemblance to humans (mechanical robots), to some body shape resemblance (biped humanoids) to a perfect copy of human body (androids). Androids raised the highest concerns for the potential damage to humans, followed by humanoids and then mechanical robots. In Study 1, we further demonstrated that robot anthropomorphic appearance (and not the attribution of mind and human nature) was responsible for the perceived damage that the robot could cause. In Study 2, we gained a clearer insight in the processes underlying this effect by showing that androids were also judged as most threatening to the human-robot distinction and that this perception was responsible for the higher perceived damage to humans. Implications of these findings for social robotics are discussed.","Ferrari, F.",0,10.1007/s12369-016-0338-y,620
1704,"Slot Machine Gambling and Testosterone: Evidence for a ""Winner-Loser"" Effect?","The ""winner-loser effect"" refers to a phenomenon in testosterone research where the outcome of a social competition induces increases (wins) and/or decreases (losses) in testosterone levels. Here, we sought to test to what extent changes in testosterone occur in response to gambling behavior. More specifically, we hypothesized that the winner-loser effect would extend to slot machine gambling as a solitary (noncompetitive) gambling activity in players who ""anthropomorphized"" the slot machine, thus treating the machine as a human opponent. Male participants (n = 113) were recruited into a quasi-experimental design involving 15 min of authentic slot machine gambling, incentivized by a $10 cash bonus for participants who finished in profit. In addition to salivary measures of testosterone, salivary cortisol and self-reported anthropomorphization of the slot machine were tested as potential moderators. Contrary to predictions, winning and losing slot machine sessions did not exert significant differential effects on testosterone, and this pattern was not moderated by cortisol levels or slot machine anthropomorphization. Exploratory analyses tested relationships between subjective gambling experiences in the sessions and testosterone change. Higher positive affect and flow predicted greater testosterone declines from pre- to postgambling. The testosterone results add to a growing literature on the boundary conditions of the winner-loser effect and inform future studies on testosterone reactivity in relation to gambling and disordered gambling. The tendency to anthropomorphize slot machines is a neglected cognitive distortion in gambling that merits further study.","Ferrari, M. A.",0,10.1037/adb0000425,621
1708,,"In Brazil from 1932 to 1945, Heitor Villa-Lobos, considered the most important Brazilian composer of all time, participated in the authoritarian regime of Getúlio Vargas as music educator and as what could be construed as an indoctrinator of the regime’s ideologies. Villa-Lobos implemented a program of music education in public schools that sought to promote discipline among children while socializing them in the school environment and educating them about aspects of the ethnic and sociocultural formation of Brazilian people and the “spirit” of Brazilian people, the so-called brasilidade (Brazilian-ness). Villa-Lobos had sketched his program of music education in the 1920s with ostensibly pure educational intentions, but Vargas appropriated Villa-Lobos’s program and used it as a tool to homogenize the government’s nationalistic ideologies among children (and consequently their families). Villa-Lobos’s method of music education was Orpheonic Chant, which Guillaume Louis Bocquillon Wilhem elaborated in France in the 1820s and João Gomes Júnior implemented in Brazil in 1912. When Villa-Lobos became the director of music education of Vargas’s regime, Orpheonic Chant was used throughout the state of São Paulo, where Gomes Júnior implemented it. Despite Villa-Lobos adoption of the methodologies of Orpheonic Chant that music educators had established before him, he imposed much stronger nationalistic and patriotic orientations in his pedagogical approaches and increasingly aligned the directives of his Orpheonic Chant with the nationalistic and patriotic politics of the government. Villa-Lobos worked mostly in the city of Rio de Janeiro (then the capital of Brazil), where Vargas made Orpheonic Chant mandatory in 1931. In 1932 Villa-Lobos organized the Teacher’s Orpheon (Orpheão de Professores ), a group of 250 teachers of Orpheonic Chant who performed concerts with civic, artistic, and patriotic purposes; and in 1933, musicians in Rio who sympathized with Villa-Lobos’s quest for music education organized the Orquestra Villa-Lobos and chose Villa-Lobos as its conductor. Like the Teacher’s Orpheon, the Orquestra Villa-Lobos also performed concerts with nationalistic, patriotic, and educational purposes. Additionally, Villa-Lobos regularly conducted the Municipal Orchestra of Rio de Janeiro in concerts of nationalistic and patriotic content. Consequently, Villa-Lobos was accused of collaborating with the authoritarian government and of disseminating Vargas’s ideologies through music. Despite admitting art in general could be used as a tool for political propaganda, he regularly said he had no personal interest in the regime, asserting that all he sought was to instill discipline and love for music. While scholars have mostly speculated whether Villa-Lobos used Vargas to promote his career or Vargas used Villa-Lobos to disseminate the government’s ideologies, they tend to overlook the indoctrinating aspects of music education. My research demonstrates that regardless of his personal intentions, through Orpheonic Chant, Villa-Lobos consciously instilled Vargas’s nationalistic and patriotic ideologies in the minds of children. Through the Teacher’s Orpheon, the Municipal Orchestra of Rio de Janeiro, and the Orquestra Villa-Lobos, Villa-Lobos sought to extend this education to adults as well. In this sense, he created a complex system of music education that reached out to the population of Rio de Janeiro as a whole, and worked to create a national program of music education. Through analysis of extensive archival materials, most of which remain unpublished and had not been previously examined, I reevaluate the directives of Villa-Lobos’s system of music education and argue that he became an important agent of indoctrination for the government of Vargas irrespective of his personal political ideology. Drawing on the concept of “indexicality” from Thomas Turino’s theory of music semiotics and Benedict Anderson’s concept of “imagined communities,” I demonstrate that, thr","Ferraz, Gabriel Augusto",0,,622
1709,A hierarchical Bayesian framework for multimodal active perception,"In this article, we present a hierarchical Bayesian framework for multimodal active perception, devised to be emergent, scalable and adaptive. This framework, while not strictly neuromimetic, finds its roots in the role of the dorsal perceptual pathway of the human brain. Its composing models build upon a common spatial configuration that is naturally fitting for the integration of readings from multiple sensors using a Bayesian approach devised in previous work. The framework presented in this article is shown to adequately model human-like active perception behaviours, namely by exhibiting the following desirable properties: high-level behaviour results from low-level interaction of simpler building blocks; seamless integration of additional inputs is allowed by the Bayesian Programming formalism; initial 'genetic imprint' of distribution parameters may be changed 'on the fly' through parameter manipulation, thus allowing for the implementation of goal-dependent behaviours (i.e. top-down influences).","Ferreira, J.

1712,Learning emergent behaviours for a hierarchical Bayesian framework for active robotic perception,"In this research work, we contribute with a behaviour learning process for a hierarchical Bayesian framework for multimodal active perception, devised to be emergent, scalable and adaptive. This framework is composed by models built upon a common spatial configuration for encoding perception and action that is naturally fitting for the integration of readings from multiple sensors, using a Bayesian approach devised in previous work. The proposed learning process is shown to reproduce goal-dependent human-like active perception behaviours by learning model parameters (referred to as ""attentional sets"") for different free-viewing and active search tasks. Learning was performed by presenting several 3D audiovisual virtual scenarios using a head-mounted display, while logging the spatial distribution of fixations of the subject (in 2D, on left and right images, and in 3D space), data which are consequently used as the training set for the framework. As a consequence, the hierarchical Bayesian framework adequately implements high-level behaviour resulting from low-level interaction of simpler building blocks by using the attentional sets learned for each task, and is able to change these attentional sets ""on the fly,"" allowing the implementation of goal-dependent behaviours (i.e., top-down influences).","Ferreira, J.

1715,"Stimulus-category competition, inhibition, and affective devaluation: a novel account of the uncanny valley","Stimuli that resemble humans, but are not perfectly human-like, are disliked compared to distinctly human and non human stimuli. Accounts of this ""Uncanny Valley"" effect often focus on how changes in human resemblance can evoke different emotional responses. We present an alternate account based on the novel hypothesis that the Uncanny Valley is not directly related to 'human-likeness' per se, but instead reflects a more general form of stimulus devaluation that occurs when inhibition is triggered to resolve conflict between competing stimulus-related representations. We consider existing support for this inhibitory-devaluation hypothesis and further assess its feasibility through tests of two corresponding predictions that arise from the link between conflict resolving inhibition and aversive response: (1) that the pronounced disliking of Uncanny-type stimuli will occur for any image that strongly activates multiple competing stimulus representations, even in the absence of any human-likeness, and (2) that the negative peak of an 'Uncanny Valley' should occur at the point of greatest stimulus-related conflict and not (in the presence of human-likeness) always closer to the 'human' end of a perceptual continuum. We measured affective responses to a set of line drawings representing non-human animal animal morphs, in which each continuum midpoint was a bistable image (Experiment 1), as well as to sets of human robot and human-animal computer-generated morphs (Experiment 2). Affective trends depicting classic Uncanny Valley functions occurred for all continua, including the non-human stimuli. Images at continua midpoints elicited significantly more negative affect than images at endpoints, even when the continua included a human endpoint. This illustrates the feasibility of the inhibitory-devaluation hypothesis and the need for further research into the possibility that the strong dislike of Uncanny-type stimuli reflects the negative affective consequences of cognitive inhibition.","Ferrey, A.

1718,Social scaling of extrapersonal space: Target objects are judged as closer when the reference frame is a human agent with available movement potentialities,"Space perception depends on our motion potentialities and our intended actions are affected by space perception. Research on peripersonal space (the space in reaching distance) shows that we perceive an object as being closer when we (Witt, Proffitt, & Epstein, 2005; Witt & Proffitt, 2008) or another actor (Costantini, Ambrosini, Sinigaglia, & Gallese, 2011; Bloesch, Davoli, Roth, Brockmole, & Abrams, 2012) can interact with it. Similarly, an object only triggers specific movements when it is placed in our peripersonal space (Costantini, Ambrosini, Tieri, Sinigaglia, & Committeri, 2010) or in the other's peripersonal space (Costantini, Committeri, & Sinigaglia, 2011; Cardellicchio, Sinigaglia, & Costantini, 2013). Moreover, also the extrapersonal space (the space outside reaching distance) seems to be perceived in relation to our movement capabilities: the more effort it takes to cover a distance, the greater we perceive the distance to be (Proffitt, Stefanucci, Banton, & Epstein, 2003; Sugovic & Witt, 2013). However, not much is known about the influence of the other's movement potentialities on our extrapersonal space perception. Three experiments were carried out investigating the categorization of distance in extrapersonal space using human or non-human allocentric reference frames (RF). Subjects were asked to judge the distance (""Near"" or ""Far"") of a target object (a beach umbrella) placed at progressively increasing or decreasing distances until a change from near to far or vice versa was reported. In the first experiment we found a significant ""Near space extension"" when the allocentric RF was a human virtual agent instead of a static, inanimate object. In the second experiment we tested whether the ""Near space extension"" depended on the anatomical structure of the RF or its movement potentialities by adding a wooden dummy. The ""Near space extension"" was only observed for the human agent but not for the dummy. Finally, to rule out the possibility that the effect was simply due to a line-of-sight mechanism (visual perspective taking) we compared the human agent free to move with the same agent tied to a pole with a rope, thus reducing movement potentialities while maintaining equal visual accessibility. The ""Near space extension"" disappeared when this manipulation was introduced, showing that movement potentialities are the relevant factor for such an effect. Our results demonstrate for the first time that during allocentric distance judgments within extrapersonal space, we implicitly process the movement potentialities of the RF. A target object is perceived as being closer when the allocentric RF is a human with available movement potentialities, suggesting a mechanism of social scaling of extrapersonal space processing.

1721,,"This study examines how artists in the US reimagined aesthetic practice through performances of refusal from 1964 to 1975. Attending to the emergent genre of the lecture-performance, I analyze pedagogical projects that articulate dissent through interventions into existing models of knowledge, asking: what is to be learned from saying no? These projects respond, in part, to artists’ encounters with university training. They redefine artistic activity through critical engagements with the labor of the information worker, a figure sartorially invoked by the bespectacled uniform of a professorial archetype. Artists deployed the lecture format to imagine how knowledge might be assembled otherwise: within counter-institutional frameworks, beyond authorized discourse, through embodied tactics of performativity, and toward socially transformative ends. They did so at a moment when artists’ academicization proceeded as an explicitly gendered project that privileged masculine-coded cognitive labor over and against modes of work coded as feminized craft. Jettisoning these divisions, the lecture-performance situates knowledge in the specificity of embodied agents. In this way, lecture-performance renegotiates the discursive practices that regulate bodies of knowledge and knowledgeable bodies. Placing these developments in conversation with the agitational speech of artist activism, my study focuses on affiliates of the 1970 Art Strike Against Racism, Sexism, War, and Repression. It tracks forms of pedagogy and protest across a range of media beyond the lecture-performance, including video lectures, pamphlets, and photographic series by Robert Morris, Adrian Piper, Faith Ringgold, and Andy Warhol. Its case studies toggle between artworks, performative speech acts, and direct action, arguing for the porousness of their categorical boundaries in this period. Redressing the claim that artists’ strikes, protests, and boycotts foreclose possibilities for productive engagement, I route practices of refusal toward their generative, dialogic capacities. Charting the convergence of movements in art and activism from 1964 to 1975, this study asks what we have to learn from statements of refusal delivered at the interstices of academic lecterns, political podiums, and sites of artistic display.","Firunts, Mashinka",0,,627

They specifically explore how high school girls' mediated and embodied identities were translated, particularly as they engaged in participatory activist research by becoming co-meaning makers and co-interpreters during the research process. During the first phase of the study, data were collected from focus group interviews and descriptive field notes from observations. In the second phase, participants created their own activist-based project. Participants shed light on the social issues they encountered in high school and how these experiences influenced their embodied identities, which led them to develop Beautiful You and thus become agents of social change.","Fisette, J.

1724,"Your Robot Therapist Will See You Now: Ethical Implications of Embodied Artificial Intelligence in Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy","Background: Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from 'virtual psychotherapists' to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective: This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods: Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results: From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; 'gaps' in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions: We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.","Fiske, A.",0,10.2196/13216,629

Little is known about the exact computations that deep neural networks learn, and to what extent these computations are similar to the ones performed by the primate brain. Here, we investigate how color information is processed in the different layers of the AlexNet deep neural network, originally trained on object classification of over 1.2M images of objects in their natural contexts. We found that the color-responsive units in the first layer of AlexNet learned linear features and were broadly tuned to two directions in color space, analogously to what is known of color responsive cells in the primate thalamus. Moreover, these directions are decorrelated and lead to statistically efficient representations, similar to the cardinal directions of the second-stage color mechanisms in primates. We also found, in analogy to the early stages of the primate visual system, that chromatic and achromatic information were segregated in the early layers of the network. Units in the higher layers of AlexNet exhibit on average a lower responsivity for color than units at earlier stages. (c) 2018 Optical Society of America","Flachot, A.",0,10.1364/josaa.35.00b334,630
1729,,"Researchers and educators have always strived for creating appropriate instructional tools and resources that help students to acquire knowledge. Animated pedagogical agents (APAs) embedded within multimedia learning settings are one of the emerging technologies that provide a powerful and supportive learning environment. According to previous studies, APAs can effectively promote learning and support social interaction with learners (Johnson & Lester, 2016; Lane, 2016). However, APAs also may cause cognitive load without providing motivational benefits in some cases and distract learners during the learning process. In other words, the results of previous studies on APAs do not provide enough evidence to argue that APA may be able to decrease cognitive load, promote motivational effects, or facilitate meaningful learning. The lack of enough evidence in the research findings seems to be variable depending upon the APA’s features, the learners, and the difficulty of the learning materials (Schroeder & Adesope, 2014). By focusing on these factors, this study provided new considerations related to embedding an APA’s role that facilitates “Word Parts” for adult students who speak English as a Second Language (ESL) with concentrating on their cognition, motivation, and vocabulary acquisition. Presenting two APA’s roles (expert model and peer model) differently influenced ESL learners’ motivation, specifically their satisfaction feelings. In addition, ESL learners’ prior knowledge affected their intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load, motivation, and vocabulary acquisition. The two different APA’s roles and their effects on ESL learners’ perceptions and learning outcomes serve as a media comparison research. Further, examining APA as a model to teach ESL students vocabulary acquisition skills serves a Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) research.","Flemban, Fadwa Yasin",1,,631
1730,,"Context: Visualization as a multi-modal process is widely explored in curriculum studies. I examined a facet of how people learn to participate in visualization practices that remains under-studied in preschool and post-secondary settings: moment-to-moment agency while in unfamiliar socio-cultural realms. I conducted a thirteen-month ethnography of a research university’s Image Lab (IL) and studied how people critically appropriated ways of seeing and making images so as to manipulate perceived subject positions and become agents in the IL’s visualization practices. My fieldwork focused on DrawBridge, a graduate course hosted by the IL and instructed by the lab’s director. For two semesters, graduate students split their time between the IL and a preschool classroom in one of three university early childhood centers to explore shared inquiry through pre-planned, improvised, and spontaneous drawing and storytelling activities. In DrawBridge, preschoolers were positioned as a certain kind of image-maker who expertly modeled drawing practices the instructor taught in the course. They were natural story-tellers who drew without aloofness and in ways that mimicked how they play and pretend. Theory: My research draws upon Holland and colleagues’ (1998) notion of figured worlds, or the socially and culturally constructed realm of interpretation whereby a person’s sense of themselves as an agent emerges in particular events. Both the IL and childhood are multi-sensory and enacted cultural spaces with specific rules and rituals about ways of seeing and making images. My ethnography focused on two aspects of figured worlds: 1) cultural artifacts, or verbal, gestural, and material productions (p. 17); and 2) improvisation, or deliberate acts that manipulate perceived positions in social interactions that might be unfamiliar or undesirable (pp. 15-18). Research Question and Methods: I broadly examined the question: How do graduate students, preschoolers, the instructor and I become agents in DrawBridge’s visualization practices? My ethnographic methods featured comics making processes to generate, analyze, and represent data. Comics making is a way to navigate in-print constraints of sharing work with academic audiences. Integrated knowledge of multi-sensory experience was a significant part of my fieldwork experience. I made comics to translate my multimodal and multi-sensory data using a process that complements yet, remains distinct from text-based approaches to qualitative research. Data collection also featured the production of cultural artifacts (such as graduate students and preschoolers' hand-made pictures), participant interviews with graduate students, co-drawing activities with preschoolers and graduate students, and fieldnotes. I analyzed data using a comics-informed inductive coding process whereby emergent themes were expounded upon via drawing, writing, and making comics. Findings: Research participants became agents of the visualization practices in DrawBridge by critically appropriating cultural artifacts and improvising their perceived subject positions. Cultural artifacts, such as graduate students’ and preschoolers’ hand-made pictures, mediated access to children’s ways of seeing and making images. Drawing a picture in the IL calibrated to a cartoonist’s–namely the instructor–ways of seeing and making images.

1731,Measuring disability: The agency of an attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnostic questionnaire,"Scholars in language and social interaction have long been concerned with the role of texts in institutional settings, studying, for example, how interview schedules actively shape conversational dynamics between participants. While texts have been acknowledged as active in this way, their generative capacity remains largely overlooked. This article argues that like human subjects, texts in interaction enact agency. One text in particular, a screening form used to diagnose the learning disability attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is analyzed to claim that this text brings about the very condition it is designed to measure: a learning disability. Drawing from work in discursive psychology, I show how the measurement requires the client to adopt certain speaking positions, which then enables the text to speak for the client. I also demonstrate how the text constructs otherwise normal behavior as pathological through punctuation and nominalization. Finally, I illustrate how the spatial organization of the text constrains clients' choices for interacting with it. This article claims that texts produce, rather than reflect, cognitive phenomena, and it moreover encourages that the notion of text as agent be taken seriously, especially when it presents the capacity to disable.","Forbes, S.",0,10.1177/1461445614557759,633
1732,,"The rise in drug resistance coupled with the virtual halt in the antibacterial drug pipeline has lead once highly treatable bacterial infections back to the brink of epidemic levels. The need for novel antibiotic agents is urgent. An important route for the discovery of novel therapeutics continues to be the screening of microbial natural products. However, the discovery rate of novel molecules from terrestrial and near-shore environments is decreasing. Turning to largely unexplored habitats is a necessary direction for the search of novel biological and chemical diversity. One of the greatest resources yet to be explored is the microbial life in the deep subsurface ocean sediments. The overall aim of this dissertation is to better understand the biogeography and community structure of deep subseafloor microorganisms to accelerate the discovery of novel diversity and bioactive natural products. Culture-independent and culture-dependent strategies were used to investigate the microbial biodiversity and biomedical potential of deep subseafloor sediments from two unique environments. The opening study reported in chapter two represents the first investigation of the microbial diversity in the deep subsurface sediments underlying the ice-covered central Arctic Ocean. Sediment samples were collected during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Arctic Coring Expedition (Expedition 302). The drill site was located ∼250 km from the North Pole on the Lomonosov Ridge in a water depth of 1209 m. Culture-independent methods were used to characterize the bacterial and archaeal communities in the three geochemical environments (an upper ammonium oxidation zone, a carbonate dissolution zone and a deep sulfate reduction zone) identified in the 428 m sediment stack. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were successfully amplified from each of the biogeochemical zones, while archaea was only amplified from the deep sulfate reduction zone. The microbial communities at each zone are phylogenetically distinct and are most closely related to those from other similar deep subsurface environments. The second study, presented in chapter three, on microbial communities in the deep subsurface focuses on the biodiversity of actinomycete, especially Salinispora, in the South Pacific Gyre. Actinomycetes are proven prolific producers of bioactive natural products. During a coring expedition to the South Pacific Gyre, deep sea (>3600 m) sedimentary core samples were collected from sediments extending to 7 meters beneath seafloor (mbsf). The slow sedimentation rates and resulting oxic, oligotrophic sediments of the South Pacific Gyre make this environment unlike any previously studied. Culture independent methods were used to probe the sediments for actinomycete and Salinispora biodiversity. Actinomycete and Salinispora 16S rRNA genes were amplified from 55% and 49% of samples, respectively, and analyzed in a biogeographical context. This study expands the biogeographical range of this biosynthetically potent group of bacteria to include subsurface sediments underlying low productivity surface waters in the open ocean. Reported in chapter four, the final study aims to culture novel microbes from deep sediments and evaluate them for antibiotic activity. A full IODP drilling expedition (Expedition 329) returned to the same South Pacific Gyre sites investigated in the previous study to examine the entire sediment stack. The depth of the sediments ranges from 75 m on the outer edges of the gyre to only 15 m in the heart of the gyre. To date, 150 bacterial and 120 fungal isolates have been cultivated from the subsurface sediments using standard laboratory conditions. A remarkable 60% of bacterial and 80% of fungal isolates have demonstrated antibacterial activity against one or more bacterial test strains. In addition, inhibition of bioluminescence in Vibrio harveyi , a quorum sensing controlled phenotype, was observed by 46% of the bacterial isolates tested.

1733,,"This thesis explores the use of complexity theory in Physics Education Research as a way to examine the issue of student retention (a university’s ability to retain its students). University physics education is viewed through the concepts of nestedness and networked interactions. The work presented in this thesis covers two main aspects from a complexity theory perspective: (1) institutional action to enhance student retention; and, (2) the role of students’ in-course interaction networks. These aspects are used to reframe student retention from a complexity theory perspective, as well as to explore what implications this new perspective affords. The first aspect is addressed by conceptualizing student retention as an emergent phenomenon caused by both agent and component interaction within a complex system. A methodology is developed to illustrate a networked visualization of such a system using contemporary estimation methods. Identified limitations are discussed. To exemplify the use of simulations of complex systems, the networked system created is used to build a simulation of an “ideal” university system as well as a Virtual world for hypothesis-testing. The second aspect is divided into two sections: Firstly, an analysis of processes relating to how students’ in-course networks are created is undertaken. These networks are divided into two relevant components for student retention – the social and the academic. Analysis of these two components of the networks shows that the formation of the networks is not a result of random processes and is thus framed as a function of the core constructs of student retention research – the social and academic systems. Secondly, a case is made that students’ structural positions in the social and academic networks can be related to their grade achievement in the course.","Forsman, Jonas",0,,635
1734,,"Operation ARIES! is an Intelligent Tutoring System that is designed to teach scientific methodology in a game-like atmosphere. A fundamental goal of this serious game is to engage students during learning through natural language tutorial conversations. A tight integration of cognition, discourse, motivation, and affect is desired to meet this goal. Forty-six undergraduate students from two separate colleges in Southern California interacted with Operation ARIES! while intermittently answering survey questions that tap specific affective and metacognitive states related to the game-like and instructional qualities of Operation ARIES!. After performing a series of data mining explorations, we discovered two trends in the log files of cognitive-discourse events that predicted self-reported affective states. Students reporting positive affect tended to be more verbose during tutorial dialogues with the artificial agents. Conversely, students who reported negative emotions tended to produce lower quality conversational contributions with the agents. These findings support a valence-intensity theory of emotions and also the claim that cognitive-discourse features can predict emotional states over and above other game features embodied in ARIES.","Forsyth, Carol M.",0,,636

In this assessment, students converse with animated agents in natural language conversations to assess various aspects of English language learning. In a between subjects design, 31 students (N=31) were asked questions by either the newly created system or human interviewers. Results revealed that there was no difference in answers in regards to impacting the constructs under investigation. However, there were other differences including higher word count and potentially more complex language usage when speaking to a human. Furthermore, students liked interacting with the system. These results suggest that the newly created system can assess students' English capabilities comparably to human interviewers and implementing such a formative assessment is feasible.","Forsyth, C.

1747,,"It is hypothesized that the topology of brain networks is constructed by connecting nodes which may be continuously remodeled by appropriate training. Efficiency of physical and/or mental training on the brain relies on the flexibility of networks’ architecture molded by local remodeling of proteins and synapses of excitatory neurons producing transformations in network topology. Continuous remodeling of proteins of excitatory neurons is fine-tuning the scaling and strength of excitatory synapses up or down via regulation of intra-cellular metabolic and regulatory networks of the genome-transcriptome-proteome interface. Alzheimer’s disease is a model of “energy cost-driven small-world network disorder” with dysfunction of high-energy cost wiring as the network global efficiency is impaired by the deposition of an informed agent, the amyloid-β, selectively targeting high-degree nodes.

1748,Effects of an artificial agent as a behavioral model on motivational and learning outcomes,"Earlier research provides inconsistent evidence for effects of pedagogical agents on learning outcomes. We claim that the agent's instructional method helps to explain the inconsistency, with agents that offer behavioral modeling as an instructional method leading to better learning. We conducted two studies to investigate effects of the use of an artificial agent as a persuasive behavioral model on individuals' learning outcomes in the context of computer training. Specifically, in both studies, participants watched an instructional video on how to perform a web search with their eyes using a novel eye-tracking software. Study 1 examined the effects of agent-delivered modeling vs. two non-modeling instructional methods (agent-delivered instructional narration and no agent, text-only instruction) on participants' (N = 197) self-efficacy and system-specific perceptions of ease of use. Study 2 extends findings of Study 1 by examining effects of agent-delivered modeling vs. two non-modeling instructional methods (agent-delivered instructional narration and no agent, voice-only instructional narration) on participants' (N = 99) declarative knowledge and task performance. Previous work with human behavioral models showed an advantage of behavioral modeling over other non-modeling instructional methods in influencing learning outcomes. Therefore, agent-delivered modeling was predicted to be more effective in influencing motivational (i.e., self-efficacy) and learning outcomes (i.e., declarative knowledge, task performance). In accordance with our hypotheses, results revealed that participants who received instructions from an artificial agent as a behavioral model reported significantly stronger self-efficacy beliefs, tended to have higher system-specific ease of use, exhibited enhanced declarative knowledge, and better task performance skills.","Fountoukidou, S.",1,10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.013,639

A meta-analysis (N = 32) examined the model of social influence in virtual environments (Blascovich, 2002) and investigated whether agents and avatars in virtual environments elicit different levels of social influence. Results indicated that perceived avatars produced stronger responses than perceived agents. Level of immersion (desktop vs. fully immersive), dependent variable type (subjective vs. objective), task type (competitive vs. cooperative vs. neutral), and actual control of the representation (human vs. computer) were examined as moderators. An interaction effect revealed that studies conducted on a desktop that used objective measures showed a stronger effect for agency than those that were conducted on a desktop but used subjective measures. Competitive and cooperative tasks showed greater agency effects than neutral tasks. Studies in which both conditions were actually human controlled showed greater agency effects than studies in which both conditions were actually computer controlled.

Participants entered a fully immersive virtual environment and observed the agents as their physiological response was measured. Arousal was greatest when exposed to a running virtual self or a loitering virtual other. The finding that the virtual self causes physiological arousal may explain why a running virtual self has been shown in previous research to increase exercise behavior after exposure.

1765,,"A discussion of the earliest point defect and ADM theory studies then justifies the dissertation’s selection of CdO—it’s strong electrical properties are suitable for bandgap engineering. Investigations of previous literature involving the Group II-oxides of ZnO, MgO, and CdO lead to two key conclusions. First, few studies exist in which CdO is a primary alloying material. Second, the properties of CdO are tunable with better complementary materials such as NiO, a transition metal (TM) oxide, instead of commonly used ZnO and MgO. Given their unique properties, there is an opportunity to investigate the structure, properties, and behavior of CdO system after alloying it with NiO. Hall effect, optical reflectance and transmittance and X-ray diffraction measurements are utilized first and the structural, electrical transport and optical properties of NixCd1-xO films sputtered in argon (Ar) with radio frequency (RF) magnetron are then reported. This initial study shows that NixCd1-xO alloys are rocksalt-structured and exhibit a monotonic shift of the (220) diffraction peak to higher 2&thetas; angles with increasing Ni concentration. The electron mobility and electron concentration decrease with increasing Ni—becoming highly resistive for Ni content greater than 43.4% Ni. This decrease in n-type conductivity is consistent with the movement expected from a virtual crystal approximation (VCA) of the conduction band minimum (CBM) from below to above the Fermi stabilization energy (EFS). The optical absorption edge of the alloys is tunable from CdO to NiO. An intrinsic, carrier-free bandgap of the alloys, Eg, was calculated from the electrical and optical measurements, accounting for Burstein-Moss carrier filling and carrier-induced bandgap correlation effects. An unusual super linear composition dependence of the intrinsic bandgap is revealed when accounting for these effects. The super linear behavior was initially attributed to an interaction between the conduction-band extended states and localized donor and acceptor d-states of Ni. To probe the mechanisms behind the anomalous electrical transport and optical behaviors of the Ar sputtered alloys a collection of experimental and modeling investigations via ion irradiation, band anticrossing (BAC) simulations and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy-Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS-UPS) was then used. This study discovered that the introduction of a TM with two impurity levels leads to interactions that reconstruct both the conduction and valence bands of the alloy with increasing Ni. Irradiation of the films leads to a saturation of the electron concentration associated with the pinning of the Fermi level at EFS. The composition dependence of the pinned EF enables determination of the CBM energy relative to the vacuum level. There is an unusually strong deviation of this CBM energy observed from the VCA which is then explained by a BAC interaction between localized 3d states of Ni and the extended states of the NixCd1-xO alloy host. The resulting band structure is responsible for the dependence on composition of the electrical and optical properties of the alloys, the rapid reduction of the electron mobility, and previously observed positive bandgap bowing parameter. XPS-UPS studies confirm that the Γ- and L-point valence band maxima in the Cd-rich alloys are unaffected by interactions with Ni d-states. The results from this study provide much-needed context to the previously reported, but unexplained, electrical transport and optical behavior found in NixCd 1-xO, NixMg1-xO and Ni1-xZnxO alloys—the interactions govern their measured electrical and optical properties. These breakthroughs are also applicable to metal-oxide-based semiconducting alloys with TM acting as the dopant or alloying agents—such as V-doped ZnO. With an understanding of the structure, properties, and behavior of n-type, Ar sputtered NixCd1-xO, exploratory work for applications was then conducted.

1766,Infants' perception of chasing,"Two significant questions in cognitive and developmental science are first, whether objects and events are selected for attention based on their features (featural processing) or the configuration of their features (configural processing), and second, how these modes of processing develop. These questions have been addressed in part with experiments focused on infants' perception of faces, human body shapes, and biological motion of individual agents. Here, we investigate 4- and 10-month-old infants' (N = 192) attention to social motions, specifically to chasing a ubiquitous, ancient, and fitness-relevant mode of interaction. We constructed computer-generated animations of chasing that had three properties: acceleration, high turning rates, and attraction (""heat-seeking""). In the first experiment we showed chasing side-by-side with a control display of inanimate, billiard-ball-like motions. Infants strongly preferred attending to chasing. In the next three studies, we systematically investigated the effect of each property in turn (acceleration, turning, and attraction) by showing a display of that property side-by-side with the control display. Infants preferentially attended to acceleration, and to attraction, but not to turning. If infants preferred chasing for its configuration, then the sum of the effect sizes of individual properties should be smaller than their combined effects. That is not what we found: instead, on three measures of visual behavior, the summed effects of individual properties equaled (or exceeded) that of chasing. Moreover, although attraction drew little attention and turning no attention at all, acceleration drew (nearly) as much attention as chasing. Our results thus provide evidence that infants preferred chasing because of its features, not its configuration. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Frankenhuis, W.

1770,,"If we place our hopes and anxieties for the future in children, where does that leave teachers? Since the mid nineteenth century, educators have hoped that proper schooling would eliminate social tensions and decrease social disorder. However, building a formal education system required delegating socialization to other people, usually working-class men and women. The promises of education, wide social change without significant material redistribution, came up against the limitations of individual actors in reducing the effects of inequality. Teachers could not live up to the utopian expectations for educational reform and their unmediated contact with children began to cause alarm. As much as conservative elites were concerned with the seditious possibilities of allowing educated working class men unfettered access to large groups of children, radicals worried that teachers were the foot soldiers of an attempt by the Anglican establishment to expand its sphere of influence. The naturalization of teaching as an activity required significant discursive work, convincing both the educated and the government of the efficacy of the pupil-teacher relationship. The dissertation tracks two inter-related processes. It traces the representation of teachers as ineffectual, irrelevant and insurrectionary, each chapter following the disavowal of teachers within a different site: in the monitorial school classroom, Romantic pedagogical theory, teacher training colleges for working class scholarship children (the first state sponsored social mobility scheme), and the novel. Equally, it attends to the different rhetorical tactics, figures and metaphors, that helped teaching to be publicly legible and unthreatening, often at the expense of actually existing teachers. The project marshals materials from across the ecosystem of nineteenth century pedagogy: placing the writings of prominent educationalists (Andrew Bell, Joseph Lancaster, James Kay-Shuttleworth, Derwent Coleridge), teaching logs and procedural manuals from the archives of school providers and teacher training colleges (the British and Foreign School Society and the National Society) in dialogue with Romantic philosophers (Wordsworth, Coleridge, Rousseau, James Mill) and Victorian thinkers (Herbert Spencer, Alexander Bain, Matthew Arnold, J.S. Mill) and novelists (Dickens, Hardy, H.G. Wells and Lawrence). I trace both the governmental anxiety that teachers were insufficiently disciplined, and therefore vectors of working class dissent, inverted in the popular concern that they were agents of state discipline. I argue that suspicion of teachers was constitutive to liberal thought: indicative of the difficulty of finding coercive procedures that educate the individual into freedom.","Franklin, Jonathan",0,,645
1771,The meso-unit theory of post-merger integration,"This article introduces the meso-unit theory of post-merger integration. The theory offers that the number of constituent work-units involved in an organizational merger has a greater detrimental effect on the time-to-integration than does the total number of constituent personnel involved. Its establishment is based on the results of controlled experiments conducted in a virtual laboratory. The simulation utilizes agent-based modeling software that encapsulates organizational behavior models such as the knowledge-based view of the firm, social and communication network theory, and CONSTRUCT theory. The software is configured for a two-organization merger and implements classic behavior dynamics to simulate communicative behavior of information-seeking actors. As a result, detailed micro- and macro-level data on the integration progress is available for examination, analysis and interpretation. The results give rise to the development of the meso-unit theory, which directs integration managers' attention toward a key aspect of the integration that is often overlooked.","Frantz, T.

1773,,"The main thesis is that introspection is recommended for the development of anthropic AI. Human-like AI, distinct from rational AI, would suit robots for care for the elderly and for other tasks that require interaction with naïve humans. “Anthropic AI” is a sub-type of human-like AI, aiming for the pre-cultured, universal intelligence that is available to healthy humans regardless of time and civilisation. This is contrasted with western, modern, well-trained and adult intelligence that is often the focus of AI. Anthropic AI would pick up local cultures and habits, ignoring optimality. Introspection is recommended for the AI developer, as a source of ideas for designing an artificial mind, in the context of technology rather than science. Existing notions of introspection are analysed, and the aspiration for “clean” or “good” introspection is exposed as a mirage. Nonetheless, introspection is shown to be a legitimate source of ideas for AI using considerations of the contexts of discovery vs. justification. Moreover, introspection is shown to be a positively plausible basis for ideas for AI since if a teacher uses introspection to extract mental skills from themselves to transmit them to a student, an AI developer can also use introspection to uncover the human skills that they want to transfer to a computer. Methods and pitfalls of this approach are detailed, including the common error of polluting one's introspection with highly-educated notions such as mathematical methods. Examples are coded and run, showing promising learning behaviour. This is interpreted as a compromise between Classic AI and Dreyfus's tradition. So far AI practitioners have largely ignored the subjective, while the Phenomenologists have not written code – this thesis bridges that gap. One of the examples is shown to have Gadamerian characteristics, as recommended by (Winograd & Flores, 1986).

This study compared the efficacy of an embodied robot-coacher and its virtual agent in involving preschool children in the performance of playlike motor tasks. The robot or its virtual agent demonstrated movements, asked the children to repeat them, and provided positive feedback on their performance. The difficulty of the motor tasks was increased over the course of the session. Two groups of children were studied, one of them with and the other without previous experience of interaction with the embodied robot. In the experienced group, involvement in motor tasks was successfully induced by both the embodied robot and its virtual agent, but the children interacted less well with the virtual agent than with the embodied robot. Children in the inexperienced group did not interact at all during the experiment with the virtual agent. Because participants in the experiment were preschool children in their natural environment, this study proposes the combined use of an embodied robot and its virtual agent for motor involvement.","Fridin, M.",0,10.1080/10447318.2014.888500,650
1778,,"This practitioner research study has sought to understand what happens when a high school English teacher listens systematically to students’ perceptions of themselves as writers, their attitudes towards writing, and their perspectives on classroom writing instructional practices. Specifically, how does the adoption of a listening stance influences teacher practice, student learning, and the development of a community of writers over one school year? The theoretical framework that guided this study is based on constructivist principles that blend research and practice, positioning teachers as knowledge-generators and agents of change. During the year, I implemented constructivist practices with the goal of developing a classroom culture in which students could develop identities as writers and experience success in their writing. While I implemented constructivist practices, I systematically reflected on my instruction through audiotapes and transcripts of student interviews, lesson plans, classroom records, a researcher journal, and inquiry community conversations. To capture information about students’ experiences, I reviewed audiotapes and transcripts of student interviews, a researcher journal, student journals, student writing portfolios, open-ended surveys, and notes from writing conferences with students. This dissertation provides insights into the classroom context that advances students as writers and learners. In adopting an inquiry stance, specifically systematic reflection and weekly participation in professional learning and teacher inquiry communities, I became more aware of problems of practice and how to address them more comprehensively. In taking a listening stance, I realized that my students saw value in my pedagogical responses to their feedback and had more positive perceptions of writing. As I got to know my students, I tailored instruction more deliberately to each of their preferences and interests. I offered varied participatory structure options, where students could better thrive as writers, ultimately leading to a more inclusive communal space.","Fritz, Jason Scott",0,,651

The experimental study was conducted with students in foreign language classes (n = 122): a 12-week experimental trial that included pre and post-course interest, and a sequence of task interest measures. Employing a counterbalanced design, at three week intervals students engaged in separate speaking tasks with each of a Human and ""Chatbot"" partner. Students' interest in successive tasks and in the course (pre-post), were used to assess differential partner effects and course interest development trajectories. Comparisons of task interest under different partner conditions over time indicated a significant drop in students' task interest with the Chatbot but not Human partner. After accounting for initial course interest, Structural Equation Modelling indicated that only task interest with the Human partner contributed to developing course interest. While Human partner task interest predicted future course interest, task interest under Chatbot partner conditions did not. Under Chatbot partner conditions there was a drop in task interest after the first task: a novelty effect. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiments were performed using TEO, a household companion humanoid robot developed at the University Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M), via representations in Spanish Sign Language (LSE), and a total of 16 deaf and hearing-impaired participants.","Gago, J.

1789,How social is the chaser? Neural correlates of chasing perception in 9-month-old infants,"We investigated the neural correlates of chasing perception in infancy to determine whether animated interactions are processed as social events. By using EEG and an ERP design with animations of simple geometric shapes, we examined whether the positive posterior (P400) component, previously found in response to social stimuli, as well as the attention related negative fronto-central component (Nc), differs when infants observed a chaser versus a non-chaser. In Study 1, the chaser was compared to an inanimate object. In Study 2, the chaser was compared to an animate but not chasing agent (randomly moving agent). Results demonstrate no difference in the Nc component, but statistically higher P400 amplitude when the chasing agent was compared to either an inanimate object or a random object. We also find a difference in the N290 component in both studies and in the P200 component in Study 2, when the chasing agent is compared to the randomly moving agent. The present studies demonstrate for the first time that infants' process correlated motion such as chasing as a social interaction. The perception of the chasing agent elicits stronger time-locked responses, denoting a link between motion perception and social cognition. (C) 2016 The Authors.

1793,,"Since the seminal work of Fritz Heider and Marienne Simmel (1944) the study of animacy perception, or the perception and attribution of life from the motion of simple geometrical shapes has intrigued researchers. The intrigue for psychologists and vision scientists then and today centered on the stark disconnect between the simplicity of the visual input and the universal richness of the resulting percept.Infant research in this domain has become critical in examining the ontological processes behind the formation of animated percepts. To date, little is known about how infants process these kinds of stimuli. While numerous habituation studies have shown sensitivity to animate motion in general, none to date has examined whether infants actually perceive animate displays as social interactions.The overarching goal of the present thesis is to answer this question and further augment knowledge about the mechanisms behind the formation of animated percepts in infancy. I, along with my collaborators, do so in three ways, in three separate studies. First, we examined visual attention during online observation of randomly moving geometrical shapes in adults and infants (Study I, using eye tracking). Second, we examine distribution of visual attention in infancy during online observation of non-contact causal interactions, focusing on the most ubiquitous, fitness relevant of interactions – chasing (Study II, using eye tracking). Third, we answer the question whether infants perceive social content in chasing displays by measuring the neural correlates in response to chasing (Study III, using EEG).The collective contribution of the present work is also three fold. First, it demonstrates that starting at the end of the first year of life, human visual system is sensitive to cues that efficiently predict an interaction. Second, at 5-months infants begins allocating attention differently across agents within interactions. Finally, attention to specific objects is not due to low-level saliency but the social nature of the interaction. Subsequently, I present the case that perception of social agents is fast, direct, and reflects the workings of a specialized learning mechanisms whose function is the detection of heat-seeking animates in motion.","Galazka, Martyna A.",0,,657
1794,,"Since the emergence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), several antiretrovirals drugs have been developed to treat AIDS. However, new anti HIV-1 agents are needed due to the rapid mutation of the virus yielding drug-resistant strains. Our specific aim is to design non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI's) that target wild-type (WT) and drug resistant mutant strains Tyr181Cys (Y181C) and Lys103Asn/Y181C (K103N/Y181C) HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). Our research group has employed computational tools, such as virtual screening and de novo design, to pursue lead generation of novel NNRTI. Once lead generation is accomplished, free-energy perturbation calculations, under Monte Carlo simulations (MC/FEP), are pursued for NNRTI lead optimization. MC/FEP simulations have guided the synthesis of catechol diethers, benzyloxazoles, indolizines, indoles, and benzofurans, as novel NNRTIs, with enhanced pharmacological characteristics and inhibitory activity towards WT and both HIV-RT mutant strains. The synthesis and optimization of a diphenylmethane scaffold, a 5-μM docking-hit, was computationally-guided to yield very potent catechol diethers with picomolar inhibitory activity against HIV-RT (EC50 = 55 pM for WT). Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) and crystallographic studies were performed to elucidate the high potency of substituted catechol diethers. Catechol diethers containing a cyanovinyl moiety showed the best potency against WT and both mutant strains. Several intermolecular interactions have been observed to increase potency. Halogen moieties placed at the C5 position of the cyanovinylphenyl (CVP) ring interact favorably with Cγ of Pro95 through van der Waals interactions. Hydrogen-bonding interactions occur between the ethoxyuracil linker and residues Lys102 and Lys103. Furthermore, the position of the cyanovinylphenyl ring makes π-π interactions, with Y188 and W229, essential for high potency. The cyanovinyl moiety, a weak Michael acceptor, could lead to covalent modifications of proteins or nucleic acids. Replacement of this functional group was pursued computationally. This led to the discovery of novel 6:5 heterobicyclic scaffolds such as indoles, benzofurans, and indolizines. Indolizines, bearing a cyanonitrile moiety, showed high potency towards WT, EC50 = 380 pM, and both mutant strains Y181C, EC50 = 310 nM, and Y181C/K103N, EC50 = 11 nM, respectively. Furthermore, indolizines also showed decreased cytotoxicity, > 100 µM, and enhanced solubility, ∼40 µg/mL, compared to FDA-approved NNRTIs such as rilpivirine and etravirine. Lastly, the addition of aliphatic substituents into the 4-position of benzylic rings of oxazoles, guided by FEP simulations, yielded novel NNRTIs targeting Y181C. According to MC/FEP simulations, addition of ethyl and propyl moieties would enhance binding and thus inhibitory activity towards Y181C. After the synthesis and assaying of the NNRTIs, it was very gratifying to find that the inhibitory activity followed qualitative correspondence to the simulations. For example, the ethyl analogue had a EC50 = 1 nM towards WT, and a EC50 = 7 nM against Y181C, respectively.","Gallardo-Macias, Ricardo",0,,658
1795,Exploring interactions between semantic and syntactic processes: The role of animacy in syntactic priming,"The current study addressed the relation between syntactic and semantic processes during language production in 5- and 6-year-old children. A priming paradigm was used to examine children's production of passives in describing transitive scenes (target pictures) following exposure to the experimenter's sentences (primes). The key question was whether the tendency to repeat the syntactic form of the prime was affected by the animacy features in the prime and the target picture. In Experiment 1, children heard either passive or active primes with varied animacy configurations (e.g., animate patient/inanimate agent vs. inanimate patient/animate agent). The animacy features of the prime matched those of the target. Similar to prior studies, results showed a greater use of passives following passive, as opposed to active, primes. Critically, the difference between the two priming conditions varied as a function of animacy; it was larger when the prime and the target included an animate patient/inanimate agent than with the reversed animacy. In Experiment 2, the animacy configuration of the prime either matched or did not match that of the target. Results showed a greater likelihood of producing a passive when the target picture contained an animate patient versus an inanimate patient, and this effect was stronger when the prime had the same animacy features. The findings indicating that syntactic priming is moderated by animacy are discussed in the broader context of understanding the role of semantics in guiding the choice of syntactic structure.

1797,,"Most modern research of facial beauty prediction focuses on geometric features by traditional machine learning methods. Geometric features may easily lose much feature information characterizing facial beauty, rely heavily on accurate manual landmark localization of facial features and impose strict restrictions on training samples. Deep architectures have been recently demonstrated to be a promising area of research in statistical machine learning. In this paper, deep self-taught learning is utilized to obtain hierarchical representations, learn the concept of facial beauty and produce human-like predictor. Deep learning is helpful to recognize a broad range of visual concept effectively characterizing facial beauty. Through deep learning, reasonable apparent features of face images are extracted without depending completely on artificial feature selection. Self-taught learning, which has the ability of automatically improving network systems to understand the characteristics of data distribution and making recognition significantly easier and cheaper, is used to relax strict restrictions of training samples. Moreover, in order to choose a more appropriate method for mapping high-level representations into beauty ratings efficiently, we compare the performance of five regression methods and prove that support vector machine (SVM) regression is better. In addition, novel applications of deep self-taught learning on local binary pattern (LBP) and Gabor filters are presented, and the improvements on facial beauty prediction are shown by deep self-taught learning combined with LBP. Finally, human-like performance is obtained with learning features in full-sized and high-resolution images.

1801,,"The Dengue Virus Type-2 (DENV-2) is an arbovirus that belongs to the family of Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. It includes Dengue virus (DENV) types 1-4, West Nile virus, Langat virus, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus and others that cause encephalitic or hemorrhagic disease. DENV binds the cell surface receptors and fuses with the host cell membrane using surface envelope protein (E). The E protein ectodomain contains three domains, EDI, EDII and EDIII. The highly immunogenic EDIII is the putative receptor binding domain that also binds neutralizing antibodies. Thus, EDIII is an attractive target for development of vaccines, anti-viral and diagnostic agents. We have developed leads targeting the DENV-2 EDIII using small molecules and backbone-modified short single stranded DNA molecules called thioaptamers. Thioaptamers are highly resistant to nuclease degradation and do not elicit an immune response. We have identified thioaptamer sequences that bind to DENV-2 EDIII protein with high-affinity. The binding constants were determined for selected thioaptamers using filter binding assays and thermophoresis technique. The apparent Kd ranged from 100 nM to 500 nM. The binding site was determined for thioaptamer DEN TA-1 with DENV-2 EDIII protein using NMR HSQC experiment and mapped on the EDIII structure. Small molecules were selected from a virtual library, through collaboration within our lab, using computational methods that showed tight binding to DENV-2 EDIII protein. Selected molecules were characterized for binding to the EDIII target using protein thermal stability shift assay and 2-D HSQC NMR experiment. The apparent binding affinity for one of the selected compounds was calculated to be around 500 μM. The selected thioaptamers can be modified by attaching the selected small molecule binder at specific positions along the sequence using amide coupling reaction to create a novel class of X-aptamer library. The X-aptamer sequence with modification at the right positions can be selected that can specifically bind the DENV-2 EDIII target with very high affinity. These molecules can potentially be developed as a therapeutic or vaccine against dengue virus.","Gandham, Sai Hari Amarnath",0,,661
1802,Interactor's body shape does not affect visuo-motor interference effects during motor coordination,"The biological-tuning of the Action Observation Network is highly debated. A current open question relates to whether the morphological appearance (body shape) and/or the biological motion of the observed agent triggers action simulation processes. Motor simulation of the partner's action is critical for motor interactions, where two partners coordinate their actions in space and time. It supports interpersonal alignment and facilitates online coordination. However, motor simulation also leads to visuo-motor interference effects when people are required to coordinate with complementary actions, i.e. incongruent movements as compared to the observed ones. Movement kinematics of interactive partners allows us to capture their automatic tendency to simulate and imitate the partner's complementary movements. In an online reach-to-grasp task, we investigated whether visuo-motor interference effects, visible in the kinematics of complementary movements, are modulated by the visual presence of the interactor's body shape. We asked participants to interact with 1) a humanoid agent with a human-like body shape and with real human, biological, movement kinematics, or 2) a non-humanoid agent, which did not resemble the human body-shape but moved with the same real kinematics. Through the combination of inferential and Bayesian statistics, the results show no effect of interactor's body shape on visuomotor interference in reaching and grasping kinematics during online motor coordination. We discuss the results and propose that the kinematics of the observed movements, during motor interactions, might be the key factor for visuo-motor interference to take place independently from the morphological appearance of the partner. This is particularly relevant in a technological society that constantly asks humans to interact with artificial agents.","Gandolfo, M.",0,10.1016/j.actpsy.2019.04.003,662
1807,,"Millions of people worldwide engage in online role-playing with their avatar, a virtual agent that represents the self. Previous behavioral studies have indicated that many gamers identify more strongly with their avatar than with their biological self. Through their avatar, gamers develop social networks and learn new social-cognitive skills. The cognitive neurosciences have yet to identify the neural processes that underlie self-identification with these virtual agents. We applied functional neuroimaging to 22 long-term online gamers and 21 nongaming controls, while they rated personality traits of self, avatar,and familiar others. Strikingly, neuroimaging data revealed greater avatar-referential cortical activity in the left inferior parietal lobe, a region associated with self-identification from a third-person perspective. The magnitude of this brain activity correlated positively with the propensity to incorporate external body enhancements into one bodily identity. Avatar-referencing furthermore recruited greater activity in the rostral anterior consulate gyrus, suggesting relatively greater emotional self-involvement with one’s avatar. Post-scanning behavioral data revealed superior recognition memory for avatar relative to others. Interestingly, memory for avatar positively covaried with play duration. These findings significantly advance our knowledge about the brain’s plasticity to self-identify with virtual agents and the human cognitive-affective potential to live and learn in virtual worlds (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)","Ganesh, Shanti",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhr227,663

Results showed that collaborative courseware modules can lead to better learning outcome, and efficient communication especially audio communication is more preferred by the tested students.

1822,Ethics for end-of-life treatments: Metastatic colorectal cancer is one example,"The number of biological agents (BAs) registered with an indication related to cancer treatment is flourishing and the cost of these treatments is rising dramatically, making the situation potentially unsustainable for healthcare systems. Here we focus on the examples of bevacizumab (BV) and cetuximab (CX), two BAs approved for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The first clinical trials show an increase in median overall survival of a few months, though these results could not always be repeated in subsequent studies. We reviewed full economic evaluations (FEEs) on BV or CX and despite frequently arguable estimates based on indirect efficacy, only one estimated the addition of CX was cost-effective in a virtual subgroup of patients, albeit with flawed methods. Most Western European countries reimburse BV and CX for mCRC, though clinical evidence seems weak and economic evidence even absent. The underlying question is whether national health authorities are prepared to spend an increasing share of healthcare budgets on very expensive end-of-life treatments, their impact on life expectancy (a few additional months at best) and QoL (enhanced mainly by patients' hopes) being doubtful and their cost-effectiveness hardly ever proved. Further research is needed to explore how ethics could be included and thus assessed under these circumstances. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1825,Word order preferences of Tagalog-speaking adults and children,"This article investigates the word order preferences of Tagalog-speaking adults and five- and seven-year-old children. The participants were asked to complete sentences to describe pictures depicting actions between two animate entities. Adults preferred agent-initial constructions in the patient voice but not in the agent voice, while the children produced mainly agent-initial constructions regardless of voice. This agent-initial preference, despite the lack of a close link between the agent and the subject in Tagalog, shows that this word order preference is not merely syntactically-driven (subject-initial preference). Additionally, the children's agent-initial preference in the agent voice, contrary to the adults' lack of preference, shows that children do not respect the subject-last principle of ordering Tagalog full noun phrases. These results suggest that language-specific optional features like a subject-last principle take longer to be acquired.","Garcia, R.",0,10.1177/0142723718790317,668

The research reported here explored three categories of pro-environmental behavior (consumption of materials and energy, waste generation, and work-related commuting) in a public large-scale organization in Spain, with the aim of identifying the most effective policy options for a sustainable organization. Agent-based modeling was used to design a virtual simulation of the organization. Psychologically informed profiles of employees were defined using data gathered through a questionnaire, measuring knowledge, motivations, and ability. Future scenarios were developed using a participatory backcasting scenario development methodology, and policy tracks were derived. Dynamic simulations indicated that, to be effective, organizational policy should strengthen worker participation and autonomy, be sustained over time, and should combine different measures of medium intensity for behavior change, instead of isolated policies of high intensity.","Garcia-Mira, R.",0,10.1177/0013916516673869,669

Methods: Women were randomized to either 1) an ECA (content included: mindfulness, stress management, physical activity, and healthy eating) or 2) patient education sheets mirroring same content plus a meditation CD/MP3 once a day for one month. General outcome measures included: number of stress management techniques used, physical activity levels, and eating patterns. Results: Sixty-one women ages 18 to 50 were enrolled. On average, 51% identified as white, 26% as black, 23% as other races; and 20% as Hispanic. The major stress management techniques reported at baseline were: exercise (69%), listening to music (70%), and social support (66%). After one month, women randomized to the ECA significantly decreased alcohol consumption to reduce stress (p = 0.03) and increased daily fruit consumption by an average of 2 servings compared to the control (p = 0.04).

1844,,"Virtual digital assistants are automated software systems which assist humans by understanding natural languages such as English, either in voice or textual form. In recent times, a lot of digital applications have shifted towards providing a user experience using natural language interface. The change is brought up by the degree of ease with which the virtual digital assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa can be integrated into your application. These assistants make use of a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system which acts as an interface to translate unstructured natural language data into a structured form. Such an NLU system uses an intent finding algorithm which gives a high-level idea or meaning of a user query, termed as intent classification. The intent classification step identifies the action(s) that a user wants the assistant to perform. The intent classification step is followed by an entity recognition step in which the entities in the utterance are identified on which the intended action is performed. This step can be viewed as a sequence labeling task which maps an input word sequence into a corresponding sequence of slot labels. This step is also termed as slot filling. In this thesis, we improve the intent classification and slot filling in the virtual voice agents by automatic data augmentation. Spoken Language Understanding systems face the issue of data sparsity. The reason behind this is that it is hard for a human-created training sample to represent all the patterns in the language. Due to the lack of relevant data, deep learning methods are unable to generalize the Spoken Language Understanding model. This thesis expounds a way to overcome the issue of data sparsity in deep learning approaches on Spoken Language Understanding tasks. Here we have described the limitations in the current intent classifiers and how the proposed algorithm uses existing knowledge bases to overcome those limitations. The method helps in creating a more robust intent classifier and slot filling system.","Garg, Prashant",0,,671
1845,Fostering inclusion in school through creative and body-based learning,"In neoliberal times, accountability measures and high-stakes testing further contribute to differentiated outcomes for young people. The way that knowledge is conceptualised in tests regularly fails to recognise the embodied knowledge and abilities of many young people and instead students are positioned as passive receivers of knowledge. Students who are located in structural disadvantage continue to be least successful. This paper offers a critical counter-narrative to the didactic habit inherent in education through the mobilisation of creative and embodied practices as a transformational pedagogical approach. These pedagogies signal an epistemological and pedagogical shift toward mobilising bodies as agents of knowledge production and creativity as cultural capital. This paper reports on research that investigates primary school teachers and teaching artists using creative and body-based pedagogies, with a focus on enhancing student engagement in mathematics through strategies of 'encounter' (MacKenzie, Sarah. 2013. ""Poetic Praxis: Engaging Body, Mind, and Soul in the Social Foundations Classroom."" Journal for Learning Through the Arts 9 (1): 1-27.). Findings highlight the cumulative affective responses and shifts in subjectivity for both students and teachers when working with the body's ability to move, feel, respond and imagine.

1847,Learning through Embodied Conversational Agents with Semantic Memory,"Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) are interactive characters that exhibit human-like qualities, such as facial expressions, lip-synch, or emotional voice, and are able to communicate with humans, or with other ECAs by using natural human capabilities (speech, gestures, etc.). However, to make current ECAs' dialogue management strategies more appealing and real to the user, they should be aware of general knowledge about the external world. This factual knowledge, which is independent of personal experience, should be stored in their semantic memory. This paper presents a knowledge-based solution to improve learning through ECAs with factual knowledge based on semantics. In particular, we build this semantic memory by means of a novel proposal known as Daira. Moreover, we integrated Daira with Maxine, a powerful animation engine for developing applications with embodied animated agents. To illustrate the potential of our approach, we designed a proof of concept in which our system is able to provide data from the online Great Aragonese Encyclopedia (GEA), written in Spanish, to engage students. The experiments performed show the feasibility and efficiency of our proposal. In particular, we demonstrated that using enriched ECAS when searching information can enhance learning motivation and learning performance, making the interaction process much more accurate, simpler, and near to the students.","Garrido, P.",1,,673
1853,Verbal framing of statistical evidence drives children's preference inferences,"Although research has shown that statistical information can support children's inferences about specific psychological causes of others' behavior, previous work leaves open the question of how children interpret statistical information in more ambiguous situations. The current studies investigated the effect of specific verbal framing information on children's ability to infer mental states from statistical regularities in behavior. We found that preschool children inferred others' preferences from their statistically non-random choices only when they were provided with verbal information placing the person's behavior in a specifically preference-related context, not when the behavior was presented in a non-mentalistic action context or an intentional choice context. Furthermore, verbal framing information showed some evidence of supporting children's mental state inferences even from more ambiguous statistical data. These results highlight the role that specific, relevant framing information can play in supporting children's ability to derive novel insights from statistical information. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

1855,,"Digital games are part of our culture and have gained significant attention over the last decade. The growing capabilities of home computers, gaming consoles and mobile phones allow current games to visualise 3D virtual worlds, photo-realistic characters and the inclusion of complex physical simulations. The growing computational power of those devices enables the usage of complex algorithms while visualising data. Therefore, opportunities arise for developers of interactive products such as digital games which introduce new, challenging and exciting elements to the next generation of highly interactive software systems. Two of those challenges, which current systems do not address adequately, are design support for creating Intelligent Virtual Agents and more believable non-player characters for immersive game-play. We start in this thesis by addressing the agent design support first and then extend the research, addressing the second challenge. The main contributions of this thesis are: - The POSH-SHARP system is a framework for the development of game agents. The platform is modular, extendable, offers multi-platform support and advanced software development features such as behaviour inspection and behaviour versioning. The framework additionally integrates an advanced information exchange mechanism supporting loose behaviour coupling. - The Agile behaviour design methodology integrates agile software development and agent design. To guide users, the approach presents a work-flow for agent design and guiding heuristics for their development. - The action selection augmentation ERGo introduces a ""white-box"" solution to altering existing agent frameworks, making their agents less deterministic. It augments selected behaviours with a bio-mimetic memory to track and adjust their activation over time. With the new approach to agent design, the development of ""deepagent"" behaviour for digital adversaries and advanced tools supporting their design is given. Such mechanisms should enable developers to build robust non-player characters that act more human-like in an efficient and robust manner. Within this thesis, different strategies are identified to support the design of agents in a more robust manner and to guide developers. These discussed mechanisms are then evolved to develop and design Intelligent Virtual Agents. Because humans are still the best measurement for human-likeness, the evolutionary cycle involves feedback given by human players.","Gaudl, Swen",0,,675
1856,The extended ramp model: A biomimetic model of behaviour arbitration for lightweight cognitive architectures,"In this article, we present an idea for a more intuitive, low-cost, adjustable mechanism for behaviour control and management. One focus of current development in virtual agents, robotics and digital games is on increasingly complex and realistic systems that more accurately simulate intelligence found in nature. This development introduces a multitude of control parameters creating high computational costs. The resulting complexity limits the applicability of AI systems. One solution to this problem it to focus on smaller, more manageable, and flexible systems which can be simultaneously created, instantiated, and controlled. Here we introduce a biologically inspired systems-engineering approach for enriching behaviour arbitration with a low computational overhead. We focus on an easy way to control the maintenance, inhibition and alternation of high-level behaviours (goals) in cases where static priorities are undesirable. The models we consider here are biomimetic, based on neuro-cognitive research findings from dopaminic cells responsible for controlling goal switching and maintenance in the mammalian brain. The most promising model we find is applicable to selection problems with multiple conflicting goals. It utilizes a ramp function to control the execution and inhibition of behaviours more accurately than previous mechanisms, allowing an additional layer of control on existing behaviour prioritization systems.

I examined what excellent elementary mathematics teachers know and do in their practice of teaching. The study depicts detailed verbatim interactions between the teachers and students during actual teaching episodes to give the reader naturalistic examples of the explanation patterns and questioning strategies that these excellent teachers used to further students’ understandings of mathematical concepts and procedures. Analyses of the pedagogical strategies, including the interactive exploratory problem solving format these teachers used, and explanations for those decisions from the teacher and the researcher are included. The teachers were studied individually and collectively in an exploration of what excellent elementary mathematics teaching is through the lens of excellent teachers’ teaching practices in their classrooms and then compared with research literature. The findings show examples of how these teachers enhanced their students’ experiences with mathematics and identified six dimensions of excellent teaching. These teachers enabled students to become active agents of their own learning and showed how to allow students to construct their own understandings without telling them what to think or do. They empowered students by accepting them as capable thinkers who can reason and provide proof for that reasoning in early schooling experiences. These teachers encouraged students to develop and showcase their own thinking and non-routine algorithm discoveries to their peers showing multiple pathways to problem solutions and how they relate to mathematical ideas. Student Understanding of mathematics was described in examples of classroom episodes.

1859,,"In deep submicron era, thermal hot spots and large temperature gradients significantly impact system reliability, performance, cost and leakage power. Dynamic thermal management techniques are designed to tackle the problems and control the chip temperature as well as power consumption. They refer to those techniques which enable the chip to autonomously modify the task execution and power dissipation characteristics so that lower-cost cooling solutions could be adopted while still guaranteeing safe temperature regulation. As long as the temperature is regulated, the system reliability can be improved, leakage power can be reduced and cooling system lifetime can be extended significantly. Multimedia applications are expected to form the largest portion of workload in general purpose PC and portable devices. The ever-increasing computation intensity of multimedia applications elevates the processor temperature and consequently impairs the reliability and performance of the system. In this thesis, we propose to perform dynamic thermal management using reinforcement learning algorithm for multimedia applications. The presented learning model does not need any prior knowledge of the workload information or the system thermal and power characteristics. It learns the temperature change and workload switching patterns by observing the temperature sensor and event counters on the processor, and finds the management policy that provides good performance-thermal tradeoff during the runtime. As the system complexity increases, it is more and more difficult to perform thermal management in a centralized manner because of state explosion and the overhead of monitoring the entire chip. In this thesis, we present a framework for distributed thermal management in many-core systems where balanced thermal profile can be achieved by proactive task migration among neighboring cores. The framework has a low cost agent residing in each core that observes the local workload and temperature and communicates with its nearest neighbor for task migration and exchange. By choosing only those migration requests that will result in balanced workload without generating thermal emergency, the presented framework maintains workload balance across the system and avoids unnecessary migration. Experimental results show that, our distributed management policy achieves almost the same performance as a global management policy when the tasks are initially randomly distributed. Compared with existing proactive task migration technique, our approach generates less hotspot, less migration overhead with negligible performance overhead. Temperature affects the leakage power and cooling power. In this thesis, we address the impact of task allocation on a processor's leakage power and cooling fan power. Although the leakage power is determined by the average die temperature and the fan power is determined by the peak temperature, our analysis shows that the overall power can be minimized if a task allocation with minimum peak temperature is adopted together with an intelligent fan speed adjustment technique that finds the optimal tradeoff between fan power and leakage power. We further present a multi-agent distributed task migration technique that searches for the best task allocation during runtime. By choosing only those migration requests that will result chip maximum temperature reduction, the presented framework achieves large fan power savings as well as overall power reduction.","Ge, Yang",0,,678
1860,,"The far right English Defence League (EDL) is a strange product of global and local dynamics, most prominently the ‘War on Terror’. While the EDL has become well known for its high-profile demonstrations within local communities, the bulk of its day-to-day activity occurs online within its social networking sites, between supporters – referred to as ‘keyboard warriors’. ‘Keyboard warriors’’ activities are confined to the virtual realm and they are extremely unlikely to attend EDL events in physical space, such as demonstrations. This study explores the kind of Islamophobic identity that is produced by EDL supporters within the networking sites and will focus on how this identity is constructed around insecurities that are central to the lives of this population. EDL supporters can be identified as members of the working class that have experienced significant ontological insecurity since the 1980s, as a consequence of globalisation and related deindustrialisation. Working class identity has been weakened in contrast to the post war era when stronger roles could be located for such groups. Adrift in a post-industrial landscape, located in an ethno-religious war attached to feelings of class and national pride and now mediated by new social networking systems, the insecurities of these sections of the white working class have become attached to a construct of Islamic identity that is defined as essentially immoral and dangerous. This attribution of ‘otherness’, however, is not restricted merely to Muslims, but is applied to any perceived anti-EDL agent, including the government and the police, which are aggregated into a hegemonic foe that persecutes the English nation and facilitates Islamic expansionism. The central theme of the thesis is that new media systems have become critical to an understanding of extreme political identities and the expansion of worldviews in which inter-group conflict is amplified while also offering a sense of meaning and self-esteem for those involved.","Geddes, Graham Edward",0,,679
1861,,"This dissertation presents our research on coalition formation for Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP). In a DCOP, a problem is broken up into many disjoint sub-problems, each controlled by an autonomous agent and together the system of agents have a joint goal of maximizing a global utility function. In particular, we study the use of coalitions for solving distributed k-coloring problems using iterative approximate algorithms, which do not guarantee optimal results, but provide fast and economic solutions in resource constrained environments. The challenge in forming coalitions using iterative approximate algorithms is in identifying constraint dependencies between agents that allow for effective coalitions to form. We first present the Virtual Structure Reduction (VSR) Algorithm and its integration with a modified version of an iterative approximate solver. The VSR algorithm is the first distributed approach for finding structural relationships, called strict frozen pairs, between agents that allows for effective coalition formation. Using coalition structures allows for both more efficient search and higher overall utility in the solutions. Secondly, we relax the assumption of strict frozen pairs and allow coalitions to form under a probabilistic relationship. We identify probabilistic frozen pairs by calculating the propensity between two agents, or the joint probability of two agents in a k-coloring problem having the same value in all satisfiable instances. Using propensity, we form coalitions in sparse graphs where strict frozen pairs may not exist, but there is still benefit to forming coalitions. Lastly, we present a cooperative game theoretic approach where agents search for Nash stable coalitions under the conditions of additively separable and symmetric value functions.","Gemelli, Nathaniel",0,,680
1862,,"Efficient self-organizing virtual clusterheads that supervise data collection based on their wireless connectivity, risk, and overhead costs, are an important element of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). This function is especially critical during deployment when system resources are allocated to a subsequent application. In the presented research, a model used to deploy intrusion detection capability on a Local Area Network (LAN), in the literature, was extended to develop a role-based hierarchical agent deployment algorithm for a WSN. The resulting model took into consideration the monitoring capability, risk, deployment distribution cost, and monitoring cost associated with each node. Changing the original LAN methodology approach to model a cluster-based sensor network depended on the ability to duplicate a specific parameter that represented the monitoring capability. Furthermore, other parameters derived from a LAN can elevate costs and risk of deployment, as well as jeopardize the success of an application on a WSN. A key component of the approach presented in this research was to reduce the costs when established clusterheads in the network were found to be capable of hosting additional detection agents. In addition, another cost savings component of the study addressed the reduction of vulnerabilities associated with deployment of agents to high volume nodes. The effectiveness of the presented method was validated by comparing it against a type of a power-based scheme that used each node's remaining energy as the deployment value. While available energy is directly related to the model used in the presented method, the study deliberately sought out nodes that were identified with having superior monitoring capability, cost less to create and sustain, and are at low-risk of an attack. This work investigated improving the efficiency of an intrusion detection system (IDS) by using the proposed model to deploy monitoring agents after a temperature sensing application had established the network traffic flow to the sink. The same scenario was repeated using a power-based IDS to compare it against the proposed model. To identify a clusterhead's ability to host monitoring agents after the temperature sensing application terminated, the deployed IDS utilized the communication history and other network factors in order to rank the nodes. Similarly, using the node's communication history, the deployed power-based IDS ranked nodes based on their remaining power. For each individual scenario, and after the IDS application was deployed, the temperature sensing application was run for a second time. This time, to monitor the temperature sensing agents as the data flowed towards the sink, the network traffic was rerouted through the new intrusion detection clusterheads. Consequently, if the clusterheads were shared, the re-routing step was not preformed. Experimental results in this research demonstrated the effectiveness of applying a robust deployment metric to improve upon the energy efficiency of a deployed application in a multi-application WSN. It was found that in the scenarios with the intrusion detection application that utilized the proposed model resulted in more remaining energy than in the scenarios that implemented the power-based IDS. The algorithm especially had a positive impact on the small, dense, and more homogeneous networks. This finding was reinforced by the smaller percentage of new clusterheads that was selected. Essentially, the energy cost of the route to the sink was reduced because the network traffic was rerouted through fewer new clusterheads. Additionally, it was found that the intrusion detection topology that used the proposed approach formed smaller and more connected sets of clusterheads than the power-based IDS. As a consequence, this proposed approach essentially achieved the research objective for enhancing energy use in a multi-application WSN.","Gendreau, Audrey",0,,681
1863,Animacy and competition in relative clause production: A cross-linguistic investigation,"This work investigates production preferences in different languages. Specifically, it examines how animacy, competition processes, and language-specific constraints shape speakers' choices of structure. English, Spanish and Serbian speakers were presented with depicted events in which either an animate or inanimate entity was acted upon by an agent. Questions about the affected participant in these events prompted the production of relative clauses identifying these entities (e.g., the bag the woman is punching). Results indicated that in English, animacy plays a strong role in determining the choice of passive structures. In contrast, it plays a less prominent role in Spanish and Serbian structure choices, where more active structures were produced to varying degrees. Critically, the semantic similarity between the agent and the patient of the event correlated with the omission of the agent in all languages, indicating that competition resulted in the agent's inhibition. Similarity also correlated with different functional choices in Spanish. The results suggest that similarity-based competition may influence various stages of production planning but its manifestations are constrained by language-specific grammatical options. Implications for models of sentence production and the relationship between production and comprehension are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Gennari, S.

1866,,"Human vision is a demanding computation that acts on and learns from billions of moving measurements every second. Computer vision requires models that are both tractable for realtime learning and inference as well as robust to the transformations of the visual world. For a vision system to benefit an embodied agent it must be able to (a) learn tractable models discriminatively so that it does not waste computation on nonessential questions, (b) learn model structure so computation is only added where needed, (c) learn from images subject to transformations, and (d) learn new concepts quickly. In this dissertation we tackle these four desiderata, weaving together sum-product networks, neural networks, kernel machines, and symmetry group theory. First, we extend sum-product networks so that they can be trained discriminatively. This expands the space of SPN architectures and allows feature functions, making them a compelling tractable alternative to conditional random fields. We show that discriminative SPNs can be competitive with deep models on image classification. Second, we present an algorithm to learn the structure of sum-product networks. The top-down recursive algorithm builds a product if it can decompose variables and otherwise a sum to cluster instances. Surprisingly, this algorithm learns SPNs with superior inference accuracy and speed compared to probabilistic graphical models on a large number of datasets. Third, we introduce deep symmetry networks that can learn representations over arbitrary Lie groups. We present techniques to scale these networks to high-dimensional symmetries. We show that deep symmetry networks can classify 2D and 3D transformed objects with higher accuracy and less training data than convolutional neural networks. Finally, we propose compositional kernel machines as an instance-based learner that has the symmetry and compositionality of convolutional neural networks but is significantly easier to train. We combat the curse of dimensionality by effectively summing over an exponential set of constructed virtual training instances using a sum-product function. This makes CKMs outperform standard instance-based learners on image classification and generalizing to unseen compositions and symmetries.","Gens, Robert",0,,683
1867,,"High-functioning autism (HFA) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which is characterized by life-long socio-communicative impairments on the one hand and preserved verbal and general learning and memory abilities on the other. One of the areas where particular difficulties are observable is the understanding of non-verbal communication cues. Thus, investigating the underlying psychological processes and neural mechanisms of non-verbal communication in HFA allows a better understanding of this disorder, and potentially enables the development of more efficient forms of psychotherapy and trainings. However, the research on non-verbal information processing in HFA faces several methodological challenges. The use of virtual characters (VCs) helps to overcome such challenges by enabling an ecologically valid experience of social presence, and by providing an experimental platform that can be systematically and fully controlled. To make this field of research accessible to a broader audience, we elaborate in the first part of the review the validity of using VCs in non-verbal behavior research on HFA, and we review current relevant paradigms and findings from social-cognitive neuroscience. In the second part, we argue for the use of VCs as either agents or avatars in the context of “transformed social interactions.” This allows for the implementation of real-time social interaction in virtual experimental settings, which represents a more sensitive measure of socio-communicative impairments in HFA. Finally, we argue that VCs and environments are a valuable assistive, educational and therapeutic tool for HFA.

1872,,"Despite the fact that nonverbal dyadic social interactions are abundant in the environment, the neural mechanisms underlying their processing are not yet fully understood. Research in the field of social neuroscience has suggested that two neural networks appear to be involved in social understanding: (1) the action observation network (AON) and (2) the social neural network (SNN). The aim of this study was to determine the differential contributions of the AON and the SNN to the processing of nonverbal behavior as observed in dyadic social interactions. To this end, we used short computer animation sequences displaying dyadic social interactions between two virtual characters and systematically manipulated two key features of movement activity, which are known to influence the perception of meaning in nonverbal stimuli: (1) movement fluency and (2) contingency of movement patterns. A group of 21 male participants rated the “naturalness” of the observed scenes on a four‐point scale while undergoing fMRI. Behavioral results showed that both fluency and contingency significantly influenced the “naturalness” experience of the presented animations. Neurally, the AON was preferentially engaged when processing contingent movement patterns, but did not discriminate between different degrees of movement fluency. In contrast, regions of the SNN were engaged more strongly when observing dyads with disturbed movement fluency. In conclusion, while the AON is involved in the general processing of contingent social actions, irrespective of their kinematic properties, the SNN is preferentially recruited when atypical kinematic properties prompt inferences about the agents' intentions.

1879,An Integrated Decision Making Approach for Adaptive Shared Control of Mobility Assistance Robots,"Mobility assistance robots provide support to elderly or patients during walking. The design of a safe and intuitive assistance behavior is one of the major challenges in this context. We present an integrated approach for the context-specific, on-line adaptation of the assistance level of a rollator-type mobility assistance robot by gain-scheduling of low-level robot control parameters. A human-inspired decision-making model, the drift-diffusion Model, is introduced as the key principle to gain-schedule parameters and with this to adapt the provided robot assistance in order to achieve a human-like assistive behavior. The mobility assistance robot is designed to provide (a) cognitive assistance to help the user following a desired path towards a predefined destination as well as (b) sensorial assistance to avoid collisions with obstacles while allowing for an intentional approach of them. Further, the robot observes the user long-term performance and fatigue to adapt the overall level of (c) physical assistance provided. For each type of assistance a decision-making problem is formulated that affects different low-level control parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in technical validation experiments. Moreover, the proposed approach is evaluated in a user study with 35 elderly persons. Obtained results indicate that the proposed gain-scheduling technique incorporating ideas of human decision-making models shows a general high potential for the application in adaptive shared control of mobility assistance robots.","Geravand, M.",0,10.1007/s12369-016-0353-z,686
1883,"A multi-agent approach for performance based architecture: Design exploring geometry, user, and environmental agencies in facades","This paper presents research on the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) in architectural design with the goal of both improving and partially automating the design process as well as the design outcomes in terms of geometry and environmental performance. The work is based upon research on agent based Modeling and simulatitm techniques (ABMS), and the combination of analytical and optimization methods with geometric modeling and User centered design. The motivation is to render more accessible the exploration of the generative aspect of bottom up design techniques when coupled with optimization and performance criteria. The objective of the work is to develop and test a design methodology, which enables designers to explore larger sets of informed solutions by coupling design requirements and generative design techniques with validated simulations (i.e., environmental analysis) based partly on the inclusion of user light preferences early in the design process. The development of the proposed methodology and the implementation of the design system for a building facade are described, while the robustness and validity of the framework is initially tested by applying it to the generation and optimization of facade panel configurations of an office building. The results show that the MAS for design system can generate unique design configurations that perform environmentally (daylight factor analysis) better than a facade with normative facade shading.

This research examines social responses towards persuasive social agents. We present a laboratory experiment which assessed reactance and compliance to persuasive attempts delivered by an artificial (non-robotic) social agent, a social robot with minimal social cues (human-like face with speech output and blinking eyes), and a social robot with enhanced social cues (human-like face with head movement, facial expression, affective intonation of speech output). Our results suggest that a social robot presenting more social cues will cause higher reactance and this effect is stronger when the user feels involved in the task at hand.","Ghazali, A.

1890,Combining fuzzy cognitive maps with agent-based modeling: Frameworks and pitfalls of a powerful hybrid modeling approach to understand human-environment interactions,"Agent-based modeling (ABM) is an established technique to capture human-environment interactions in socio-ecological systems. As a micro-model, it explicitly represents each agent, such that heterogeneous decision-making processes (e.g. based on the beliefs and experiences of stakeholders) can anticipate the socio-environmental consequences of aggregated individual behaviors. In contrast to ABM, Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping takes a macro-level view of the world that represents causal connections between concepts rather than individual entities. Researchers have expressed interest in reconciling the two, i.e. taking a hybrid approach and drawing of the strengths of each to more accurately model socio-ecological interactions. The intuition is to take FCMs, which can be quickly developed using participatory modeling tools and use them to create a virtual population of agents with sophisticated decision-making processes. In this paper, we detail two ways in which this combination can be done, and highlight the key questions that modelers need to be mindful of. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

1893,"Does Media Discourse Favour the Emergence of Avalanche Risk in Medium-High Mountain Regions? Between Ignorance and Underestimation, the Example of the Vosges Mountains","Despite significant proof to the contrary, scientific and institutional agents present the Vosges Mountains, a medium-high mountain range located in north-eastern France, as a territory that poses almost no risk of avalanches. A comprehensive review of the daily press, as well as national and regional television news, shows that media discourses do not counter this point of view strongly. Indeed, unlike the Alpine environment, whose risk the media presents in a concrete and sometimes pedagogical way, the Vosges Mountains receive very little coverage with respect to risk. More generally, the argumentative strategies that the media use are ambiguous and on the edge between warning about and underestimating the risk. Therefore, the image that is conveyed is one of a territory where the risk is limited to a few locations and/or to particular circumstances. Consequently, avalanches continue to be viewed as a distinctive attribute of a specific space-namely, high mountains-while the question of the danger posed by the Vosges Mountains is left open. This observation should be complemented by a study of the origin of such editorial choices, as well as their impact on the risk representations among different target audiences.","Giacona, F.",0,,690
1896,,"Tumour Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is a protein belonging to the TNF family of ligands. TRAIL is able to induce apoptosis in tumour cells, whilst leaving normal cells unaltered, representing therefore an attractive anti-cancer agent. In breast cancer, however, different cell lines are resistant to TRAIL. Moreover, many studies have demonstrated that breast cancer stem cells (bCSCs), the cells that are the most responsible for relapses and metastasis development, are resistant to TRAIL. Cellular FLICE-Like Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) plays a crucial role in TRAIL-resistance due to its ability to interfere with the TRAIL pathway, preventing therefore the apoptosis. In the course of a previous study, the homology model of c-FLIP has been constructed and using a structure-based virtual screening of commercially available compounds, one hit compound (3) able to inhibit c-FLIP at micromolar concentrations has been identified. Starting from the structure of the hit compound, several new derivatives belonging to four different structural families were designed and synthesised: sulfonamide derivatives, amine derivatives, amide derivatives and methylene derivatives. All the newly synthesised compounds were tested in an in vitro assay for their ability to sensitise TRAIL-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cell line to TRAIL. Different derivatives retained the ability to increase TRAIL sensitisation showing a similar or slightly improved activity compared to the original hit. Some of the most promising compounds were further evaluated in in vitro pharmacokinetic assays, dose-response and cytotoxicity studies. The results obtained from these studies suggested the identification of a novel hit compound (88) which showed the ability to increase TRAIL sensitisation with an IC50 value in the range of 15-19 μM and improved metabolic stability compared to 3. Additionally, molecular docking analyses suggested a potential ability of the newly synthesised derivatives to occupy the pocket of c-FLIP. Taking into consideration all these results, a series of novel potential small molecule c-FLIP inhibitors showing ability to increase TRAIL sensitisation in resistant breast cancer cells and breast cancer stem cells was developed.","Giancotti, Gilda",0,,691

1900,Speech Accommodation Without Priming: The Case of Pitch,"People often accommodate to each other's speech by aligning their linguistic production with their partner's. According to an influential theory, the Interactive Alignment Model, alignment is the result of priming. When people perceive an utterance, the corresponding linguistic representations are primed and become easier to produce. Here we tested this theory by investigating whether pitch (F0) alignment shows two characteristic signatures of priming: dose dependence and persistence. In a virtual reality experiment, we manipulated the pitch of a virtual interlocutor's speech to find out (1) whether participants accommodated to the agent's F0, (2) whether the amount of accommodation increased with increasing exposure to the agent's speech, and (3) whether changes to participants' F0 persisted beyond the conversation. Participants accommodated to the virtual interlocutor, but accommodation did not increase in strength over the conversation and disappeared immediately after the conversation ended. Results argue against a priming-based account of F0 accommodation and indicate that an alternative mechanism is needed to explain alignment along continuous dimensions of language such as speech rate and pitch.","Gijssels, T.",0,10.1080/0163853x.2015.1023965,693
1905,,"Seemingly, the era of ubiquitous connectivity has arrived, with smart phones, tablets, and small computing devices bringing internet straight to our fingertips - or has it? Two thirds of the world still does not have access to the internet, and a lack of realistic communication guarantees for multi-agent robotic networks are standing in the way of taking these systems from research labs into the real world. In this thesis we consider the problem of satisfying communication demands in a multi-agent system where several robots cooperate on a task and a fixed subset of the agents act as mobile routers. Our goal is to position the team of robotic routers to provide communication coverage to the remaining client robots, while allowing clients maximum freedom to achieve their primary coordination task. We develop algorithms and performance guarantees for maintaining a desired communication quality over the entire heterogeneous team of controlled mobile routers and non-cooperative clients. In the first part of the thesis we consider the problem of router placement while explicitly accounting for client motion over a priori unknown trajectories. We formulate this problem as a novel optimization called the connected reachable k-connected center problem that extends the classical k-center problem. We propose an algorithm to compute a small representative set of clients where this set is of size (klog( n)/)[special characters omitted]O(1), can be constructed in O(nk) time and updated in (klog( n)/[special characters omitted])O(1) time as clients move along their trajectories. Here k is the number of routers, n is the number of clients, and [special characters omitted] is a user-defined acceptable error tolerance. Our router placement algorithm applied to this sparse set provides a configuration of router positions that is bounded by a multiplicative factor, (1 + [special characters omitted]) from optimal. Secondly, we incorporate a realistic communication model into our router placement optimization problem. We do this by developing a novel method of directional signal strength mapping that has sufficient richness of information to capture complex wireless phenomena such as fading and shadowing, and can be used to derive a simple optimization formulation that is based on quadratic link costs and is solved using our router placement algorithm. Using off-the-shelf hardware platforms we present aggregate results demonstrating that the resulting router placements satisfy communication demands across the network with 4X smaller standard deviation in performance and 3.4X faster convergence time than existing methods, and our solutions assume no environment map and unknown client positions. Finally, we derive distributed controllers for the special case where clients are static. We show that by the tuning of a control parameter our routers maintain a connected network using only local information. We support our theoretical claims with experimental results using AscTec hummingbird platforms as well as iRobot Create platforms of small 10 client and large 500 virtual client implementations.

1906,,"Traditional organizations are often relatively structured, involving hierarchies of individual agents driving progress through production, with well-defined boundaries between internal requirements and external expectations and with explicit goals set to drive work processes to their ideal end. Modern commons-based peer production communities, however, exist in a different reality, both conceptually and physically. These communities of collaborators are often identified by their distributed agents acting among distributed teams, functioning without formal hierarchy, each contributing to disparate projects with divergent goals, each with myriad individual motivations, all leading to an emergent order that arises not from managerial decree but from the mass of actors participating in the melee. In these communities, coordination is no longer a top-down process that can be centrally controlled. It is instead a product of emergent order; it is a product of the ongoing and ever changing narrative of the individual actors contributing to and ultimately shaping those communities they interact within. This dissertation examines such coordination within one of the most visible commons-based peer production communities – Wikipedia. Within Wikipedia, millions of volunteers have contributed to create one of the largest and most visited resources in the world, a free online encyclopedia with the goal to make available the sum of all human knowledge. While prior research has contributed to theoretical understanding of coordination in organizations, no such theory exists for modern commons-based peer production communities. This dissertation presents such a theory, grounded in observations of the agents within that community, with the capacity to explicate the many discrete interactions that inform the whole, to identify the means by which those interactions succeed or fail, and to ultimately provide a theoretical foundation for future design interventions. Finally, to validate this theory I present the Virtual Team Explorer, a theory-driven design study resulting in a prototype application intended to facilitate the coordination of distributed actors within WikiProjects in Wikipedia, along with the tools and requisite documentation that make such an intervention possible.","Gilbert, Michael D.",0,,695
1907,Can avatars pass the Turing test? Intelligent agent perception in a 3D virtual environment,"The current study involved the first natural language, modified Turing Test in a 3D virtual environment. One hundred participants were given an avatar-guided tour of a virtual clothing store housed in the 3D world of Second Life. In half of the cases, a human research assistant controlled the avatar-guide; in the other half, the avatar-guide was a visually indistinguishable virtual agent or ""bot"" that employed a chat engine called Discourse, a more robust variant of Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML). Both participants and the human research assistant were blind to variations in the controlling agency of the guide. The results indicated that 78% of participants in the artificial intelligence condition incorrectly judged the bot to be human, significantly exceeding the 50% rate that one would expect by chance alone that is used as the criterion for passage of a modified Turing Test. An analysis of participants' decision-making criteria revealed that agency judgments were impacted by both the quality of the AI engine and a number of psychological and contextual factors, including the naivety of participants regarding the possible presence of an intelligent agent, the duration of the trial period, the specificity and structure of the test situation, and the anthropomorphic form and movements of the agent. Thus, passage of the Turing Test is best viewed not as the sole product of advances in artificial intelligence or the operation of psychological and contextual variables, but as a complex process of human-computer interaction.

1909,,"It is possible to construct increasingly realistic computer based three dimensional (3D) models of landscape designs, which when used in interactive visualisations, have been shown to increase engagement and cognitive response. However, they remain underutilised in the landscape design process, due to the time taken to produce a model and the perceived complexity of modelling software. There would be more reason to construct a 3D model if it could be utilised as more than just a visualisation. Therefore, this thesis explores the hypothesis that it is possible to make virtual 3D landscape models central to the landscape design process. As the role of 3D real-time graphics amongst more traditional forms of visualisation in the design process remains unclear, a new methodology for examining this as well as data regarding this issue are presented, highlighting an expert user preference for both two dimensional (2D) plans and interactive 3D visualisations. Given this result and other supporting research, this thesis presents the concept of a 3D Landscape Information Model (3D LIM), defined as an interactive software tool that supports the landscape design process in both the construction and judgement of a landscape design via 3D landscape models. A theoretical framework for key functionality and the usage of a 3D LIM is presented and the development of a prototype 3D LIM based on this framework is described. A set of distinct simulation techniques to aid judgement of the performance of a landscape design is connected to this prototype through adding a landscape semantic to the 3D model. Firstly, real-time integration of geo-spatial analysis and Bayesian Networks into a 3D LIM is shown to be possible. The 3D LIM is then integrated, in an offline manner, into computationally expensive microclimate and flood simulations. Next, a novel agent based pedestrian and vehicular model is developed that is driven from data held in the 3D LIM landscape system. Finally, the 3D LIM prototype is extended once more to contain a web server. It is shown that this development allows for on-site viewing and editing of the 3D model via mobile data networks for site surveys and as a possible method for public consultation.","Gill, Lewis",0,,697

Our contribution is to introduce and explore the significance of two particular hybrids: (1) the cyranoid method that enables humans to converse face-to-face through the medium of another person’s body, and (2) the echoborg method that enables artificial intelligence to converse face-to-face through the medium of a human body. These two methods are distinct in being able to parse the unique influence of the human body when combined with various speech sources. We also introduce a new framework for conceptualizing the body’s role in communication, distinguishing three levels: self’s perspective on the body, other’s perspective on the body, and self’s perspective of other’s perspective on the body. Within each level the cyranoid and echoborg methodologies make important research questions tractable. By conceptualizing and synthesizing these methods, we outline a novel paradigm of research on the role of the body in unscripted face-to-face communication.

1912,,"Making the use of an unfamiliar digital user interface (Ul) easy, transparent and accessible is a challenging problem, particularly when the interaction occurs without any prior experience. Where and how the user pays attention is critical for the development of an effective human-computer interaction (HCI). The role of attention is particularly important in cases of an inexperienced user, unaccustomed to receiving valuable information for the interaction. Therefore, a recurring problem during an unfamiliar transaction is ‘what to do next’, where the user fails to anticipate the following step. This problem is well illustrated in the context of transactions using Self-Service Technologies, where the next step is likely to be unidentified by an inexperienced or first-time user, and accentuated by the lack of help or human assistance. This thesis applies an interdisciplinary blend of Psychological, Animation and HCI principles relating to guiding users unfamiliar with the Ul to ease the digital interaction. A series of experiments address visuo-spatial mechanisms of guidance to orient and direct user attention during a search of target items inside a Ul. Dynamically animated virtual agent (VA) gaze and head cues were found to guide eye gaze and button presses faster than 1-image and 2- image agent cues. When these cues were animated using the principles of animation, they introduced a substantial increase in the likeability of the agent observed but also delaying the response latency. The use of the ‘exaggeration’ principle of animation was shown to provide the optimal balance between response speed and preference. Following on from the experiments, the thesis develops a formal categorisation for a user who occasionally uses UIs, the Occasional User (OU), and the specific development of a new interaction style for the OU, represented by a guideduser interface, that does not require any prior experience and only a minimum knowledge of to use it. In summary, this overall analysis of guidance mechanisms and unfamiliar HCI contexts indicates that VA visual cues influence the overt allocation of user attention and that, in combination with an ad-hoc interaction style, may be used to enhance occasional digital interactions.","Gil-Martinez, Santiago",0,,699
1913,,"The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate the practices of high school principals who have built a culture in their high schools focused on college and career readiness for all students, but in particular students from historically underserved backgrounds, and to identify and describe the characteristics that they shared (Stake, 2005, 2006). This study involved case study research methods, with two case study sites. I completed the investigation with a detailed, holistic case study report of two principals with data collected between October 2014 and May 2015 at two high schools located in the metropolitan area of a large Midwestern city. Data collection involved individual interviews of principals; focus group interviews with teachers, students, and parents/legal guardians; several observations of the principals in meetings or in their schools, and document review. The findings reveal that the high school principals engaged in a number of behaviors beginning with a personal, justice-oriented mindset that strives for equitable outcomes for all students through their leadership and advocacy in interpersonal and pedagogical relationships. For both principals, it was more than just striving for equitable outcomes—they laid a foundation and began carving a path that any student could take and end wherever her/his interests or passions resided. The flexibility of this path was mindfully and deliberately crafted by looking forward to the future, postsecondary, needs of students and mapping backwards to the first day of high school. The two justice-oriented high school principals undertook the task of carving a path for students by creating career pathway structures in their schools that build a culture focused on both college and careers, supporting teachers and faculty as they reinforced the career pathway structures in their classrooms, through internships or mentorships, and exposing students to college and career experiences and opportunities that contextualized the classroom and school experiences. A career pathway structure is not a model that silos students and teachers into choosing career preparation over college preparation but instead is a mutually inclusive approach of embedding career development into the academic curriculum. Both principals were mindful and deliberate in the programmatic structure of their career pathways or courses as to not isolate or pre-determine paths for students. All students were exposed to college and career experiences or opportunities in contextualized learning environments in and out of the classroom. The justice-oriented high school principals recognized student and family diversity as an integral and unifying factor in their schools and community and ensured that every willing student participated in all college and career experiences, even if obstacles or challenges may have existed. Diversity was a common thread in discussions with both principals and their teachers, parents, and students and wove many of the study’s findings together. Diversity was described by participants as rich, foundational, an asset, a unifying agent, and a perceived strength in the classrooms, in the hallways, and in the overall school community. At both schools, diversity was not regarded or celebrated as a theatrical production, but a common fiber that linked the daily occurrences or activities at both schools. Whether in the form of multilingual communications that were produced orally and in print, in the languages overheard in hallway conversations, or in the fundraising and community outreach of school faculty and staff, parents, and community partners, cultural, linguistic, and economic diversity was packaged into all shapes and sizes and the entire school community reaped its benefits.","Gioiosa, Carmen",0,,700
1914,,"Infectious diseases, including hepatitis C and tuberculosis, claim the lives of over 15 million people each year. Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) which infects the liver and can ultimately result in liver transplantation. HCV is very adaptive as a result of its high mutation rate. Thus, there is a potential high risk for the development of drug resistance and also a possible cross-resistance due to a structural similarity between many of the HCV NS3 protease inhibitors currently in clinical trial and on the market, that all are based on a P2-proline or a proline mimic. Thus, part of the research behind this thesis was to explore a new structural P3-P2 unit for the NS3 protease inhibitors, a 2(1H)-pyrazinone moiety. A microwave-assisted protocol was developed, and the 2(1H)-pyrazinone core was synthesized in only 2 × 10 min. A series of optimization steps resulted in several submicromolar 2(1H)-pyrazinone-containing NS3 protease inhibitors that performed well against drug-resistant NS3 protease variants. The key modifications were: exchanging the unstable carbamate P3 capping group for a stable urea functionality, transferring the P2 group from the amino acid residue to the pyrazinone ring and elongating the substituent, and using an aromatic acyl sulfonamide in the P1-P1' position.The causative agent of tuberculosis is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which currently infects one third of the world's population. No new TB drugs have been approved in nearly 50 years and drug resistance has been observed for all of the current first-line drugs. Because of the importance of identifying novel drug targets, the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme was investigated. The RNR enzyme consists of two R1 and two R2 subunits and is essential for Mtb replication. Starting from hits identified in a virtual screening program, a small library of low molecular weight inhibitors of the association between the R1 and R2 subunits was designed and synthesized. The compounds with the strongest affinity for the R1 subunit of RNR were further evaluated in an orthogonal activity assay. Two RNR inhibitors with promising antimycobacterial effects were identified, which can serve as leads in the further optimization of this class of compounds.","Gising, Johan",0,,701
1915,,"This PHD project aims to develop a service design system which has a customer-centric view and delivers a balance between profit and value for both customers and service providers. The system will enable designers to assess the design and provide decision support and rationale at an early service design development stage. Also during the lifecycle of the service it would provide a better cost estimation for the service provider to support its future decisions. The two first chapters give an overview of the service field and the research area. Chapter 1, the introduction, states the aim and objectives of this research along with setting the field of the rationale behind the motivation and scope. Chapter 2, the literature review, gives a thorough overview of the service design area mentioning the theories, techniques, methodologies and methods that have been used directly or indirectly for service modeling/design. Chapter 3, the research methodology, states the rationale behind the decisions to conduct this research in terms of purpose, design, strategy and data collection techniques. Moreover an analysis of the current methodology structure which was based on the adaptation of the aforementioned decisions is provided. In Chapter 4 there is a comparison among three different methods (Service Explorer (SE), Integrated Service CAD and Life cycle simulator (ISCL) and Service Blueprinting (SB)) as identified from the literature, which have been developed specifically for service design. The comparison looks at the dynamic features of each method. A dynamic feature is a property of a service method that has the ability to capture specific elements of the service design process which are subject to continuously change within a specific timeframe. At first, there is a brief discussion on how each method is applied and what the output as a generic process is. It starts with identifying generic key concepts of the service design approach by applying all methods to a rental service scenario. Following that, we create a virtual service of a rental machine scenario and map the previously identified key concepts into specific elements of the rental service. We test all methods against these service concepts to identify how well and in what scope each one performs. A merging process of the service concepts is then carried out to form 4 categories which form the specific dynamic features. We test all methods against these features. In particular we find that, SB lacks dynamic capability. SE does well on prioritising individual customer requirements but provides neither a modular design process nor the ability to deal with changes during the service lifecycle. ISCL can provide a process for generating models by combining previously established building blocks and a life-cycle service simulation. However the resources are fixed and there is no prioritisation on the requirements. A pragmatic service deployment requires a service environment that is subject to change, which in turn is not provided by the current methods we compared. The purpose of Chapter 5 is to demonstrate an open source agent-based simulation language that could be used for service design and to simulate the Emergent Synthesis (ES) methodology. This methodology was identified from the literature search as a potential solution to the research gap presented in Chapter 4. That would act as a validation of using the proposed method in the service design area. For this reason a service market is being used as a modelling example. First the area of agent-based modelling is introduced. Certain modifications take place according to the modelling language needs. Next step is the justification and discussion about these changes. The Systems Modelling Language (SySML) is being introduced as a diagrammatic notation method according to which the altered service market model is being represented.

1916,Topic management for an engaging conversational agent,"We present an engagement-driven Topic Manager that enables a conversational agent to personalise the topics of interaction in human-agent information-giving chat. The Topic Selection component of this computational model decides what the agent should talk about and when. For this it takes into account the agent's dynamically updated perception of the user's engagement as well as the agent's own mental state. The Topic Transition component of the Topic Manager computes how the agent should introduce the topics in the ongoing interaction without loosing the coherence of the interaction. We have implemented the Topic Manager in a virtual agent, endowing it with the ability to adapt the topics of the interaction on the fly to promote the user's engagement. By means of an evaluation study we have found that third party observers perceive the actions of the Topic Manager in the agent's behaviour.","Glas, N.",0,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2018.07.007,703
1918,Are robots becoming unpopular? Changes in attitudes towards autonomous robotic systems in Europe,"Many societies are on the brink of a robotic era. In the near future, various autonomous computer systems are expected to be part of many people's daily lives. Because attitudes influence the adoption of new technologies, we studied the attitudes towards robots in the European Union between 2012 and 2017. Using representative samples from 27 countries (three waves, total N = 80,396), these analyses showed that, within five years, public opinions regarding robots exhibited a marked negative trend. Respondents became more cautious towards the use of robots. This tendency was particularly strong for robots at the workplace, which are, despite the drop, still more positively evaluated than robots performing surgeries or autonomous cars. Attitudes were more positive among men and people in white-collar jobs. Moreover, countries with a larger share of older citizens evaluated robotic assistance more favorably. In general, these results highlight increasing reservations towards autonomous robotic systems in Europe.","Gnambs, T.",0,10.1016/j.chb.2018.11.045,704
1920,"Humanizing chatbots: The effects of visual, identity and conversational cues on humanness perceptions","Chatbots are replacing human agents in a number of domains, from online tutoring to customer-service to even cognitive therapy. But, they are often machine-like in their interactions. What can we do to humanize chatbots? Should they necessarily be driven by human operators for them to be considered human? Or, will an anthropomorphic visual cue on the interface and/or a high-level of contingent message exchanges provide humanness to automated chatbots? We explored these questions with a 2 (anthropomorphic visual cues: high vs. low anthropomorphism) x 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low message interactivity) x 2 (identity cue: chat-bot vs. human) between-subjects experiment (N = 141) in which participants interacted with a chat agent on an e-commerce site about choosing a digital camera to purchase. Our findings show that a high level of message interactivity compensates for the impersonal nature of a chatbot that is low on anthropomorphic visual cues. Moreover, identifying the agent as human raises user expectations for interactivity. Theoretical as well as practical implications of these findings are discussed.","Go, E.",0,10.1016/j.chb.2019.01.020,705
1922,"A point of application study to determine the accuracy, precision and reliability of a low-cost balance plate for center of pressure measurement","Changes in postural sway measured via force plate center of pressure have been associated with many aspects of human motor ability. A previous study validated the accuracy and precision of a relatively new, low-cost and portable force plate called the Balance Tracking System (BTrackS). This work compared a laboratory-grade force plate versus BTrackS during human-like dynamic sway conditions generated by an inverted pendulum device. The present study sought to extend previous validation attempts for BTrackS using a more traditional point of application (POA) approach. Computer numerical control (CNC) guided application of similar to 155 N of force was applied five times to each of 21 points on five different BTrackS Balance Plate (BBP) devices with a hex-nose plunger. Results showed excellent agreement (ICC > 0.999) between the POAs and measured COP by the BBP devices, as well as high accuracy (<1% average percent error) and precision (<0.1 cm average standard deviation of residuals). The ICC between BBP devices was exceptionally high (ICC > 0.999) providing evidence of almost perfect inter-device reliability. Taken together, these results provide an important, static corollary to the previously obtained dynamic COP results from inverted pendulum testing of the BBP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

1926,,"Modern systems, such as robots or virtual agents, need to be able to plan their actions in increasingly more complex and larger state-spaces, incorporating many degrees of freedom. However, these high-dimensional planning problems often have low-dimensional representations that describe the problem well throughout most of the state-space. For example, planning for manipulation can be represented by planning a trajectory for the end-effector combined with an inverse kinematics solver through obstacle-free areas of the environment, while planning in the full joint space of the arm is only necessary in cluttered areas. Based on this observation, we have developed the framework for Planning with Adaptive Dimensionality, which makes effective use of state abstraction and dimensionality reduction in order to reduce the size and complexity of the state-space. It iteratively constructs and searches a hybrid state-space consisting of both abstract and non-abstract states. Initially the state-space consists only of abstract states, and regions of non-abstract states are selectively introduced into the state-space in order to maintain the feasibility of the resulting path and the strong theoretical guarantees of the algorithm—completeness and bounds on solution cost sub-optimality. The framework is able to make use of hierarchies of abstractions, as different abstractions can be more effective than others in different parts of the state-space. We have extended the framework to be able to utilize anytime and incremental graph search algorithms. Moreover, we have developed a novel general incremental graph search algorithm—tree-restoring weighted A*, which is able to minimize redundant computation between iterations while efficiently handling changes in the search graph. We have applied our framework to several different domains—navigation for unmanned aerial and ground vehicles, multi-robot collaborative navigation, manipulation and mobile manipulation, and navigation for humanoid robots.","Gochev, Kalin Vasilev",0,,707
1927,,"This master's thesis compares the memory allocation between the two virtual machines, namely Oracle and Jamaica VM. The basic difference of the architecture in both machines is that the Jamaica VM uses fixed-size blocks for allocating objects on the heap. This means that objects have to be split into several connected blocks if they become bigger than the block-size. This produces more overhead in garbage collection in terms time and memory. The thesis contains both theoretical and experimental analysis on the overhead of time and memory and attempts to find an answer to the question of which block-size would be recommended for any given program. The theoretical analysis is based on specifications of the two virtual machines and the experimental analysis is done with a modified JVMTI Agent together with the SPECjvm2008 Benchmark and specially designed ReadTextFileBenchmark. The results are summarized in a diagram. From this diagram, recommendation on the block size can be made for any specific data size.","Goffart, Markus Christian",0,,708
1928,,"Flows at large scales are capable of unmatched complexity. At large spatial scales, they can exhibit phenomena like waves, tornadoes, and a screaming concert audience; at high densities, they can create shockwaves, and can cause stampedes. Though strides have been made in simulating flows like fluids and crowds, extending these algorithms with scale poses challenges in ensuring accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. In this dissertation, I present novel techniques to simulate large-scale flows using coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian models that employ a combination of discretized grids and dynamic particle-based representations. I demonstrate how such models can efficiently simulate flows at large-scales, while maintaining fine-scale features. In fluid simulation, a long-standing problem has been the simulation of large-scale scenes without compromising fine-scale features. Though approximate multi-scale models exist, accurate simulation of large-scale fluid flow has remained constrained by memory and computational limits of current generation PCs. I propose a hybrid domain-decomposition model that, by coupling Lagrangian vortex-based methods with Eulerian velocity-based methods, reduces memory requirements and improves performance on parallel architectures. The resulting technique can efficiently simulate scenes significantly larger than those possible with either model alone. The motion of crowds is another class of flows that exhibits novel complexities with increasing scale. Navigation of crowds in virtual worlds is traditionally guided by a static global planner, combined with dynamic local collision avoidance. However, such models cannot capture long-range crowd interactions commonly observed in pedestrians. This discrepancy can cause sharp changes in agent trajectories, and sub-optimal navigation. I present a technique to add long-range vision to virtual crowds by performing collision avoidance at multiple spatial and temporal scales for both Eulerian and Lagrangian crowd navigation models, and a novel technique to blend both approaches in order to obtain collision-free velocities efficiently. The resulting simulated crowds show better correspondence with real-world pedestrians in both qualitative and quantitative metrics, while adding a minimal computational overhead. Another aspect of real-world crowds missing from virtual agents is their behavior at high densities. Crowds at such scales can often exhibit chaotic behavior commonly known as emph crowd turbulence; this phenomenon has the potential to cause mishaps leading to loss of life. I propose modeling inter-personal stress in dense crowds using an Eulerian model, coupled with a physically-based Lagrangian agent-based model to simulate crowd turbulence. I demonstrate how such a hybrid model can create virtual crowds whose trajectories show visual and quantifiable similarities to turbulent crowds in the real world. The techniques proposed in this thesis demonstrate that hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian modeling presents a versatile approach for modeling large-scale flows, such as fluids and crowds, efficiently on current generation PCs.","Golas, Abhinav",0,,709
1929,Feedback source modality effects on training outcomes in a serious game: Pedagogical agents make a difference,"The aim of this research is to enhance game-based training applications to support educational events in the absence of live instruction. The overarching purpose of the presented study was to explore available tools for integrating intelligent tutoring communications in game-based learning platforms and to examine theory-based techniques for delivering explicit feedback in such environments. The primary tool influencing the design of this research was the open-source Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), a modular domain-independent architecture that provides the tools and methods to author, deliver, and evaluate intelligent tutoring technologies within any instructional domain. Influenced by research surrounding social cognitive theory and cognitive load theory, the resulting experiment tested varying approaches for utilizing an Embodied Pedagogical Agent (EPA) to function as a tutor during interaction in a game-based training environment. Conditions were authored to assess the trade-offs between embedding an EPA directly in a game, embedding an EPA in GIFT's browser-based Tutor-User Interface (TUI), or using audio prompts alone with no social grounding. The resulting data supported the application of using an EPA embedded in GIFT's TUI to provide explicit feedback during a game-based learning event. Analyses revealed conditions with an EPA situated in the TUI to be as effective as embedding the agent directly in the game environment.

1931,An automated controlled-rearing method for studying the origins of movement recognition in newly hatched chicks,"Movement recognition is central to visual perception and cognition, yet its origins are poorly understood. Can newborn animals encode and recognize movements at the onset of vision, or does this ability have a protracted developmental trajectory? To address this question, we used an automated controlled-rearing method with a newborn animal model: the domestic chick (Gallus gallus). This automated method made it possible to collect over 150 test trials from each subject. In their first week of life, chicks were raised in controlled-rearing chambers that contained a single virtual agent who repeatedly performed three movements. In their second week of life, we tested whether chicks could recognize the agent's movements. Chicks successfully recognized both individual movements and sequences of movements. Further, chicks successfully encoded the order that movements occurred within a sequence. These results indicate that newborn visual systems can encode and recognize movements at the onset of vision and argue for an increased focus on automated controlled-rearing methods for studying the emergence of perceptual and cognitive abilities.","Goldman, J.

1933,,"This article explores the potential of complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory to inform behaviour change research. A CAS describes a collection of heterogeneous agents interacting within a particular context, adapting to each other’s actions. In practical terms, this implies that behaviour change is (1) socially and culturally situated; (2) highly sensitive to small baseline differences in individuals, groups, and intervention components; and (3) determined by multiple components interacting ‘chaotically’. Two approaches to studying CAS are briefly reviewed. Agent-based modelling is a computer simulation technique that allows researchers to investigate ‘what if’ questions in a virtual environment. Applied qualitative research techniques, on the other hand, offer a way to examine what happens when an intervention is pursued in real-time, and to identify the sorts of rules and assumptions governing social action. Although these represent very different approaches to complexity, there may be scope for mixing these methods – for example, by grounding models in insights derived from qualitative fieldwork. Finally, I will argue that the concept of CAS offers one opportunity to gain a deepened understanding of health-related practices, and to examine the social psychological processes that produce health-promoting or damaging actions.

1934,,"A steady decline in the use of residential real estate agents by homebuyers and sellers in favor of self-directed home buying and selling activities is affecting the relevance of services provided by residential real estate brokers and agents. The growth of informational real estate databases utilizing the Internet is outpacing technology adoption by real estate brokers and their agents. Access to real estate information in the public domain challenges the value proposition of the service provided by real estate agents that lack technological proficiency. Third-party organizations have entered the industry space with disruptive social media tools that include online home value calculators and loan qualification systems that surpass the technology services provided by real estate agents. As technology continues to evolve, one-dimensional technology such as the internet, virtual tours, photos, and some smart technologies have become baseline and others irrelevant. The objective of this research was to determine if there existed a statistically significant difference between smart technology adoption and the real estate agents age, gender, sales volume, and level of education. The Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) was applied to measure and explain attributes of smart technology adoption among real estate agents. The specific research questions in this study did not find a statistically significant difference between smart technology adoption and the real estate agents age, gender, sales volume, and level of education.

1935,,"This paper describes an interactive museum exhibit featuring an avatar of Alan Turing that informs museum visitors about artificial intelligence and Turing's seminal Turing Test for machine intelligence. The objective of the exhibit is to engage and motivate visiting children in the hope of sparking an interest in them about computer science and artificial intelligence, and cause them to consider pursuing future studies and/or careers in these fields. The exhibit interacts with the visitors, allowing them to participate in a simplified version of Turing's test that is brief and informal to suit the limitations of a five-minute exhibit. In this exhibit, the visitor (targeted towards middle school age children) invokes an avatar of his/her own choice, and acts to endow it with human-like qualities (voice, brain, eyesight and hearing). Then, the visitor engages the avatar in a (brief) question-and-answer session to determine whether the visitor thinks that he/she is interacting with a real human on a video conference or with an avatar. We consider this interaction to be an extension of the original Turing Test because, unlike Turing's original that used text via a teletype, this version features a graphical embodiment of an agent with which one can converse in spoken natural language. This extension serves to make passing the Turing Test more difficult, as now the avatar must not only communicate like a human, but also look, sound and act the part. It also makes the exhibit visual, dynamic and interesting to the visitors. Evaluations were performed with museum visitors, both in backrooms with prototypes as well as on the museum floor with the final version. The formative and summative evaluations performed indicated overall success in engaging the museum visitors and increasing their interest in computer science. More specifically, the formative testing, mostly done in quiet back rooms with selected test subjects, indicated that on the important questions about enjoyment of exhibit and increased interest in computer science by the test subjects, their self-reported Likert scale responses (1 being negative and 5 being positive) increased from 3.16 in the first evaluation to 4.38 in the third one for increased interest in CS. Likewise for the question about exhibit enjoyment (from 3.92 to 4.56). The summative evaluation, done through unobtrusive observation of exhibit use on museum floor, indicated that almost 74% of the parties that initiated the exhibit were either highly or moderately engaged by the exhibit. However, there was one major negative finding, namely the overly long duration of the exhibit, which may have caused premature abandonment of the exhibit in several cases during the summative evaluation. These tests and their results are presented and discussed in detail in this paper. The exhibit has been on permanent display at the Orlando (FL) Science Center since June 2014 and has received a strongly positive response from visitors since that time.","Gonzalez, Avelino J.",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-017-0144-1,714

1951,It Takes a (Virtual) Village: Exploring the Role of a Career Community to Support Sensemaking As a Proactive Socialization Practice,"Scholars have long advocated for individuals to play a more proactive role during organizational entry rather than relying on institutionally led processes. The primary benefit being that the newcomer moves from passive recipient, dependent on the institution to highlight relevant information, to active agent with self-determined sources and methods to aid in adjustment. A virtual career community made up of 12 first year business faculty members was created to provide such a self-determined source of support during the transition from doctoral studies to full-time assistant professorship. After the entry period (1 academic year), the interactions in this community were used as data for a phenomenon driven research study. The results illustrate how a virtual career community could be used as a proactive socialization tool by encouraging sensemaking amongst first year faculty peers. The sensemaking process consists of perceived contrasts and tensions, followed by positive and negative self-disclosures, community feedback, and the experience of cognitive-behavioral shifts. The findings also expand the proactive use of external referents during organizational entry, which previously had only looked at friends and family members of the newcomer.","Good, D.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00097,717

When the narrator Charlotte's parents conceived her through IVF, they froze an unused embryo, not knowing that before Charlotte's embryo was implanted, it had split in two. Twelve years later, the parents decide to implant this second embryo, resulting in the birth of Carolina, Charlotte's younger sister.

Charlotte, who resents these qualities in her sister, discovers an unusual gift: the ability to hurt Carolina by physically harming herself. As the novel plays out, the reader begins to realize that the damage Charlotte causes to her sister is a metaphor for the damage we cause ourselves by refusing to accept (or being unable to interrogate) our own core identities. As humans can never truly understand who we are or what made us that way, Charlotte desperately tries but fails to discover herself by using her sister as a mirror. The self, for Charlotte and for all of us, is ultimately unknowable.","Goodman, Jessy",0,,718
1954,Social behaviour as an emergent property of embodied curiosity: a robotics perspective,"Social interaction is an extremely complex yet vital component in daily life. We present a bottom-up approach for the emergence of social behaviours from the interaction of the curiosity drive, i.e. the intrinsic motivation to learn as much as possible, and the embedding environment of an agent. Implementing artificial curiosity algorithms in robots that explore human-like environments results in the emergence of a hierarchical structure of learning and behaviour. This structure resembles the sequential emergence of behavioural patterns in human babies, culminating in social behaviours, such as face detection, tracking and attention-grabbing facial expressions. These results suggest that an embodied curiosity drive may be the progenitor of many social behaviours if satiated by a social environment. This article is part of the theme issue 'From social brains to social robots: applying neurocognitive insights to human-robot interaction'.","Gordon, G.",0,10.1098/rstb.2018.0029,719
1955,Responsibilities of Kinship The Amborg Gaze in Speculative Fictions about Apes,"I consider four works of speculative fiction that demonstrate the shifting ways in which we think of our cousins the apes: Gustave Flaubert's ""Quidquid Volueris"" (1837), Franz Kafka's ""A Report to an Academy"" (1917), The One and Only Ivan by Katherine Applegate (2012), and We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves by Karen Joy Fowler (2013). Knitting together speculative fiction, primate studies, and ideas of the post-human with the present episteme of seeing the world in Venn diagrams, evaporating genres, and liminal zones, I want to examine how such works, despite their often significant differences, portray our relationships with and obligations to other primates in quite similar ways: by extending the meaning of personhood. The ""zone of occult instability"" of Franz Fanon, the ""contact zone"" of Mary Louise Pratt, and the ""shatter zone"" of Diane Loesch in postcolonial studies thus meet Brooks Landon's ""zone of possibility"" and Scott Bukatman's ""contested border zone"" in science fiction. These various zones, an uncanny valley, do not necessarily make other animals metaphors for our condition but they can help us confront our troubled relationship by using speculative fiction.","Gordon, J.",0,10.3828/extr.2016.14,720
1956,,"This dissertation presents the design, development and short-term evaluation of an embodied conversational agent designed to mentor human users. An embodied conversational agent (ECA) was created and programmed to mentor African American computer science majors on their decision to pursue graduate study in computing. Before constructing the ECA, previous research in the fields of embodied conversational agents, relational agents, mentorship, telementorship and successful mentoring programs and practices for African American graduate students were reviewed. A survey used to find areas of interest of the sample population. Experts were then interviewed to collect information on those areas of interest and a dialogue for the ECA was constructed based on the interview's transcripts. A between-group, mixed method experiment was conducted with 37 African American male undergraduate computer science majors where one group used the ECA mentor while the other group pursued mentoring advice from a human mentor. Results showed no significant difference between the ECA and human mentor when dealing with career mentoring functions. However, the human mentor was significantly better than the ECA mentor when addressing psychosocial mentoring functions.","Gosha, Kinnis",1,,721
1957,The acquisition of the get-passive,"This article examines children's comprehension of the get-passive relative to the be-passive in an attempt to systematically compare the acquisition of both types of passives. It discusses the findings of two experiments (a picture-matching task and an act-out task) with children ages 36. Results from the picture-matching task indicate that 3-year-olds are above chance only with get-passives with animate subjects, which suggests that early get-""passives"" may actually be (active) control structures requiring a thematic agent. Children 4-6 years old perform equally well with get and be. Results from the act-out task further reveal that children ages 4;02 and older interpret the by-phrase in nontruncated actional passives (with get and with be) and analyze it as agentive. This is consistent with a raising analysis for both passive types after the age of 4. There is no advantage to either type of passive at this point, contra previous claims in the literature.","Gotowski, M.",0,10.1080/10489223.2017.1391268,722
1958,,"Agent technology has become one of the most dynamic and interesting areas of computer science in recent years. The dynamism of this technology has resulted in computer-generated characters, known as pedagogical agents, entering the digital learning environments in increasing numbers. Commonly deployed in implementing tutoring strategies, these characters, through the manifestation of verbal and non-verbal communication behaviors, are able to engage students in meaningful learning experiences. Their social affordances and motivational benefits are seen as essential components in e-learning environment that lacks the presence of a social entity, leading to animated characters becoming a milestone in interactive e-learning environment. This paper reviews some of the agent technology software commonly used by designers to employ animated characters in pedagogical role. The review includes a brief explanation on features as well as operational procedures of selected agent software including MS Agent, Vox Proxy, Noah, Code Baby, Sitepal and Crazy Talk. The instructional strength and shortcomings of each software application is discussed and elaborated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)","Govindasamy, Malliga K.",0,,723
1959,Assessment with computer agents that engage in conversational dialogues and trialogues with learners,"This article describes conversation-based assessments with computer agents that interact with humans through chat, talking heads, or embodied animated avatars. Some of these agents perform actions, interact with multimedia, hold conversations with humans in natural language, and adaptively respond to a person's actions, verbal contributions, and emotions. Data are logged throughout the interactions in order to assess the individual's mastery of subject matters, skills, and proficiencies on both cognitive and noncognitive characteristics. There are different agent-based designs that focus on learning and assessment. Dialogues occur between one agent and one human, as in the case of intelligent tutoring systems. Three-party conversations, called trialogues, involve two agents interacting with a human. The two agents can take on different roles (such as tutors and peers), model actions and social interactions, stage arguments, solicit help from the human, and collaboratively solve problems. Examples of assessment with these agent-based environments are presented in the context of intelligent tutoring, educational games, and interventions to help struggling adult readers. Most of these involve assessment at varying grain sizes to guide the intelligent interaction, but conversation-based assessment with agents is also currently being used in high stakes assessments.

1963,EMOTIONS DURING THE LEARNING OF DIFFICULT MATERIAL,"Students experience a variety of emotions (or cognitive-affective states) when they are assigned difficult material to learn or problems to solve. We have documented the emotions that occur while college students learn and reason about topics in science and technology. The predominant learning-centered emotions are confusion, frustration, boredom, engagement/flow, curiosity, anxiety, delight, and surprise. A cognitive disequilibrium framework provides a reasonable explanation of why and how these emotions arise during difficult tasks. The student is in the state of cognitive disequilibrium when confronting impasses and obstacles, which launches a trajectory of cognitive-affective processes until equilibrium is restored, disequilibrium is dampened, or the student disengages from the task. Most of our work has been conducted in computerized learning environments (such as Auto Tutor and Operation Acquiring Research Investigative and Evaluative Skills! (ARIES)) that help students learn with pedagogical agents that hold conversations in natural language. An emotion-sensitive Auto Tutor detects student's emotions and adaptively responds in ways to enhance learning and motivation.","Graesser, A. C.",0,10.1016/b978-0-12-394293-7.00005-4,725
1965,Two Heads May Be Better Than One: Learning From Computer Agents in Conversational Trialogues,"Background: Pedagogical agents are computerized talking heads or embodied animated avatars that help students learn by performing actions and holding conversations with the students in natural language. Dialogues occur between a tutor agent and the student in the case of AutoTutor and other intelligent tutoring systems with natural-language conversation. The agents are adaptive to the students' actions, verbal contributions, and, in some systems, their emotions (such as boredom, confusion, and frustration). Focus of Study: This paper explores several designs of trialogues (two agents interacting with a human student) that have been productively implemented for particular students, subject matters, and depths of learning. The two agents take on different roles, but often serve as peers and tutors. There are different trialogue designs that address different pedagogical goals for different classes of students. For example, students can (a) observe vicariously two agents interacting, (b) converse with a tutor agent while a peer agent periodically chimes in, or (c) teach a peer agent while a tutor rescues a problematic interaction. In addition, agents can argue with each other over issues and ask what the human student thinks about the argument. Research Design: Trialogues have been developed for systematic experimental investigations in several studies that measure student impressions, learning gains from pretest to post-test on objective tests, and both cognitive and affective states during learning. The studies compare conditions with different pedagogical principles underlying the trialogues in order to assess the impact of these principles on student impressions, learning, emotions, and other psychological measures. Discourse analyses are performed on the language and actions in the log files in order to assess their impacts on psychological measures. Recommendations: Tests of these agent-based systems have shown improvements in learning gains and systematic influences on student emotions. In the future, researchers need to conduct more research to empirically evaluate the psychological impact of different trialogue designs on psychological measures. These trialogue designs range from scripted interactions between agents being observed by the student, to the student helping a fellow peer agent, to the student resolving an argument between two agents. The central question is whether the learning experiences and outcomes show improvement over typical human-computer dialogues (i.e., one human and one tutor agent) and conventional pedagogical interventions.","Graesser, A.

1968,Learning by Communicating in Natural Language With Conversational Agents,"Learning is facilitated by conversational interactions both with human tutors and with computer agents that simulate human tutoring and ideal pedagogical strategies. In this article, we describe some intelligent tutoring systems (e.g., AutoTutor) in which agents interact with students in natural language while being sensitive to their cognitive and emotional states. These systems include one-on-one tutorial dialogues, conversational trialogues in which two agents (a tutor and a peer) interact with a human student, and other conversational ensembles in which agents take on different roles. Tutorial conversations with agents have also been incorporated into educational games. These learning environments have been developed for different populations (elementary through high school students, college students, adults with reading difficulties) and different subjects spanning science, technology, engineering, mathematics, reading, writing, and reasoning. This article identifies some of the conversation patterns that are implemented in the dialogues and trialogues.","Graesser, A. C.",0,10.1177/0963721414540680,727
1971,,"This work addresses and aims to fulfill a very clear need in teaching biosystem engineering. When introducing students to the complexity of soil processes, one of the frustrations that teachers often experience is the impossibility to demonstrate practically, in the lab, some of the concepts and processes discussed in class. Either the experiments take far longer than a typical laboratory session or they require access to specific equipment. To deal with this situation, it would be ideal for students to be able to do virtual experiments. The purpose of this work is to display the individual-based simulation model INDISIM-SOM, available free from a website, and to show how it can be used in experiments or as a teaching-learning instrument in the classroom. The computational model has been designed specifically for the study of soil organic matter and is based mainly on the activity conducted by two different prototypes of microorganisms. One option of using INDISIM-SOM is as a way to introduce the individual-based model as a methodology to improve understanding of the agents involved in soil microbial system and their processes. Another option is to develop the ability to work with simulators by connecting concepts and helping students in the development of modelling competence. Virtual experiments were carried out as an example of what may be expected from using the INDISIM-SOM web simulator. Temporal evolutions of five virtual soils with diferent organic C content and proportional content in organic N, easily hidrolyzable N, nitrate and ammonia were generated and discussed.","Gras, Anna",0,,728
1974,,"In the competitive and fast-paced industry of residential real estate, digital marketing strategies must effectively meet the information needs and demands of the industry’s three key stakeholders: buyers, sellers, and agents. Digital house hunting is the predominant search strategy for prospective homebuyers who scour the Internet looking for homes to purchase. Property sellers and real estate professionals, whose shared end-goal is to transact a successful sale, must discern which digital marketing choices are optimal for marketing for-sale properties online in the digital channels where buyers are searching. A 2008 settlement agreement between the Department of Justice and the National Association of Realtors over concerns of anticompetitive policies relating to virtual office websites (VOWs) led to a shift in responsibility from the agent to the seller regarding which online marketing options will be associated with the online property listings. Real estate agents allocate time and resources to market properties on behalf of sellers, and need strategies that cater to buyers’ search preferences and sellers’ online marketing prerogatives while remaining effective and cost-efficient. Previous empirical studies using MLS data have considered the effects of seller marketing choices of real estate platforms and types of agents (i.e. full-service, flat-fee, etc.) as well as the impacts of a variety of agent marketing efforts on the market outcomes of sales price, time on the market, and the probability of sale. This research extends prior work by providing a quantitative analysis of the effects digital marketing choices of sellers (allowing “blogging” or third-party commentary) and digital marketing efforts of the agents (using a virtual tour) have on market outcomes. This analysis also includes a novel inquiry into what, if any, measurable effects the various platforms chosen for the virtual tours have on market outcomes.","Gravatt, Denise Hunter",0,,729
1975,Feeling robots and human zombies: Mind perception and the uncanny valley,"The uncanny valley-the unnerving nature of humanlike robots-is an intriguing idea, but both its existence and its underlying cause are debated. We propose that humanlike robots are not only unnerving, but are so because their appearance prompts attributions of mind. In particular, we suggest that machines become unnerving when people ascribe to them experience (the capacity to feel and sense), rather than agency (the capacity to act and do). Experiment 1 examined whether a machine's humanlike appearance prompts both ascriptions of experience and feelings of unease. Experiment 2 tested whether a machine capable of experience remains unnerving, even without a humanlike appearance. Experiment 3 investigated whether the perceived lack of experience can also help explain the creepiness of unfeeling humans and philosophical zombies. These experiments demonstrate that feelings of uncanniness are tied to perceptions of experience, and also suggest that experience-but not agency-is seen as fundamental to humans, and fundamentally lacking in machines.

1977,Wild jackdaws are wary of objects that violate expectations of animacy,"Nature is composed of self-propelled, animate agents and inanimate objects. Laboratory studies have shown that human infants and a few species discriminate between animate and inanimate objects. This ability is assumed to have evolved to support social cognition and filial imprinting, but its ecological role for wild animals has never been examined. An alternative, functional explanation is that discriminating stimuli based on their potential for animacy helps animals distinguish between harmless and threatening stimuli. Using remote-controlled experimental stimulus presentations, we tested if wild jackdaws (Corms moneclula) respond fearfully to stimuli that violate expectations for movement. Breeding pairs (N = 27) were presented at their nests with moving and non-moving models of ecologically relevant stimuli (birds, snakes and sticks) that differed in threat level and propensity for independent motion. Jackdaws were startled by movement regardless of stimulus type and produced more alarm calls when faced with animate objects. However, they delayed longest in entering their nest-box after encountering a stimulus that should not move independently, suggesting they recognized the movement as unexpected. How jackdaws develop expectations about object movement is not clear, but our results suggest that discriminating between animate and inanimate stimuli may trigger information gathering about potential threats.","Greggor, A.

1981,The Bolshevik Revolution and the Rise of Italian Fascism,"This article reviews the relationship between the Bolshevik revolution and that of Fascism. The central claim is that initially both revolutions were animated by Marxist inspiration. Both V. I. Lenin and Benito Mussolini were learned and committed Marxists. Both revolutions were a response to conditions that arose out of the Great War that between 1914 and 1918 involved all the major nations of Europe. Lenin insisted that Marxism demanded strict neutrality - and opposed Russia's involvement in the war. Mussolini, in turn, became an advocate of intervention in the struggle against Germany. The Bolshevik revolution resulted with the collapse of Russian resistance to the German invasion. Lenin led the surrender. Mussolini opposed Bolshevism primarily because it had advocated surrender while Allied forces were still critically engaged with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Mussolini recognized Bolshevism to have been the product of military defeat and the disintegration of Russia's defense and domestic security forces. He was convinced that Bolshevism could not have otherwise acceded to the control of Russia. Nonetheless, he was aware that Italians feared the possible advent of a form of Bolshevism and proceeded to mobilize citizenry around opposition to such an eventuality. Lenin's efforts to incite a radicalization of socialism in Italy by inserting his agents into the environment precipitated a predictable response - and Fascism, having scant successes in the immediate period following its founding, suddenly began exponential growth. Without the threat of Bolshevism, there probably would not have been a successful Fascist movement in Italy, and the history of Europe might well have been different.","Gregor, A. J.",0,,732
1982,Mobile Health Interventions: Exploring the Use of Common Relationship Factors,"The use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions has risen dramatically over the past two decades. It is important to consider mHealth intervention research within the broader therapy outcome literature. Among other key findings, this broader literature suggests that common relationship factors such as empathy, positive regard, and genuineness may play a critical role in therapy effectiveness. These findings raise intriguing questions for mobile interventions. For example, can mobile interventions incorporate aspects of common factors to augment their efficacy? Will the absence of relationship-based common factors make mobile interventions less effective? This viewpoint paper addresses these questions as well as related issues such as how to operationalize relationship qualities in the context of a mobile intervention and whether common relationship factors apply to computers or computerized narrators. The paper concludes by outlining a future research agenda guided by theory and empirical studies.","Grekin, E. R.",0,10.2196/11245,733

1994,Modeling the user state for context-aware spoken interaction in ambient assisted living,"Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems must provide adapted services easily accessible by a wide variety of users. This can only be possible if the communication between the user and the system is carried out through an interface that is simple, rapid, effective, and robust. Natural language interfaces such as dialog systems fulfill these requisites, as they are based on a spoken conversation that resembles human communication. In this paper, we enhance systems interacting in AAL domains by means of incorporating context-aware conversational agents that consider the external context of the interaction and predict the user's state. The user's state is built on the basis of their emotional state and intention, and it is recognized by means of a module conceived as an intermediate phase between natural language understanding and dialog management in the architecture of the conversational agent. This prediction, carried out for each user turn in the dialog, makes it possible to adapt the system dynamically to the user's needs. We have evaluated our proposal developing a context-aware system adapted to patients suffering from chronic pulmonary diseases, and provide a detailed discussion of the positive influence of our proposal in the success of the interaction, the information and services provided, as well as the perceived quality.","Griol, D.",0,10.1007/s10489-013-0503-z,737

The fusion approach allows to employ different recognizers and can be integrated as an additional module in the architecture of a spoken conversational agent, using the information generated as an additional input for the dialog manager to decide the next system response.

2008,State of the Art in Agent-Based Modeling of Urban Crime: An Overview,"ObjectivesAgent-based modeling (ABM) is a type of computer simulation that creates a virtual society and allows controlled experimentation. ABM has the potential to be a powerful tool for exploring criminological theory and testing the plausibility of crime prevention interventions when data are unavailable, when they would be unethical to collect, or when policy-makers need an answer quickly. This paper takes stock of the current literature to discuss the potential contributions of ABM, assess current practice, identify shortcomings that threaten the validity of findings using ABM, and to make suggestions regarding the construction and communication of future work using ABM.MethodsWe systematically searched major databases to find all publications using ABM to simulate urban crime patterns and coded publications to quantify the following information: (1) characteristics of the publication, the model and the agents, (2) model purpose, (3) crime type investigated, and (4) interrogation of the model via sensitivity testing and validation.ResultsAfter sifting papers according to our inclusion criteria, we identified and reviewed 45 publications. Models informed by the opportunity theory framework dominated. Most publications lacked detail sufficient to enable replication. Many did not include clear a rationale for modeling choices, parameter selection or calibration. Rarely were parameters calibrated using empirical data. Model validation was limited and inconsistent across papers.ConclusionsABM offers significant potential for criminological enquiry. However, at present, the lack of model detail reported in publications makes it difficult to assess where sufficient evidence exists to supportand where gaps limitthe development of models that reflect extant conditions and offender decision-making. For the field to progress, as a minimum, standardized reporting that encourages transparency will be necessary.","Groff, E. R.",0,10.1007/s10940-018-9376-y,742
2011,,"Infants’ ability to follow another person’s eye gaze has been studied extensively and is considered to be an important and early emerging social cognitive skill. However, it is not known whether young infants detect when a social partner follows their gaze to an object. This sensitivity might help infants in soliciting information from others and serve as an important basis for social learning. In this study, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure 5-month-old infants’ frontal and temporal cortex responses during social interactions in which a social partner (virtual agent) either followed the infants’ gaze to an object (congruent condition) or looked to an object that the infant had not looked at before (incongruent condition). The fNIRS data revealed that a region in the left prefrontal cortex showed an increased response when compared to baseline during the congruent condition but not during the incongruent condition, suggesting that infants are sensitive to when someone follows their gaze. The findings and their implications for the development of early social cognition are discussed in relation to what is known about the brain processes engaged by adults during these kinds of social interactions.

2014,Investigating social gaze as an action-perception online performance,"Gaze represents a major non-verbal communication channel in social interactions. In this respect, when facing another person, one's gaze should not be examined as a purely perceptive process but also as an action-perception online performance. However, little is known about processes involved in the real-time self-regulation of social gaze. The present study investigates the impact of a gaze-contingent viewing window on fixation patterns and the awareness of being the agent moving the window. In face-to-face scenarios played by a virtual human character, the task for the 18 adult participants was to interpret an equivocal sentence which could be disambiguated by examining the emotional expressions of the character speaking. The virtual character was embedded in naturalistic backgrounds to enhance realism. Eye-tracking data showed that the viewing window induced changes in gaze behavior, notably longer visual fixations. Notwithstanding, only half of the participants ascribed the window displacements to their eye movements. These participants also spent more time looking at the eyes and mouth regions of the virtual human character. The outcomes of the study highlight the dissociation between non-volitional gaze adaptation and the self-ascription of agency. Such dissociation provides support for a two-step account of the sense of agency composed of pre-noetic monitoring mechanisms and reflexive processes, linked by bottom-up and top-down processes. We comment upon these results, which illustrate the relevance of our method for studying online social cognition, in particular concerning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) where the poor pragmatic understanding of oral speech is considered linked to visual peculiarities that impede facial exploration.","Grynszpan, O.",0,10.3389/fnhum.2012.00094,744

Our goal is to study the cognitive network that emerges during a chat seance. We used the Derrida coefficient and the triangle structure under the working assumption that moods and perceived mutual affinity can produce results complementary to a full semantic analysis. The most outstanding outcome is the difference between the network obtained considering publicly exchanged messages and the one considering only privately exchanged messages: In the former case, the network is very homogeneous, in the sense that each individual interacts in the same way with all the participants, whilst in the latter the interactions among different agents are very heterogeneous, and are based on ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" strategy. Finally, a recent characterization of the triangular cliques has been considered in order to describe the intimate structure of the network. Experimental results confirm recent theoretical studies indicating that certain three-vertex structures can be used as indicators for the network aging and some relevant dynamical features.","Guazzini, A.",0,10.1142/s0219525912500841,745

The main cause of stagnation in that field was the neglect of knowledge accumulated in psychology of perception in general and in Gestalt psychology in particular. In this paper we demonstrate that by using principles of Gestalt psychology combined with basics of Linguistics (concepts of ""language of meaning"" and ""adequate language"") it is possible to come up with a computer program which works humanlike in quite a big domain of real images of outdoor scenes. The program demonstrates images by generating the first order description of the scene. In that program we implemented a number of new ideas in image processing: a) top-to-bottom segmentation by Dual Clustering (DC) algorithm, b) interpretation of an object depending on the nature of surrounding objects and their relative position (in complete accordance with Gestalt principle), c) defining algorithms for generalized notions—concepts (like ""sky"", ""green"", ""ground"" etc.) that could not be defined in the tradition of classical pattern recognition based on a set of examples. The developed program opens possibilities in constructing an image search engine—a program that searches the internet for images similar to one presented by the user. The results demonstrate once more that the principles of Gestalt psychology developed by the founding fathers mainly on dotted and lined images are completely applicable to any images. More than that—the history of Artificial Intelligence proves that progress in imitating abilities of human vision couldn't be achieved without implementing principles of Gestalt psychology.

2027,,"This ethnographic study investigates Yucatec Maya language revitalization pedagogy by focusing on the language planning implementation process and the crucial on-the-ground agents of this process, teachers. In the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, Spanish is the dominant language while Maya is a non-standardized indigenous minority language. This 10-month study investigated a large teacher education program, a Maya language course for 1,600 public school educators in the Indigenous Education System of the Yucatan Peninsula. Data included approximately 250 hours of classroom discourse, 33 interviews with teacher learners and other stakeholders, 9 focus groups, ethnographic field notes, and surveys, which were analyzed using ethnographically-grounded discourse analytic methods. Although standard Maya does not exist either officially or in practice, participants in this Maya language course repeatedly expressed concerns with various aspects of standard language. The concept of standard language, drawing on Widdowson (1994), offered a theoretical framework through which to analyze these findings. Diverse stakeholders understood the notion of standard Maya differently, and three distinct conceptualizations of standard Maya emerged from the data. The first is a top-down institutional standard, las nuevas normas de la lengua maya (""the new standards for Maya language""). These include official norms of spelling, grammar, lexicon, and pronunciation that linguists and government institutions are in the process of establishing. The second, jach maya (""real Maya""), is an illusory prestige variety that teachers idealize. Jach maya is associated with a semi-mystical Maya of the past and an ideology of linguistic purity. A third conceptualization of the standard, ""A Maya that Flows,"" is based on vernacular Maya and includes borrowings from Spanish, unlike las normas or jach maya. Analysis suggests that a vernacular-based standard is the most viable from a linguistic perspective. Additionally, in the pedagogical implementation of language planning, awareness of issues surrounding linguistic standardization is an invaluable component of language teacher expertise.","Guerrettaz, Anne Marie",0,,748

The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of this music intervention to the management of patients with chronic pain. Methods: A controlled, single-blind, randomized trial was used. Eighty-seven patients presenting with lumbar pain, fibromyalgia, inflammatory disease, or neurological disease were included in the study. During their hospitalization, the intervention arm (n = 44) received at least 2 daily sessions of music listening between D0 and D10, associated with their standard treatment, and then pursued the music intervention at home until D60 using a multimedia player in which the music listening software program had been installed. The control arm received standard treatment only (n = 43). The end points measured at D0, D10, D60, and D90 were: pain (VAS), anxiety-depression (HAD) and the consumption of medication.

2038,Rationale and design of the Atrial Fibrillation health Literacy Information Technology Trial: (AF-LITT),"Background: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia that is challenging for patients and adversely impacts health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Long-term management of AF requires that patients adhere to complex therapies, understand difficult terminology, navigate subspecialty care, and have continued symptom monitoring with the goal of preventing adverse outcomes. Continued interventions to ameliorate the patient experience of AF are essential. Design: The Atrial Fibrillation health Literacy Information Technology Trial (AF-LITT; NCT03093558) is an investigator-initiated, 2-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT). This RCT is a pilot in order to implement a novel, smartphone-based intervention to address the patient experience of AF. This pilot RCT will compare a combination of the Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) and the Alive Cor Kardia Mobile heart rhythm monitor to the current standard of care. The study will enroll 180 adults with non-valvular AF who are receiving anticoagulation for stroke prevention and randomize them to receive a 30-day intervention (smartphone-based ECA/Kardia) or standard of care, which will include a symptom and adherence journal. The primary end-points are improvement in HRQoL and self-reported adherence to anticoagulation. The secondary end-points are the acceptability of the intervention to participants, its use by participants, and acceptability to referring physicians. Conclusions: The AF-LITT pilot aims to evaluate the efficacy of the ECA/Kardia to improve HRQoL and anticoagulant adherence, and to guide its implementation in a larger, multicenter clinical trial. The intervention has potential to improve HRQoL, adherence, and health care utilization in individuals with chronic AF.","Guhl, E. N.",0,10.1016/j.cct.2017.09.005,750
2045,,"In this dissertation, we address predictive learning in the context of 3D human motion prediction — forecasting human motion from hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds given a historical skeleton sequence. This ability is missing in modern artificial intelligent systems. State-of-the-art deep learning based approaches typically formulate the task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and solve it by using recurrent encoder-decoder neural networks. Despite notable successes, these existing approaches suffer from prediction discontinuity, rely on extensive annotated motion capture data, are brittle to novel actions, and do not perform well in longer time horizons due to error accumulation and uncertainty. We focus on human-like motion prediction so that the predicted sequences are more plausible, realistic, and temporally coherent with past sequences in both short-term and long-term situations for a variety of actions. Our key insight is to exploit the rich yet implicit structural dependencies and regularities within motion sequences, including geometric, temporal, model parameter, and contextual structures without any additional supervision. In this spirit, we tackle key technical challenges and explore complementary perspectives. We integrate these perspectives into a deep learning based prediction framework, and leverage group theory, adversarial learning, meta-learning, and attention mechanism to acquire the desired structural information. We start by addressing the fidelity and continuity in deterministic prediction. We incorporate local geometric structure constraints through a frame-wise geodesic loss on a Lie group. Further, we simultaneously validate the sequence-level plausibility of the prediction and its coherence with the input sequence by introducing two global recurrent discriminators together with adversarial learning. Next, we consider a crucial yet under-explored issue, namely, the small sample size problem. We deal with, which we believe for the first time, the few-shot prediction and propose a general proactive and adaptive meta-learning framework that enables rapid generation of a task-specific prediction model for a novel action from few annotated motion sequences. A third problem we tackle is the uncertainty and stochasticity inherent in long-term prediction. We predict multiple plausible future sequences through multiple choice learning over an ensemble of attention-based predictors. Each of the predictors produces a context-dependent prediction by paying attention to different spatial and temporal evolutions of the past motion. We benchmark our results with the largest-scale, widely-used Human 3.6M dataset. We show that our approaches significantly outperform current state-of-the-art results under various criteria. Finally, we deploy our prediction models into practical systems, such as (1) teaching a humanoid robot ""Pepper"" to interact with a human by predicting and mimicking how the human moves or acts, and (2) synthesizing and animating human motion with a virtual human body ""Adam"" on Unity, a graphics rendering platform.","Gui, Liangyan",0,,751
2046,Swimming with mermaids: Communication and social density in the Second Life merfolk community,"While individuals are solicited by a growing number of online networks and virtual communities, human cognitive resources are still limited in terms of the number of fruitful interactions a given individual can sustain. With a high degree of competition for attention, affiliation with the community and communication between its members are central for the survival of virtual communities. A particular virtual community could shed a new light on these phenomena. Indeed, beside the conventional communities based on human-like land-dwelling avatars, a merfolk community spontaneously emerged in the seas of the virtual world of Second Life. The fact that merfolk avatars characteristics strongly restrain their interactions with others and their ability to simultaneously join other communities obviously impacts the structuring and communication within the merfolk community. In order not to become isolated, the members have to develop optimal strategies to keep strong bonds, which in turn reinforce the immersion process. The Second Life merfolk community therefore provides an ideal model to study how members of a virtual community can compensate for ultra-specialization by increasing the quality of the internal communication processes within the community. Furthermore, the observation of the merfolk virtual community demonstrates how optimizing communication, even in a community with a wide repartition and low actual density within the virtual world, can reinforce social density.

2047,Affect in Embodied Pedagogical Agents: Meta-Analytic Review,"Over the past decade, computer games and other interactive technologies have shown great potential when used in innovative ways to enhance learning. It is now known that learning is associated not only with cognitive ability but also with affect. The incorporation of affective embodied pedagogical agents (EPAs) in computer programs for learning can significantly influence learner beliefs and efficacy. However, there have been a number of criticisms and contradictory empirical findings calling into question earlier results and theoretical claims on the effectiveness of using EPAs. Therefore, this paper reviewed studies that evaluated the effectiveness of affect in EPAs in a computer-based learning environment (CLE). The statistical meta-analytic review (k=30, n=2,150) found that the use of affect in EPAs has a significant and moderate impact (r=.35) on students' learning motivation and a relatively smaller impact on knowledge retention (r=.29) and knowledge transfer (r=.26). The effect sizes of the three outcome variables in this review are stronger compared with previous meta-analysis on the impact of the embodiment level of EPAs, indicating that the use of affect is more desirable and effective in CLEs. Finally, implications for both designers and researchers of using affective EPAs in CLEs are discussed.","Guo, Y. R.",1,10.1177/0735633115588774,753
2049,Evaluation of affective embodied agents in an information literacy game,"Digital game-based learning (DGBL) has become increasingly popular. With elements such as narratives, rewards, rules, and interactivity, DGBL can actively engage learners, stimulating desired learning outcomes. In an effort to increase its appeal, affective embodied agents (EAs) have been incorporated into DGBL as learning companions or instructors. However, claims about the efficacy of using affective EAs in DGBL have scarcely been subjected to empirical analysis. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influence of affective EAs on students' learning outcome, motivation, enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention in an information literacy (IL) game. In total, 159 tertiary students were recruited and randomly assigned in a pre-test post-test between-subjects experiment with three conditions: affective-EA, neutral-EA, and no-EA. Results suggested that students benefited from interacting with the affective EA in the IL game, in terms of learning motivation, enjoyment, perceived usefulness and behavioral intention. However, there was no significant difference in learning outcome. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Guo, Y. R.",1,10.1016/j.compedu.2016.09.013,754
2051,Tertiary students' acceptance of a game to teach information literacy,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate tertiary students' acceptance of digital game-based learning (DGBL). Specifically, it investigated the influence of learning motivation, enjoyment, and perceived usefulness on students' behavioral intention to play an information literacy (IL) game. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 150 tertiary students were recruited to play an IL game, and fill in a survey questionnaire. Multiple linear regression was performed. Findings - Results indicated that attention, satisfaction, affective enjoyment, and perceived usefulness were significant determinants for the behavioral intention to play IL games. However, relevance, confidence, cognitive enjoyment, and behavioral enjoyment were not found to predict their behavioral intention. Research limitations/implications - The authors did not consider other factors in the hypotheses, such as the mediating effects of enjoyment on behavioral intention, and the influence of students' individual characters such as learning styles or personalities on their behavioral intention of using DGBL. Further, the IL game used in the study, Library Escape, may reduce generalizability of the results. The study used self-reported attitudinal data from survey questionnaires, while behavioral data were not considered. Practical implications - The results showed that pedagogical features, enjoyment factors, and perceived usefulness remain critical in the uptake of IL games by students. Further, the study demonstrated that instead of behavioral or cognitive dimensions of enjoyment, players are more concerned with affective enjoyment. Hence, developing DGBL with affective features should be pursued. Originality/value - By taking into consideration both pedagogical and gameplay characteristics of DGBL to explain students' acceptance of IL games, this study integrates and extends previous studies in the context of IL games. Additionally, instead of using perceived enjoyment as a single dimensional construct, this study adopted a multifaceted, more nuanced perspective on the perceived enjoyment of DGBL.","Guo, Y.

2054,The effectiveness and acceptance of an affective information literacy tutorial,"Due to the ready access to large amounts of information afforded by the Internet, information literacy (IL) has taken on an important role. Recent developments in affective computing have provided more opportunities in the way online IL education can be delivered. However, research on how affective computing can be used in IL education is lacking. The research objectives of this study are therefore twofold: to investigate the influence of affective embodied agents (EAs) on students' motivation, enjoyment, knowledge retention and intention to use; and to uncover factors influencing their intention to use an online IL tutorial with affective EAs. To achieve these objectives, 285 university students were recruited to participate in a betweensubjects experiment (text-only, non-affective EAs, and affective EAs), including completing an IL tutorial and a post-test questionnaire. The results suggested that students benefited from the added use of an affective EA in the IL tutorials, in terms of learning motivation and enjoyment. Moreover, relevance, confidence, satisfaction, affective enjoyment, and behavioral enjoyment were found to be significant predictors for intention to use an IL tutorial with affective EM.

2059,,"A multi-agent scenario generation framework is designed, implemented and evaluated in the context of a preventive medicine education virtual reality system with data collected from a sensor network at the University of Iowa Hospital. An agent in the framework is a virtual human that represents a healthcare worker. The agent is able to make certain decisions based on the information it gathers from its surroundings in the virtual environment. Distributed sensor networks are becoming very commonplace in public areas for public safety and surveillance purposes. The data collected from these sensors can be visualized in a multi-agent simulation. The various components of the framework include generation of unique agents from the sensor data and low level behaviors such as path determination, directional traffic flows, collision avoidance and overtaking. The framework also includes a facility to prevent foot slippage with detailed animations during the travel period of the agents. Preventive medicine education is the process of educating health care workers about procedures that could mitigate the spread of infections in a hospital. We built an application called the 5 Moments of Hand Hygiene that educates health care workers on the times they are supposed to wash their hands when dealing with a patient. The purpose of the application was to increase the compliance rates of this CDC mandated preventive measure in hospitals across the nation. A user study was performed with 18 nursing students and 5 full-time nurses at the Clemson University School of Nursing to test the usability of the application developed and the realism of the scenario generation framework. The results of the study suggest that the behaviors generated by the framework are realistic and believable enough for use in preventive medicine education applications.","Gupta, Manan",0,,757
2060,,"This dissertation analyzes three important problems in purchasing operations. Below, we briefly summarize each problem: In the first chapter, we focus on designing optimal descending mechanisms for constrained procurement. Descending mechanisms for procurement (or, ascending mechanisms for selling) have been well-recognized for their simplicity from the viewpoint of bidders—they require less bidder sophistication as compared to sealed-bid mechanisms. We consider procurement under each of two types of constraints: (1) Individual/Group Capacities: Limitations on the amounts that can be sourced from individual and/or subsets of suppliers, and (2) Business Rules: Lower and upper bounds on the number of suppliers to source from, and on the amount that can be sourced from any single supplier. We analyze two procurement problems, one that incorporates individual/group capacities and another that incorporates business rules. In each problem, we consider a buyer who wants to procure a fixed quantity of a product from a set of suppliers, where each supplier is endowed with a privately-known constant marginal cost. The buyer's objective is to minimize her total expected procurement cost. For both problems, we present descending auction mechanisms that are optimal mechanisms. We then show that these two problems belong to a larger class of mechanism design problems with constraints specified by polymatroids, for which we prove that optimal mechanisms can be implemented as descending mechanisms. In the second chapter, we propose a modification of the well-known Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism and investigate its optimality in the context of procurement. It is well-known that the VCG mechanism is optimal for a buyer procuring one unit from a set of symmetric suppliers. For procuring a unit from asymmetric suppliers, Myerson's optimal mechanism can be interpreted as a transformation of the VCG mechanism—both in terms of its allocation and payment—using the virtual cost function. For a more general setting in which multiple units need to be procured from asymmetric suppliers under an arbitrary set of feasibility constraints, we analyze the same transformation of the VCG mechanism. We show that this mechanism is optimal if the feasible region is a polymatroid. We also present an example of a non-polymatroidal feasible region for which this mechanism is sub-optimal. The third chapter considers governmental procurement of food crops from farmers in developing countries and examines the impact of several operational features on the selling behavior of the farmers. Among the various governmental schemes that support agriculture, support prices have been adopted by many developing countries. A support price for an agricultural crop is a guaranteed price at which a governmental entity agrees to purchase that crop from farmers. Despite this surety, the surprising practice of ""distressed selling"" has been widely observed in practice: Farmers sell a significant portion of their crops to outside agents at prices much lower than the support price. We build a tractable stochastic dynamic programming model that captures the salient features of the ground realities—limited as well as uncertain procurement capacity, high holding costs for the farmers, and lack of affordable credit—that conspire to induce distressed selling and, consequently, a significant loss of welfare of the farmers. Using real data on procurement under a support-price program, we establish the accuracy of our model's prediction on the volume of distressed sales. Finally, we show how our model and its solution can serve as a simple and useful tool for policy-makers to assess the relative impact of the improvements in the main determinants of distressed sales.","Gupta, Shivam",0,,758

2063,From Edison to Pixar: The spectacular screen and the attention economy from celluloid to CG,"This article argues that Pixar's computer generated (CG) animated features of the past 15 years sit at a crossroads in both the conceptualization of viewers and their socialization to the contemporary digital screen. Embedded within a new aesthetic visual form, almost all of Pixar's movies feature, and talk back to, the emergence of the mythical astonished cinema spectator. At the same time, Pixar's features question the future of digital spectacle and the position of the screen subject. In the contemporary context of the social network and the online video, CG animated features do not simply prepare young viewers for a world of consumer behaviour, they prepare them for a multilayered world of digital screens in which they must learn to function as objects of consumption as well as consuming agents. Beyond this, however, and in contrast to previous Disney features, Pixar movies prepare young consumers for a changed production landscape in contemporary culture. Moving beyond notions of Fordist production that structured previous discourses of the viewing and socialized child, the spectacular specificity of Pixar movies is now structured self-reflexively according to the logic of the attention economy.","Gurevitch, L.",0,10.1080/10304312.2014.986062,760

As a consequence, business travel has increased considerably over the past few decades, and large companies and public authorities often employ travel managers to implement efficient travel routines. The present paper investigates the professional practice of travel management. Using interviews, policy documents and existing literature, it examines recent developments in this field and identifies a number of dilemmas and challenges that travel managers experience in their attempts to control travel behaviour and travel costs in their organizations. These dilemmas occur in travel managers' relations with other stakeholders in the business travel process - travellers, senior managers, suppliers, and travel agents. An additional dilemma concerns the role of 'virtual meetings' (via telephone, video or the Web) and their potential to serve as substitutes for or complements to travel and face-to-face meetings.

2066,Creation of a new set of dynamic virtual reality faces for the assessment and training of facial emotion recognition ability,"The ability to recognize facial emotions is target behaviour when treating people with social impairment. When assessing this ability, the most widely used facial stimuli are photographs. Although their use has been shown to be valid, photographs are unable to capture the dynamic aspects of human expressions. This limitation can be overcome by creating virtual agents with feasible expressed emotions. The main objective of the present study was to create a new set of dynamic virtual faces with high realism that could be integrated into a virtual reality (VR) cyberintervention to train people with schizophrenia in the full repertoire of social skills. A set of highly realistic virtual faces was created based on the Facial Action Coding System. Facial movement animation was also included so as to mimic the dynamism of human facial expressions. Consecutive healthy participants (n = 98) completed a facial emotion recognition task using both natural faces (photographs) and virtual agents expressing five basic emotions plus a neutral one. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no significant difference in participants' accuracy of recognition between the two presentation conditions. However, anger was better recognized in the VR images, and disgust was better recognized in photographs. Age, the participant's gender and reaction times were also explored. Implications of the use of virtual agents with realistic human expressions in cyberinterventions are discussed.","Gutierrez-Maldonado, J.",0,10.1007/s10055-013-0236-7,763
2069,,"Simulation of human crowds can create plausible human trajectories, predict likely flows of pedestrians, and has application in areas such as games, movies, safety planning, and virtual environments. This dissertation presents new crowd simulation methods based on geometric techniques. I will show how geometric optimization techniques can be used to efficiently compute collision-avoidance constraints, and use these constraints to generate human-like trajectories in simulated environments. This process of reacting to the nearby environment is known as local navigation and it forms the basis for many crowd simulation techniques, including those described in this dissertation. Given the importance of local navigation computations, I devote much of this dissertation to the derivation, analysis, and implementation of new local navigation techniques. I discuss how to efficiently exploit parallelization features available on modern processors, and show how an efficient parallel implementation allows simulations of hundreds of thousands of agents in real time on many-core processors and tens of thousands of agents on multi-core CPUs. I analyze the macroscopic flows which arise from these geometric collision avoidance techniques and compare them to flows seen in real human crowds, both qualitatively (in terms of flow patterns) and quantitatively (in terms of flow rates). Building on the basis of these strong local navigation models, I further develop many important extensions to the simulation framework. Firstly, I develop a model for global navigation which allows for more complex scenarios by accounting for long-term planning around large obstacles or emergent congestion. Secondly, I demonstrate methods for using data-driven approaches to improve crowd simulations. These include using real-world data to automatically tune parameters, and using perceptual user study data to introduce behavioral variation. Finally, looking beyond geometric avoidance based crowd simulation methods, I discuss methods for objectively evaluating different crowd simulation strategies using statistical measures. Specifically, I focus on the problem of quantifying how closely a simulation approach matches real-world data. I propose a similarity metric that can be applied to a wide variety of simulation approaches and datasets. Taken together, the methods presented in this dissertation enable simulations of large, complex humans crowds with a level of realism and efficiency not previously possible.","Guy, Stephen J.",0,,764
2070,Detecting Neolithic Burial Mounds from LiDAR-Derived Elevation Data Using a Multi-Scale Approach and Machine Learning Techniques,"Airborne LiDAR technology is widely used in archaeology and over the past decade has emerged as an accurate tool to describe anthropomorphic landforms. Archaeological features are traditionally emphasised on a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using multiple Visualisation Techniques (VTs), and occasionally aided by automated feature detection or classification techniques. Such an approach offers limited results when applied to heterogeneous structures (different sizes, morphologies), which is often the case for archaeological remains that have been altered throughout the ages. This study proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a multi-scale analysis of topographic position combined with supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). Rather than highlighting individual topographic anomalies, the multi-scalar approach allows archaeological features to be examined not only as individual objects, but within their broader spatial context. This innovative and straightforward method provides two levels of results: a composite image of topographic surface structure and a probability map of the presence of archaeological structures. The method was developed to detect and characterise megalithic funeral structures in the region of Carnac, the Bay of Quiberon, and the Gulf of Morbihan (France), which is currently considered for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. As a result, known archaeological sites have successfully been geo-referenced with a greater accuracy than before (even when located under dense vegetation) and a ground-check confirmed the identification of a previously unknown Neolithic burial mound in the commune of Carnac.","Guyot, A.",0,10.3390/rs10020225,765
2073,Voices in and of the machine: Source orientation toward mobile virtual assistants,"Research regarding source orientation has demonstrated that when interacting with computers, people direct their communication toward and react toward the technology itself. Users perceive technology to be a source in human-machine communication (HMC). This study provides a new dimension to those findings with regard to source orientation with voice-based, mobile virtual assistants enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). In qualitative interviews regarding their conceptualizations of mobile conversational agents (Apple's Siri, Google Voice, Samsung S-Voice) and their perceptions of interactions with these specific technologies, some participants describe the agent they can hear but not see as a voice in the mobile phone (assistant as distinct entity) while others perceive the technology that they command to be the voice of the phone (assistant as the device). Therefore, congruent with existing research, users of mobile assistants orient toward a technology, instead of thinking they are interacting with a human, but, in contrast to existing research, attend to different technologies. When technologies possess a disembodied voice and are designed with various social cues and degrees of intelligence, the locus and nature of the digital interlocutor is not uniform in people's minds.","Guzman, A.

2075,Scaffolding mentalizing via a play-&-learn game for preschoolers,"Educational software in which the student takes the role of teacher and instructs a digital tutee a so-called teachable agent has repeatedly proven to have positive effects for school children's learning. In a study with 39 preschoolers aged 3:9 to 6:3, we explored the conditions under which children this young would benefit as well from this kind of educational software. We specifically investigated to what extent children of this age group would be able to reason about and reflect upon the actions of their digital tutee, and to what extent they would enjoy an educational game centered around instructing and helping a digital tutee. Results revealed that preschoolers were quite capable of reasoning and reflecting upon their digital tutee. This was rather surprising, since the results of a standardized false-belief test did not indicate this level of mentalizing capabilities in the group as a whole. The results also indicated that the preschoolers, like older children, were interested and engaged in this kind of game that involves instructing a digital tutee. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2079,,"The Believe It! program developed and evaluated by Kovalski & Horan (1999) was the first interactive, multimedia, psychological-education intervention deployed on the Internet. In a controlled study, the authors reported that the ethnically diverse cartoon models were partially successful in using cognitive restructuring to promote more reasonable career beliefs among Caucasian middle-school young women. It was not clear if the program’s lack of efficacy among minority young women was due to computer literacy factors affected by SES. Subsequently, four studies explored the role of matching or mismatching the ethnicity of animated agents in a graphically enhanced program with young women receiving the cognitive restructuring treatment. Each of the studies used the same four outcome measures (Occupational Sex-Role Questionnaire, Believe It Measure, Career Beliefs Inventory, and the Career Myths Scale) before and after matched and mismatched participants received the Believe It! intervention. Webster (2010) analyzed data from African-American participants, Hardy (2011) Latinas, Zhang (2013) Asian-Americans, and Hacker (2014) ethnically isolated Caucasian young women. The current article reports that the results of these four studies are consistent with similar research involving live counselor and client dyads (e.g., Cabral & Smith, 2011). The Believe It! program had a clear impact on ethnically matched African-American young women, whereas pairings on ethnicity produced, at best, marginally improved outcomes for Latinas, Asian-Americans, and ethnically isolated Caucasian young women.

2086,Dynamic model for pedestrian crossing in congested traffic based on probabilistic navigation function,"More than 1.2 million people die in road crashes each year, and more than 20 million are severely injured, making it the 9th leading cause of death in the world (2.2% of all deaths globally). Pedestrian deaths comprise more than 35% of road accident deaths, mostly as a result of pedestrian-vehicle crashes. This paper proposes a new model for formulating the dynamics of the interaction between drivers and pedestrians at congested conflict spots where drivers and/or pedestrians do not closely follow the traffic laws and regulations. In this type of spots, characterized by heavy traffic, pedestrians and vehicles interact in close proximity, often requiring sharp and aggressive maneuvers to avoid crashes. The model is based on the Probabilistic Navigation Function (PNF), originally developed for robotics motion planning, that constructs a trajectory according to the probabilistic collision risks. According to this model, pedestrians construct a virtual risk map that assigns the entire crossing area with probabilities for a collision with vehicles, and then select their actions based on their perceived probability for collision. Many accidents can be interpreted in terms of the proposed model, either as a result of incorrect perception of risks, or, despite proper estimation of risks, by a wrong choice of collision maneuvers. The development of the model follows a theoretical and experimental investigation of pedestrian/vehicle interactions at crosswalks. The model is implemented in an agent-based simulation system for pedestrian/driver interaction, and is validated using video clips taken at several congested road spots. It can be used for analyzing the effect of changes in location architecture and traffic regulations for each spot. The model can also serve as a standard tool in simulations for assessing accident risks in urban environments. Finally, it can be utilized in control systems of autonomous vehicles and in drivers' on-board alert systems.","Hacohen, S.",0,10.1016/j.trc.2017.10.024,770
2089,Curriculum design in theology and development: Human agency and the prophetic role of the church,"The field of theology and development is a relatively new sub-discipline within theological studies in Africa. The first formal postgraduate programme was introduced at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, during the mid-1990s. In the early years, it was known as the Leadership and Development programme and, since 2000, as the Theology and Development programme. Over the past 20 years, this programme has graduated over 160 BTh Honours, 100 MTh and 15 PhD students. This article outlines the history of the programme, addresses its ideological orientation, pedagogical commitments and preferences in curriculum design. It further argues that theological reflection on 'development' must seek to understand the prophetic role of the church in responding to the complexities of the social issues facing the African continent. Key to this discussion is the contested nature of 'development' and the need for theological perspectives to engage this contestation through a social analysis of the global structures of injustice. This requires an engagement with the social sciences. It is this engagement of the social sciences with theological reflection, the article argues, that has enabled the students who have graduated from the Theology and Development programme at the University of KwaZulu-Natal to assist the church and faith-based organisations to become effective agents of social transformation.","Haddad, B.",0,10.4102/hts.v72i4.3432,771
2091,,"This thesis critically analyzes installations of telepresence art since 1986 and argues that the phenomological experience of engagement in telepresence suggests a new state of subjectivity at the end of the twentieth century: the hyper-subject, an overlapping of self and multiple others. I place telepresence art firmly in the genealogy of Surrealism by comparing artworks to Hans Bellmer's infinitely recombinant doll, La Poupee. While Bellmer represented the physical anagram of the body through the doll, telepresence art produces psychic anagrams of participants in the virtual sphere. Installations of telepresence art by multiple artists are probed to critically engage the artistic design of each, including humanoid telerobots, screen-based telepresence, and human avatars, and to assess their efficacy in upholding telepresence as what Lombard and Ditton define as “the perceptual illusion of non-mediation.” By integrating psychoanalysis, post-anthropocentric posthumanism, and feminist disability theory, I examine telepresence art as a platform for social change. This research contributes the first art historical application of the uncanny valley to telepresence artworks, the first comparison of telepresence art to Bellmer's La Poupee, and advocates for more art historical research on the hyper-subject as a new state of viewing and experiencing art in the twenty-first century.","Haden, Heather",0,,772
2093,Welfare-maximizing assignment of agents to hierarchical positions,"We allocate agents to three kinds of hierarchical positions: top, medium, and low. No monetary transfers are allowed. We solve for the incentive-compatible (IC) mechanisms that maximize a family of weighted social welfares that includes utilitarian and Rawlsian welfares. When the market is tough (all agents bear positive risk of obtaining a low position in any IC and feasible mechanism), then the pseudomarket mechanism with equal budgets (PM) and the Boston mechanism without priorities (BM) yield identical assignments which are always optimal. Otherwise, when the market is mild, PM and BM differ and each one implements the optimal rule under different assumptions on the curvature of virtual valuations. We also establish that both BM and PM mechanisms guarantee IC Pareto-optimal assignments for a domain of preference distributions satisfying weak assumptions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

2095,,"With the advancement in agent technology and social recognition and acceptance of autonomous online services we foresee increasing use of agents in social contexts and, in particular, in human-agent virtual and ad hoc team applications. For such virtual ad hoc teams, particularly those where explicit coordination to determine task allocations are infeasible due to communication and time constraints, to be effective, agents need to quickly develop an understanding of the expectation of human team members and be able to quickly adapt accordingly. This dissertation empirically investigates the effects of agent performance, past experience of humans, and agent reputation on human trust in and behavior towards agent teammates. We also study the differences in growth of humans' trust attitudes towards human and agent teammates during initial interactions while achieving team goals. Ad hoc collaboration of humans and agents without pre-planning is a novel human-agent teamwork concept that enables diverse, high-impact applications including emergency response, group buying, online social movements, and next generation crowd-sourcing. In spite of prior work on the influence of various factors on human trust in automation, very little is known about human trust in ""peer"" agent teammates. This is the first study to investigate these factors in virtual human-agent teamwork without pre-planning or explicit coordination. This dissertation introduces a repeated team coordination game, the Game of Trust (GoT), in which two players repeatedly cooperate to complete team tasks without prior assignment of subtasks. We systematically evaluate the effects of agent performance, past experience, and agent reputation on human trust in the GoT by performing an extensive set of controlled experiments with subjects recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace. We collect both teamwork performance data as well as surveys to gauge participants' trust in their agent partners. A learning agent player is developed by training on collected game data to predict future task choices of humans and is shown to increase social utility by reducing redundant work and increasing team goal achievement rates. The empirical results indicate that participants were able to respond appropriately to changes in an agent's behavior in terms of trust and contributions to teamwork, that positive (negative) past experience and positive (negative) reputation increase (decrease) human trust in agent teammates, and humans' trust attitudes towards human and agent teammates differ. The results also show that past experience can affect three antecedents of trust: emotional state, game expertise, and expectation. The interplay between these three elements significantly affected the influence of agent performance and reputation on human trust. The detailed findings and the recommendations derived from them in this dissertation will allow agent developers to set appropriate context for more efficient and successful ad hoc collaboration between human and agent peers in virtual teams. This dissertation enhances our understanding of the changes in human trust in peer level agent teammates with respect to agent trustworthiness, past experience, and agent reputation. The empirical findings provide clear and significant evidence of the influence of key factors on human trust in virtual agent teammates. We also derive several guidelines for agents to follow in practice.","Hafizoglu, Feyza Merve",0,,774
2097,,"This thesis studies the design of Bayesian revenue-optimal auctions for a class of problems in which buyers have general (non-linear and multi-parameter) preferences. This class includes the classical linear single-parameter problem considered by Myerson (1981), for which he provided a simple characterization of revenue proving optimality of a mechanism, leading to numerous applications in theory and practice. However, for fully general preferences no generic and practical solution is known (various negative computational or structural results exist for special cases), even for the problem of designing a mechanism for a single agent. This thesis sets to identifies key conditions implying that the optimal mechanism is practical. Our main results are different in that they identify different conditions implying different notions of practicality, but are all similar in adopting a modular view to the problem that separates the task of designing a solution for the single-agent problem as the main module, from the task of combining these modules to form an optimal multi-agent mechanism. For multi-parameter linear settings, we specify a large class of distributions over values that implies that the optimal single-agent mechanism is posted pricing, and the optimal multi-agent mechanism maximizes \emph{virtual values} for players' favorite items (e.g., when agents are identical, second price auction with reserve for favorite items). More generally, we specify a condition called revenue-linearity (defined beyond multi-parameter linear settings) that implies that optimizing agents' marginal revenue maximizes revenue. Finally, adopting efficient computability as the notion of practicality, we show that for any setting in which single-agent solutions are efficiently computable, multi-agent solutions are also computable.","Haghpanah, Nima",0,,775
2099,From water footprint to climate change adaptation: Capacity development with teenagers to save water,"This article presents a bottom-up approach which attempts to link the Water Footprint (WF) concept with climate change adaptation and capacity development. The approach was developed and tested in cooperation with a partner school in Austria aiming to provide a starting point for WF assessment and formulate an improvement response. The pupils reduced their WF by 9%, and became change agents. The approach assists young people to develop self-efficacy by discovering the connection between their individual actions at local level and aspects of climate change adaptation at global level. It provides a tool to increase this understanding and contribute to the adaptation of distant impacts of climate change and reduce vulnerability.","Haida, C.",0,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.02.043,776
2104,,"Autonomous speech-enabled applications such as speech-to-speech machine translation, conversational agents, and spoken dialogue systems need to be able to distinguish system-directed user input from “off-talk” to function appropriately. “Off-talk” occurs when users speak to themselves or to others, often causing the system to mistakenly respond to speech that was not directed to it. Automatic detection of off-talk could help prevent such errors, and make the user’s interaction with the system more natural. It has been observed that speech in human-human dialogue and in soliloquy is prosodically different from speech directed at machines, and that the right hemisphere of the human brain is the locus of control of speech prosody. In this study, we explore human brain activity prior to speech articulation alone and in combination with prosodic features to create models for off-talk prediction. The proposed EEG based models are a step towards improving response time in detecting system-directed speech in comparison with audio-based methods of detection, opening new possibilities for the integration of brain-computer interface techniques into interactive speech systems.

2109,,"The purpose of this capstone project is two-fold: first to introduce a problem of advising practice and then offer a recommended solution. The problem is captured in my general overall question which ask, how (if at all) can Academic and Career (AC) Advisers, as institutional agents engage students in an educational process which encourages career development practices (CDP) in the context of social justice pedagogy, using principles from Intergroup Dialogue (IGD)? I present a promising response by introducing the convergence of two streams of practice: blending career development practices with principles from intergroup dialogue. A focus on the rationale, purpose and significance of merging these two practices is presented in a two-part response: one of which is a proposed course curriculum and training manual, which are not a part of this document, but a companion will be available at a later time. (However, a sample course syllabus and a summary of the manual content are provided in the appendix for review). The second response, which this document presents is in the form of an inquiry and literature analysis that informs the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed course curriculum and manual. Through semi-structured qualitative interview inquiry, five Career Navigation instructors were selected to participate in a forty-five minute interview. These person-to-person interviews provided rich narrative data by looking at AC Advisers’ knowledge, experiences, opinions, beliefs, feelings and attitudes in their roles as social justice and career development educators. I examined how AC Advisers constructed, interpreted and gave meaning to their experiences of working with students. The results of this inquiry emerged five themes used to inform the development of the proposed course curriculum and manual blending two streams of practices (CDP and IGD) together. The five themes are also used to determine the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed course curriculum and manual using pedagogical practices that contribute to career development and intergroup dialogue outcomes.","Hairston, June Delores Summers",0,,778
2111,Cooperative Human-Robot Planning with Team Reasoning,"The paper studies the connections between philosophical action theory and planning methods in artificial intelligence. It proposes a method of cooperative planning in which agents select actions using a combination of planning and team reasoning. Whereas several standard approaches to multi-agent planning start from individuals' plans and try to combine them into a group plan, the proposed method starts from constructing a group plan from which the individuals derive their sub-plans. The former method is labelled I-mode planning and the latter we-mode planning. The basic idea of the proposed we-mode planning method is that the agents conceive themselves as a group agent that selects the best plan specifying the actions of all individual agents who then carry out their parts in the group plan. We-mode planning is suited for human-robot cooperation in situations in which the participants have a shared goal and a shared plan evaluation function, and can observe each others' actions. The method is expected to lead in some cases to more human-like robot behaviour and more efficient execution of joint actions in human-robot teams.","Hakli, R.",0,10.1007/s12369-016-0377-4,779
2112,Souvenirs: Magical objects in everyday life,"This article considers the role of souvenirs within domestic spaces. Souvenirs are ambivalent objects; at the same time the very epitome of tourism kitsch and personal objects for which the owner holds significant affection. Rather than pre-framing these objects either as 'touristic signifiers' or as personal memory objects, this article reflects on the roles they take as material and embodied co-habitants in domestic space, living - and communicating - with their owners. Hence, this paper departs from 'humanistic' accounts of cohabiting people and things and instead attempts to put human and non-human agents on an equal footing. It does so, by discussing the 'magical capabilities' of everyday objects that enable these to enchant the lives of their human cohabitants; animating them with affects and emotions, feelings of remembrance, affection, appreciation and loss. By drawing inspiration from autoethnography and in particular its potentials for interrogating objects, the author explores the 'souvenirish' qualities of five homely objects; using this exploration to enter into a dialogue with objects as well as theories and studies of objects. Considering the many faces of the souvenir - as utility item, mediator, fetish, tuner and artwork - the article suggests an opening for more imaginative thinking and explorations of how we live with objects in everyday life.

We give an overview of four paradigms of doctoral supervision that have endured over the past 25 years and elucidate some of their strengths and limitations, contextualise them historically and consider their implications for doctoral supervision in the contemporary university. Two common threads across the four paradigms are a view of doctoral supervision as pedagogical practice and that supervisors have primary responsibility for the supervision of doctoral students. We challenge these assumptions. In their place, we propose that the goal of doctoral supervision is praxis and that this involves a learning alliance between multiple institutional agents grounded in a relational ethics of mutual responsibility.","Halse, C.",0,10.1080/03054985.2012.706219,782
2126,Virtual Fieldwork: Modeling Observer Bias in Kinship and Marriage Alliance Networks,"The morphological properties of genealogical and marriage alliance networks constitute a key to the understanding of matrimonial behavior and social norms, in particular where these norms have not been explicitly formalized. Their analysis, however, faces a major difficulty: the actual datasets which allow researchers to reconstruct kinship and alliance networks are generally subject to a marked observer bias, if only due to limitations of observer mobility and/or informant memory. This paper presents an agent based simulation method destined to evaluate the impact of this bias on some key indicators of kinship and alliance networks (such as matrimonial circuit frequencies). The method consists in explicitly simulating the exploration of a given network by a virtual observer, the bias being introduced by the observer's inclination for choosing informants who are more or less closely related to each other. The article presents the model for genealogical and for alliance networks, applies it to a series of artificial networks exhibiting some characteristic morphological patterns, and discusses the divergence of observed from real patterns for different kinds and degrees of observer bias.

This had been proven by several researches, which indicate that learning with interactive animation is much more advantageous than conventional learning. Hence, the mistake in choosing the realistic level of an animated character at a particular condition has negative effect on students' learning performance. Therefore, this study would focus on the Uncanny Valley phenomenon, which is understood to have an effect on the students' emotions. This phenomenon is mainly attributed to the animated character design which is almost similar to real humans. To overcome these problems, the non-realistic three-dimensional and two-dimensional talking-head animation courseware has been developed to ensure that students get the maximum learning from the point of emotional reaction and learning performance. In this regard, the focus of this study was mainly on developing non-realistic three-dimensional talking-head animation. The courseware was developed based on theories, principles and literature review conducted. The paper also reports the evaluation of usability and user satisfaction (PSSUQ) test carried out. One hundred students from Teluk Intan Community College in Malaysia were involved in this study.

However, pragmatic action research is also distinctive: it has a particular concern for consensus and, through the work of Dewey, a focus on the pedagogical implications of problem solving.

2133,,"This dissertation argues for an interpretation of Gilles Deleuze's theory of the mind and of action which, by means of the concept of a social group agent, can serve as the basis for a novel political theory. Drawing on recent scholarship on Deleuze which emphasizes the significance of Immanuel Kant's influence on his work, the first chapter argues that Deleuze's Difference and Repetition presents a theory of the mind which is largely in line with Kant's project, but which presents a more dynamic and developmental picture of the mind. Deleuze presents the mind as the product of the interaction of three synthetic faculties, habit, memory, and thought, and argues that they can function both in concert, taking the same object and producing empirical representation, or dynamically and serially, permitting learning when encountering new phenomena. The second chapter argues that Deleuze has a unique theory of action, drawing from Spinoza, Kant, and Nietzsche, which distinguishes action from habitual behavior by means of the presence of a rule constructed by the agent through thought. The third chapter argues that, given this theory of the mind and of action, along with Deleuze's argument that a multiplicity must have both material and virtual parts, social groups of a sufficient level of organization, such as commercial corporations, are metaphysically individual agents. Finally, the fourth chapter argues that if large social groups, such as nations, are also individual agents, Deleuze's distinction between action and habit lines up with H. L. A. Hart's distinction between social practices and social rules and explains why latter exert normative force on the members of a social group. Finally, these concepts are applied to Deleuze's own social philosophy, in Anti-Oedipus, to shed light on Deleuze's concepts of social machines and social inscription.","Hammond, Paul W.",0,,786
2135,Jordanian national football Muslimat players: Interrupting Islamophobia in FIFA's hijab ban,"Background: Though muslim females exclusion from physical activities and sports has concerned scholars for years, they are still being theorized out of context and out of history and not as agents in their own lives. Within the prevailing context of the 'War on Terror,' muslim females are becoming more racialized in sports and are unnecessarily constructed as needing protection and void of any agency. In 2010, a crisis emerged out of the International Federation of Association Football's (FIFA) erratic interpretation of Law 4 which excluded muslim females players with a head/cover gear deemed unsafe on the field. This crisis highlighted the importance of understanding not only the targeted exclusion of muslim female players but also the importance of working with muslim female national football players and the possibilities of them resisting the racializing and gendering logics of a mega-sport institution such as FIFA. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand how five women football players on the Jordanian national team negotiated FIFA's 'hijab ban' of 2011. Particularly, it seeks the perspectives of the players themselves - whether they are wearing the head and/or neck cover or not and whether their muslimness is visible or not - and their stories of how they negotiated FIFA's 'hijab ban' (2011-2012). Methodology: This paper is part of a larger critical qualitative study based on (1) dialogical interviews with five football players on the Jordanian national team, (2) material the players crafted and used to campaign against FIFA's 'hijab ban,' (3) players' journals, (4) email correspondence and (5) web-based campaigning material. I deploy arab-muslim feminist scholars' more complicated understanding of the hijab and theorize of how muslim women's bodies are regulated by two interconnected hijabophobias, the Islamist and Western-Islamophobic. Findings: The findings are organized in the following themes: (1) experiencing humiliation and injustice, (2) exposing FIFA's Islamophobic standpoint and (3) resisting through solidarity and activism. The results suggest that the muslim female football players on the Jordanian national team exposed the FIFA's Islamophobic hijabophobia in its interpretation of Law 4. They acted with resilience and political savviness to regain the right to play while being muslim female under FIFA's laws. This suggests that muslim females are active agents in their own lives and on a global level. They are able to counter the racializing injustices produced by very powerful sport institutions. Non-muslim/Western policy-makers, researchers, teachers and trainers working among muslim women and youth need to consider this example as a frame to their participatory research, critical pedagogies, and physical education (PE) and sport curricula. They need to recognize that we are living a moment in history in which muslim women's bodies are sites of both the Islamist and the colonialist anxieties in their struggles for power. Thus, they need to urgently be engaged in the theories and pedagogical approaches that challenge both the Islamist and the Islamophobic hijabophobias in sport and PE.","Hamzeh, M.",0,10.1080/17408989.2015.1050660,787
2136,Understanding adoption of intelligent personal assistants: A parasocial relationship perspective,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive research model that can explain customers' continuance intentions to adopt and use intelligent personal assistants (IPAs). Design/methodology/approach This study proposes and validates a new theoretical model that extends the parasocial relationship (PSR) theory. Partial least squares analysis is employed to test the research model and corresponding hypotheses on data collected from 304 survey samples. Findings Interpersonal attraction (task attraction, social attraction, and physical attraction) and security/privacy risk are important factors affecting the adoption of IPAs. Research limitations/implications First, this is the first empirical study to examine user acceptance of IPAs. Second, to the authors' knowledge, no research has been conducted to test the role of PSR in the context of IPAs. Third, this study verified the robustness of the proposed model by introducing new antecedents reflecting risk-related attributes, which has not been investigated in prior PSR research. But this study has limitations that future research may address. First, key findings of this research are based only on data from users in the USA. Second, individual differences among the survey respondents were not examined. Practical implications To increase the adoption of IPAs, manufacturers should focus on developing human-like and professional assistants, in consideration of the important role of PSR and task attraction. R&D should continuously strive to realize artificial intelligence technology advances so that IPAs can better recognize the user's voice and speak naturally like a person. Collaboration with third-party companies or individual developers is essential in this field, as manufacturers are unable to independently develop applications that support the specific tasks of various industries. It is also necessary to enhance IPA device design and its user interface to enhance physical attraction. Originality/value This study is the first empirical attempt to examine user acceptance of IPAs, as most of the prior literature has concerned analysis of usage patterns or technical features.","Han, S.",0,10.1108/imds-05-2017-0214,788
2138,"Emergence of cooperation via intention recognition, commitment and apology - A research summary","The mechanisms of emergence and evolution of cooperation in populations of abstract individuals, with diverse behavioral strategies in co-presence, have been undergoing mathematical study via evolutionary game theory, inspired in part on evolutionary psychology. Their systematic study resorts to simulation techniques, thus enabling the study of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions, parameters and alternative virtual games. The theoretical and experimental results have continually been surprising, rewarding and promising. In our recent work, we initiated the introduction, in such groups of individuals, of cognitive abilities inspired on techniques and theories of Artificial Intelligence, namely those pertaining to Intention Recognition, Commitment and Apology (separately and jointly), encompassing errors in decision-making and communication noise. As a result, both the emergence and stability of cooperation become reinforced comparatively to the absence of such cognitive abilities. This holds separately for Intention Recognition, for Commitment and for Apology, and even more so when they are jointly engaged. Our presentation aims to sensitize the reader to these evolutionary game theory based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in importance for the modeling of minds with machines, with impact on our understanding of the evolution of mutual tolerance and cooperation. Recognition of someone's intentions, which may include imagining the recognition others have of our own intentions, and may comprise not just some error tolerance, but also a penalty for unfulfilled commitment though allowing for apology, can lead to evolutionary stable win/win equilibriums within groups of individuals, and perhaps amongst groups. The recognition and the manifestation of intentions, plus the assumption of commitment-even whilst paying a cost for putting it in place-and the acceptance of apology, are all facilitators in that respect, each of them singly and, above all, in collusion.","Han, T.

2142,Stance markers in television news presentation: Expressivity of eyebrow flashes in the delivery of news,"The discourse of broadcast news is shifting toward being more ""conversational."" As a consequence, rather than assuming the traditional poker-face style of delivering news on television, news readers as televised personae are becomingmore ""informal"" and ""dialogic"" in order to better relate to audiences. Eyebrow flashes, as a communicative resource in television news presentation, play an important part in construing the expressiveness of presentation and engaging with audiences. Drawing upon insights from nonverbal communication studies (especially the pragmatics of nonverbal communication) and discourse analysis, this paper explores the pragmatics of eyebrow flashes as a marker of expressivity in news delivery, and the interaction of eyebrow flashes with the verbal context, based on data collected from Chinese broadcast news in English. The analysis shows that eyebrow flashes are widely employed to initiate the theme of the agent in news messages (implicating ""I know something""), to emphasize the focus of the news statements (implying ""I am thinking now""), and to respond to the attributed statement (indicating ""I want to know more""). Therefore, eyebrow flashes function to assist viewers in construing alignment with authors or reporters of news, as well as alignment with audiences. In addition, they serve to distill personal emotion to hybridize the institutional voice of news, thus rendering television news more ""watchable"" and engaging.","Han, Z.

2144,Perception of gait patterns that deviate from normal and symmetric biped locomotion,"This study examines the range of gait patterns that are perceived as healthy and human-like with the goal of understanding how much asymmetry is allowable in a gait pattern before other people start to notice a gait impairment. Specifically, this study explores if certain abnormal walking patterns can be dismissed as unimpaired or not uncanny. Altering gait biomechanics is generally done in the fields of prosthetics and rehabilitation, however the perception of gait is often neglected. Although a certain gait can be functional, it may not be considered as normal by observers. On the other hand, an abnormally perceived gait may be more practical or necessary in some situations, such as limping after an injury or stroke and when wearing a prosthesis. This research will help to find the balance between the form and function of gait. Gait patterns are synthetically created using a passive dynamic walker (PDW) model that allows gait patterns to be systematically changed without the confounding influence from human sensorimotor feedback during walking. This standardized method allows the perception of specific changes in gait to be studied. The PDW model was used to produce walking patterns that showed a degree of abnormality in gait cadence, knee height, step length, and swing time created by changing the foot roll-over-shape, knee damping, knee location, and leg masses. The gait patterns were shown to participants who rated them according to separate scales of impairment and uncanniness. The results indicate that some pathological and asymmetric gait patterns are perceived as unimpaired and normal. Step time and step length asymmetries less than 5%, small knee location differences, and gait cadence changes of 25% do not result in a change in perception. The results also show that the parameters of a pathologically or uncanny perceived gait can be beneficially altered by increasing other independent parameters, in some sense masking the initial pathology.","Handzic, I.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00199,791
2146,Easy access: new dynamics in long-distance African intimacies,"This article examines how African transnational relationships in the twenty-first century differ from their manifestation in previous periods of mobility and long-distance intimacy. I argue that the possibilities for and expectations of immediate communication and co-presence facilitated by the current technological landscape distinguish this era from earlier ones and fundamentally alter the ways in which African migrants connect to those at home. Although time-space compression allows for the potential of new practices of virtual intimacy, it also creates an imperative of availability for migrants that is reinforced not only on micro- and meso-levels by families and communities but also on macro-levels by neoliberal state policies that target migrants as agents of development and providers of social services.","Hannaford, D.",0,10.1017/s0001972018000402,792
2148,,"This study explores the impact that co-designing a virtual manipulative, Fractions Lab, had on teachers’ professional development. Tapping into an existing community of practice of mathematics specialist teachers, the study identifies how a cooperative enquiry approach utilising workshops and school-based visits challenged 23 competent primary school teachers’ technological, pedagogical and content knowledge of fraction equivalence, addition and subtraction. Verbal and written data from the workshops alongside observations and interviews from the school visits were analysed using the technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework. The findings show that the assumptions of even experienced teachers were challenged when Fractions Lab was shared as an artefact on which they were asked to co-design and subsequently interact with, using it in subsequent phases of the cooperative inquiry process. Two original aspects of successful co-design of virtual manipulatives through communities of practice are identified and offered to others: (1) careful bootstrapping of the first design iteration that gathers intelligence about the content area and the technological affordances and constraints available; and (2) involvement of highly motivated teachers who perceive themselves as agents of change in the domain area.

2151,Patterns of thanking in the closing section of UK service calls Marking conversational macro-structure vs managing interpersonal relations,"I investigate patterns of usage of thanking formulae in the closing section of a corpus of 94 telephone calls made by tenants to a UK housing association. The data suggest that unilateral thanking is the norm when calls are institutionally and interactionally unmarked. In contrast, mutual thanking correlates mainly with the presence of interactional problems of various kinds, or, in a few cases, with features that are not problematic as such, but simply interactionally marked given the nature of the activity. When initiated by agents rather than by callers, thanking is frequently hearable as conveying an apologetic stance. Participants thus seem to orient to different thanking patterns as devices which may be used either to mark the preceding interaction as an instance of 'business-as-usual' or, if such is not the case, to restore interpersonal harmony or index awareness that aspects of the preceding interaction have otherwise deviated from situational expectations.","Hansen, M.

2152,,"Portrayals of humanoid robots in television series draw heavily from the historical and cultural mythology of robots. This mythology is expressed in two contemporary television series, Almost Human and Humans, in which robots are depicted as closely resembling humans in physical appearance and behavior and as fulfilling social roles usually occupied by humans. The robots are imagined with characteristics associated with human consciousness, such as emotions, individuality, and free will. An analysis of the robots in these series, using Jean-Paul Sartre’s theories of consciousness and the Other, demonstrates that when the robots are depicted as conscious, the relationship between a human and robot is portrayed as one of human-to-human (or human-to-Other), not human-to-technology. Sartre’s philosophy helps describe the human characters’ fascination and fear of the robots as resulting from their perceptions of the Other’s shifting status of object and subject and the unpredictability associated with the Other’s freedom. Thus, it is not the machine aspects of the robot that are desired and feared, but the humanness within the machine. Viewed in this way, the humanoid robot as depicted these television series represents a continuing effort to define and describe the essence of humanity in a society where the boundaries between machines and humans are becomingly increasingly blurred.","Hanson, Karen S.",0,,795
2154,Persuasive avatars: The effects of customizing a virtual salesperson's appearance on brand liking and purchase intentions,"Transformed social interaction (TSI) suggests that virtual environments have unique advantages over traditional forms of interpersonal communication. Recent research has demonstrated that a persuasive speaker can use these advantages to create a more persuasive message. However, little has been done to establish how a receiver of a persuasive message in a virtual, interactive environment might also use these advantages. Giving individuals the ability to customize a persuasive source may empower them and affect their perceptions of the persuasive message. In a 2(forewarned or not) x 2(customize source or watch customization) experiment, participants were forewarned or not forewarned that they would be hearing a persuasive message about buying a new energy drink. Participants were then allowed to customize (or watch someone customize) the appearance of the speaker's avatar before the sales pitch. Participants who had the opportunity customize the speaker's appearance liked the product more and had higher purchase intentions than those who did not have control, regardless of forewarning. Findings suggest a new application for TSI, and that both users and sources may benefit when users have the power to customize the appearance of a virtual salesperson. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

SFE can play a vital role in helping universities establish relationships with their local communities that are equitable and based upon the voices and needs of the community. In addition to university-wide and community value, a strong connection between SFE courses and departments outside of education, local schools, educational organizations, and government institutions illustrates the undeniable importance of SFE to the training and development of a generation of future educators who are advocates and allies for their local community members and who are change agents in their field.

2158,,"The immunoregulatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. While injectable biological agents, such as anti-cytokine antibodies or soluble cytokine receptors, have successfully inhibited MIF biological activity, these strategies have significant limitations including high cost and inconvenience of application. Alternatively, MIF could be effectively targeted by oral administration of small molecule inhibitors. In an effort to discover potent small molecule inhibitors that target the catalytic site of MIF, optimization studies of several lead candidates have been pursued and are detailed in this dissertation. The investigations were guided by the general strategy of structure-based drug design and the application of computational methods to discover small molecules which bind to a target protein. Specifically, the optimization of lead compounds was pursued by free-energy perturbation and docking calculations. Through this effort, several active compounds have been identified including a compound that covalently modifies MIF with an IC50 value of 1.0 μM and a non-covalent inhibitor with an IC50 value of 7.5 nM. Furthermore, synthetic optimization was done for plasmodium falciparum macrophage migration inhibitory factor, a malarial homologue of human MIF. The lead compound was discovered by virtual screening and modification of the initial compound provided a small molecule antagonist with an Ki value of 54 nM.","Hare, Alissa Ann",0,,798
2160,FFAB-The Form Function Attribution Bias in Human-Robot Interaction,"People seem to miscalibrate their expectations and interactions with a robot. When it comes to robot design, the anthropomorphism level of the robot form (appearance) has become an increasingly important variable to consider. It is argued here that people base their expectations and perceptions of a robot on its form and attribute functions which do not necessarily mirror the true functions of the robot. The term form function attribution bias (FFAB) refers to the cognitive bias which occurs when people are prone to perceptual errors, leading to a biased interpretation of a robot's functionality. We argue that rather than objectively perceiving the robot's functionalities, people take a cognitive shortcut using the information available to them through visual perception. FFAB intends to outline the implications the design of a robot has on the human predisposition to interact socially with robots. In this theoretical review, we examined the results of several studies suggesting an FFAB. We outline future directions of experimental paradigms and robot design implications.","Haring, K.

2165,Individual differences in affective touch: Behavioral inhibition and gender define how an interpersonal touch is perceived,"Receiving a tender caress from a caregiver or spouse reduces stress and promotes emotional well-being, but receiving the same caress from a stranger makes us feel uncomfortable. According to recent neurophysiological findings, we not only react differently to the invited versus uninvited touch but also perceive the touch differently depending on context. A virtual reality experiment was conducted,to investigate whether individual differences regarding behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and gender contribute to this affective touch perception. Touch perception was measured directly using self-reports and indirectly using the touch-related orienting response. The results showed that touch perception depended on the emotional expression of the virtual agents. High-arousal approach-related (happiness, anger) and avoidance-related (fear) expressions increased self-reported touch intensity, while happiness reduced the orienting response to touch. Moreover, interpersonal differences in behavioral inhibition and gender played distinct roles: BIS sensitivity in males was associated with stronger affective touch perception, particularly with high-arousal emotions whereas in females BIS sensitivity did not affect touch perception. The results suggest that individual differences that are related to preferences regarding tactile communication also determine how touch is perceived. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2170,Persuaded by the machine: The effect of virtual nonverbal cues and individual differences on compliance in economic bargaining,"Receiving a touch or smile increases compliance in natural face-to-face settings. It has been unclear, however, whether a virtual agent's touch and smile also promote compliance or whether there are individual differences in proneness to nonverbal persuasion. Utilizing a multimodal virtual reality, we investigated whether touch and smile promoted compliance to a virtual agent's requests and whether receiver's personality modulated the effects. Compliance was measured using the ultimatum game, in which participants were asked to either reject or accept an agent's monetary offers. Decision-making data were accompanied by offer-related cardiac responses, both of which were analyzed as a function of expression (anger, neutral, and happiness), touch (visuo-tactile, visual, no touch), and three personality traits: behavioral inhibition/activation system sensitivity (BIS/BAS) and justice sensitivity. People accepted unfair offers more often if the agents smiled or touched them. The effect of touch was more enhanced in those with low justice sensitivity and BAS, whereas facial expressions affected those with high BIS the most. Unfair offers amplified the cardiac response, but this effect was not dependent on nonverbal cues. Together, the results suggest that virtual nonverbal behaviors of virtual agents increase compliance and that there is substantial interindividual variation in proneness to persuasion.","Harjunen, V.

2175,,"This thesis examined the impact of two different tutorial strategies (Feedback and No-Feedback) deployed by a pedagogical agent (PA) in a multi-agent hypermedia-learning environment, MetaTutor, on college students' embodiment of discrete emotions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two PA tutorial conditions, which were designed to assist students with setting three appropriate sub goals for their learning session. The two conditions differed in that the Feedback tutorial strategy condition provided participants with more information on how they could improve their suggested sub goals, were given more opportunities to try again (when unsuccessful) and the PA's counterproposals integrated relevant components of participants' proposed sub goals, whereas the No-Feedback PA tutorial condition did not and simply proposed the most related sub goal. FaceReader, an automatic facial expression recognition program, was used to analyze videos of learners' facial expressions in order to determine their basic emotional states. Tens of thousands of emotional data points (frequency data) were provided by FaceReader, which were transformed into proportions for analysis. The results of this thesis came from two analyses (Analysis 1, University of Memphis and McGill University, N = 18; Analysis 2, McGill University, N = 24), which examined undergraduate students' emotional responses to the PA during the initial sub goal setting phase, while they set three sub goals for their two-hour learning session with MetaTutor. Results demonstrated that learners' experienced more negative than positive or neutral emotions during their interaction with the PA and less anger and happiness, but more surprise in the Feedback tutorial condition. This thesis provided evidence for recommending tutorial strategies similar to the Feedback tutorial strategy examined and the use of the control-value theory of achievement emotions to assess the emotional impact of tutorial strategies.","Harley, Jason",0,,802
2177,Examining the predictive relationship between personality and emotion traits and students' agent-directed emotions: towards emotionally-adaptive agent-based learning environments,"The current study examined the relationships between learners' () personality traits, the emotions they typically experience while studying (trait studying emotions), and the emotions they reported experiencing as a result of interacting with four pedagogical agents (agent-directed emotions) in MetaTutor, an advanced multi-agent learning environment. Overall, significant relationships between a subset of trait emotions (trait anger, trait anxiety) and personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism) were found for four agent-directed emotions (enjoyment, pride, boredom, and neutral) though the relationships differed between pedagogical agents. These results demonstrate that some trait emotions and personality traits can be used to predict learners' emotions directed toward specific pedagogical agents (with different roles). Results provide suggestions for adapting pedagogical agents to support learners' (with certain characteristics; e.g., high in neuroticism or agreeableness) experience of adaptive emotions (e.g., enjoyment) and minimize their experience on non-adaptive emotions (e.g., boredom). Such an approach presents a scalable and easily implementable method for creating emotionally-adaptive, agent-based learning environments, and improving learner-pedagogical agent interactions in order to support learning.","Harley, J.

2184,"""Let's Set Up Some Subgoals"": Understanding Human-Pedagogical Agent Collaborations and Their Implications for Learning and Prompt and Feedback Compliance","Research on collaborative learning between humans and virtual pedagogical agents represents a necessary extension to recent research on the conceptual, theoretical, methodological, analytical, and educational issues behind co- and socially-shared regulated learning between humans. This study presents a novel coding framework that was developed and used to describe collaborations between learners and a pedagogical agent (PA) during a subgoal setting activity with MetaTutor, an intelligent tutoring system. Learner-PA interactions were examined across two scaffolding conditions: prompt and feedback (PF), and control. Learners' compliance to follow the PA's prompts and feedback in the PF condition were also examined. Results demonstrated that learners followed the PA's prompts and feedback to help them set more appropriate subgoals for their learning session the majority of the time. Descriptive statistics revealed that when subgoals were set collaboratively between learners and the PA, they generally lead to higher proportional learning gains when compared to less collaboratively set goals. Taken together, the results provide preliminary evidence that learners are both willing to engage in and benefit from collaborative interactions with PAs when immediate, directional feedback and the opportunity to try again are provided. Implications and future directions for extending co- and socially-shared regulated learning theories to include learner-PA interactions are proposed.","Harley, J. M.",1,10.1109/tlt.2017.2756629,804

The resulting ambivalent aesthetics, sometimes thought of as one of 'Internet music', embraces particular negative notions of digital mediation in ways that can and have been thought of as satirical, exploratory or 'accelerationist'. I examine three facets of this aesthetics: maximalism, kitsch and the uncanny valley. I also question the legitimacy of dramatising, even positively, digital media and culture as effectively 'degenerate'.","Harper, A.",0,10.1017/s0261143016000696,805
2189,Architecture as Animate Landscape: Circular Shrines in the Ancient Maya Lowlands,"In this study, I develop a theory of landscape archaeology that incorporates the concept of ""animism"" as a cognitive approach. Current trends in anthropology are placing greater emphasis on indigenous perspectives, and in recent decades animism has seen a resurgence in anthropological theory. As a means of relating in (not to) one's world, animism is a mode of thought that has direct bearing on landscape archaeology. Yet, Americanist archaeologists have been slow to incorporate this concept as a component of landscape theory. I consider animism and Nurit Bird-David's (1999) theory of ""relatedness"" and how such perspectives might be expressed archaeologically in Mesoamerica. I examine the distribution of marine shells and cave formations that appear incorporated as architectural elements on ancient Maya circular shrine architecture. More than just ""symbols"" of sacred geography, I suggest these materials represent living entities that animate shrines through their ongoing relationships with human and other-than-human agents in the world.","Harrison-Buck, E.",0,10.1111/j.1548-1433.2011.01397.x,806
2190,Tutorial and simulations with ADAM: an adaptation and anticipation model of sensorimotor synchronization,"Interpersonal coordination of movements often involves precise synchronization of action timing, particularly in expert domains such as ensemble music performance. According to the adaptation and anticipation model (ADAM) of sensorimotor synchronization, precise yet flexible interpersonal coordination is supported by reactive error correction mechanisms and anticipatory mechanisms that exploit systematic patterns in stimulus timing to plan future actions. Here, we provide a tutorial introduction to the computational architecture of ADAM and present a series of single- and dual-virtual agent simulations that examine the model parameters that produce ideal synchronization performance in different tempo conditions. In the single-agent simulations, a virtual agent synchronized responses to steady tempo sequence or a sequence containing gradual tempo changes. Parameters controlling basic reactive error (phase) correction were sufficient for producing ideal synchronization performance at the steady tempo, whereas parameters controlling anticipatory mechanisms were necessary for ideal performance with a tempo-changing sequence. In the dual-agent simulations, two interacting virtual agents produced temporal sequences from either congruent or incongruent internal performance templates specifying a steady tempo or tempo changes. Ideal performance was achieved with reactive error correction alone when both agents implemented the same performance template (either steady tempo or tempo change). In contrast, anticipatory mechanisms played a key role when one agent implemented a steady tempo template and the other agent implemented a tempo change template. These findings have implications for understanding the interplay between reactive and anticipatory mechanisms when agents possess compatible versus incompatible representations of task goals during human-human and human-machine interaction.","Harry, B.",0,10.1007/s00422-019-00798-6,807
2192,Design and implementation of an intelligent virtual environment for improving speaking and listening skills,"In this paper, we present an intelligent architecture, called intelligent virtual environment for language learning, with embedded pedagogical agents for improving listening and speaking skills of non-native English language learners. The proposed architecture integrates virtual environments into the Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning. This architecture supports visual, auditory, and haptic channels of interaction. It allows pedagogical ideas about language skills to be implemented and validated with a minimum design time. Moreover, we design a computational model to evaluate learner's proficiency level, and an automatic adaptation mechanism which adjusts to the learner's learning curve. We have implemented two scenarios based on the proposed architecture to teach learners how to communicate in public places such as airports and TV stores. Inputs to this system include learner's speech and hand motion, and outputs include graphical scenes, force feedback, and speech by a few embodied agents. Throughout interactions, agents discover the proficiency level of the learner and customize the level of communication complexity accordingly. The system is tested on 10 subjects. Experimental results show 14% increase in the number of proper replies, 3% decrease in grammatical errors, 16% decrease in pronunciation duration, and 11% increase in learners' proficiency level within three trials.","Hassani, K.",1,10.1080/10494820.2013.846265,808
2195,,"Advances in smart technologies, wireless networking, and increased interest in contextual services have led to the emergence of ubiquitous and pervasive computing as one of the most promising areas of computing in recent years. Smart Spaces, in particular, have gained significant interest within the research community. Currently, most Smart Spaces rely on physical components, such as sensors, to acquire information about the real-world environment. Although current sensor networks can acquire some useful contextual information from the physical environment, their information resources are often limited, and the data acquired is often unreliable. We argue that by introducing social network information into such systems, smarter and more adaptive spaces can be created. Social networks have recently become extremely popular, and are now an integral part of millions of people’s daily lives. Through social networks, users create profiles, build relationships, and join groups, forming intermingled sets and communities. Social Networks contain a wealth of information, which, if exploited properly, can lead to a whole new level of smart contextual services. A mechanism is therefore needed to extract data from heterogeneous social networks, to link profiles across different networks, and to aggregate the data obtained. We therefore propose the design and implementation of a Smart Spaces framework that utilizes the social context. In order to manage services and sessions, we integrate our system with the IP Multimedia Subsystem. Our system, which we call SocioSpace, includes full design and implementation of all components, including the central server, the location management system, the social network interfacing system, the service delivery platform, and user agents. We have built a prototype for proof of concept and carried out exhaustive performance analysis; the results show that SocioSpace is scalable, extensible, and fault-tolerant. It is capable of creating Smart Spaces that can truly deliver adaptive services that enhance the users’ overall experience, increase their satisfaction, and make the surroundings more beneficial and interesting to them.","Hasswa, Ahmed",0,,809
2197,,"Drug-resistant pathogens throughout the world, in first and third world countries, create a continual burden on public health. With global emergence of multiply-drug resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and parasites like Plasmodium falciparum, there is a distinct need for the development of novel anti-infectives to target these infections. Our data encompasses interdisciplinary links between pharmacology, natural product chemistry, infectious disease pathogenesis and innate immunity. We have (I) characterized novel antibiotics as new classical-type antibiotics, (II) identified a significant virulence factor, alpha-toxin, in MRSA and characterized its potential as a therapeutic target and (III) investigated a pathogen-specific cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulatory subunit as a possible therapeutic target in the treatment of P. falciparum. From this multi-dimensional approach, we have identified potent antibacterial therapies. Our data highlights the ocean as an extremely rich resource of chemically diverse scaffolds. Here, we comprehensively characterize four marine-derived chemical scaffolds, marinopyrrole, napyradiomycin, etamycin and nosiheptide for their potent antibacterial activities against contemporary strains of multi-drug resistant MRSA. Further, in this work, we identify a potential MRSA virulence factor inhibitor. Diflunisal, a known and commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, was predicted via virtual screening to inhibit the production of a pore-forming S. aureus toxin. Our data emphasizes the potent anti-virulence properties of diflunisal and identifies a wide range of supplementary anti-bacterial and anti-virulence properties that could prove extremely useful in treating virulent and pathogenic MRSA infections. Finally, we investigate the PKA regulatory subunit of P. falciparum to identify pathogen-specific features that may be implicated in its roles in malarial parasite development, host invasion and pathogenesis. We conclude it to be a valid therapeutic target by identifying species-specific differences parasitic and mammalian isoforms that may prove useful in the development and engineering of therapeutic inhibitors. This work highlights three novel approaches to anti-pathogen research where we pinpoint valid therapeutic targets and potential therapies in the ongoing battle against emerging superbugs.","Haste, Nina M.",0,,810
2199,Early science learning with a virtual tutor through multimedia explanations and feedback on spoken questions,"The purpose of this pilot study with a within-subject design was to gain a deeper understanding about the promise and restrictions of a virtual tutoring system designed to teach science to first grade students in Finland. Participants were 61 students who received six tutoring science sessions of approximately 20 min each. Sessions consisted of a sequence of narrated multimedia science presentations during which a virtual tutor explained science phenomena displayed in pictures. Narrated science explanations were followed by one or more multiple choice questions with immediate feedback about students' choices and a possible second attempt, during which students reached 97% accuracy. A pretest and posttest was administered to assess students' ability to reason about the science and to transfer knowledge to new contexts. Results indicated significantly greater improvement in the understanding of the science concepts taught during the tutoring sessions, relative to the concepts that were not taught. Results from the surveys administered to teachers and students indicated that the program was well received. Detailed analysis of student error responses provided a deeper understanding about the complex interplay between students' prior knowledge, the way topics were taught in the multimedia lessons, and the way learning was assessed. Findings from the quantitative and qualitative analyses are discussed in the context of designing high quality lessons delivered through a virtual tutoring system.","Hautala, J.",1,10.1007/s11423-017-9558-6,811
2205,Diffusion of knowledge in social media networks: effects of reputation mechanisms and distribution of knowledge roles,"Social media platforms serve as important tools for diffusing knowledge within organizations. The factors affecting knowledge diffusion through social media networks (SMNs) need to therefore be better understood. Accordingly, this paper focuses on two SMN-specific characteristics - reputation mechanisms and the distribution of knowledge roles - which are argued to enhance and enable, respectively, the smooth transfer of knowledge in a SMN. To examine their effects, we distinguish between two types of reputation mechanisms - adaptive and objective - and across three distinct knowledge roles in SMNs: seekers, contributors and brokers. We argue that the extent of knowledge diffusion in the SMN depends on the type of mechanism and the relative distribution of these three roles. Using data collected through an agent-based simulation, we find that (a) the distribution of knowledge roles affects knowledge diffusion, with distributions consisted of more brokers outperforming others and (b) objective reputation mechanisms outperform adaptive mechanisms. Furthermore, we find that reputation mechanisms and distribution of knowledge roles interact to influence knowledge diffusion. The study's implications for future research and practice are discussed in the light of its limitations. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Havakhor, T.",0,10.1111/isj.12127,812

2209,Lexical Network Analysis on an Online Explanation Task: Effects of Affect and Embodiment of a Pedagogical Agent,"The present study investigated the performance of textbased explanation for a large number of learners in an online tutoring task guided by a Pedagogical Conversational Agent ( PCA). In the study, a lexical network analysis that focused on the co-occurrence of keywords in learner's explanation text, which were used as dependent variables, was performed. This method was used to investigate how the variables, which consisted of expressions of emotion, embodied characteristics of the PCA, and personal characteristics of the learner, influenced the performance of the explanation text. The learners ( participants) were students enrolled in a psychology class. The learners provided explanations to a PCA one-on-one as an after-school activity. In this activity, the PCA, portraying the role of a questioner, asked the learners to explain a key concept taught in their class. The students were randomly assigned one key term out of 30 and were asked to formulate explanations by answering different types of questions. The task consisted of 17 trials. More than 300 text-based explanation dialogues were collected from learners using a web-based explanation system, and the factors influencing learner performance were investigated. Machine learning results showed that during the explanation activity, the expressions used and the gender of the PCA influenced learner performance. Results showed that ( 1) learners performed better when a male PCA expressed negative emotions as opposed to when a female PCA expressed negative emotions, and ( 2) learners performed better when a female PCA expressed positive expressions as opposed to when a female PCA expressed negative expressions. This paper provides insight into capturing the behavior of humans performing online tasks, and it puts forward suggestions related to the design of an efficient online tutoring system using PCA.","Hayashi, Y.",1,10.1587/transinf.2015CBP0005,814
2210,"The Power of a ""Maverick"" in Collaborative Problem Solving: An Experimental Investigation of Individual Perspective-Taking Within a Group","Integrating different perspectives is a sophisticated strategy for developing constructive interactions in collaborative problem solving. However, cognitive aspects such as individuals' knowledge and bias often obscure group consensus and produce conflict. This study investigated collaborative problem solving, focusing on a group member interacting with another member having a different perspective (a ""maverick""). It was predicted that mavericks might mitigate disadvantages and facilitate perspective taking during problem solving. Thus, 344 university students participated in two laboratory-based experiments by engaging in a simple rule-discovery task that raised conflicts among perspectives. They interacted with virtual partners whose conversations were controlled by multiple conversational agents. Results show that when participants interacted with a maverick during the task, they were able to take others' perspectives and integrate different perspectives to solve the problem. Moreover, when participants interacted in groups with a positive mood, groups with a maverick outperformed groups having several perspectives.","Hayashi, Y.",1,10.1111/cogs.12587,815
2211,Multiple pedagogical conversational agents to support learner-learner collaborative learning: Effects of splitting suggestion types,"This study experimentally investigated the design of effective interactions using pedagogical conversational agents (PCAs) in a learner-learner collaborative learning activity. While dyads engaged in a concept explanation task (explaining the mechanism of computer processing), PCAs served as facilitators and provided metacognitive suggestions to better improve learning performance. Previous studies have shown that learners who received several types of suggestions from multiple PCAs were motivated to produce effective explanations; this study then further explored the effects of using multiple PCAs in different roles, providing different types of facilitation. It was predicted that by using two different PCAs to offer suggestions with a delay, learners may be able to process information more efficiently, for example by paying closer attention to each type of suggestion. To investigate this possibility, two types of facilitating content, namely provision of metacognitive suggestions and advice on effective coordination, were each implemented into two role-playing PCAs, named the ""explanation adviser"" and the ""communication adviser"" respectively. The results show that when learners used PCAs playing different roles and offering suggestions corresponding to these roles, learners generated explanations related to the suggestions and improved performance (efficacy of explanations) in several areas, including learning performance, for example better understanding the concept and becoming able to explain it using a greater range of technical words. This study shows empirically how multiple PCAs can be effectively designed to implement roles yielding different types of suggestions. The advantages of using such methods and implementing such functions of PCAs are further discussed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Hayashi, Y.",1,10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.04.005,816
2212,,"This dissertation presents a critical case study of Mars Hill Church from its founding in 1998 through its closure in 2014 through the lens of the church's music ministry. Led by charismatic and controversial pastor Mark Driscoll, Mars Hill Church began as a small Bible study and grew into a fifteen-site megachurch across five states, largely drawing young adults between ages 18 and 35. Facing a cascade of scandals and accusations in 2014, Driscoll resigned as lead pastor and the church soon closed and dispersed. Tracing this bounded history through interviews with former members and musicians, archival print and web-based materials, published texts and books, and various participant-observation experiences at Mars Hill campuses before and during the collapse, I explore the multifaceted role of musicians as agents in perpetuating the church's youth culture orientation, precipitating church growth, centering and inculcating certain theologies, and patterning embodied worship experiences. I begin with an exploration of the history of Christian missions, detailing how 20th century European and American missionaries began to decouple Western cultural norms and practices from Christian orthodoxy, focusing instead on infusing Christian messages into indigenous cultural practices. This ""missional"" framework animated the rise of Christian rock 'n' roll and the Christian Contemporary Music industry. Mars Hill leaders adopted missional discourses to center the genres of punk and post-punk, perceived as authentic local practices in the Seattle context. I thus explore the cultural constructions of punk rock and the adaptations to punk's founding ideologies, politics, aesthetics, and practices that grunge and indie rock musicians and audiences forged to expand aesthetic bounds, form new audiences, and adapt to economic changes. Further, I detail how the church's musical performances of worship songs, Protestant hymns, and new music in the genres of punk, grunge, and indie rock served multiple roles, allowing the church to accrue subcultural capital in the Seattle music scene while simultaneously differentiating Mars Hill as a masculine religious movement within American evangelicalism. Yet Mars Hill Church underwent phases of massive organizational change in the course of its existence, with an effect on polity, theology, and musical style. To account for these intersecting changes, I draw my theoretical framework from the field of ritual studies at the boundary of performance theory, particularly following Catherine Bell who views ritual as a vantage point from which to analyze the production of power and meaning through habituated action. Bell explores how actions, interactions, and speech endow objects, texts, certain personnel or modes of relationship, and so on with meaning(s) that are variously shared, rendering collective ontologies and theologies that pattern political outcomes. While ritual theory affords an encompassing lens of the processes relevant to the production of power, critical theories of gender, race, and class inform my study as intersectional axes of analysis, particularly detailing Driscoll's strident privileging of men and hypermasculinity. As a central node of organizational change, I examine Driscoll and Mars Hill Church's adoption into New Calvinism, a paradenominational movement spanning the Southern Baptist Convention, the Presbyterian Church in America, and various non-denominational adherents. I argue that New Calvinist discourses and theologies lent Driscoll a totalizing operational framework of authority and submission that infused the church's polity, theology, and music ministry, leading to the broad disempowerment of elders, laity and artists. This dissertation thus offers ritual studies as a productive theoretical frame for ethnomusicological research, while furthering academic inquiry into the ways that streams of American Evangelicalism and punk, grunge, and indie rock subcultures variously inform the broad scale production of power and authority in American culture.","Haynes, Maren",0,,817
2214,,"Tumour Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is a known anti-cancer agent which exhibits cancer cell specificity. Its efficacy in breast cancer is limited, however, as illustrated by the resistance demonstrated in a number of cell lines. Cellular FLICE-Like Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) has been demonstrated to play a key role in TRAIL resistance in these cell line models, through its competitive interference with caspase-8 recruitment to the death inducing signalling complex (DISC). Our lab has demonstrated that breast cancer 'stem cells', the cells proposed to be responsible for disease recurrence and metastasis, can be eliminated by combination of c-FLIP suppression, by siRNA, and TRAIL treatment. While it has been proposed that suppression of c-FLIP could improve TRAIL efficacy in breast cancer, there are no pharmacological c-FLIP specific inhibitors available. The purpose of this study therefore was to design and validate novel pharmacological inhibitors of c-FLIP and to determine their tumour efficacy in models of breast cancer. Using in silico modelling, we have modelled the structure of c-FLIP and associated proteins, and, using virtual pharmacophore screening, we have identified 19 potential small molecule c-FLIP inhibitors. In vitro cell viability assays demonstrated 3 of these inhibitors to sensitise TRAIL resistant MCF-7 and BT474 breast cancer cell lines to TRAIL (p<0.05) at micromolar concentrations, with several additional compounds showing a partial ability to sensitise to TRAIL. Each of the three lead inhibitors were shown to be acting via caspase-8 and therefore in a TRAIL specific manner. Two of the lead compounds in combination with TRAIL significantly reduced tumoursphere forming potential in an in vitro assay which represents breast cancer stem cell like traits. The ability of our primary compound to target cells with breast CSC-like traits was further supported using a colony forming assay, which demonstrated a significant reduction in the potential for clonal expansion of breast cancer cells following treatment with the novel agent in combination with TRAIL. Acceptor-photobleaching FRET was successfully utilised to show the mechanism of action of our lead inhibitors to indeed be based on interfering with the c-FLIP FADD interaction. TALEN-mediated targeting of c-FLIP is being optimised to allow for further evaluation of these agents in addition to performing mutagenesis studies in a c-FLIP null background to further delineate the role and mechanism of c-FLIP in the sensitization of breast cancer stem cells to TRAIL. Here we have identified several small molecule c-FLIP inhibitors which are able to specifically sensitise resistant breast cancer cells to TRAIL induced apoptosis via interfering with c-FLIP FADD interaction at the DISC, and thus allowing caspase-8 mediated apoptosis to occur. These early results show promise for our lead compounds as potential therapeutics in breast cancer, via sensitisation to TRAIL.","Hayward, Olivia A.",0,,818
2216,,"The goal of virtual human simulation is to produce behaviour which is visually indistinguishable from reality. However, while various aspects of human behaviour have been extensively explored, there has been little research into behaviour motivated by moral objectives. Virtual characters are often simulated in charged environments, where rational behaviour is greatly challenged and in reality moral judgement plays a significant role. This thesis explores and presents novel solutions to the problem of simulating ethical behaviour. The research is presented in three stages. In the first, a reactive approach to the simulation of ethics inspired by Braitenberg’s Vehicles is described. This is achieved by iteratively augmenting a Type 3 Vehicle with new sensorimotor connections to produce further emergent results. The approach was capable of producing behaviour which was consistent with various normative specifications. Although successful, the Braitenberg Vehicle approach yields behaviour which is visually robotic. This is explored in the second stage of the research where a novel method for modelling affective behaviour is presented. In the third stage, a new architecture for the simulation and modelling of ethical behaviour called Trilogy is presented. This approach, inspired by classical and contemporary tripatriate theories of thought, serves as a computational substrate to bring together the ethical and affective simulation methods previously developed in stages one and two. Two experiments are conducted to evaluate the architecture where participants observed videos of simulated behaviour. The first experiment tests the hypothesis that the inclusion of affective states make an agent’s ethical behaviour more believable, and this was demonstrated to be the case. The second experiment compares the behaviour of the ethical agents against agents which are not ethically motivated. The results of both experiments demonstrate that the approach is capable of producing visually ethical behaviour beyond chance accuracy.","Headleand, Christopher J.",0,,819
2218,,"Agent-based models (ABMs) are computational models used to simulate the behaviors, actions and interactions of agents within a system. The individual agents each have their own set of assigned attributes and rules, which determine their behavior within the ABM system. These rules can be deterministic or probabilistic, allowing for a great deal of flexibility. ABMs allow us to observe how the behaviors of the individual agents affect the system as a whole and if any emergent structure develops within the system. Examining rule sets in conjunction with corresponding emergent structure shows how small-scale changes can affect large-scale outcomes within the system. Thus, we can better understand and predict the development and evolution of systems of interest. ABMs have become ubiquitous—they used in business (virtual auctions to select electronic ads for display), atomospheric science (weather forecasting), and public health (to model epidemics). But there is limited understanding of the statistical properties of ABMs. Specifically, there are no formal procedures for calculating confidence intervals on predictions, nor for assessing goodness-of-fit, nor for testing whether a specific parameter (rule) is needed in an ABM. Motivated by important challenges of this sort, this dissertation focuses on developing methodology for uncertainty quantification and statistical inference in a likelihood-free context for ABMs. Chapter 2 of the thesis develops theory related to ABMs, including procedures for model validation, assessing model equivalence and measuring model complexity. Chapters 3 and 4 of the thesis focuses on two approaches for performing likelihood-free inference involving ABMs, which is necessary because of the intractability of the likelihood function due to the variety of input rules and the complexity of outputs. Chapter 3 explores the use of Gaussian Process emulators in conjunction with ABMs to perform statistical inference. This draws upon a wealth of research on emulators, which find smooth functions on lower-dimensional Euclidean spaces that approximate the ABM. Emulator methods combine observed data with output from ABM simulations, using these to fit and calibrate Gaussian-process approximations. Chapter 4 discusses Approximate Bayesian Computation for ABM inference, the goal of which is to obtain approximation of the posterior distribution of some set of parameters given some observed data. The final chapters of the thesis demonstrates the approaches for inference in two applications. Chapter 5 presents application models the spread of HIV based on detailed data on a social network of men who have sex with men (MSM) in southern India. Use of an ABM will allow us to determine which social/economic/policy factors contribute to thetransmission of the disease. We aim to estimate the effect that proposed medical interventions will have on the spread of HIV in this community. Chapter 6 examines the function of a heroin market in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. Extending an ABM developed from ethnographic research, we explore a procedure for reducing the model, as well as estimating posterior distributions of important quantities based on simulations.","Heard, Daniel",0,,820
2220,The Impact of Human-Robot Synchronization on Anthropomorphization,"To elucidate the working mechanism behind anthropomorphism, this study investigated whether human participants would anthropomorphize a robot more if they move synchronously versus non-synchronously with it, and whether this is affected by which of the two initiates the movements. We tested two competing hypotheses. The feature-overlap hypothesis predicts that moving in synchrony would increase perceived self-other feature overlap, which in turn might spread activation to codes of features related to humans-which should increase anthropomorphization. In contrast, the autonomy hypothesis predicts that unpredictability increases anthropomorphization, and thus that whenever the robot initiates movements, or when the human initiates movements to which the robot moves non-synchronously, there is an increased perception of the robot as a more human-like, intentionally acting creature, which in turn should increase anthropomorphization. We performed a study with synchrony as within-subjects factor, and initiator (robot or human) as between-subjects factor. To study the impact of synchrony on self-other overlap and perception of human likeness, participants completed two tasks that served as implicit measures of state anthropomorphization, and two questionnaires that served as explicit measures of state anthropomorphization toward the robot. The two implicit measures were the joint Simon task and one-shot Dictator Game. Additionally, participants filled in a trait anthropomorphization questionnaire, to enable correction for baseline tendencies to anthropomorphize. The synchrony manipulation did not affect the joint Simon effect, although there was an effect on average reaction time (RT), where in the group in which the robot initiated the movement, RTs were slower when the human and robot moved non-synchronously. The Dictator Game offer and the state anthropomorphization questionnaires were not affected by the synchrony manipulation. There was, however, a positive correlation between current anthropomorphization of the robot and amount of money offered to it. Given that most measures were not systematically affected by our manipulation, it appears that either our design was suboptimal, or that synchronization does not affect the anthropomorphization of a robot.","Heijnen, S.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02607,821
2223,One wouldn't expect an expert bowler to hit only two pins: Hierarchical predictive processing of agent-caused events,"Evidence is accumulating that our brains process incoming information using top-down predictions. If lower level representations are correctly predicted by higher level representations, this enhances processing. However, if they are incorrectly predicted, additional processing is required at higher levels to explain away prediction errors. Here, we explored the potential nature of the models generating such predictions. More specifically, we investigated whether a predictive processing model with a hierarchical structure and causal relations between its levels is able to account for the processing of agent-caused events. In Experiment 1, participants watched animated movies of experienced and novice bowlers. The results are in line with the idea that prediction errors at a lower level of the hierarchy (i.e., the outcome of how many pins fell down) slow down reporting of information at a higher level (i.e., which agent was throwing the ball). Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that this effect is specific to situations in which the predictor is causally related to the outcome. Overall, the study supports the idea that a hierarchical predictive processing model can account for the processing of observed action outcomes and that the predictions involved are specific to cases where action outcomes can be predicted based on causal knowledge.","Heil, L.",0,10.1177/1747021817752102,822

2230,Artificial Intelligence-Virtual Trainer: An educative system based on artificial intelligence and designed to produce varied and consistent training lessons,"AI-Virtual Trainer is an educative system using Artificial Intelligence to propose varied lessons to trainers. The agents of this multi-agent system apply case-based reasoning to build solutions by analogy. However, as required by the field, Artificial Intelligence-Virtual Trainer never proposes the same lesson twice, whereas the same objective may be set many times consecutively. The adaptation process of Artificial Intelligence-Virtual Trainer delivers an ordered set of exercises adapted to the objectives and sub-objectives chosen by trainers. This process has been enriched by including the notion of distance between exercises: the proposed tasks are not only appropriate but are hierarchically ordered. With this new version of the system, students are guided towards their objectives via an underlying theme. Finally, the agents responsible for the different parts of lessons collaborate with each other according to a dedicated protocol and decision-making policy since no exercise must appear more than once in the same lesson. The results prove that Artificial Intelligence-Virtual Trainer, however perfectible, meets the requirements of this field.","Henriet, J.",0,10.1177/1754337116651013,824
2232,,"Chronic illnesses such as cancer, dementia, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are one of the major challenges facing Western health care systems. Concomitant with the rise of chronic illness in the last decades, autobiographical narratives about experiences with chronic illness have proliferated in Western societies and occupy a prominent place in the cultural landscape today. While studies of illness narratives have mainly focused on pedagogical and narratological analysis and on texts, this dissertation examines how visual life narratives can transform medical and cultural concepts of chronic illness. Specifically, it analyzes life narratives about chronic illness by patients or their caregivers in contemporary Germany, focusing in particular on documentary, photography and comic. In Western medicine and culture, chronic illness is understood as loss or decline of health and a productive, independent and autonomous life. Drawing on three case studies, dementia documentaries, cancer photography and comics about motor disabilities, I argue that, rather than a loss, the selected works reveal how these often painful material changes allow for the possibility of transformation and becoming. This becoming occurs through recreating material and affective relations beyond the individual body. Such a conceptualization of illness transcends biopolitical philosophy and social constructivism, prevalent in literary and cultural scholarship of medicine, and insists on the entanglement of pathology with materiality and discourse. By engaging live narratives with (material) feminist theory and media studies the project intervenes in the emerging field of critical medical humanities. The first chapter analyzes how documentaries of dementia conceive of memory loss. While medical discourse focuses on the progressive loss of cognitive function and of passivity and dependency in dementia, I argue that Marion Kainz’ Der Tag, der in der Handtasche verschwand (The Day That Was Lost in the Purse) and David Sieveking’s Vergiss mein nicht (Forget Me Not) theorize memory loss as deterritorialization from stable identities and linear time-space frameworks. Drawing on Rosi Braidotti’s concept of minoritarian memory and Karen Barad’s notion of entangled re-membering, this deterritorialization of dementia patients opens an agential process of becoming and re-membering that consists of re-creating (gendered) identities, relations or memories in the continuous present of the documentary. The second chapter engages with photographs and (digital) life narratives about female bodies with cancer scars. While chronic illness and loss of feminine body parts such as hair and breast are linked to loss of sexuality and desire, drawing on Elisabeth Grosz and Rosi Braidotti, I argue that life narratives about sexuality and chronic illness celebrate how scars allow the emergence of multiple possibilities of (sexual) becoming while acknowledging the suffering inherent in this process. Nana Stäcker’s highly stylized portrait pictures, taken during her chemotherapy for Edwing’s Sarcoma and published in her mother's photographic memoir, and Ute Melle’s selfie blog and Amazon art book with (nude) photographs after mastectomy allow them to experiment with female performances and desires. The third chapter analyzes comics about living with bodies that are suddenly or increasingly unable to move. While medical and cultural discourses construe immobility as loss of independence and autonomy, drawing on Erin Manning’s concept of relational movement and incipiency, I argue that these narratives theorize their disability as opening potentialities of movement through relations between bodies, spaces and technologies. Even though Reto Gloor’s graphic memoir Das Karma-Problem (The Karma Problem) about his struggle with Multiple Sclerosis and Roland Burkart’s autobiographically-based graphic novel Wirbelsturm (Whirlwind) about tetraplegia describe their experiences of dependency in daily life, they highlight how their relations with assisti","Herges, Katja",0,,825
2234,Assessment for learning as support for student self-regulation,"Assessment for learning (AfL) is integral to teaching and learning, and has as its central foci (i) pedagogical intervention in the immediacy of student learning, and (ii) the students' agency in the learning and assessment process. The role that students adopt in AfL is consistent with the idea of self-regulated learning, which involves students as metacognitively, motivationally, and behaviorally active agents in their own learning. Through an analysis of an extended sequence of classroom interaction for the purpose of obtaining evidence of learning, this paper demonstrates that self-regulation is supported through a temporary process of co-regulation between teacher and student in the context of AfL. Co-regulation is a construct derived from Vygotsky's concept of socially mediated learning, and the neo-Vygotskian perspective on human learning as a culturally based communicative process, through which knowledge is shared and constructed. Specific features of co-regulation illustrated through the analyses presented in the paper are (i) goal orientation, a focus on the learning to be achieved; (ii) scaffolding, the assistance the teacher provides to achieve a goal that is currently beyond students' unassisted efforts; (iii) intersubjectivity, a shared understanding based on a common focus of attention; (iv) the active construction of knowledge by students, rather than transference of knowledge from the teacher to the student; and (v) temporary support, provided through scaffolding and other external supports that students can ultimately appropriate as their own.","Heritage, M.",0,10.1007/s13384-018-0261-3,826

2237,,"Multibody modeling is an engineering tool widely used to solve kinematics and dynamics problems for various mechanisms. Its application to the human body modeling by the research community has gone through a revolution in the last decades, enabling to estimate muscle forces and joint torques in a non-invasive way. Therefore, the use of human-like models has become increasingly popular and very relevant to the health industry and for clinical applications. In addition, multibody modeling is more and more involved in the decision-making process for the design of products interacting closely with the human body such as exoskeletons or prosthetics. Particularly, many efforts have been made recently to combine this tool with other tools such as computer-aided design software packages and finite elements analysis in order to make more thorough design and analysis studies. However, despite the complexity inherent to learning of multibody modeling, it is rarely taught in a systematic way, and is usually learned in ad-hoc manner in both research and or industry, thus limiting greatly the capacity of cooperation and development for engineers. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a learning methodology allowing one to incorporate this material in the training of engineers and more particularly biomedical and mechanical engineers. Therefore, the aim of this Masters thesis is to provide a project based learning methodology to facilitate the teaching of the basics of multibody modeling applied to the human body, so that students could then consider more advanced developments on the basis of stronger and better standardized skills. The general approach proposed in this master thesis is to build on the methodology of real-world project development in the field of biomedical and mechanical engineering involving multibody modeling steps, to offer a project using professional tools and techniques. Then a step of identification of the difficulties and challenges for learning multibody modeling is carried out using data collected from literature and from semi-structured interviews leading to a proposed project-based learning methodology meeting the identified challenges. The main results of this master project allow (1) to identify the main difficulties in learning and using multibody modeling applied to the human body (2) to conclude that the proposed methodology should not only use simulation but must be accompanied by a physical prototype. In particular, the results show that the use of rapid prototyping enables one to offer a simplified project while still addressing the identified challenges. The prospects of this study are to develop a methodology increasing both the project and the physical device complexity to reach a similar sophistication compared with models used in the industry and by clinicians.","Hernandez, Sebastian",0,,828
2239,Designing Empathetic Animated Agents for a B-Learning Training Environment within the Electrical Domain,"Electrical tests involve high risk; therefore utility companies require highly qualified electricians and efficient training. Recently, training for electrical tests has been supported by virtual reality systems; nonetheless, these training systems are not yet adaptive. We propose a b-learning model to support adaptive and distance training. The adaptation is based on a representation of the knowledge and affect of the trainee. One of the main components is an animated pedagogical agent who guides trainees and provides instruction. The agent deploys different facial expressions conveying emotion and empathy to trainees. We incorporated these constructs into the learning model aiming to achieve credibility, social interaction, and user engagement, and thus improve learning. To develop the agent, we included some of the basic characteristics of electricians: work uniform and safety gear, such as helmets, gloves, and glasses, among other features. We believe that by representing the tutor as an electrician, the training environment will be better accepted by operators. The focus of this paper is a study that we conducted to gather knowledge about the expressivity and appearance of the animated agent. The participants evaluated the facial expressions of the agent and stated their point of view regarding the incorporation of the animated agent into the training system. The gathered knowledge is being used to enhance the animated agent before completing its integration to the training environment.","Hernandez, Y.",1,,829

2246,Computer models solving intelligence test problems: Progress and implications,"While some computational models of intelligence test problems were proposed throughout the second half of the XXth century, in the first years of the XXIst century we have seen an increasing number of computer systems being able to score well on particular intelligence test tasks. However, despite this increasing trend there has been no general account of all these works in terms of how they relate to each other and what their real achievements are. Also, there is poor understanding about what intelligence tests measure in machines, whether they are useful to evaluate AI systems, whether they are really challenging problems, and whether they are useful to understand (human) intelligence. In this paper, we provide some insight on these issues, in the form of nine specific questions, by giving a comprehensive account of about thirty computer models, from the 1960s to nowadays, and their relationships, focussing on the range of intelligence test tasks they address, the purpose of the models, how general or specialised these models are, the AI techniques they use in each case, their comparison with human performance, and their evaluation of item difficulty. As a conclusion, these tests and the computer models attempting them show that AI is still lacking general techniques to deal with a variety of problems at the same time. Nonetheless, a renewed attention on these problems and a more careful understanding of what intelligence tests offer for AI may help build new bridges between psychometrics, cognitive science, and AI; and may motivate new kinds of problem repositories.

2251,Ethical values in college education: a mixed-methods pilot study to assess health sciences students' perceptions,"Background: Society demands a university education grounded on ethical principles. Education in ethics values is responsibility of universities but will not be viable unless also adopted by directly responsible agents, the teachers who work with the students. For this reason, our primary research objective was to conduct an in-depth analysis of how Health Sciences students self-perceive the ethical dimension. Methods: A mixed research methodology with two phases, qualitative and quantitative, allowed us to address our research question from two complementary viewpoints. Conversational interviews were conducted in an intentional and purposive sample to identify a wide range of discursive representations. A questionnaire was designed based on previous studies and the topics of qualitative research. The response format for the questionnaire followed a Likert scale and modulators such as sex, age, degree and the score of a social desirability test were examined. Results: After 24 conversational interviews, three main thematic blocks (coinciding with the three subscales of the questionnaire) were identified: ""attitudes for harmony in human relations"", ""construction of the self"" and ""rules and regulations"". A total of 246 students completed a questionnaire with 39 items. The total scores ranged from 93 to 152 points, with an average score of 122.72 +/- 10.64 points. Responsibility, the basic rules of education and respect were perceived as the two most important values, whereas solidarity and social participation as the least important. Results showed a significant positive linear correlation between total score on the questionnaire and age and social desirability. Age was also a significant predictor for the total score and the subscale score ""rules and regulations"". The students ' responses seemed to be conditioned by the degree of social desirability that they present. Conclusions: The ad-hoc questionnaire captured the maintenance of high ethical values in our college undergraduate students, which may be directly related to enhanced social desirability. The scores obtained on the questionnaire were correlated with the students' age, which may indicate that values might tend to acquire progressively more importance as students grow older. Further research is warranted to delve deeper on the determinants of professionalism and ethical decision-making in college students.","Hernando, A.",0,10.1186/s12909-018-1396-7,832
2259,Action anticipation in human infants reveals assumptions about anteroposterior body-structure and action,"Animal actions are almost universally constrained by the bilateral body-plan. For example, the direction of travel tends to be constrained by the orientation of the animal's anteroposterior axis. Hence, an animal's behaviour can reliably guide the identification of its front and back, and its orientation can reliably guide action prediction. We examine the hypothesis that the evolutionarily ancient relation between anteroposterior body-structure and behaviour guides our cognitive processing of agents and their actions. In a series of studies, we demonstrate that, after limited exposure, human infants as young as six months of age spontaneously encode a novel agent as having a certain axial direction with respect to its actions and rely on it when anticipating the agent's further behaviour. We found that such encoding is restricted to objects exhibiting cues of agency and does not depend on generalization from features of familiar animals. Our research offers a new tool for investigating the perception of animate agency and supports the proposal that the underlying cognitive mechanisms have been shaped by basic biological adaptations in humans.","Hernik, M.",0,10.1098/rspb.2013.3205,833

It proposes that service delivery network design would benefit from complex adaptive systems (CAS) modeling approaches to recreate organizational phenomena driven by the interaction of the organization with its operating environment. This approach, paired with experimental design methods can serve as a virtual laboratory. We take the case of social service delivery (SSD) organizations that are structured as nonprofit organizations providing humanitarian assistance and relief services. These organizations often serve different geographical regions, thus, racial composition, migration patterns, and wealth of the populations served are factors that vary between locations. SSDs operate through service nodes (i.e., field offices, chapters, branches) in a network configuration. Therefore, the managerial decision of where to locate the field offices is an important one. An agent-based model to recreate agents' interactions as proxies of those exchanges occurring in real SSD settings is used. A series of validation experiments instill confidence that our model can be used as a virtual research laboratory. This paper contributes to the field of organizational design by testing a model able to recreate different policies that combined with different operating conditions impact the network over time and space. In addition, it provides experimental insights on what type of network configuration might provide a higher number of services delivered over time across the service network. The results can inform those defining the service system architecture looking to achieve SSD's goals considering the demographics of the markets served.

2264,More than Information: A Christian Critique of a New Dualism,"In light of quantum theory and advances in computer science, scientists have posited that it is information, rather than matter, that forms the bedrock of the universe. Thus it follows that the essence of our selves as human beings is simply the information housed in the neural connections of our brain. If this is so, then the self could be reproduced digitally. Such a cybernetic immortality introduces a new Cartesian dualism that separates mind from body, locating the self wholly in the mind. This view contrasts with the traditionally Christian view, that humans are created and best understood as being in the image of God-an image found in our rational intellect, our embodied agency, and our relationships. Our sense of self is incomplete without all three. We are neither just a mind nor just a body, but a mind that is both part and product of our human body, embedded within the larger environment of the physical world and human culture. Our knowledge, functioning, and self-understanding is shaped and acquired by and through our bodies. Without a body, we also cannot feel emotion, and thus have neither human-like intelligence nor compassion. The dreams of cybernetic immortality fail to capture the full nature of what it means to be human and are illusory hopes for a form of immortality not requiring the action of a supernatural being. Any hope for immortality is best found, as Niebuhr noted, beyond the scope of history. Further, this new dualism leads us to grandiose delusions-Niebuhr's sin of pride-regarding what we can accomplish in the here and now, delusions that are harmful to both our sense of self and to our capacity to love one another.","Herzfeld, N.",0,10.1080/14746700.2015.1122337,835
2265,Socio-Emotional Concern Dynamics in a Model of Real-Time Dyadic Interaction: Parent-Child Play in Autism,"We used a validated agent-based model-Socio-Emotional CONcern DynamicS (SECONDS)-to model real-time playful interaction between a child diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and its parent. SECONDS provides a real-time (second-by-second) virtual environment that could be used for clinical trials and testing process-oriented explanations of ASD symptomatology. We conducted numerical experiments with SECONDS (1) for internal model validation comparing two parental behavioral strategies for stimulating social development in ASD (play-centered vs. initiative-centered) and (2) for empirical case-based model validation. We compared 2,000 simulated play sessions of two particular dyads with (second-by-second) time-series observations within 29 play sessions of a real parent-child dyad with ASD on six variables related to maintaining and initiating play. Overall, both simulated dyads provided a better fit to the observed dyad than reference null distributions. Given the idiosyncratic behaviors expected in ASD, the observed correspondence is non-trivial. Our results demonstrate the applicability of SECONDS to parent-child dyads in ASD. In the future, SECONDS could help design interventions for parental care in ASD.","Hesp, C.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01635,836
2268,Make-Believing Animated Films Featuring Digital Humans: A Qualitative Inquiry Using Online Sources,"A qualitative inquiry of reviews of films featuring digital humanlike characters was performed by sampling user comments from three online reviewer aggregator sites: the Internet Movie Database, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. The films chosen for analysis were: Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (dir. Hironobu Sakaguchi and Motonori Sakakibara, 2001), The Polar Express (dir. Robert Zemeckis, 2004), and Beowulf (dir. Robert Zemeckis, 2007), all produced using CGI animation, together with A Scanner Darkly (dir. Richard Linklater, 2006) whose visuals are depicted by rotoscoping using Bob Sabiston's Rotoshop software. The authors' analysis identified individual differences in the viewing experience, particularly in relation to the uncertain ontology of the humanlike characters created using CGI (CGI-Humans). They found examples of reviews indicating an inability to distinguish between real and CGI-Human actors, observations of characters transiently exhibiting realism before returning to their artifice, and of characters being viewed as eerie (analogous to the uncanny valley), thus illustrating a complex and dynamic response to this phenomenon. In some situations, character uncanniness was related to the presence of an atypical feature such as movement of the eyes. Whilst specifically for Beowulf, perceptions became more problematic when there was familiarity with the actor playing the CGI-Human character, with some reviewers describing difficulties in categorizing the character as either real or animated. CGI-Human performances were also characterized by a lack of, or inappropriate, social interaction. Online reviewers did not perceive characters depicted using Rotoshop (Rotoshop-Humans) as eerie; rotoscoping was found to preserve, and possibly enhance, the natural social interactions between actors recorded from the live-action film which was used as the source material for the animation. The authors' inquiry also identified user motivations for viewing these films and the importance placed by reviewers on the form of display when viewing the CGI films. They situate their interpretation of these findings in relation to Walton's make-believe theory (Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts, 1990).","Hetherington, R.",0,10.1177/1746847717710738,837

Much research has focused on how to create human models that exhibit realistic appearance and movement. This dissertation investigates how to create virtual humans that act like real people. In particular, we develop human agents that make plans, navigate through complex environments, and communicate with one another. Despite their autonomous behavior, our agents can be tightly controlled by content designers who wish to script their virtual world behavior. Many virtual environments, particularly those used in interactive games, have tight restrictions on memory and frame rate, and we show how judicious offline computation can yield significant runtime performance gains. We demonstrate a virtual world with agents that can plan, navigate, and communicate in English.","Hewlett, William Redington, II",0,,838
2272,"In dialogue with an avatar, language behavior is identical to dialogue with a human partner","The use of virtual reality (VR) as a methodological tool is becoming increasingly popular in behavioral research as its flexibility allows for a wide range of applications. This new method has not been as widely accepted in the field of psycholinguistics, however, possibly due to the assumption that language processing during human-computer interactions does not accurately reflect human-human interactions. Yet at the same time there is a growing need to study human-human language interactions in a tightly controlled context, which has not been possible using existing methods. VR, however, offers experimental control over parameters that cannot be (as finely) controlled in the real world. As such, in this study we aim to show that human-computer language interaction is comparable to human-human language interaction in virtual reality. In the current study we compare participants' language behavior in a syntactic priming task with human versus computer partners: we used a human partner, a human-like avatar with human-like facial expressions and verbal behavior, and a computer-like avatar which had this humanness removed. As predicted, our study shows comparable priming effects between the human and human-like avatar suggesting that participants attributed human-like agency to the human-like avatar. Indeed, when interacting with the computer-like avatar, the priming effect was significantly decreased. This suggests that when interacting with a human-like avatar, sentence processing is comparable to interacting with a human partner. Our study therefore shows that VR is a valid platform for conducting language research and studying dialogue interactions in an ecologically valid manner.","Heyselaar, E.",1,10.3758/s13428-015-0688-7,839

Participants narrated short animated cartoons showing an agent displacing objects and varying along several dimensions (Path, Manner). A significant increase with age was found in the number of expressed motion components in all languages, as well as an influence of Path (vertical > boundary crossing). However, at all ages, participants encoded more information in English and German than in French, where more variation and structural changes occurred with increasing age. These findings highlight both cognitive and typological factors impacting the expression of caused motion in development.

2283,,"This dissertation argues that contemporary ecotheology is in need of a theological cosmology able to carry out two tasks simultaneously: It must, on one hand, attempt to trace trajectories of value and meaning that run throughout the spatiotemporal continuum of the world and, on the other hand, centrally affirm the creative agency of a multiplicity of creaturely entities whose trajectories of becoming contain an inherent degree of indeterminacy. These tasks are commonly held to contradict one another due in large part to the prominence in Western thought of what I call the ""free-agent / frozen-design"" model—a thought system assuming that the transcendent agency of one subject—either God in the case of traditional theism or humanity in the case of secular modernity—can only be gained at the expense of a reduction of its object (creation or nature, respectively) to eternal, static laws. An important set of resources for moving beyond this model lie with what I call ""cosmological postmodernism,"" a body of thought holding together deep ecology's insistence on humanity's belongingness to the ""deep time"" of a cosmos that exceeds and includes us, with postmodern theory's suspicion of any preordained, transcendent essences or laws that dictate in advance what it is possible for us to become. This dissertation focuses in particular on three philosophers whose thought has formatively shaped cosmological postmodernism and its attention to the creative processes undergirding human and non-human transformations alike. In particular, I bring Whitehead's understanding of the di-polar flows between God and the world into dialogue with Deleuze and Bergson's notion of the dual tendencies of time—an ""ontological"" contraction towards a virtual ""pure past"" and a ""translative"" contraction towards an actual present. Common to all these philosophers is the theorization of a sphere of ""trans-temporal"" continuity constituted by a creative vector running counter or inverse to that of creaturely actualizations. This forms the basis for a conception of divinity as that which soteriologically receives the spatio-temporal entirety of the cosmos into itself so as to empower agential, self-creative, creaturely actualizations (thus carrying out the two key tasks as articulated above). The relation of these ideas to Christian traditions around ""cosmic Christology"" is also explored, both in reference to ancient pre-Nicene Logos theologies and more recent ecotheologians such as Teilhard de Chardin, Sallie McFague and Jurgen Moltmann. These reflections culminate in a constructive cosmic Christology that shifts from a substance-based preoccupation with Christ's two natures towards an emphasis on Christ's mediatory, bi-directional mobility—a dynamic process of ""Chrystolization"" in which all creatures are invited to participate. It is hoped that these ideas can help ecotheology embrace an awareness of being steeped within a common, more-than-human past, but in such a way that does not bind us within past patterns so much as propel us forward into ever novel ""intensive alliances"" capable of transforming and vitalizing our living ecology.","Higgins, Luke B.",0,,842
2285,,"Examining the elements of the hidden curriculum in theatre education allows theatre educators the opportunity to reflect on their own pedagogy and its effects on the learner. The hidden curriculum refers to the unspoken or implicit values, norms, and beliefs that are transmitted through tacit messages. When the hidden curriculum remains veiled, the impact on the learner's education and socialization process can perpetuate gender, race, and class inequalities. In order to understand how the hidden curriculum manifests itself in theatre classrooms, we have to look at schools as ""agents of legitimation, organized to produce and reproduce the dominant categories, values, and social relationships necessary for the maintenance of the larger society"" (Giroux, 1983, p. 72). This qualitative study examined the hidden curriculum in theatre at the secondary level and looked at theatre teachers' pedagogy in reproducing elements of the hidden curriculum. Interviews, naturalistic observation, and a researcher reflective journal were employed in the data collection process to better understand: a) the elements of hidden curriculum that appear in theatre education at the secondary level, b) how the pedagogical practices of theatre teachers support societal structures, and c) how the hidden curriculum in theatre reinforces gender, race, and social class distinctions. Data were then coded and analyzed to find emergent themes. Multiple theoretical perspectives serve as a conceptual framework for understanding the hidden curriculum, and provide a neglected perspective of the hidden curriculum in theatre education. The theatre classroom provides a unique space to view hidden curriculum and can be viewed as a unique agent of social change. Themes related to the first research question emerged as: a) privileges for older students, b) school rules, c) respect for authority, d) acceptance of repetitive tasks, and c) punctuality. Themes related to the second research question emerged as: a) practices, b) procedures, c) rules, d) relationships, and e) structures. Finally, themes related to the third question emerged as: a) reinforcement of social inequality, b) perpetuation of class structure, and c) acceptance of social destiny. The discussion looks at the functions of theatre pedagogy in the reproduction of class, inequality, and institutionalized cultural norms.","Hines, Angela R.",0,,843
2287,The Janus face of Darwinian competition,"Without competition, organisms would not evolve any meaningful physical or cognitive abilities. Competition can thus be understood as the driving force behind Darwinian evolution. But does this imply that more competitive environments necessarily evolve organisms with more sophisticated cognitive abilities than do less competitive environments? Or is there a tipping point at which competition does more harm than good? We examine the evolution of decision strategies among virtual agents performing a repetitive sampling task in three distinct environments. The environments differ in the degree to which the actions of a competitor can affect the fitness of the sampling agent, and in the variance of the sample. Under weak competition, agents evolve decision strategies that sample often and make accurate decisions, which not only improve their own fitness, but are good for the entire population. Under extreme competition, however, the dark side of the Janus face of Darwinian competition emerges: Agents are forced to sacrifice accuracy for speed and are prevented from sampling as often as higher variance in the environment would require. Modest competition is therefore a good driver for the evolution of cognitive abilities and of the population as a whole, whereas too much competition is devastating.","Hintze, A.",0,10.1038/srep13662,844
2290,,"Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) is a new and important technique developed specifically for virtualized environments. VMI provides the ability to perform virtual machine (VM) monitoring by gathering VM run-time states from the hypervisor and analyzing those states to obtain information about a running operating system (OS) without installing an agent inside the VM. The agentless VMI approach has enabled the development of applications that combine the best of two worlds: efficient centralization and effective monitoring. VMI's primary drawback is the semantic gap problem. The semantic gap refers to the difficulty in interpreting low level run-time OS states obtained through VMI into a high level model of the OS's state. We approached the problem through the creation of the real-time kernel data structure monitoring (RTKDSM) system. The RTKDSM system leverages the rich OS analysis capabilities of Volatility, an open source forensics framework, to simplify and automate analysis of VM run-time states of Windows and Linux OSes. The RTKDSM system is designed as an extensible software framework, which can be extended by writing Volatility plugins to perform new VM analysis tasks. In addition, the RTKDSM system is built to perform real-time monitoring of the extracted OS states in guest VMs to detect changes made to these states. This feature is especially important for effective security monitoring of VMs. To improve the efficiency of the RTKDSM framework, we reduce the overhead of monitoring changes to guest OS states. The RTKDSM system is capable of supporting a wide range of VMI applications due to the RTKDSM framework's flexibility and extensibility. Leveraging the RTKDSM framework, VMI developers can easily create new VMI applications. To demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the RTKDSM framework, we built three novel applications on top of the framework: (1) an inter-VM data flow tracking tool, (2) a VM lock down tool to restrict the execution environment to running only approved user applications, and (3) a tool for detection of malicious attacks that manipulate privileges of running processes. These systems are expected to contribute to enhanced system monitoring in virtual machine environments.","Hizver, Jennia",0,,845

2295,,"Human-looking computer interfaces, including humanoid robots and animated humans, may elicit in their users eerie feelings. This effect, often called the uncanny valley, emphasizes our heightened ability to distinguish between the human and merely humanlike using both perceptual and cognitive approaches. Although reactions to uncanny characters are captured more accurately with emotional descriptors (e.g., eerie and creepy) than with cognitive descriptors (e.g., strange), and although previous studies suggest the psychological processes underlying the uncanny valley are more perceptual and emotional than cognitive, the deep roots of the concept of humanness imply the application of category boundaries and cognitive dissonance in distinguishing among robots, androids, and humans. First, laddering interviews (N = 30) revealed firm boundaries among participants' concepts of animated, robotic, and human. Participants associated human traits like soul, imperfect, or intended exclusively with humans, and they simultaneously devalued the autonomous accomplishments of robots (e.g., simple task, limited ability, or controlled). Jerky movement and humanlike appearance were associated with robots, even though the presented robotic stimuli were humanlike. The facial expressions perceived in robots as improper were perceived in animated characters as mismatched. Second, association model testing indicated that the independent evaluation based on the developed indices is a viable quantitative technique for the laddering interview. Third, from the interviews several candidate items for the eeriness index were validated in a large representative survey (N = 1,311). The improved eeriness index is nearly orthogonal to perceived humanness ( r = .04). The improved indices facilitate plotting relations among rated characters of varying human likeness, enhancing perspectives on humanlike robot design and animation creation.","Ho, Chin-Chang",0,,847
2297,Measuring the Uncanny Valley Effect,"Using a hypothetical graph, Masahiro Mori proposed in 1970 the relation between the human likeness of robots and other anthropomorphic characters and an observer's affective or emotional appraisal of them. The relation is positive apart from a U-shaped region known as the uncanny valley. To measure the relation, we previously developed and validated indices for the perceptual-cognitive dimension humanness and three affective dimensions: interpersonal warmth, attractiveness, and eeriness. Nevertheless, the design of these indices was not informed by how the untrained observer perceives anthropomorphic characters categorically. As a result, scatter plots of humanness vs. eeriness show the stimuli cluster tightly into categories widely separated from each other. The present study applies a card sorting task, laddering interview, and adjective evaluation (N = 30) to revise the humanness, attractiveness, and eeriness indices and validate them via a representative survey (N = 1311). The revised eeriness index maintains its orthogonality to humanness (r = .04, p = .285 ), but the stimuli show much greater spread, reflecting the breadth of their range in human likeness and eeriness. The revised indices enable empirical relations among characters to be plotted similarly to Mori's graph of the uncanny valley. Accurate measurement with these indices can be used to enhance the design of androids and 3D computer animated characters.","Ho, C. C.",0,10.1007/s12369-016-0380-9,848
2299,"People Teach With Rewards and Punishments as Communication, Not Reinforcements","Carrots and sticks motivate behavior, and people can teach new behaviors to other organisms, such as children or nonhuman animals, by tapping into their reward learning mechanisms. But how people teach with reward and punishment depends on their expectations about the learner. We examine how people teach using reward and punishment by contrasting two hypotheses. The first is evaluative feedback as reinforcement, where rewards and punishments are used to shape learner behavior through reinforcement learning mechanisms. The second is evaluative feedback as communication, where rewards and punishments are used to signal target behavior to a learning agent reasoning about a teacher's pedagogical goals. We present formalizations of learning from these 2 teaching strategies based on computational frameworks for reinforcement learning. Our analysis based on these models motivates a simple interactive teaching paradigm that distinguishes between the two teaching hypotheses. Across 3 sets of experiments, we find that people are strongly biased to use evaluative feedback communicatively rather than as reinforcement.","Ho, M. K.",0,10.1037/xge0000569,849
2303,Non-anthropomorphic robots as social entities on a neurophysiological level,"The mirror-neuron-system (MNS) is involved in the perception of actions of humans and anthropomorphic robots. The current study investigates whether social interaction with a non-anthropomorphic robot is sufficient for a response of the MNS. Fifty-seven participants observed movements of a vacuum cleaning robot before and after it was handled by its owner. The robot was either humanized, being treated aggressively (n = 30), or it was treated as an object (n = 27). Electroencephalographic mu-activity is used as an index of MNS activity, because both are inversely correlated. Activity within the 8-13 Hz band was measured at central (mu activity) and occipital (alpha-activity) electrodes. Further, the level of aggressiveness displayed by the robot's owner, and the participants' compassion were rated on visual analog scales. Mu-activity showed medium-sized correlations with rated aggressiveness and compassion: The more aggressive the action towards the robot was perceived (r = -.379, p = .004), and the more compassion was felt for the robot (r = -.339, p = .010), the less pronounced mu-activity was at electrode C3 in response to the robot's movement. Thus social interaction with a non-anthropomorphic robot might establish the robot as a social entity and is sufficient to activate the human MNS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2306,Artificial Intelligence and Social Simulation: Studying Group Dynamics on a Massive Scale,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence and computer science can be used by social scientists in their study of groups and teams. Here, we explain how developments in machine learning and simulations with artificially intelligent agents can help group and team scholars to overcome two major problems they face when studying group dynamics. First, because empirical research on groups relies on manual coding, it is hard to study groups in large numbers (the scaling problem). Second, conventional statistical methods in behavioral science often fail to capture the nonlinear interaction dynamics occurring in small groups (the dynamics problem). Machine learning helps to address the scaling problem, as massive computing power can be harnessed to multiply manual codings of group interactions. Computer simulations with artificially intelligent agents help to address the dynamics problem by implementing social psychological theory in data-generating algorithms that allow for sophisticated statements and tests of theory. We describe an ongoing research project aimed at computational analysis of virtual software development teams.","Hoey, J.",0,10.1177/1046496418802362,851
2312,Embodied Cognition for Autonomous Interactive Robots,"In the past, notions of embodiment have been applied to robotics mainly in the realm of very simple robots, and supporting low-level mechanisms such as dynamics and navigation. In contrast, most human-like, interactive, and socially adept robotic systems turn away from embodiment and use amodal, symbolic, and modular approaches to cognition and interaction. At the same time, recent research in Embodied Cognition (EC) is spanning an increasing number of complex cognitive processes, including language, nonverbal communication, learning, and social behavior. This article suggests adopting a modern EC approach for autonomous robots interacting with humans. In particular, we present three core principles from EC that may be applicable to such robots: (a) modal perceptual representation, (b) action/perception and action/cognition integration, and (c) a simulation-based model of top-down perceptual biasing. We describe a computational framework based on these principles, and its implementation on two physical robots. This could provide a new paradigm for embodied humanrobot interaction based on recent psychological and neurological findings.","Hoffman, G.",0,10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01218.x,852
2313,Myths of automation and their implications for military procurement,"Several mythical beliefs surround military automation, including the belief that automation reduces manpower needs, that it requires less training for operators, and that it reduces errors. The unbridled enthusiasm for automation exhibited by some technologists - and, consequently, by some technology acquisition programs - extends to claims that computers will achieve and even surpass human-like reasoning capabilities. Such attitudes must be balanced by a recognition that automation's reality rarely matches its promise. When automation is introduced, human operators must assume the additional tasks of monitoring and coordinating with the technology. When automation takes over, human operators - instead of having fewer things to do - have new things to do. Automation requires that operators be trained to high proficiency. Even the most well-intentioned systems trigger new problems, different kinds of problems, and unanticipated problems. Procurement processes for automated military technology could be improved by awareness of, and efforts to escape from, the mythical beliefs that surround military automation.","Hoffman, R.

2317,The influence of a virtual companion on amusement when watching funny films,"We investigated the role of a virtual companion and trait cheerfulness on the elicitation of amusement. Ninety participants watched funny films in four conditions: either alone, with a virtual companion laughing or verbally expressing amusement at fixed time points (pre-scripted), or additionally joining the participant's laughter (responsive companion). Amusement was assessed facially and vocally by coding Duchenne Displays and laughter vocalizations. Participants' cheerful mood pre and post the film watching and positive experience were assessed. Results showed that high trait cheerful individuals generally experienced and expressed more amusement than low trait cheerful individuals. The presence of a virtual companion (compared to being alone) led to more laughter for individuals low in trait cheerfulness. Unexpectedly, the responsive companion did not elicit more amusement than the pre-scripted companion. The general disliking of virtual companions and gelotophobia related negatively to amusement. Amusement expressing virtual companions may be used in interventions aiming at eliciting positive responses, especially for individuals with higher thresholds for amusement.","Hofmann, J.",0,10.1007/s11031-014-9461-y,854
2322,Bridging the Mechanical and the Human Mind: Spontaneous Mimicry of a Physically Present Android,"The spontaneous mimicry of others' emotional facial expressions constitutes a rudimentary form of empathy and facilitates social understanding. Here, we show that human participants spontaneously match facial expressions of an android physically present in the room with them. This mimicry occurs even though these participants find the android unsettling and are fully aware that it lacks intentionality. Interestingly, a video of that same android elicits weaker mimicry reactions, occurring only in participants who find the android ""humanlike."" These findings suggest that spontaneous mimicry depends on the salience of humanlike features highlighted by face-to-face contact, emphasizing the role of presence in human-robot interaction. Further, the findings suggest that mimicry of androids can dissociate from knowledge of artificiality and experienced emotional unease. These findings have implications for theoretical debates about the mechanisms of imitation. They also inform creation of future robots that effectively build rapport and engagement with their human users.","Hofree, G.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0099934,855
2326,"Behind the Robot's Smiles and Frowns: In Social Context, People Do Not Mirror Android's Expressions But React to Their Informational Value","Facial actions are key elements of non-verbal behavior. Perceivers' reactions to others' facial expressions often represent a match or mirroring (e.g., they smile to a smile). However, the information conveyed by an expression depends on context. Thus, when shown by an opponent, a smile conveys bad news and evokes frowning. The availability of anthropomorphic agents capable of facial actions raises the question of how people respond to such agents in social context. We explored this issue in a study where participants played a strategic game with or against a facially expressive android. Electromyography (EMG) recorded participants' reactions over zygomaticus muscle (smiling) and corrugator muscle (frowning). We found that participants' facial responses to android's expressions reflect their informational value, rather than a direct match. Overall, participants smiled more, and frowned less, when winning than losing. Critically, participants' responses to the game outcome were similar regardless of whether it was conveyed via the android's smile or frown. Furthermore, the outcome had greater impact on people's facial reactions when it was conveyed through android's face than a computer screen. These findings demonstrate that facial actions of artificial agents impact human facial responding. They also suggest a sophistication in human-robot communication that highlights the signaling value of facial expressions.","Hofree, G.",0,10.3389/fnbot.2018.00014,856

The study data consisted commonly used home economics (n=4) and health education (n=3) textbooks. Nutrition contents of the textbooks were compatible with the national core curriculum. The scope of nutrition education in health education textbooks was health centred, whereas home economics textbooks considered also cultural and environmental aspects of nutrition education. All textbooks considered adolescents' current nutrition issues. The pedagogical style was usually participative in exercises and neutral informative in a plain text; however, a considerable amount of text was written on using a persuasive style. Overall, textbook pedagogical style supported the constructivist idea of learning, and textbooks can be a positive agent for change as we strive towards a better nutrition health in children and adolescents.","Hokkanen, S.",0,10.1111/ijcs.12008,857
2333,"'I'm Not a Real Boy, I'm a Puppet': Computer-Animated Films and Anthropomorphic Subjectivity","This article rethinks anthropomorphic representation and animated animality within the context of the contemporary digital era and, more precisely, against the rise of the computer-animated feature film. By interrogating the fractured identity of the anthropomorph as a necessarily hybrid figuration, it suggests how popular computer-animated films have rejected anthropos and instead exploited the non-human morphe element to manipulate virtual space through anthropomorphic subjectivity. The anthropomorph is here refined into a more prescriptive and functional agent, absorbing viewers into a spectatorial game that sharpens their awareness of the digital realm. Films such as Ratatouille (Brad Bird, 2007) and Bee Movie (Simon J Smith and Steve Hickner, 2007) are offered as case studies that reflect the shift towards the form or morphe element, one that is registered through a particular mode of subjectified address. Drawing on Gilles Deleuze's notion of 'gaseous perception' to elucidate this delivery of enlivened space, this article argues that the computer-animated film is implicated in a hierarchical switch away from humanlike behaviour to embrace the possibilities of the anthropomorph's non-human morphe identity, thereby upturning the received narrative of how anthropomorphism has been conceptualized among critical studies of animation.","Holliday, C.",0,10.1177/1746847716661456,858
2335,,"Pedestrian behaviour simulation models are being developed with the intention to simulate human behaviour in various environments in both non-emergency and emergency situations. These models are applied with the objective to understand the underlying causes and dynamics of pedestrian behaviour and how the environment or the environment’s intrinsic procedures can be adjusted in order to provide an improvement of human comfort and safety. In order to realistically model pedestrian behaviour in complex environments, the specific human behaviour patterns which govern their behaviour need to be represented. It is thereby of importance to understand the causal chains between the surrounding conditions and the pedestrians’ behaviours: the impact of the environment’s purpose and facilities as well as the pedestrians’ individual goals on the pedestrians’ planning and route choice behaviour; the influence of emergent stimuli on the pedestrians’ plans and environment usage; the influence of the pedestrians’ environment usage under normal usage conditions on the pedestrians’ behaviour in response to a potential alarm event. In this thesis, a framework is developed for modelling advanced individual pedestrian behaviours and especially purpose-driven environment usage. The framework thereby aims to assist building and facility planners in improving a building’s layout in terms of pedestrian experience and walking routes. In this thesis, a comprehensive review on how individual pedestrian behaviour and the pedestrians’ environment usage are realised in current pedestrian behaviour simulation models has been undertaken. In addition, current theories on human decision making, goal-driven behaviour and emotion modelling have been surveyed from the research fields of artificial intelligence, virtual reality simulation, human psychology and human behavioural sciences. From this survey, theories suitable for this thesis’ cause have been identified and combined for the proposed Cognitive Pedestrian Agent Framework (CPAF). The proposed framework contains a sophisticated human decision making model, a multi-faceted individual knowledge representation, a model to realise situational and contextual awareness, and a novel realisation of a human path planning heuristic. The proposed framework has been demonstrated in the simulation of a building usage-cycle use case. Further, it has been outlined how the proposed framework could be used to model experiential alarm response behaviour.","Hollmann, Claudia",0,,859
2337,,"Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems aim to mimic the adaptive behaviour of human tutors by delivering tutorial content as part of a dynamic exchange of information conducted using natural language. Deciding when it is beneficial to intervene in a student’s learning process is an important skill for tutoring. Human tutors use prior knowledge about the student, discourse content and learner non-verbal behaviour to choose when intervention will help learners overcome impasse. Experienced human tutors adapt discourse and pedagogy based on recognition of comprehension and non-comprehension indicative learner behaviour. In this research non-verbal behaviour is explored as a method of computationally analysing reading comprehension so as to equip an intelligent conversational agent with the human-like ability to estimate comprehension from non-verbal behaviour as a decision making trigger for feedback, prompts or hints. This thesis presents research that combines a conversational intelligent tutoring system (CITS) with near real-time comprehension classification based on modelling of e-learner non-verbal behaviour to estimate learner comprehension during on-screen conversational tutoring and to use comprehension classifications as a trigger for intervening with hints, prompts or feedback for the learner. To improve the effectiveness of tuition in e-learning, this research aims to design, develop and demonstrate novel computational methods for modelling e-learner comprehension of on-screen information in near real-time and for adapting CITS tutorial discourse and pedagogy in response to perception of comprehension indicative behaviour. The contribution of this research is to detail the motivation for, design of, and evaluation of a system which has the human-like ability to introduce micro-adaptive feedback into tutorial discourse in response to automatic perception of e-learner reading comprehension. This research evaluates empirically whether e-learner non-verbal behaviour can be modelled to classify comprehension in near real-time and presents a near real-time comprehension classification system which achieves normalised comprehension classification accuracy of 75%. Understanding e-learner comprehension creates exciting opportunities for advanced personalisation of materials, discourse, challenge and the digital environment itself. The research suggests a benefit is gained from comprehension based adaptation in conversational intelligent tutoring systems, with a controlled trial of a comprehension based adaptive CITS called Hendrix 2.0 showing increases in tutorial assessment scores of up to 17% when comprehension based discourse adaptation is deployed to scaffold the learning experience.","Holmes, Michael Henry",0,,860
2339,Infants' Visual Preferences for Prosocial Behavior and Other-Race Characters at 6 Months: An Eye-Tracking Study,"There is growing evidence that infants display preferences for prosocial agents. However, recent studies have reported conflicting results about the impact of appearance on these preferences. The current study investigated the relative influence of behavior and face/race on 6-month-old infants' evaluation of social agents when these two aspects are in competition. In a short research study featuring animated cartoons where agents interacted in a ball game, we used eye-tracking methodology to assess infants' preferences (a) for prosocial behavior, (b) for one kind of appearance, represented by race, and (c) when the two aspects were pitted against one another. The two control conditions revealed preferences for prosocial agents and for other-race appearance. No preference could be found at group level in the third condition, where these two aspects competed with each other. However, a profile analysis revealed that when this situation was a source of conflict in terms of the preferences identified in the control conditions, infants prioritized appearance over behavior.","Holvoet, C.",0,10.1177/2158244018784993,861
2343,"Infants' social evaluation abilities: testing their preference for prosocial agents at 6, 12 and 18 months with different social scenarios","Recent research suggests that infants prefer prosocial behaviour. However, some studies have failed to report this preference, raising the question of which specific parameters allow it to be observed. We attempted to answer this question by investigating whether the preference varies (1) with age (by testing infants aged 6, 12 and 18 months), (2) with type of social behaviour (help, play or share) and (3) when the pro- and antisocial agents' appearance is manipulated (neutral, own-race or other-race faces). To this end, we use an eye-tracking methodology to assess infants' preferences for pro- versus antisocial agents featured in animated cartoons. We found that the prosocial preference was not stable across ages and varied according to social scenario. No sound conclusion could be reached about the influence of faces. Our results raise a new question, concerning the extent to which very young infants perceive prosociality in complex social behaviour.","Holvoet, C.",0,10.1080/03004430.2017.1361415,862
2347,,"Craving is recognized as an important diagnosis criterion for substance use disorders (SUDs) and a predictive factor of relapse. Various methods to study craving exist; however, suppressing craving to successfully promote abstinence remains an unmet clinical need in SUDs. One reason is that social and environmental contexts recalling drug and alcohol consumption in the everyday life of patients suffering from SUDs often initiate craving and provoke relapse. Current behavioral therapies for SUDs use the cue-exposure approach to suppress salience of social and environmental contexts that may induce craving. They facilitate learning and cognitive reinforcement of new behavior and entrain craving suppression in the presence of cues related to drug and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, craving often overweighs behavioral training especially in real social and environmental contexts with peer pressure encouraging the use of substance, such as parties and bars. In this perspective, virtual reality (VR) is gaining interest in the development of cue-reactivity paradigms and practices new skills in treatment. VR enhances ecological validity of traditional craving-induction measurement. In this review, we discuss results from (1) studies using VR and alternative virtual agents in the induction of craving and (2) studies combining cue-exposure therapy with VR in the promotion of abstinence from drugs and alcohol use. They used virtual environments, displaying alcohol and drugs to SUD patients. Moreover, some environments included avatars. Hence, some studies have focused on the social interactions that are associated with drug-seeking behaviors and peer pressure. Findings indicate that VR can successfully increase craving. Studies combining cue–exposure therapy with virtual environment, however, reported mitigated success so far.

2350,,"Adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase (APR) is an iron-sulfur protein that catalyzes the first committed step in the de novo biosynthesis of cysteine in mycobacteria. APR is a validated target for the development of new antitubercular agents, particularly for the treatment of latent infection. The goal of this research is to develop small-molecule inhibitors of APR that serve as tools for biological discovery or as leads for drug discovery. Toward this end, we have combined virtual ligand screening (VLS), rational structure-based design, and enzyme mechanism analysis. Through VLS and experimental testing, we have identified the first nonphosphate-based inhibitors of APR and discovered an additional ligand-binding site, which could be exploited for the design of bifunctional small-molecules. To facilitate the development of potent and specific inhibitors of APR, we have also probed the molecular determinants that underlie binding and specificity via a series of substrate and product analogs. Our findings reveal a critical role for the α-phosphate group and provide evidence for ligand-specific conformational states within the C-terminal domain. In addition, we demonstrate that a conserved histidine within the flexible segment plays an essential role in substrate binding and in closure of the active site lid. Subsequently, a structure-based approach was utilized in the design and synthesis of an irreversible cysteine-targeted inhibitor of APR, which locks the enzyme in its closed, inactive state. Finally, we have investigated the function of the iron-sulfur cluster in APR and provide kinetic evidence that the cofactor plays an essential role in substrate specificity of sulfonucleotide reductases. Collectively, these data further our understanding of the APR reaction mechanism and pave the way for development of new inhibitors to target this therapeutically important class of enzymes.","Hong, Jiyoung A.",0,,864
2352,Behavioural responsiveness of virtual users for students' creative problem-finding in architectural design,"Previous theories have hypothesised that the behavioural responsiveness of autonomous, anthropomorphic computer-agents of virtual users (VUsers) influences designers' creative problem-finding in architectural design; however, this assumption has not yet been investigated. To examine this hypothesis, the present study compared the presence and non-presence of VUsers and used responsive and non-responsive VUsers in students' authentic problem-finding. Statistical analyses based on the students' self-assessments revealed that: (1) the presence of VUsers better facilitates the discovery of more unexpected and functional design solutions, as well as more evaluations of the usability and values of design solutions, including users' safety and comfort, than the non-presence of VUsers; (2) VUsers' responsive behaviours facilitated the discovery of more unexpected and physical functions of design solutions, as well as more evaluations of users' safety and comfort, than non-responsive VUser behaviours; and (3) when the behavioural details were not distinctive, the evaluation scores were indifferent.","Hong, S.

2354,A courseware to script animated pedagogical agents in instructional material for elementary students in English education,"Animated agents are virtual characters who demonstrate facial expressions, gestures, movements, and speech to facilitate students' engagement in the learning environment. Our research developed a courseware that supports a XML-based markup language and an authoring tool for teachers to script animated pedagogical agents in teaching materials. The design of the markup language refers to Mayer's segmenting principle that is efficient for assisting a teacher to edit teaching contents into a set of segments and further organize the segments in a given lesson in class. This paper details a case study of applying the proposed courseware for elementary students in English education, and further investigates how the instructional materials scripted using the courseware affect the learning achievement of students. Two groups of participants from an elementary school in Taiwan enrolled in this experiment. The experimental group used animated agent-based instructional materials in their English classroom, whereas the control group participated in a traditional curriculum. Post-test results revealed that the experimental group outperformed the control group. Our experiment demonstrated that the developed courseware provides an opportunity for scripting animated pedagogical agents as appropriate instructional tools in a computer-assisted language learning environment to foster elementary students' English learning.","Hong, Z.

2359,Testing the model-observer similarity hypothesis with text-based worked examples,"Example-based learning is a very effective and efficient instructional strategy for novices. It can be implemented using text-based worked examples that provide a written demonstration of how to perform a task, or (video) modelling examples in which an instructor (the model') provides a demonstration. The model-observer similarity (MOS) hypothesis predicts that the effectiveness of modelling examples partly depends on the degree to which learners perceive the models to be similar to them. It is an open question, however, whether perceived similarity with the person who created the example, would also affect learning from text-based worked examples. Therefore, two experiments were conducted to investigate whether MOS would also play a role in learning from worked examples. In Experiment 1 (N=147), students were led to believe via pictures and a short story that the worked examples were created by a male or female peer student. Males showed higher performance and confidence, but no effects of MOS on learning were found. In Experiment 2 (N=130), students were led to believe that a peer student or a teacher created the examples. Again, no effects of MOS were found. These findings suggest that the perceived origin of text-based worked examples is not important for learning.","Hoogerheide, V.",1,10.1080/01443410.2015.1109609,868
2364,Learning from video modeling examples: does gender matter?,"Online learning from video modeling examples, in which a human model demonstrates and explains how to perform a learning task, is an effective instructional method that is increasingly used nowadays. However, model characteristics such as gender tend to differ across videos, and the model-observer similarity hypothesis suggests that such characteristics may affect learning. Therefore, this study investigated whether the effectiveness of learning how to solve a probability calculation problem from video modeling examples would vary as a function of the model's and observer's gender. In a 2 (Model: Female/Male) x 2 (Observer: Female/Male) between-subject design, 167 secondary education students learned how to solve probability calculation problems by observing video modeling examples. Results showed no effects of Model or Observer gender on learning and near transfer. Male students reported higher self-efficacy than female students. Compared to a female model, observing a male model enhanced perceived competence more from pretest to posttest, irrespective of observers' gender. Furthermore, learning from a male model was less effortful and more enjoyable for male students than for female students. These results suggest that gender of both model and observer can matter in terms of affective variables experienced during learning, and that instructional designers may want to consider this when creating (online) learning environments with video modeling examples.","Hoogerheide, V.",1,10.1007/s11251-015-9360-y,869
2367,"Learning from video modeling examples: Content kept equal, adults are more effective models than peers","Learning from (video) modeling examples in which a model demonstrates how to perform a task is an effective instructional strategy. The model-observer similarity (MOS) hypothesis postulates that (perceived) similarity between learners and the model in terms of age or expertise moderates the effectiveness of modeling examples. Findings have been mixed, however, possibly because manipulations of MOS were often associated with differences in example content and manipulations of (perceived) expertise confounded with age. Therefore, we investigated whether similarity with the model in terms of age and putative expertise would affect cognitive and motivational aspects of learning when the example content is kept equal across conditions. Adolescents (N = 157) watched a short video in which a peer or adult model was introduced as having low or high expertise, followed by two video modeling examples in which the model demonstrated how to troubleshoot electrical circuit problems. Results showed no effects of putative expertise. In contrast to the MOS hypothesis, adult models were more effective and efficient to learn from than peer models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In a speed-date with 54 young females, either our software or human confederates controlled the simulation of the virtual human's affective performance. Results were obtained with frequentist analysis and Bayesian structural equation modeling. Indeed, participants did not detect differences and observed similarity in the emotional behavior of the virtual human and in the way it assumingly perceived them. Additionally, participants did not recognize different but similar cognitive-affective structures between humans and our system. As is, designers may use our software for believable affective virtual humans or robots. Moreover, as far as the richness of interaction possibilities in the speed-dating session allowed, our software seems to reproduce human cognitive-affective structures.","Hoorn, J.

2377,,"This thesis aims to quantify the reduction in radiation dose deposited in glandular breast tissue achieved by using tilted gantry acquisition during cardiac CT scans. Previous work by Halpern et al. suggested using tilted acquisition parallel to the long axis of the patient's heart. However, for a larger portion of the population this is not feasible due to the design of current scanners (which are limited to maximum tilt angles of 30 degrees). This study investigated the potential dose reduction and image quality effects at commercially available tilt angles between 0–30 degrees through simulation and experimental studies. Upon IRB approval, datasets from 10 female patients from Froedtert Hospital (Milwaukee, WI) were used to create voxelized phantom models for the computer simulation. Experimental measurements were performed with an anthropomorphic phantom on a clinical CT scanner (Discovery CT750HD, GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Gilates, England). For both simulation and experimental studies, radiation dose to the breast and reconstructed image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was quantified for tilt angles between 0–30 degrees in five degree increments. The simulated and experimental results demonstrate that tilted gantry acquisition reduces the glandular breast dose from cardiac CT scans when compared to conventional (non-tilted) axial scans. Maximum reductions of 33%–81% (mean, 55%) were achieved with a 30-degree gantry tilt. However, a decrease in image quality by approximately 15% when compared to non-tilted images is seen in the simulated results. The image quality is found to remain equivalent, on average, up to a 15 degree tilt. At a 15 degree tilt, a mean breast dose reduction of 12%–64% (mean, 30%) was found.","Hoppe, Michael E.",0,,873
2379,A pedagogical framework for facilitating parents' learning in nurse-parent partnership,"Nursing work increasingly demands forms of expertise that complement specialist knowledge. In child and family nursing, this need arises when nurses work in partnership with parents of young children at risk. Partnership means working with parents in respectful, negotiated and empowering ways. Existing partnership literature emphasises communicative and relational skills, but this paper focuses on nurses' capacities to facilitate parents' learning. Referring to data from home visiting, day-stay and specialist toddler clinic services in Sydney, a pedagogical framework is presented. Analysis shows how nurses notice aspects of children, parents and parent-child interactions as a catalyst for building on parents' strengths, enhancing guided chance or challenging unhelpful constructs. Prior research shows the latter can be a sticking point in partnership, but this paper reveals diverse ways in which challenges are folded into learning process that position parents as agents of positive change. Noticing is dependent on embodied and communicative expertise, conceptualised in terms of sensory and reported channels. The framework offers a new view of partnership as mind-expanding for the parent and specifies the nurse's role in facilitating this process.","Hopwood, N.",0,10.1111/nin.12220,874
2382,,"Nonverbal behavior plays an integral part in a majority of social interaction scenarios. Being able to adjust nonverbal behavior and influence other's responses are considered valuable social skills. A deficiency in nonverbal behavior can have detrimental consequences in personal as well as in professional life. Many people desire help, but due to limited resources, logistics, and social stigma, they are unable to get the training that they require. Therefore, there is a need for developing automated interventions to enhance human nonverbal behaviors that are standardized, objective, repeatable, low-cost, and can be deployed outside of the clinic. In this thesis, I design and validate a computational framework designed to enhance human nonverbal behavior. As part of the framework, I developed My Automated Conversation coacH (MACH)—a novel system that provides ubiquitous access to social skills training. The system includes a virtual agent that reads facial expressions, speech, and prosody, and responds with verbal and nonverbal behaviors in real-time. As part of explorations on nonverbal behavior sensing, I present results on understanding the underlying meaning behind smiles elicited under frustration, delight or politeness. I demonstrate that it is useful to model the dynamic properties of smiles that evolve through time and that while a smile may occur in positive and in negative situations, its underlying temporal structures may help to disambiguate the underlying state, in some cases, better than humans. I demonstrate how the new insights and developed technology from this thesis became part of a real-time system that is able to provide visual feedback to the participants on their nonverbal behavior. In particular, the system is able to provide summary feedback on smile tracks, pauses, speaking rate, fillers and intonation. It is also able to provide focused feedback on volume modulation and enunciation, head gestures, and smiles for the entire interaction. Users are able to practice as many times as they wish and compare their data across sessions. I validate the MACH framework in the context of job interviews with 90 MIT undergraduate students. The findings indicate that MIT students using MACH are perceived as stronger candidates compared to the students in the control group. The results were reported based on the judgments of the independent MIT career counselors and Mechanical Turkers', who did not participate in the study, and were blind to the study conditions.

2384,,"Research suggests that the pedagogical thoughts of postsecondary teachers exist on a continuum from student-centered to teaching-centered orientations, the latter of which are more pedagogically effective than the former. However, this body of literature has been critiqued for insufficient conceptualization of psychological constructs and the lack of connection to research in cognitive psychology. In this thesis I advance a multi-dimensional account of faculty practice based on situative theories of cognition that address these gaps. Using thematic, data reduction (i.e., cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling), social network, and thematic network analysis techniques, I examine interviews and classroom observations from 56 science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty from three public research universities in the U.S. Results indicated that 15 types of beliefs could be discerned from the data, with the most widely held being that students best learn through practice and persistence. These beliefs can be grouped into two clusters that appear to have an underlying dimensionality characterized by which agent (teacher or student) is seen as primarily responsible for constructing meaning. Additionally, two beliefs (i.e., practice and perseverance, and that people learn according to different styles) appear to be stand-alone beliefs unrelated to this dimension. Further, 37 faculty in the study reported beliefs that cut across the two clusters and stand-alone beliefs, thereby indicating that most faculty cannot be characterized as holding a particular ""type"" of belief. Analyses of classroom observation data using social network analysis resulted in five distinct configurations of teaching dimensions across the disciplinary groups in the study. Case studies of three faculty demonstrate how beliefs, goals, prior knowledge, and perceived affordances within the organizational context all interact to shape planning and teaching. Results suggest that: (a) a multi-dimensional account of planning and teaching that focuses on tracing a single element throughout the instructional process provides a detailed account of faculty practice, (b) efforts to label individuals as holding a particular ""type"" of belief, and corresponding assumptions regarding the efficacy of their teaching, should be avoided, and, (c) beliefs alone do not determine practice but they interact with other features to help define problem spaces for teaching.","Hora, Matthew Tadashi",0,,876

2390,The Perception of Emotion in Artificial Agents,"Given recent technological developments in robotics, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality, it is perhaps unsurprising that the arrival of emotionally expressive and reactive artificial agents is imminent. However, if such agents are to become integrated into our social milieu, it is imperative to establish an understanding of whether and how humans perceive emotion in artificial agents. In this review, we incorporate recent findings from social robotics, virtual reality, psychology, and neuroscience to examine how people recognize and respond to emotions displayed by artificial agents. First, we review how people perceive emotions expressed by an artificial agent, such as facial and bodily expressions. Second, we evaluate the similarities and differences in the consequences of perceived emotions in artificial compared to human agents. Besides accurately recognizing the emotional state of an artificial agent, it is critical to understand how humans respond to those emotions. Does interacting with an angry robot induce the same responses in people as interacting with an angry person? Similarly, does watching a robot rejoice when it wins a game elicit similar feelings of elation in the human observer? Here, we provide an overview of the current state of emotion expression and perception during interactions with artificial agents, as well as a clear articulation of the challenges and guiding principles to be addressed as we move ever closer to truly emotional artificial agents.","Hortensius, R.",0,10.1109/tcds.2018.2826921,879
2393,Ubiquitous computer aided design: A broken promise or a Sleeping Beauty?,"As a novel computational approach, ubiquitous computing was emerging at the beginning of the 1980s and has reached a rather mature level by now. It assumes that computing can be available anywhere, anytime and in any context due to technological developments, social demands and calm implementations. Over the years, the opportunities of this computing paradigm have been explored and the benefits have been exploited successfully in many application fields. This survey paper addresses ubiquitous computing from the perspective of enabling computer aided design. The specific objectives of the reported survey are to: (i) give an overall account of the current status of ubiquitous computing and technologies, (ii) cast light on how ubiquitous computing has influenced the development of CAD systems, tools, and methods, and (iii) critically investigate future development opportunities of ubiquitous computing enabled computer aided design. First, the paper discusses the principles and typical technologies of ubiquitous computing. Then, the development and spectrum of the so-called standard computer aided design tasks are analyzed from a computational point of view. Afterwards, the already implemented design enabling functionalities are discussed and some additional functional possibilities are considered. The literature provides evidence that ubiquitous computing has not managed to revolutionize the methodologies or the systems of computer aided design so far, though many researchers intensively studied the affordances and the application possibilities of ubiquitous technologies. One reason is that ubiquitous computing technologies had in the last two decades to compete with other kinds of computational technologies, such as high-capacity computing, high-speed networking, immersive virtual reality, knowledge ontologies, smart software agents, mobile communication, etc., which had a much stronger influence on the development of computer aided design methods and systems. In combination with the rather conservative and conventionalist industrial practice of CAD system development and application, this may explain why the ubiquitous computing revolution remained weak in computer aided design. The literature clearly indicates that application of ubiquitous technologies did not lead to radically new functionalities that could have been exploited by the concerned industries. Consequently, it seems to be possible that computer aided design simply steps over the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and expects new functionalities from the emerging new computing paradigms, such as brain-computer interfacing, cyber-physical computing, biological computing, or quantum computing.

The associative mechanisms enable even generalization of rules or algorithms. These systems can reproduce generalization not only to train and classify static objects but also to form new sequences, which enables creativity of these systems.

2397,,"In the past few years there has been a lot of development in the field of tele-presence. These developments have caused tele-presence technologies to become easily accessible and also for the experience to be enhanced. Since tele-presence is not only used for tele-presence assisted group meetings but also in some forms of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), these activities have also been facilitated. One of the lingering issues has to do with how to properly transmit presence of non-co-located members to the rest of the group. Using current commercially available tele-presence technology it is possible to exhibit a limited level of social presence but no physical presence. In order to cater for this lack of presence a system is implemented here using tele-operated robots as avatars for remote team members and had its efficacy tested. This testing includes both the level of presence that can be exhibited by robot avatars but also how the efficacy of these robots for this task changes depending on the morphology of the robot. Using different types of robots, a humanoid robot and an industrial robot arm, as tele-presence avatars, it is found that the humanoid robot using an appropriate control system is better at exhibiting a social presence. Further, when compared to a voice only scenario, both robots proved significantly better than with only voice in terms of both cooperative task solving and social presence. These results indicate that using an appropriate control system, a humanoid robot can be better than an industrial robot in these types of tasks and the validity of aiming for a humanoid design behaving in a human-like way in order to emulate social interactions that are closer to human norms. This has implications for the design of autonomous socially interactive robot systems.","Hossen Mamode, H. Z.",0,,882
2399,Video intervention changes parent perception of all-terrain vehicle (ATV) safety for children,"Background Children aged <16 years account for 25% of deaths on all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), despite public health and industry warning against paediatric use. Parents often underestimate instability and other risks associated with ATVs. Objective To determine if a brief intervention consisting of validated computer simulations of ATV performance with a child driver changes attitudes, beliefs and planned safety behaviours of parents of children who ride ATVs. Design/methods Participants were parents of children presenting to a children's hospital emergency department. All participants had children who had ridden an ATV in the past year. Subjects viewed a video simulation of ATVs in scenarios featuring 6-year-old and 10-year-old biofidelic anthropomorphic test devices. Parents completed a survey both before and after viewing the video to report attitudes/beliefs on ATV safety for children, use of safety equipment and family ATV use, as well as risk and safety perception. Results Surveys were collected from 99 parents, mostly mothers (79%), Caucasian (61%) and had high school education or less (64%). The intervention shifted parents' belief in overall ATV safety (48% unsafe preintervention, 73% unsafe post-intervention, p<0.001). After viewing the video simulation, parents were almost six times more likely to perceive ATVs as unsafe (OR 5.96, 95% CI 2.32 to 15.31, p<0.001) and many parents (71%) planned to change family ATV safety rules. Conclusion Video simulations of ATV performance with child riders changed short-term risk perception and planned safety behaviours of parents whose children ride ATVs. Similar educational interventions hold promise for larger-scale studies in at-risk populations.","House, T.",0,10.1136/injuryprev-2015-041880,883
2406,Investigating the simulation elements of environment and control: Extending the Uncanny Valley Theory to simulations,"Recent technological advancements have enabled the widespread application of simulations in organizations, particularly for training contexts. Two important simulation elements, environment and control, have often been shown to improve trainee outcomes. I argue that environment and control are reliant on each other, and their combined effects are explained by extending the Uncanny Valley Theory. The Uncanny Valley Theory proposes that individuals are comfortable with experiences that are very dissimilar or similar to reality, but are uncomfortable with experiences that fall between these conditions. In simulations, perceptions of realism are created through observations (environment) and interactions (control). Users are comfortable with experiences when these elements are in agreement; however, an Uncanny Valley effect may occur when these elements are in disagreement. In the current article, two studies analyze the realism of environment and control in predicting trainee reactions and learning outcomes. Both studies support the extension of the Uncanny Valley Theory to simulations. Simulations with only ""low"" or only ""high"" environment and control produce the greatest outcomes, and those with mixed ""low"" and ""high"" elements produce the worst outcomes; however, trainees did not differ in reactions to the simulations, indicating that the Uncanny Valley phenomenon in simulations may operate subconsciously.

2407,Agent-patient similarity affects sentence structure in language production: evidence from subject omissions in Mandarin,"Interference effects from semantically similar items are well-known in studies of single word production, where the presence of semantically similar distractor words slows picture naming. This article examines the consequences of this interference in sentence production and tests the hypothesis that in situations of high similarity-based interference, producers are more likely to omit one of the interfering elements than when there is low semantic similarity and thus low interference.This work investigated language production in Mandarin, which allows subject noun phrases to be omitted in discourse contexts in which the subject entity has been previously mentioned in the discourse. We hypothesize that Mandarin speakers omit the subject more often when the subject and the object entities are conceptually similar. A corpus analysis of simple transitive sentences found higher rates of subject omission when both the subject and object were animate (potentially yielding similarity-based interference) than when the subject was animate and object was inanimate. A second study manipulated subject-object animacy in a picture description task and replicated this result: participants omitted the animate subject more often when the object was also animate than when it was inanimate. These results suggest that similarity-based interference affects sentence forms, particularly when the agent of the action is mentioned in the sentence. Alternatives and mechanisms for this effect are discussed.","Hsiao, Y. L.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01015,885

Recently developed hybrid models that combine different machine learning techniques have shown promising results. This research proposes a novel classification model based on bio-inspired computing mechanism to combine the artificial bee colony (ABC) approach and support vector machine (SVM) technique to enhance the credit ratings and credit rating changes prediction. Experiments are based on a ten-year real-world dataset taken from the Compustat credit rating database. Three additional financial datasets from the UCI datasets are also used to access the robust and convergence performance. The experimental outcomes indicate the proposed model provides improved prediction accuracy than other traditional statistical or soft-computing approaches, suggesting that the proposed approach is well-designed to potential credit rating or changes predicting.

2413,Does unbelted safety requirement affect protection for belted occupants?,"Objective: Federal regulations in the United States require vehicles to meet occupant performance requirements with unbelted test dummies. Removing the test requirements with unbelted occupants might encourage the deployment of seat belt interlocks and allow restraint optimization to focus on belted occupants. The objective of this study is to compare the performance of restraint systems optimized for belted-only occupants with those optimized for both belted and unbelted occupants using computer simulations and field crash data analyses.Methods: In this study, 2 validated finite element (FE) vehicle/occupant models (a midsize sedan and a midsize SUV) were selected. Restraint design optimizations under standardized crash conditions (U.S.-NCAP and FMVSS 208) with and without unbelted requirements were conducted using Hybrid III (HIII) small female and midsize male anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) in both vehicles on both driver and right front passenger positions. A total of 10 to 12 design parameters were varied in each optimization using a combination of response surface method (RSM) and genetic algorithm. To evaluate the field performance of restraints optimized with and without unbelted requirements, 55 frontal crash conditions covering a greater variety of crash types than those in the standardized crashes were selected. A total of 1,760 FE simulations were conducted for the field performance evaluation. Frontal crashes in the NASS-CDS database from 2002 to 2012 were used to develop injury risk curves and to provide the baseline performance of current restraint system and estimate the injury risk change by removing the unbelted requirement.Results: Unbelted requirements do not affect the optimal seat belt and airbag design parameters in 3 out of 4 vehicle/occupant position conditions, except for the SUV passenger side. Overall, compared to the optimal designs with unbelted requirements, optimal designs without unbelted requirements generated the same or lower total injury risks for belted occupants depending on statistical methods used for the analysis, but they could also increase the total injury risks for unbelted occupants.Conclusions: This study demonstrated potential for reducing injury risks to belted occupants if the unbelted requirements are eliminated. Further investigations are necessary to confirm these findings.","Hu, J. W.",0,10.1080/15389588.2017.1298096,887
2422,Rear Seat Restraint System Optimization for Older Children in Frontal Crashes,"Objective: Analyses of crash injury data have shown that injury risk increases when children transition from belt-positioning boosters to the vehicle seat belt alone. The objective of this study is to investigate how to improve the restraint environment for these children. Methods: A parametric analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of body size, seat belt anchorage locations, and rear seat design parameters on the injury risks in frontal crashes of children aged 6 to 12years old using a newly developed parametric child anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD) model. Restraint design optimizations were also conducted to obtain ranges of optimal restraint system configurations that provide best protections for 6-, 9-, and 12-year-old children. Results: Simulation results showed that child body size was the dominant factor affecting outcome measures. In general, lower and more rearward D-rings (upper belt anchorages), higher and more forward lap belt anchorages, and shorter, stiffer, and thinner seat cushions were associated with improved restraint performance. In these simulations, children with smaller body sizes require more-forward D-rings, inboard anchors, and outboard anchor locations to avoid submarining. However, these anchorage locations increase head excursions relative to more-rearward anchorages. Conclusions: The balance of reducing head and knee excursions and preventing submarining indicates that an optimization approach is necessary to improve protection for 6- to 12-year-old child occupants. The findings of this study provided design guidelines for future rear seat restraint system. Supplemental materials are available for this article.

Gross emotion regulation theory and Five Factors Model (FFM) which are the theoretical basis are firstly described. And then the importance of the personality effect on the emotion expression process is proposed, and how to make the effect quantization is discussed. After that, the algorithm of HMM is used to describe the process of emotional state transition and expression, and the performance transferring probability affected by personality is calculated. At last, the algorithm model is simulated and applied in a robot platform.

2431,,"Human conversants in dialog adjust their behavior to their conversational partner in many ways. In terms of language, they adapt to their partners both lexically and syntactically, by using the same referring expressions or sentence structure. In terms of gesture, they mimic their partners' gestural form, frequency, expanse and speed. However, adaptation is not about simply copying dialog partners' words, syntax, and gestures. The process of adaptation to the partner takes place under other special constraints, e.g. providing coherent and informative turns in conversation, expressing one's own personality, or achieving other social and interpersonal goals. How do speakers adapt to one another and at the same time achieve their own conversational goals? In this thesis, we first carry out an exploratory study to show that adapting to different linguistic features results in different style perceptions: adapting to hedges increase perceptions of friendliness, while adapting to syntactic structures increases perceptions of naturalness. On the basis of these results, we propose an adaptation measure that allows us to capture and model adaptation behaviors that may orient to different levels or types of linguistic representations, such as lexical, syntactical, or stylistic variations in the way speakers talk. We build and compare linguistic adaptation models using our measure with four human dialog corpora, and with different feature sets to represent different levels of linguistic representations. We also explore gestural adaptation on both particular gesture forms and gesture style. We set up our experiment in the form of two virtual gents co-telling a story. We first verify that we can express the personality of virtual agents through varying gesture parameters such as speed, height, and expanse. We then show that human subjects prefer adaptive to nonadaptive virtual agents, where the adaptive virtual agent adapts the gesture form and personality of their dialog partner.","Hu, Zhichao",0,,890
2433,,"Introduction: Bone metastasis is the third most common metastasis in cancer patients, causing intractable pain and debilitating complications. However, studies have shown that conventional single-energy computed tomography (SECT) has limitation in detecting subtle bone metastases without obvious osteolysis/osteosclerosis. We hypothesize that dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) can distinguish different composition in tumors and in healthy bone marrow, facilitating the detection of bone marrow metastases. Methods: We constructed 51 semi-anthropomorphic lumbar spine phantoms embedded with 75 simulated tumors (25 mild lytic, 25 isodense, and 25 mild sclerotic). These phantoms were initially scanned without outer torso phantom encasement, and then scanned again with outer torso phantom encasement under the same machine setting in a rapid-kilovoltage-switching DECT scanner. Two radiologists independently reviewed the virtual monochromatic reconstruction in 70 keV and material decomposition images (hydroxyapatite-water, water-hydroxyapatite, cortical bone-water, water-cortical bone). We recorded reviewer’s response regarding the presence of tumors, tumor conspicuity score and image quality using 3-point Likert scales. The sensitivity and specificity of different reconstruction algorithms were evaluated with McNemar test. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate the tumor conspicuity and image quality of different algorithms. Then we validate our testing algorithms by retrospectively reviewing patients’ images in our institution. Results: Hydroxyapatite-Water material decomposition algorithm achieved higher sensitivity in detecting isodense lesions as compared to the 70 keV reconstruction (without torso phantom encasement: 94% vs 82%, p = 0.031; with torso phantom encasement: 38% vs 18%, p = 0.013). Hydroxyapatite-Water material decomposition algorithms also possessed higher tumor conspicuity score (p < 0.0001) compared to 70 keV reconstruction, and was less affected by CT artifacts. Conclusion: DECT with hydroxyapatite-water material decomposition may help detect spine marrow metastases, especially for subtle isodense tumors. Further study in prospective clinical scans is warranted.","Huang, Hsu-Cheng",0,,891
2435,An agent-based model for an air emissions cap and trade program: A case study in Taiwan,"To determine the actual status of individuals in a system and the trading interaction between polluters, this study uses an agent-based model to set up a virtual world that represents the Kaohsiung and Pingtung regions in Taiwan, which are under the country's air emissions cap and trade program. The model can simulate each controlled industry's dynamic behavioral condition with the bottom-up method and can investigate the impact of the program and determine the industry's emissions reduction and trading condition. This model can be used elastically to predict the impact of the trading market through adjusting different settings of the program rules or combining the settings with other measures. The simulation results show that the emissions trading market has an oversupply, but we find that the market trading amounts are low. Additionally, we find that increasing the air pollution fee and offset rate restrains the agents' trading decision, according to the simulation results of each scenario. In particular, NOx and SOx trading amounts are easily impacted by the pollution fee, reduction rate, and offset rate. Also, the more transparent the market, the more it can help polluters trade. Therefore, if authorities want to intervene in the emissions trading market, they must be careful in adjusting the air pollution fee and program rules; otherwise, the trading market system cannot work effectively. We also suggest setting up a trading platform to help the dealers negotiate successfully. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Huang, H. F.",0,10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.09.008,892
2437,,"Virtual humans are embodied software agents designed to simulate the appearance and social behaviors of humans, typically with the goal of facilitating natural interactions between humans and computers. They play an important role in the advancement of today's immersive virtual worlds, including domains such as virtual training (Swartout et al., 2006), education (Rowe et al., 2010), and health care (Bickmore et al., 2010). One of the key challenges in creating virtual humans is giving them human-like nonverbal behaviors. There has been extensive research on analyzing and modeling human nonverbal behaviors. Some of them rely on results from observing and manually analyzing human behaviors, while others approach the problem by exploring advanced machine learning techniques on large amounts of annotated human behavior data. However, little attention has been paid to the ""data"" these systems learn from. In this thesis, we propose a new methodology called Parasocial Consensus Sampling (PCS) to approach the problem of modeling human nonverbal behaviors from the ""data"" perspective. It is based on previous research on Parasocial Interaction theory (Horton & Wohl, 1956). The basic idea of Parasocial Consensus Sampling is to have multiple independent participants experience the same social situation parasocially (i.e. act ""as if"" they were in a real dyadic interaction) in order to gain insight into the typicality of how individuals would behave within face-to-face interactions. First, we validate this framework by applying it to model listener backchannel feedback and turn-taking behavior. The results demonstrate that (1) people are able to provide valid behavioral data in parasocial interaction, (2) PCS data generates better virtual human behaviors and (3) can be used to learn better prediction models for virtual human. Second, we show that the PCS framework can help us tease apart the causalities of the variability of human behavior in face-to-face interactions. Such research work would be difficult to perform by traditional approaches. Moreover, PCS enables much larger scale and more efficient data collection method than traditional face-to-face interaction. Finally, we integrate the PCS-data driven models into a virtual human system, and compare it with a state-of-the-art virtual human application, the Rapport Agent (Gratch et al., 2007) in real interactions. Human subjects are asked to evaluate the performance of each agent regarding the correctness of the agents' behaviors, the rapport they feel during the interactions and the overall naturalness. The results suggest that the new agent predicts the timing of backchannel feedback and end-of-turn more precisely, performs more natural behaviors and thereby creates much stronger feeling of rapport between users and agents.","Huang, Lixing",0,,893
2439,,"Using computer systems to solve problems of interests in economics has been well-established for decades. Agent-based modeling is a powerful simulation model technique to help develop and visualize a series of economic issues and social phenomenon. An agent-based model models a typical system as a collection of autonomous decision-making entities called agents. In an agent-based model, when agents make decisions based on past experiences and choose an act which performed best in a similar circumstance in the past, agent behavior is governed by Case-based Decision Theory. The aim of this study is to validate Case-based Decision Theory in explaining human and firm behavior. The proposed dissertation follows a three-article format. In the first article, we conduct a two-stage study to examine the impact of online consumer reviews on the relative product sales of electronic appliances on a large Chinese business-to-consumer e-tailing website, Tmall.com; We find the volume of online consumer reviews and the disclosure of the reviewers' personal information can help increase relative online product sales; we design a computational model of a virtual market and create artificial consumers and sellers guided by Case-Based Decision Theory and find the loyalty of artificial consumers is relatively high in the virtual online market. In the second article, we study firms' tax avoidance behavior in China; We conduct a two-stage study to investigate whether market competitiveness enhances the incentives of Chinese manufacturing firms to engage in more tax avoidance activities; We measure the simulations of the firms' tax avoidance activities against regressions, and prove that artificial firm behavior, which is governed by Case-based Decision Theory in the second stage, in the virtual manufacturing environment has the tendency to match those in reality. In the third article, we extract sentiment and semantic analysis from online consumer reviews to further explore how reviews can affect consumers' assessments of products and thus affect the product sales; We find that given the information of review valence and text readability level through sentiment and semantic analysis, we can better estimate the online product sales.","Huang, Minjie",0,,894
2441,Mechanism Design of Fashion Virtual Enterprise under Monitoring Strategy,"Designing a revenue sharing contract to prevent the moral hazard is one of the most important issues in virtual enterprise (VE). As the partners' productive effort level cannot be observed by the owner and other partners, there is usually moral hazard problem in VE. To mitigate the moral hazard, the owner sets the monitoring effort with monitoring cost. Considering a risk-neutral owner and multiple downside risk-averse partners, the owner's problem of determining the monitoring effort and incentive intensity to maximize his profit while the partners determine their productive effort to maximize their profit is addressed. The principal agent based model of this problem is proposed. By solving the model, the optimal strategy of owner and partner is derived. By comparing with the no monitoring scenario, we find that implementing suitable monitoring strategy can reduce the moral hazard effectively. Finally, by analyzing the partners' risk attitude, the result reveals that the lower the risk level of the partner is, the more the owner wants. These results suggest that VE should not only focus on the risk attitude but also on monitoring.","Huang, M.",0,10.1155/2014/519547,895
2446,,"Virtual human simulations often consider visual perception during the computation of navigation, collision, and behavior selection. The acoustic domain, however, is relatively unexplored. We explore how the simulation realism of virtual humans and crowds may depend on other modes of communication, specifically the audio channel. Models for sound propagation, localization, and perception are explored in this context. Recent work in acoustics focuses on synthesizing sound in 3D environments; however, the perception of acoustic signals by a virtual agent is a useful and realistic adjunct to any behavior selection mechanism. Previous approaches to signal propagation and statistical models of sound recognition have been too computationally expensive to integrate into real-time autonomous agent simulations. In this dissertation, we present SPREAD, a novel agent-based sound perception model using a discretized sound packet representation with acoustic features including amplitude, pitch range, and duration. SPREAD simulates how sound features are propagated, attenuated, spread and degraded as they traverse the virtual environment. We also consider how packets at the same location combine and interfere with each other. Agents perceive and classify the sounds based on this locally-received sound packet set using a hierarchical clustering scheme, and have individualized hearing and understanding of their surroundings. Using this model, we demonstrate several simulations that greatly enrich controls and outcomes.","Huang, Pengfei",0,,896

The users have to interact with the virtual agents so that the virtual agents are willing to lead the users to specific vendors. Then, the users can buy the required items. The users communicate with the virtual agents via a conversation dialog. The emotional agents' moods are affected by their own interaction (e.g., collision) while they are walking. Furthermore, their moods are also affected by the conversational responses of the users. We adopt a simple 2D mood model and use icons to represent the mood states of the agents. The mood model supports four mood states, which are Excitement, Anger, Sadness, and Neutral. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effects of the emotional virtual agents in different aspects, including task completion, time spent in conversation, following distance, and realism of the emotional virtual crowd.","Huang, P.

2450,,"The rapid rise of technologies and global interdependencies has generated novel epistemological, economic and social patterns of human behaviour. This creates emergent landscapes for education and learning and particularly for the idea of authentic pedagogy, which seeks to enhance and enrich connections between learning at school, the learner-self and the contexts where knowledge is generated and applied. Authentic pedagogy has been adapted in schools across many countries; its impact on the quality of learning has been progressively explored and the challenges of implementation have been reported repeatedly. Less attention has been paid to the pedagogical dynamics of adapting authentic pedagogy to the dominant performance oriented culture of Western schooling. This thesis critically explores this issue through the lens of complexity theory and a mixed methods participatory case study in two secondary schools in Northern England. Data collected include classroom observations, teacher's lesson plans, interviews with teachers and learners, and surveys of learner's learning power, engagement in learning, and pedagogical perceptions. The data were subjected to thematic and causal loop analysis and a modelling methodology was trialled to explore the dynamics between pedagogical authenticity and the development of students' learning power and engagement. Educational authenticity, personal authenticity and systemic fitness were identified as three quality components that underpin authentic pedagogy. These components were found to be in conflict with a performance oriented culture while they were able to form a virtuous improvement circle in an agent-based culture. The findings are synthesised in the elaboration of an agent-based pedagogical archetype. This archetype and the complexity lens through which it was developed will contribute to educators' capability in designing and steering pedagogical innovations to fulfil a locally defined purpose.","Huang, Shaofu",0,,898
2452,,"This thesis consists of one submitted journal paper and one modified conference paper, both on simulating residents' weatherization adoption decisions. Residential buildings are responsible for a large number of energy consumptions and are therefore a major contributor to climate change. Weatherization is set of approaches that can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient. This yields many benefits for residents, including reduced energy costs and improved health and safety, as well as benefits for the environment, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving resources. However, the current adoption rate for such a good practice remains low. The government has been trying to encourage the adoptions, but its efforts have had limited success. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to explore residents' weatherization adoption decisions, and then assist stakeholders in encouraging weatherization. This thesis proposes two hybrid simulation models of an urban neighborhood populated with autonomous ""households"" for their weatherization adoption decisions. They both include three modeling techniques: 1) a building energy simulation model, 2) an agent-based model, 3) a social network model. The building energy simulation model is used to calculate monthly energy consumption data of residential buildings under pre- and post- weatherized conditions, which inform households of the potential energy savings that would result from the decisions to weatherize homes. The agent-based model is used to model the detailed decision-making process of households and peer interactions among them about weatherization. The realistic topology of households' social environment, in which peer interactions and information diffusion take place, is captured by the social network model. The hybrid models represent the complex dynamic feedback loop that connects households' weatherization decisions, energy-related decision outcomes, and communication of outcomes among community members, all of which influence future decisions. The first hybrid model models a block of 29 households and their physical social networks (i.e., the physical neighborhood). The effects of households' and communities' internal attributes on households' weatherization adoption decisions are explored. Experimental results suggest that more households tend to weatherize when there is a self-weatherized leader or they have short memories about energy bills, and especially in a denser social network as it is a self-reinforcing circle where positive information about weatherization can spread more widely. Four corresponding recommended policies to improve the adoptions of weatherization are also discussed. The second hybrid model develops an agent-based model with household agents and media agents. It is embedded in a multilayer social network, which allows households to interact via both a physical social network (i.e., their neighborhood) and a virtual social network (i.e., online). We evaluate the strength of social interactions based on households' local centrality, spatial location, and social demographics. Opinion dynamics of households are captured by the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered epidemic model. This model is used to explore the effects of more characteristics of households, media, and communities, and evaluate different interventions that government and other policy makers could adopt in an effort to promote weatherization adoption in residential buildings. Experimental results demonstrate the necessity of modeling a multilayer social network and the slight usefulness of a higher value of randomness of the physical social network. The results also indicate that selecting the most important (influential) households as early adopters of weatherization could significantly promote the weatherization adoptions. In addition, slightly increasing the probability of an approved applicant being served by WAP (e.g., the current real-life value in Iowa is 2.5%) yields dramatic increases in weatherization adoptions.

An independent samples t-test showed that the treatment group, which received added anxiety reducing features, showed higher accuracy than the control group on solving practice problems (d = 0.71) and retention problems (d = 0.63) and reported higher perceived effort on learning the multimedia lesson (d = 0.66). In addition, a standard multiple linear regression found that anxiety, self efficacy, and cognitive load as a set predicted performance (R-2 = 0.56), with self-efficacy as the strongest predictor (beta = 0.63).

Second Life has also been used by the travel and tourism industry as a collaborative and commercial tool for communicating with travelers in marketing tourism destinations (e.g. Tourism Ireland) as well as business management (e.g. Starwood Hotels; Crowne Plaza; STA travel agents). However, few studies have applied formal theory to understand the significance of virtual worlds to tourism destination marketing. The purpose of our study was to develop a research framework identifying the factors that affect tourists' experience and behavioral intentions within a 3D tourism destination by examining the applicability of the Technology Acceptance Model and Hedonic Theory. From a theoretical point of view, this study provides a research framework to capture the entertainment nature of virtual worlds and to reflect the concept that people in these worlds are technology users as well as potential consumers; it does so by extending the Technology Acceptance Model to incorporate the hedonic elements of enjoyment, emotional involvement, positive emotions, and flow experience for understanding the use of 3D virtual worlds within the context of travel and tourism. For destination managers, this study could help in designing engaging and interactive 3D tourism destination sites that contribute to an increase in people's interests in visiting the tourism destination in the future.

2460,,"This dissertation examines how social preferences and norms affect decision making in a variety of settings using experimental methods.The first chapter investigates the role of transaction utility on consumer choice. I design two laboratory paradigms to mirror shopping experiences using discounts and mark-ups (Study 1) and coupons (Study 2). In my experiments, participants purchase virtual products, allowing me to isolate transaction utility from inferences of product quality. Results reveal that consumers experience transaction utility even over these virtual products and will sacrifice monetary payoffs for transaction utility. My estimates suggest consumers’ marginal rate of substitution between study earnings and transaction utility is: 37–57 cents to gain a dollar of perceived discount and 37–78 cents to avoid a dollar of perceived mark-up.Chapter 2 investigates the role of gender in negotiations. While conventional wisdom holds that women are “worse” negotiators, we find that men have a disadvantage in a setting with explicit verbal communication relative to a control game without communication. This is driven by men’s failure to optimally tailor their negotiation strategy based on their partner’s gender. In particular, men are significantly less likely to use tough (but effective) negotiation strategies against female compared to male partners. Male-male pairs have the worst overall joint performance, indicating that women create efficiency gains without losing out on individual payoffs. We suggest these findings may be related to gender-specific social norms influencing communication strategies.Finally, research from the last three decades suggests that fairness plays an important role in economic transactions. However, the vast majority of this evidence investigates behavior in a full-information environment. In chapter 3, we develop a new experimental paradigm—which nests the widely used Ultimatum Game—to show that the role of fairness in economic transactions depends fundamentally on the information structure. We find that when transacting agents are less informed inequality increases. In the absence of information, proposers give less-fair offers and report believing that responders will accept them. Responders do, in fact, accept less-fair offers when proposers are uninformed, suggesting that responders are concerned about their social image or proposers’ intentions.","Huang, Zheng Jai Jennie",0,,902

(The term 'mixed initiative dialog' refers to a human-machine dialog where either can initiate a conversation or a change in the conversation topic.) Results: Findings from a pilot evaluation study indicate that the coach-based training is more effective in helping students establish a regular practice than self-administered training using written and audio materials. The coached group also appeared to be in more advanced stages of change in terms of the transtheoretical model, and have a higher sense of self-efficacy regarding establishment of a regular mindfulness practice. Conclusion: These results suggest that virtual coach-based training of mindfulness is both feasible, and potentially more effective, than a self-administered program. Of particular interest is the identification of the specific coach features that contribute to its effectiveness. Practice implications: Virtual coaches could provide easily accessible and cost-effective customized training for a range of health behaviors. The affect-adaptive aspect of these coaches is particularly relevant for helping patients establish long-term behavior changes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2463,The influence of social media interactions on consumer-brand relationships: A three-country study of brand perceptions and marketing behaviors,"Companies are increasingly allocating more of their marketing spending to social media programs. Yet there is little research about how social media use is associated with consumer-brand relationships. We conducted three studies to explore how individual and national differences influence the relationship between social media use and customer brand relationships. The first study surveyed customers in France, the U.K. and U.S. and compared those who engage with their favorite brands via social media with those who do not. The findings indicated that social media use was positively related with brand relationship quality and the effect was more pronounced with high anthropomorphism perceptions (the extent to which consumers' associate human characteristics with brands). Two subsequent experiments further validated these findings and confirmed that cultural differences, specifically uncertainty avoidance, moderated these results. We obtained robust and convergent results from survey and experimental data using both student and adult consumer samples and testing across three product categories (athletic shoes, notebook computers, and automobiles). The results offer cross-national support for the proposition that engaging customers via social media is associated with higher consumer-brand relationships and word of mouth communications when consumers anthropomorphize the brand and they avoid uncertainty.

2467,Playing games: The salience of social cues and group norms in eliciting aggressive behaviour,"The rise in new communication technologies makes anonymous interactions increasingly possible, extending the possibilities for understanding the effects of anonymity on the behaviour of individuals. Theories of deindividuation and dehumanisation propose that anonymity will automatically lead to aggressive and antisocial behaviour, while the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects adds that the social environment can mediate this effect. The first phase of this study was created to test the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects prediction of the role of the social environment. A quasi-experimental design was used within the online computer gaming environment as a testing platform. The results of this phase point to the salience of competitive environments in inducing aggressive behaviour (an effect that may be heightened by large group sizes and human-player opponents). Due to the unusual nature of the results of the first phase, a follow-up study was conducted as a further exploration of the results through open discussions held on various South African gaming-related forums. A number of important themes emerged from these dialogues, specifically that of aggression in others, personal investment, stress relief, and gender. Overall, the results of both phases of this study offer support for the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects model and suggestions of new avenues for future researchers to explore.","Hughes, M.",0,10.1177/0081246313482629,905

Social touch has been studied extensively in psychology and neuroscience. With the development of new technologies, it is now possible to engage in social touch at a distance or engage in social touch with artificial social agents. Social touch research has inspired research into technology mediated social touch, and this line of research has found effects similar to actual social touch. The importance of haptic stimulus qualities, multimodal cues, and contextual factors in technology mediated social touch is discussed. This survey is concluded by reflecting on the current state of research into social touch technology, and providing suggestions for future research and applications.","Huisman, G.",0,10.1109/toh.2017.2650221,906
2471,"Three-dimensional kinematic corridors of the head, spine, and pelvis for small female driver seat occupants in near- and far-side oblique frontal impacts","Objectives: Analyses of recent automotive accident data indicate an increased risk of injury for small female occupants compared to males in similar accidents. Females have been shown to be more susceptible to spinal injuries than males. To protect this more vulnerable population, advanced anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) and computer human body models are being developed and require biofidelity curves for validation. The aim of this study is to generate female-specific 3D kinematic corridors in near-and far-side oblique frontal impacts for the head, spine, and pelvis. Methods: Eight specimens were procured and prescreened for mass, stature, and quantitative computed tomography bone mineral density and preexisting injuries to minimize biologic variability. Sets of 4 noncolinear retroreflective targets were placed on the back of the head; dorsal spine at T1, T8, and L2; and posterior sacrum. Instrumented computed tomography scans were obtained to measure the orientation and position of the markers relative to anatomic fiducials. The specimens were placed on a buck representative of a generic automotive driver's seat environment designed to minimize lower-extremity and pelvic motion. The buck was oriented such that the buck centerline was seated 30 degrees from the impact vector in either a near-or far-side oblique frontal configuration. Preposition of the occupant was specified to the 50th percentile male H-point location, thigh and tibial angles, and torso angle. Impact was delivered via a servo-acceleration sled to the base of the buck with a 30 km/h 9 g trapezoidal pulse. Occupants were restrained by a standard 3-point belt that had a custom load-limiter device set to 2 kN at the D-ring side of the shoulder belt. Target motion was recorded at 1 kHz using a 3D optical motion capture system. Anatomic motion of the head, spine, and pelvis was calculated relative to the seat, and the average response was determined from 4 near-side and 4 far-side tests. The borders of the corridor were determined by calculating a standard deviational ellipse in the x, y, and z planes at each time step. Results: Plots of the biofidelity corridors for near-and far-side tests are shown in planes parallel to the seat from the lateral, rear, and overhead directions. Averaged peak excursions in the fore/aft and lateral directions are compared for the near-and far-side corridors. Near-side female and male tests are similarly compared. Conclusions: In general, average peak excursions were greater in the far-side configuration than in the near-side configuration. Peak excursion results compared well with similar tests conducted on male postmortem human subjects (PMHS). The kinematic corridors developed in the current study serve as a set of biofidelity corridors for the development of current and future physical and computational surrogates.","Humm, J.

2475,,"Every student deserves to be educated by teachers who are culturally proficient to ensure their needs are being met within inclusive school systems. This calls for educator preparation programs to ensure teacher candidates are culturally proficient. However, this is a pedagogical shift in isolated, rural settings due to the challenges rural communities pose for cultural proficiency (Sileo, Sileo, & Pierce, 2008). Modeling co-teaching and critical discourse in educator preparation allows teacher candidates to explore historical and systemic inequities of marginalized populations. Understanding these inequities can allow teacher candidates to recognize how diversity may impact the lives of various individuals and learn to honor the cultural uniqueness of others. The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of teacher candidates within a course modeling co-teaching and critical discourse in educator preparation to capture the essence of their experiences. The conceptual framework created to guide this study centralizes co-teaching in educator preparation to model and promote critical discourse embedding critical theory and disability inquiry. This study used a phenomenology approach to obtain the essence of teacher candidates’ experiences. Participants of the study were pursuing a degree in education from a rural state college. Of the participants, 92% were female and 98% were white. To ensure the essence of teacher candidates’ experience prevailed, the researcher used a peer debriefing process and member checking to ensure validity. Three themes emerged from the survey responses and four participant interviews. Each theme had three sub-themes that emerged as well. The first theme was a prosocial environment, with sub-themes of connectivity, multiple perspectives, and critical discourse. The second theme was vulnerability, with sub-themes of professors as change agents, self-awareness, and critical consciousness. The last theme was empowerment, with sub-themes of advocacy, pedagogical awareness, and understanding and honoring culture. Interconnections of the themes were analyzed and presented to combine the conceptual framework of the study with the findings.","Hurner, Casey",0,,908
2477,,"In this thesis we discuss the role played by computational methods in drug discovery and present studies chiefly using molecular simulation methodologies to characterise the binding of compounds that may serve as leads for antitumour agents against two separate proteins. We report flexible docking and QSAR studies on aplyronine A, and its analogues, a potent inhibitor of the actin protein system. Our findings delineate the mechanism by which the compounds bind to an actin monomer and highlight key features of the compounds that are fundamental for actin- depolymerisation, which instigates the necessary cytotoxic response. We show that the docking energy scores for the compounds are highly correlated with experimental depolymerisation data. The results are relevant for the design of a putative set of analogues and the development of efficacious actin-targeting cancer drugs. In a second study, we focus on the ETS domain of the Elk-l transcription factor, which is key to the protein's stability and a potential target for therapeutic compounds. The work presented identifies peptide binders of the ETS domain that may be used to inform the design of peptidomimetic compounds. Using MD simulations we show the domain undergoes conformational reorganisation at the α Iβ 1 loop. By taking frames from the MD trajectory of the loop region, we conducted virtual screening experiments for libraries of all possible di- and tri-peptides against each frame. The di- peptides showed no particular preference towards the binding site. However, several tri-peptides made specific interactions with key residues involved in Elk-l dimerisation. Further, we performed peptide-bound dynamics and relative binding free energy simulations to assess the stability of each complex, and to rank more accurately the best binding peptides identified from the docking calculations. We proposed a series of peptide binders for synthesis and experimental binding studies. The thesis ends with a brief discussion on some of the limitations to, and recent advancements in the field of computational modelling, particularly in the realm of atomistic simulations for computer-aided drug discovery.","Hussain, Abrar",0,,909

2481,,"Comments on the original article by Howard Rachlin (see record 2012-28920-001) regarding his teleological perspective with regards to artificial beings. These comments address Rachlin’s points from the other perspective to which he has contributed enormously, the quantitative analysis of behavior. Rachlin projects a future Watson II that is sophisticated and humanlike. However, behavior analysts have a vital interest in extending their analysis further, because it suggests that the inexorable evolutionary process that plays out both in the real world and in accelerated virtual reality is destined to produce robots that will displace humans at the top of the pyramid, just as all previous species have been displaced. Arguments against robots taking over, and the flaws in the arguments, include the following: Computers cannot replicate some mechanisms that humans have, and human brains with billions of neurons and trillions of connections have more power than can be produced by a computer. Humans cannot design a robot that is more intelligent than themselves. Humans should also be protected by Asimov’s (1942) rules for robots; robots must not harm humans and must obey human orders. Robots should be programmed with primary values to promote human well-being, which is a more behavioral strategy consistent with Rachlin’s analysis. Finally, many assume that humans could ultimately just pull the plug if robots threaten human superiority, or more proactively, prohibit research and development of robots that would be capable of doing so. Rachlin has demonstrated how the existence of intelligent robots might stimulate thoughtful humans to adopt more effective understanding of our own nature. Behavior analysts also have much to gain from participating in the development of computer and robotic models of operant behavior: We can express and test our formulations more effectively, we can prove the sufficiency of our formulations to others, and we can play important roles in the development of valuable applied technology. The technology seems destined to threaten human well-being in the future, but that prospect should encourage more rather than less participation by behavior analysts.

2483,CABots and Other Neural Agents,"The best way to develop a Turing test passing Al is to follow the human model: an embodied agent that functions over a wide range of domains, is a human cognitive model, follows human neural functioning and learns. These properties will endow the agent with the deep semantics required to pass the test. An embodied agent functioning over a wide range of domains is needed to be exposed to and learn the semantics of those domains. Following human cognitive and neural functioning simplifies the search for sufficiently sophisticated mechanisms by reusing mechanisms that are already known to be sufficient. This is a difficult task, but initial steps have been taken, including the development of CABots, neural agents embodied in virtual environments. Several different CABots run in response to natural language commands, performing a cognitive mapping task. These initial agents are quite some distance from passing the test, and to develop an agent that passes will require broad collaboration. Several next steps are proposed, and these could be integrated using, for instance, the Platforms from the Human Brain Project as a foundation for this collaboration.","Huyck, C.",0,10.3389/fnbot.2018.00079,912
2485,The effects of overall robot shape on the emotions invoked in users and the perceived personalities of robot,"The affective interaction between human and robots could be influenced by various aspects of robots, which are appearance, countenance, gesture, voice, etc. Among these, the overall shape of robot could play a key role in invoking desired emotions to the users and bestowing preferred personalities to robots. In this regard, the present study experimentally investigates the effects of overall robot shape on the emotions invoiced in users and the perceived personalities of robot with an objective of deriving guidelines for the affective design of service robots. In so doing, 27 different shapes of robot were selected, modeled and fabricated, which were combinations of three different shapes of head, trunk and limb (legs and arms) rectangular-parallelepiped, cylindrical and human-like shapes. For the experiment, visual images and real prototypes of these robot shapes were presented to participants, and emotions invoked and personalities perceived from the presented robots were measured. The results showed that the overall shape of robot arouses any of three emotions named 'concerned', 'enjoyable' and 'favorable', among which 'concerned' emotion is negatively correlated with the 'big five personality factors' while 'enjoyable' and 'favorable' emotions are positively correlated. It was found that the 'big five personality factors', and 'enjoyable' and 'favorable' emotions are more strongly perceived through the real prototypes than through the visual images. It was also found that the robot shape consisting of cylindrical head, human-like trunk and cylindrical head is the best for 'conscientious' personality and 'favorable' emotion, the robot shape consisting of cylindrical head, human-like trunk and human-like limb for 'extroverted' personality, the robot shape consisting of cylindrical head, cylindrical trunk and cylindrical limb for 'anti-neurotic' personality, and the robot shape consisting of rectangular-parallelepiped head, human-like trunk and human-like limb for 'enjoyable' emotion.

2488,Emotional clouds: Showing arousal and valence through the movement and darkness of digital cartoonish clouds,"While nowadays the most usual way to show emotions in digital contexts is via virtual characters, its use may raise false expectations (the user attributes human abilities to the virtual character). This paper proposes and explores an approach to express emotions which intends to minimize the user's expectations by using a non-anthropomorphic model. Emotions are represented in terms of arousal and valence dimensions. They are visualized in a simple way through the behaviour and appearance of a series of cartoonish clouds. In particular, the arousal value is expressed through the movement of these clouds (controlled by a flocking algorithm), while the valence value is expressed through their degree of darkness. Furthermore, the paper describes a user experiment which investigated whether the arousal and valence expressed by our model are appropriately interpreted by the users or not. The results suggest that movement and darkness are interpreted as arousal and valence respectively and that they are independent of each other. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2489,Managing Queueing Systems Where Capacity is Random and Customers are Impatient,"One prevalent assumption in queueing theory is that the number of servers in a queueing model is deterministic. However, randomness in the number of available servers often arises in practice, e.g., in virtual call centers where agents are allowed to set their own schedules. In this paper, we study the problems of staffing and controlling queueing systems with an uncertain number of servers and impatient customers. Because randomness in the number of servers creates congestion in the system, the customer abandonment distribution plays an important role. We characterize how it affects both the optimal staffing policy and the cost incurred by the manager. Because of strong dependence on the abandonment distribution, it is natural to investigate ways of controlling customer abandonment behavior so as to mitigate that cost. Here, we propose doing so by making delay announcements in the system. We characterize how the manager may use three controls in her toolbox, staffing, compensation, and the announcements, to effectively control her system. We show that despite jointly optimizing the usage of those three controls, it may be cost effective for the manager to understaff, overstaff, or match supply and demand in any given shift.","Ibrahim, R.",0,10.1111/poms.12796,915
2490,Virtual worlds vs books and videos in history education,"In this paper, we investigate an application of virtual reality and artificial intelligence (AI) as a technological combination that has a potential to improve the learning experience and engage with the modern generation of students. To address this need, we have created a virtual reality replica of one of humanity's first cities, the city of Uruk and populated this city with AI-controlled 3D avatars, which re-enact everyday life of ancient Sumerians in the period around 3000 B.C. Our hypothesis is that by immersing students into this environment and allowing them to learn by browsing through it and interacting with its virtual citizens can be more engaging and motivating than simply reading the corresponding history text or watching an educational video. To confirm this assumption, we have designed a study with three groups of students. One group was given a historical text about Uruk and everyday life of its citizens (created by our subject matter experts), the second group was shown a documentary video on Uruk and the third group was immersed into virtual Uruk and engaged into interactions with its virtual inhabitants. The outcomes of the study suggest that not only did people in the third group provide much more positive qualitative feedback about the learning experience, but they also showed a better comprehension of the study material by performing (on average) 20% better than the first two groups on the mini-exam that was conducted as a part of this study.","Ijaz, K.",0,10.1080/10494820.2016.1225099,916
2493,Subthalamic nucleus detects unnatural android movement,"An android, i.e., a realistic humanoid robot with human-like capabilities, may induce an uncanny feeling in human observers. The uncanny feeling about an android has two main causes: its appearance and movement. The uncanny feeling about an android increases when its appearance is almost human-like but its movement is not fully natural or comparable to human movement. Even if an android has human-like flexible joints, its slightly jerky movements cause a human observer to detect subtle unnaturalness in them. However, the neural mechanism underlying the detection of unnatural movements remains unclear. We conducted an fMRI experiment to compare the observation of an android and the observation of a human on which the android is modelled, and we found differences in the activation pattern of the brain regions that are responsible for the production of smooth and natural movement. More specifically, we found that the visual observation of the android, compared with that of the human model, caused greater activation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). When the android's slightly jerky movements are visually observed, the STN detects their subtle unnaturalness. This finding suggests that the detection of unnatural movements is attributed to an error signal resulting from a mismatch between a visual input and an internal model for smooth movement.","Ikeda, T.",0,10.1038/s41598-017-17849-2,917

2502,Subjective responses to synthesised speech with lexical emotional content: the effect of the naturalness of the synthetic voice,"This study aimed to investigate how the degree of naturalness and lexical emotional content of synthesised speech affects the subjective ratings of emotional experiences and how the naturalness of the voice affects the ratings of voice quality. Twenty-four participants listened to a set of affective words produced by three different speech synthesis techniques: formant synthesis, diphone synthesis and unit selection synthesis. The participants' task was to rate their experiences evoked by the speech samples using three emotion-related bipolar scales for valence, arousal and approachability. The pleasantness, naturalness and clarity of the voices were also rated. The results showed that the affective words produced by the synthesisers evoked congruent emotion-related ratings in the participants. The ratings of the experienced valence and approachability were statistically significantly stronger when the affective words were produced by the more humanlike voices as compared to the more machinelike voice. The more humanlike voices were also rated as statistically significantly more natural, pleasant and clear than the less humanlike voice. Thus, our findings suggest that even machinelike voices can be used to communicate affective messages but that increasing the level of naturalness enhances positive feelings about synthetic voices and strengthens emotional communication between computers and humans.","Ilves, M.",1,10.1080/0144929x.2012.702285,919
2504,,"Math problem solving has been regarded as one of the major weaknesses in U.S. students' math performance for many years (Orabuchi, 1992). One of the main reasons that students do not perform well in math problem solving may be due to math anxiety. There has been increasing interest in math education areas on how to reduce math anxiety to enhance students' math performance. However, there were few empirical studies which examined the effects of various interventions towards decreasing math anxiety. Given the lack of empirical studies on how to reduce students' math anxiety and to increase math learning, this study examined the effects of emotional support and cognitive motivational messages on math anxiety, self-efficacy, and math problem solving. This study built upon the work done by Shen (2009) by modifying elements of his design and stimulus materials and by introducing a new independent variable: incremental ability beliefs. Thus, two independent variables—one for decreasing affective math anxiety (emotional support) and another for alleviating cognitive math anxiety (cognitive motivational messages) were used in this study. The pedagogical agents were used as a delivering method of a computer based module in this study, but not an independent variable of this study. Emotional support messages were designed to alleviate students' affective dimension of math anxiety. Emotional support messages were developed based on Shen's (2009) study, which was based on the multidimensional coping inventory (COPE) (Carver et al., 1989). In this study, emotional support messages included four scales related to emotion-focus coping, which are: positive reinterpretation and growth (RG), focus on and venting of emotions (VE), use of instrumental social support (IS), and use of emotional support (ES) from COPE (Carver et al., 1989). Emotional support messages were delivered by an instructor agent and peer agent to the emotional support group. Cognitive motivational messages were designed to reduce students' cognitive dimension of math anxiety which related to worry of performing well in mathematics. In this study, cognitive motivational messages specifically contained ability belief change messages to alleviate the cognitive dimension of math anxiety. Implicit theory separated students' ability beliefs into two categories: entity belief and incremental belief (Dweck, 1999). Incremental ability belief messages were provided to the cognitive motivational messages treatment group primarily by a scientist agent in a computer-based module with video clips and short messages which emphasize the students' abilities were not fixed and could be improved through effort. The initial idea for cognitive motivational messages came from an article ""You can grow your intelligence: New research shows the brain can be developed like a muscle"" which was used in previous experimental study (Blackwell et al., 2007). Thus, cognitive motivational messages were developed by the researcher based on Blackwell et al (2007)'s study and then were reviewed by an expert in motivational design. Eighty-eight GED students enrolled in GED math classes at a community college in Florida were distributed to four groups (emotional support only, cognitive motivational messages only, emotional support and cognitive motivational messages, and a control group) and asked to individually study a computer-based module about vocabulary, concepts, and formulas related to the Pythagorean Theorem for 45 to 60 minutes. Two different math anxiety questionnaires [Mathematics Anxiety Questionnaire (MAQ) (Wigfield & Meece, 1988) and Mathematics Anxiety Scale (MAS) (Fennema & Sherman, 1976)] were used in a pre-test and post-test. Self-efficacy questionnaires were modified to be aligned with the context of this study focusing on math problem solving using Kim's (2004) questionnaire.

2505,Affordance-based altruistic robotic architecture for human-robot collaboration,"This article proposes a computational model for altruistic behavior, shows its implementation on a physical robot, and presents the results of human-robot interaction experiments conducted with the implemented system. Inspired from the sensorimotor mechanisms of the primate brain, object affordances are utilized for both intention estimation and action execution, in particular, to generate altruistic behavior. At the core of the model is the notion that sensorimotor systems developed for movement generation can be used to process the visual stimuli generated by actions of the others, infer the goals behind, and take the necessary actions to help achieving these goals, potentially leading to the emergence of altruistic behavior. Therefore, we argue that altruistic behavior is not necessarily a consequence of deliberate cognitive processing but may emerge through basic sensorimotor processes such as error minimization, that is, minimizing the difference between the observed and expected outcomes. In the model, affordances also play a key role by constraining the possible set of actions that an observed actor might be engaged in, enabling a fast and accurate intention inference. The model components are implemented on an upper-body humanoid robot. A set of experiments are conducted validating the workings of the components of the model, such as affordance extraction and task execution. Significantly, to assess how human partners interact with our altruistic model deployed robot, extensive experiments with naive subjects are conducted. Our results indicate that the proposed computational model can explain emergent altruistic behavior in reference to its biological counterpart and moreover engage human partners to exploit this behavior when implemented on an anthropomorphic robot.","Imre, M.",0,10.1177/1059712318824697,921

The guards interacted more or less politely with younger and older male and female people. Our results show strong effects of the guard's politeness. The age and sex of the people interacting with the guard had no significant effect on participants' impressions of its attributes. There were no differences between responses to robot and human guards.

2512,,"Many experiments have been performed that use evolutionary algorithms for learning the topology and connection weights of a neural network that controls a robot or virtual agent. These experiments are not only performed to better understand basic biological principles, but also with the hope that with further progress of the methods, they will become competitive for automatically creating robot behaviors of interest. However, current methods are limited with respect to the (Kolmogorov) complexity of evolved behavior. Using the evolution of robot trajectories as an example, we show that by adding four features, namely (1) freezing of previously evolved structure, (2) temporal scaffolding, (3) a homogeneous transfer function for output nodes, and (4) mutations that create new pathways to outputs, to standard methods for the evolution of neural networks, we can achieve an approximately linear growth of the complexity of behavior over thousands of generations. Overall, evolved complexity is up to two orders of magnitude over that achieved by standard methods in the experiments reported here, with the major limiting factor for further growth being the available run time. Thus, the set of methods proposed here promises to be a useful addition to various current neuroevolution methods.

2514,The social perceptual salience effect,"Affective processes appraise the salience of external stimuli preparing the agent for action. So far, the relationship between stimuli, affect, and action has been mainly studied in highly controlled laboratory conditions. In order to find the generalization of this relationship to social interaction, we assess the influence of the salience of social stimuli on human interaction. We constructed reality ball game in a mixed reality space where pairs of people collaborated in order to compete with an opposing team. We coupled the players with team members with varying social salience by using both physical and virtual representations of remote players (i.e., avatars). We observe that, irrespective of the team composition, winners and losers display significantly different inter- and intrateam spatial behaviors. We show that subjects regulate their interpersonal distance to both virtual and physical team members in similar ways, but in proportion to the vividness of the stimulus. As an independent validation of this social salience effect, we show that this behavioral effect is also displayed in physiological correlates of arousal. In addition, we found a strong correlation between performance, physiology, and the subjective reports of the subjects. Our results show that proxemics is consistent with affective responses, confirming the existence of a social salience effect.

2549,"An Empathy-Driven, Conversational Artificial Intelligence Agent (Wysa) for Digital Mental Well-Being: Real-World Data Evaluation Mixed-Methods Study","Background: A World Health Organization 2017 report stated that major depression affects almost 5% of the human population. Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.","Inkster, B.",0,10.2196/12106,926

To support this framework, this discussion introduces the research methodology, practitioner inquiry, as a meaningful approach to studying pedagogical practice and identity in the LIS classroom as a means to LIS educators becoming more self-reflective and aware of the impacts of their own identity construction in their teaching. In this article I am affirming the case for a diversity stance within the North American LIS curriculum. I am also posing additional questions and challenges about LIS identity construction and professional practice as we teach and learn in the classroom.","Irvin, Vanessa",0,,927
2553,Mindreading deception in dialog,"This paper considers the problem of detecting deceptive agents in a conversational context. We argue that distinguishing between types of deception is required to generate successful action. This consideration motivates a novel taxonomy of deceptive and ignorant mental states, emphasizing the importance of an ulterior motive when classifying deceptive agents. After illustrating this taxonomy with a sequence of examples, we introduce a Framework for Identifying Deceptive Entities (FIDE) and demonstrate that FIDE has the representational power to distinguish between the members of our taxonomy. We conclude with some conjectures about how FIDE could be used for inference. Published by Elsevier B.V.","Isaac, A. M. C.",0,10.1016/j.cogsys.2013.07.001,928
2555,,"Numerous attempts have been made to use Second Life (SL) as a platform for language teaching. As a result, the possibility of SL as a means to promote conversational interactions has been reported. However, research has thus far largely focused on simply using SL without further augmentations for communication between learners or between teachers and learners in a school-like environment. Conversely, not enough attention has been paid to its controllability, which builds on the embedded functions in SL. This study, based on the result of the authors' previous research, involves the implementation of a virtual communication task space called an automatized interactive task space (AITS) where robotic agents work as interlocutors of learners. On this platform, a series of experiments were conducted to examine whether AITS is effective in promoting language learning and communicative interactions. The number of occurrences of negotiations of meaning and the discourse analysis of the speech logs were used as measures to evaluate the results. This paper presents the improved implementation method to construct AITS, and the result of the evaluation experiments conducted on the constructed AITS.","Ishizuka, Hiroki",1,,929
2557,Perceiving social interactions in the posterior superior temporal sulcus,"Primates are highly attuned not just to social characteristics of individual agents, but also to social interactions between multiple agents. Here we report a neural correlate of the representation of social interactions in the human brain. Specifically, we observe a strong univariate response in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) to stimuli depicting social interactions between two agents, compared with (i) pairs of agents not interacting with each other, (ii) physical interactions between inanimate objects, and (iii) individual animate agents pursuing goals and interacting with inanimate objects. We further show that this region contains information about the nature of the social interaction-specifically, whether one agent is helping or hindering the other. This sensitivity to social interactions is strongest in a specific subregion of the pSTS but extends to a lesser extent into nearby regions previously implicated in theory of mind and dynamic face perception. This sensitivity to the presence and nature of social interactions is not easily explainable in terms of low-level visual features, attention, or the animacy, actions, or goals of individual agents. This region may underlie our ability to understand the structure of our social world and navigate within it.","Isik, L.",0,10.1073/pnas.1714471114,930
2561,Emerging personal intelligence in collective goals: data analysis on the bottom-up approach from PKM to OKM,"Purpose - A pattern of personal intelligence is seen emerging from the concept of agent-mediated personal knowledge management (PKM) in achieving collective organisational goals. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of surveys undertaken to prove this emergence. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative analysis supported by a qualitative analysis was conducted across three main industries in Malaysia, namely manufacturing, service and education. The triangulation of analysis is based on the four proposed hypotheses. Findings - From these analyses, it was discovered that the emergence of personal intelligence is embedded within the collaborative interactions amongst software agents, and between agents and human knowledge workers. All the hypotheses are supported by the results of the surveys which manifest organisational knowledge management (OKM) practices as a consequence of the agent-mediated PKM processes. Research limitations/implications - This research focused on the PKM in Malaysia, where the level of KM implementation varies among the organisations. The results may not reflect other developing countries due to the socio-cultural differences amongst the knowledge workers. Practical implications - The results from this paper can be used either to relook and reanalyse the existing organisational KM system or to plan and design a KM system for organisations that have not implemented any. Originality/value - The focus on personal intelligence and agent-mediated PKM contribute to further development of agent-based system that animates these theories in the real working environment.","Ismail, S.",0,10.1108/jkm-08-2013-0313,931
2564,Towards Engagement Models that Consider Individual Factors in HRI: On the Relation of Extroversion and Negative Attitude Towards Robots to Gaze and Speech During a Human-Robot Assembly Task,"Estimating the engagement is critical for human-robot interaction. Engagement measures typically rely on the dynamics of the social signals exchanged by the partners, especially speech and gaze. However, the dynamics of these signals are likely to be influenced by individual and social factors, such as personality traits, as it is well documented that they critically influence how two humans interact with each other. Here, we assess the influence of two factors, namely extroversion and negative attitude toward robots, on speech and gaze during a cooperative task, where a human must physically manipulate a robot to assemble an object. We evaluate if the score of extroversion and negative attitude towards robots co-variate with the duration and frequency of gaze and speech cues. The experiments were carried out with the humanoid robot iCub and N = 56 adult participants. We found that the more people are extrovert, the more and longer they tend to talk with the robot; and the more people have a negative attitude towards robots, the less they will look at the robot face and the more they will look at the robot hands where the assembly and the contacts occur. Our results confirm and provide evidence that the engagement models classically used in human-robot interaction should take into account attitudes and personality traits.","Ivaldi, S.",0,10.1007/s12369-016-0357-8,932
2570,Young Russian adults' attitudes towards the potential use of robots in hotels,"Robots are increasingly discussed in academic literature as well as the popular media since they are becoming more usual in industry. The increased use of robots will meet with practical issues with regards to adoption in industry as well as resistance from customers and those working in the industry. This work explores data from a 2016-2017 survey of Russian consumers to determine how young Russian adults perceive the use of robots in hotels, showing which service-oriented tasks that Russian consumers find to be the most agreeable to be done by robots and which ones they are more likely to want humans to continue doing. The findings reveal that those who are most supportive of having robots in hotels tend to be Muscovites, males, and those already supportive of the use of service industries in general. In addition, there are noteworthy differences in how males and females perceive of the acceptability of different types of tasks that robots may do in hotels.","Ivanov, S.",0,10.1016/j.techsoc.2018.06.004,933
2573,,"The development of physical education and school sport (PESS), a once ‘marginalised’ subject within the school curriculum, over the period 2003-2010 has often been referred to as the ‘quiet revolution’. An increased political interest in PESS and the idea that sport could be used to address wider social issues resulted in two major strategies, Physical Education, School Sport and Club Links (PESSCL 2003-2008) and Physical Education and Sport Strategy for Young People (PESSYP 2008-2013) and £2.4billion of funding. Drawing on Bernstein’s concept of the pedagogical device, this thesis seeks to understand how these two strategies were transmitted, transformed and realized in the secondary field and examines the extent to which they impacted on the pedagogic practice of PESS. This research study, conducted from within a School Sport Partnership, draws on a range of ethnographic methods including in-depth interviews with Partnership Development Managers, School Sport Coordinators, Primary Link Teachers and physical education teachers across a sub-regional area of London. This data was supplemented with extensive field diaries, partnership documentation and emails. Analysis of the data was conducted using grounded theory in NVivo9. The research findings are presented in three data chapters. The first examines the positioning of the PDM in the space at the interface between the recontextualising and secondary fields. The second results chapter investigates the realization of the PESS strategies and specifically examines the process of transmission and transformation of discourse as it passes through the complex infrastructure of School Sport Partnerships. The final data chapter discusses the impact of the PESS strategies on the pedagogic practices of teachers, and focuses extensively on the target driven culture which dominated practice within the secondary field. The lack of impact on pedagogic practice, particularly within secondary physical education, emerges as a key issue. The dominance of policy targets as the core evaluative rules of the PESS strategies emerged as a limiting factor in the realization of change. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the key findings and the implications for agents and/or agencies tasked with implementing and enacting change in the school setting. In applying the pedagogic device, we are able to analyse the role that the evaluative rules have in prioritising aspects of policy implementation and investigate the challenge of innovation and change. However I argue that Bernstein’s theory is not sufficiently sensitive to a number of the complexities of the contemporary educational landscape and needs further development and adaptation if we are to continue to use the pedagogic device to examine the process of recontextualisation and realization of policy in PESS.","Ives, Helen Maria",0,,934
2574,,"With the recent rise in cloud computing, applications are routinely accessing and interacting with data on remote resources. Interaction with such remote resources for the operation of media-rich applications in mobile environments is also on the rise. As a result, the performance of the underlying network infrastructure can have a significant impact on the quality of service experienced by the user. Despite receiving significant attention from both academia and industry, computer networks still face a number of challenges. Users oftentimes report and complain about poor experiences with their devices and applications, which can oftentimes be attributed to network performance when downloading or uploading application data. This dissertation investigates problems that arise with data movement across computer networks and proposes novel solutions to address these issues through software defined networking (SDN). SDN is lauded to be the paradigm of choice for next generation networks. While academia explores use cases in various contexts, industry has focused on data center and wide area networks. There is a significant range of complex and application-specific network services that can potentially benefit from SDN, but introduction and adoption of such solutions remains slow in production networks. One impeding factor is the lack of a simple yet expressive enough framework applicable to all SDN services across production network domains. Without a uniform framework, SDN developers create disjoint solutions, resulting in untenable management and maintenance overhead. The SDN-based solutions developed in this dissertation make use of a common agent-based approach. The architecture facilitates application-oriented SDN design with an abstraction composed of software agents on top of the underlying network. There are three key components modern and future networks require to deliver exceptional data transfer performance to the end user: (1) user and application mobility, (2) high throughput data transfer, and (3) efficient and scalable content distribution. Meeting these key components will not only ensure the network can provide robust and reliable end-to-end connectivity, but also that network resources will be used efficiently. First, mobility support is critical for user applications to maintain connectivity to remote, cloud-based resources. Today's network users are frequently accessing such resources while on the go, transitioning from network to network with the expectation that their applications will continue to operate seamlessly. As users perform handovers between heterogeneous networks or between networks across administrative domains, the application becomes responsible for maintaining or establishing new connections to remote resources. Although application developers often account for such handovers, the result is oftentimes visible to the user through diminished quality of service. Many intra-domain handover solutions exist for handovers in WiFi and cellular networks, such as mobile IP, but they are architecturally complex and have not been integrated to form a scalable, inter-domain solution. Second, high throughput data transfer is essential for user applications to acquire large remote data sets. As data sizes become increasingly large, often combined with their locations being far from the applications, the well known impact of lower Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) throughput over large delay-bandwidth product paths becomes more significant to these applications. While myriads of solutions exist to alleviate the problem, they require specialized software and/or network stacks at both the application host and the remote data server, making it hard to scale up to a large range of applications and execution environments. This results in high throughput data transfer that is available to only a select subset of network users who have access to such specialized software. An SDN based solution called Steroid OpenFlow Service (SOS) has been proposed as a network service that transparently incr","Izard, Ryan",0,,935
2575,Supporting and constraining factors in the development of university teaching experienced by teachers,"Higher education calls for reform, but deeper knowledge about the prerequisites for teaching development and pedagogical change is missing. In this study, 51 university teachers' experiences of supportive or constraining factors in teaching development were investigated in the context of Finland's multidisciplinary network. The findings reveal that the supportive factors in teaching development arise from the nature of the development itself, i.e. from the teachers' opportunities to act as active agents in an authentic development process. Furthermore, the circumstances of the development also play essential roles (both constraining and supportive) in teaching development. Such support, at its best, will come when teachers and others view teaching development in the university context as being valuable and rewarding, and when teachers are encouraged by management and are supplemented with the necessary equipment, tools, and networks they need to do their job. Increasing interaction between the institutional levels can make educational development successful.","Jaaskela, P.",0,10.1080/13562517.2016.1273206,936
2578,Seeing human: Distinct and overlapping neural signatures associated with two forms of dehumanization,"The process of dehumanization, or thinking of others as less than human, is a phenomenon with significant societal implications. According to Haslam's (2006) model, two concepts of humanness derive from comparing humans with either animals or machines: individuals may be dehumanized by likening them to either animals or machines, or humanized by emphasizing differences from animals or machines. Recent work in cognitive neuroscience emphasizes understanding cognitive processes in terms of interactions between distributed cortical networks. It has been found that reasoning about internal mental states is associated with activation of the default mode network (DMN) and deactivation of the task positive network (TPN); whereas reasoning about mechanical processes produces the opposite pattern. We conducted two neuroimaging studies. The first examined the neural bases of dehumanization and its relation to these two brain networks, using images and voice-over social narratives which either implicitly contrasted or implicitly likened humans to either animals or machines. The second study addressed a discrepancy between findings from the first study and prior work on the neural correlates of dehumanization: using a design similar to prior work we examined neural responses to pictures of humans, animals and machines, presented without any social context. In both studies, human and humanizing conditions were associated with relatively high activity in the DMN and relatively low activity in the TPN. However, the non-human and dehumanizing conditions deviated in different ways: they demonstrated more marked changes either in the DMN or in the TPN. Notably, differences between the animal dehumanizing and humanizing conditions were most evident in regions associated with mechanistic reasoning, not in the mentalizing network. Conjunction analysis of contrasts from both paradigms revealed that only one region was consistently more active when participants saw human, a medial parietal region regarded as the central hub of the DMN. These findings provide a neural basis for Haslam's distinction between two types of dehumanization, and suggest that the DMN and TPN play opposing roles in creating a sense of moral concern.

2581,Reducing Preconception Risks Among African American Women with Conversational Agent Technology,"Background: Systems and tools are needed to identify and mitigate preconception health (PCH) risks, particularly for African American (AA) women, given persistent health disparities. We developed and tested ""Gabby,"" an online preconception conversational agent system. Methods: One hundred nongravid AA women 18-34 years of age were screened for over 100 PCH risks and randomized to the Gabby or control group. The Gabby group interacted with the system for up to six months; the control group received a letter indicating their health risks with a recommendation to talk with their clinician. The numbers, proportions, and types of risks were compared between groups. Results: There were 23.7 (SD 5.9) risks identified per participant. Eighty-five percent (77 of 91) provided 6 month follow up data. The Gabby group had greater reductions in the number (8.3 vs. 5.5 risks, P < .05) and the proportion (27.8% vs 20.5%, P < 0.01) of risks compared to controls. The Gabby group averaged 63.7 minutes of interaction time. Seventy-eight percent reported that it ""was easy to talk to Gabby"" and 64% used information from Gabby to improve their health. Conclusion: Gabby was significantly associated with preconception risk reduction. More research is needed to determine if Gabby can benefit higher risk populations and if risk reduction is clinically significant.","Jack, B.",0,10.3122/jabfm.2015.04.140327,938

2599,Cooperation in Online Conversations: The Response Times as a Window Into the Cognition of Language Processing,"Measuring the cognitive cost of interpreting the meaning of sentences in a conversation is a complex task, but it is also at the core of Sperber and Wilson's Relevance Theory. In cognitive sciences, the delay between a stimulus and its response is often used as an approximation of the cognitive cost. We have noticed that such a tool had not yet been used to measure the cognitive cost of interpreting the meaning of sentences in a free-flowing and interactive conversation. The following experiment tests the ability to discriminate between sentences with a high cognitive cost and sentences with a low cognitive cost using the response time of the participants during an online conversation in a protocol inspired by the Turing Test. We have used violations of Grice's Cooperative Principle to create conditions in which sentences with a high cognitive cost would be produced. We hypothesized that response times are directly correlated to the cognitive cost required to generate implicatures from a statement. Our results are coherent with the literature in the field and shed some new light on the effect of violations on the humanness of a conversational agent. We show that violations of the maxim of Relation had a particularly important impact on response times and the perceived humanness of a conversation partner. Violations of the first maxim of Quantity and the fourth maxim of Manner had a lesser impact, and only on male participants.","Jacquet, B.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00727,941
2602,"The ""Invisible Hand"" of Economic Markets Can Be Visualized through the Synergy Created by Division of Labor","Inspired by Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek, economists promoting free markets postulate the existence of invisible forces that drive economic growth. Simulations with Sociodynamica allowed the emergence of market forces in virtual economies, showing that the synergistic working of division of labor in complex settings favors a stable state where all actors benefit (win-win interaction). By visualizing the detailed dynamics underlying this phenomenon in a simple virtual economy, the elements underpinning the synergistic effect on economic output produced by the division of labor between agents could be dissected. These are heterogeneity or spatial or temporal heterogeneous environment and/or agents; complementary activities of agents, with divergent optimization options; and synchrony. Markets help synchronize agent's actions. The larger the contact horizon between participants of the market is, the more efficient the market forces act. These features allow for social processes that increase the information available and increase simultaneously the capacity of producing useful economic work, that is, synergy. This insight, although trivial if viewed a posteriori, improves our understanding of the source and nature of synergies in real economic markets and might render economic and natural sciences more consilient.","Jaffe, K.",0,10.1155/2017/4753863,942
2603,How Realistic Should Avatars Be? An Initial fMRI Investigation of Activation of the Face Perception Network by Real and Animated Faces,"Increased interaction with characters in games and online necessitates a better understanding of how different characteristics of these agents impact media users. This paper investigates a possible neurological underpinning for a common research finding namely, that animated characters designed to be comparatively more human, more real, and more similar to the people they represent elicit more positive self-reported evaluations. The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which these results might be due to differential processing of character features in brain networks recruited for face recognition. There is some evidence that parts of the face network may be specifically tuned for real human faces. An experiment was conducted where participants viewed photographs of faces of actual agents (humans and animals) or colored drawings of matched agents (cartoon humans and animals). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activation in the whole brain and specifically in the face network, we investigated the variation in patterns of activation with human and animal faces that were more or less real. The results were consistent with previous reports that the core regions of the face network are sensitive to the humanness of faces. However, our results extended previous work by showing that regions of the core and extended regions of the face network and some regions outside the network were sensitive to realism, but only realism of human faces.","James, T.

2609,Enhancing interactive tutorial effectiveness through visual cueing,"The present study investigated whether learning how to use a web service with an interactive tutorial can be enhanced by cueing. We expected the attentional guidance provided by visual cues to facilitate the selection of information in static screen displays that corresponded to spoken explanations. Unlike most previous studies in this area, we chose to implement a self-paced learning environment in this experiment. This would allow learners in the no-cueing condition to try and compensate for their visual search difficulties by reviewing the visual information during pauses between slides. They would not, however, be able to process auditory and visual information jointly in working memory (temporal contiguity effect), as learners would be able to do in the cueing condition. Results showed that, as predicted, the presence of cues (arrows pointing to each aurally evoked item in turn) (1) led to a reduction in the amount of time spent reviewing the visual information during pauses, (2) better learning of the verbal information (but without any effect on a subsequent procedural task, contrary to our hypothesis), and (3) greater perceived ease of learning. These results suggest that cueing can direct attention to the right area of the screen at the right time, thereby improving learning, even in self-regulated learning environments.","Jamet, E.",0,10.1007/s11423-016-9437-6,944

The dispute can be counted among those outstanding issues that need a prompt peaceful resolution. However, this would-be resolution process puts obligation upon the competing parties—India and Pakistan – along with regional and international powers. The conflict is discussed at length and also most of the workable solutions/ proposal/ formulas have been proposed at different platforms from time to time. In the given research the conflict is being analyzed from historical and structural perspectives in the first part that locates the gaps in the assessment of the dispute. Prolonged history of animosity, ethnic, and religious factors have rendered complications to the evaluation of the intensity level. Kashmiris are very much politically mobilized the ever in their past and more concerned about their wellbeing dignified life their generations. The extremism is being instilled from outside in the valley, that has involved the terrorist factor in the issue. Peace regime can only be established by adopting a more rational behavior. Many solutions for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute have been proposed since 1947, but to no avail. Conversely there were episodes when the region was facing the virtual danger of nuclear exchange. The Relative capability of the states (status quo power vis a vis challenger power) determines the probability of conflict and the prospective peace in the region. Power Transition literature stipulates conflict with the parity of the relative powers between status quo and challenger state given the latter is also dissatisfied with the norm of the system. Pakistan’s relative power vis a vis India is evaluated and what should be the most rational attitude of Pakistan towards India is empirically evaluated. The policy direction and implications of the given evaluation, however, can best be determined using the Agent Based Model. The prospective conflict resolution among the stakeholders involved will be anticipated using an Agent Based Model along four scenarios ranging from the future status of the Kashmir Valley, future status of Jammu & Kashmir, trade over the Line of Control and, the future of the Kashmir Valley after exclusion of Pakistan. An agent based model is a forecasting model based on game theoretic logic.

2612,,"Seamstress is a 42-minute multimedia and interdisciplinary documentary song-cycle, in six movements, for solo soprano, chamber ensemble, chorus, electronics, recorded audio and video. It is based on oral history interviews I conducted with Palestinian women from different generations and social sectors in occupied Palestine (The West Bank and Gaza) from the summer of 2012 through the winter of 2017. Blending audio interviews, photography, raw and archival footage with live chamber orchestra and dance performances, Seamstress aims to create a moving and powerful portrait of love, strength, and resistance in the face of colonization, injustice and misinformation. The women interviewed include my aunt, who lives in Ramallah, a seamstress named Shahrat who fled from Jaffa to Nablus pre-Nakba, former students from the Deir Ghassaneh music center, and current artistic collaborators and colleagues, including Palestinian multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Huda Asfour. Song texts are adapted from the interviews, weaving together their different voices, perspectives and experiences in a way that challenges current existing media stereotypes of Palestinian culture and womanhood, providing a global and de-colonial context for Palestinian women’s narratives by focusing on shared universal themes of memory, identity, exile, displacement, femininity and love. The oral histories draw unifying connections between Palestinian women’s individual and collective memories in response to an undermining postcolonial geographical separation across the West Bank, Israel, Gaza and the Diaspora. My research questions were rooted in the shaping and defining of the individual and collective voice through documentary-style narratives, which is where the music comes into play in providing a sonic exploration of the voice and memory. Who belongs to the voice and whom does the voice belong to? How much of our stories are shaped by what others have told us, and how much are shaped by our lived experiences? At what point do the stories, the voices of our ancestors, become our own, and at what point do the stories, the voices of our colleagues and contemporaries, become woven into the shared fabric of our histories? How does performance help shape our understanding of marginalized communities and function in reclaiming a space for their voices, and how does it reshape our understanding of the theories and histories we have encountered about ethnic conflicts and their subjects? How does performance as resistance in marginalized communities extend beyond the boundaries of politics and nation-states? I feature Palestinian women as vital cultural and social agents of change whose stories empower and awaken a movement of progress on the regional, local and global levels. The film provides visual landscapes and timelines for the audience through use of archival footage from the Lumiere Brothers dating back to 1896, scenes from the Nablus soap factory in 1938, and British mandate clips of settlers in the orange groves of Jaffa in 1946. It features collaborative work with cinematographers and choreographers Yusuf Karajah, Maher Shawmreh and Meropi Makhlouf of the Orient and Dance Theater in Ramallah. The files and oral histories are accessible and easily shared online via the Seamstress Project (seamstressproject.com), as social media plays a pivotal role in shaping global understanding of people and their cultures. The result is a sonic and visual exploration of personal experiences with place in relation to diasporic and transnational intersectional feminist perspectives on the self/denial of the self, the state, personal identity, the body, sociality and agency.","Jarrar, Donia",0,,946

Efforts have been made to develop small molecules that will inhibit the transporters and elucidate specific binding site interactions. This work provides knowledge of molecular interactions associated with MAT inhibitors by offering an atomistic perspective that can guide designs of new pharmacotherapeutics with enhanced activity. The work described herein evaluates intermolecular interactions using computational methods to reveal the mechanistic detail of inhibitors binding in the DAT. Because cocaine recognizes the extracellular-facing or outward-facing (OF) DAT conformation and benztropine recognizes the intracellular-facing or inward-facing (IF) conformation, it was postulated that behaviorally “typical” (abusable, locomotor psychostimulant) inhibitors stabilize the OF DAT and “atypical” (little or no abuse potential) inhibitors favor IF DAT. Indeed, behaviorally-atypical cocaine analogs have now been shown to prefer the OF DAT conformation. Specifically, the binding interactions of two cocaine analogs, LX10 and LX11, were studied in the OF DAT using molecular dynamics simulations. LX11 was able to interact with residues of transmembrane helix 8 and bind in a fashion that allowed for hydration of the primary binding site (S1) from the intracellular space, thus impacting the intracellular interaction network capable of regulating conformational transitions in DAT. Additionally, a novel serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitor previously discovered through virtual screening at the SERT secondary binding site (S2) was studied. Intermolecular interactions between SM11 and SERT have been assessed using binding free energy calculations to predict the ligand-binding site and optimize ligand-binding interactions. Results indicate the addition of atoms to the 4-chlorobenzyl moiety were most energetically favorable. The simulations carried out in DAT and SERT were supported by experimental results. Furthermore, the co-crystal structures of DAT and SERT share similar ligand-binding interactions with the homology models used in this study.","Jean, Bernandie",0,,947
2614,A computational model for the emergence of turn-taking behaviors in user-agent interactions,"We propose a computational model that endows conversational agents with the capability to coordinate their speaking turns (turn-taking management) in the context of mixed-initiative two-party dialogs. In human conversations, participants are continuously adjusting their verbal and non-verbal productions for ensuring the effective coordination of speaking turns. In our model, the decision making is a continuous process based on the intrinsic current goal of the agent with respect to turn-taking, namely its motivation to keep-or to leave-its current role (speaker or listener), and on its perception of the intentions of its partner. Concurrently, the agent is also producing signals indicating its willingness to maintain or leave its current role. Our model is based on two models from cognitive psychology: the drift-diffusion model and the theory of behavioral dynamics. After presenting simulations showing how our model makes the coordination emerge from the interactions, we propose a SAIBA-Compliant architecture, named BeAware, created to support the implementation of our model. Finally, using our model, we investigate how an agent's turn-taking strategy may impact the user's experience and the effectiveness of the coordination.","Jegou, M.",0,10.1007/s12193-018-0265-3,948
2616,"The Enactive Approach to Architectural Experience: A Neurophysiological Perspective on Embodiment, Motivation, and Affordances","Over the last few years, the efforts to reveal through neuroscientific lens the relations between the mind, body, and built environment have set a promising direction of using neuroscience for architecture. However, little has been achieved thus far in developing a systematic account that could be employed for interpreting current results and providing a consistent framework for subsequent scientific experimentation. In this context, the enactive perspective is proposed as a guide to studying architectural experience for two key reasons. Firstly, the enactive approach is specifically selected for its capacity to account for the profound connectedness of the organism and the world in an active and dynamic relationship, which is primarily shaped by the features of the body. Thus, particular emphasis is placed on the issues of embodiment and motivational factors as underlying constituents of the body architecture interactions. Moreover, enactive understanding of the relational coupling between body schema and affordances of architectural spaces singles out the two-way bodily communication between architecture and its inhabitants, which can be also explored in immersive virtual reality settings. Secondly, enactivism has a strong foothold in phenomenological thinking that corresponds to the existing phenomenological discourse in architectural theory and qualitative design approaches. In this way, the enactive approach acknowledges the available common ground between neuroscience and architecture and thus allows a more accurate definition of investigative goals. Accordingly, the outlined model of architectural subject in enactive terms that is, a model of a human being as embodied, enactive, and situated agent, is proposed as a basis of neuroscientific and phenomenological interpretation of architectural experience.","Jelic, A.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00481,949
2621,No substitute for human touch? Towards a critically posthumanist approach to dementia care,"This paper develops a sociological critique of the pre-eminence of humanism in dementia care policy and practice. Throughout the centuries, humanism has served as something of a double-edged sword in relation to the care and treatment of people living with progressive neurocognitive conditions. On the one hand, humanism has provided an intellectual vehicle for recognising people with dementia as sentient beings with inalienable human rights. On the other hand, humanist approaches have relied upon and re-enforced normative understandings of what it means to be human; understandings that serve to position people with dementia as deficient. Two posthumanist approaches to dementia care policy and practice are explored in this paper: transhumanism and critical posthumanism. The former seeks, primarily, to use advances in 21st-century technologies to eradicate dementia. The latter seeks to de-centre anthropomorphic interpretations of what it means to be a person (with dementia), so as to create space for more diverse human-non-human relationships to emerge. The paper concludes with some tentative suggestions as to what a critically posthumanist approach to dementia care policy and practice might look like, as we move closer towards the middle of the 21st century.","Jenkins, N.",0,10.1017/s0144686x16000453,950
2622,Reducing domestic heating demand: Managing the impact of behavior-changing feedback devices via marketing,"Feedback devices can be used to inform households about their energy-consumption behavior. This may persuade them to practice energy conservation. The use of feedback devices can also-via word of mouth spread among households and thereby support the spread of the incentivized behavior, e.g. energy-efficient heating behavior. This study investigates how to manage the impact of these environmental innovations via marketing. Marketing activities can support the diffusion of devices. This study aims to identify the most effective strategies of marketing feedback devices. We did this by adapting an agent-based model to simulate the roll-out of a novel feedback technology and heating behavior within households in a virtual city. The most promising marketing strategies were simulated and their impacts were analyzed. We found it particularly effective to lend out feedback devices to consumers, followed by leveraging the social influence of well-connected individuals, and giving away the first few feedback devices for free. Making households aware of the possibility of purchasing feedback devices was found to be least effective. However, making households aware proved to be most cost-efficient. This study shows that actively managing the roll-out of feedback devices can increase their impacts on energy conservation both effectively and cost-efficiently. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2624,,"Modern human-engineered systems like self-driving cars, smart buildings, power grids etc., are becoming increasingly complex so that they present unparalleled challenges for their design, verification and control. Furthermore, these systems generate data at an unprecedented rate. Even though the data is supposed to be of great help in understanding these systems, it has already presented unique challenges for storage, leave alone their analysis and interpretation (for example, Google is supposed to analyze around 20 Petabytes of data everyday and it is expected that the data generated by systems industry will very soon surpass that). Machine learning provides very powerful statistical techniques for analysis and interpretation of large amounts of data and recently has seen great improvements pushed by large-scale applications in software industries. While there has been huge advancements in the individual fields of machine learning and control theory, unfortunately the modern decision systems for complex systems do not take into account the recent advances of machine intelligence for intelligent control. The role of machine learning in systems engineering is still unexplored; however, it holds tremendous potential for achieving human-like (or better) performance in modern autonomous systems, which is the ultimate goal of Artificial Intelligence. Establishing a synergistic relationship between state-of-the-art control and machine learning techniques holds the key to the synthesis of complex systems with high degrees of autonomy. This thesis explores various concepts and makes contributions to multiple areas for understanding of complex data-driven systems for their decision and control. Among several challenges of complex data-driven systems, one of the central challenge is understanding and representation of data using tools from mathematics and statistics. In this regard, this thesis presents several results for modeling of sequential data using Markov models and Deep Learning. The proposed ideas are tested on various electro-mechanical systems like combustion in lean pre-mixed systems, fatigue in polycrystalline alloys, event detection in sensor networks and lead-acid battery systems. This thesis brings together a completely interdisciplinary approach using techniques from mathematical analysis, theoretical computer science, machine learning, game theory and control theory to present a framework to solve various challenges posed by modern autonomous systems with fundamental contributions to robotic motion planning and temporal data analysis. In order to bring together control theory and machine learning for a class of modern autonomous systems (e.g., automatic driving in urban scenarios with traffic rules), the thesis presents research for the conditions under which we can bring together these fields in an optimal fashion while keeping desired properties like safety, stability, etc. This thesis makes fundamental contributions to analysis and representation of time-series data using symbolic dynamics and information theory. In particular, algorithms for order estimation and compact representation of Markov models of time-series data are proposed which have computational advantages. Furthermore for analysis of high-dimensional temporal data, an algorithm using Deep learning and Gaussian processes is proposed. The thesis also makes fundamental contributions to motion planning of robotic systems where a class of sampling-based feedback motion planning algorithms are proposed. The algorithm is extended for motion planning of multiple robots using game theory. Furthermore, data-driven algorithms are proposed to bring together learning and planning in complex robotic systems.","Jha, Devesh Kumar",0,,952
2625,Evolution of knowledge sharing behavior in social commerce: An agent-based computational approach,"The rapid development of e-commerce has expedited knowledge growth in the e-commerce social community. Knowledge sharing among online users has exhibited a nonlinear dynamic evolution. This paper examines the evolutionary process of knowledge sharing among users of the social commerce; builds an evolutionary game model to depict knowledge sharing phenomenon in the virtual community; and develops a mixed learning algorithm based on individual user's historical game strategy, neighborhood user's strategy, and information noise. We design a computational model based on multi-agent theory and social network, and implement computational experimental system using NetLogo 5.0. We find that the proposed computational-experimental model can help decision makers simulate evolutionary process under various scenarios. The evolutionary game rule and social network structure significantly influence the degree of cooperation and knowledge sharing among users. The greater noise the network information has the less stable the users' behavior will be. One can thus identify an optimal initial cooperation rate to facilitate the system to reach equilibrium state quickly. Our study on the dynamic evolution of knowledge sharing behavior in the social commerce contributes to the theoretical development of literature and provides valuable decision-making support to managers.

I have been heavily involved in the design, implementation, and construction of two large-screen, room-like stereoscopic virtual environment (VE) simulators. Using this system, I developed a three-part research plan with a series of studies to examine how people engage in full-body joint-action with a partner under three scenarios: 1. two people who are physically present in a co-occupied virtual environment; 2. one person who shares a virtual environment with a computer-generated agent (CG agent); 3. two people who share the same virtual environment remotely in physically separate places where each person is motion tracked and presented in the environment as a graphic avatar. The behaviors of participants were recorded and processed through a customized pipeline that captures important performance metrics, such as how participants pick crossable gaps and time their movements.

2630,,"Robots and puppets are linked by a common human impulse: the desire to give life to nonliving objects through the animation of material forms. Like puppets, robots are technological objects capable of revealing aspects of the human experience and have demonstrated the ability to provoke the suspension of disbelief and evoke agency. While the role of puppets and automata in theatre history is well established (Segel 1995, Jurkowski 1996, Reilly 2011), the study of robots in theatre performance is largely unexamined. Citing the presence of autonomous and semi-autonomous machines in live performance and technological developments that result in increasingly responsive and interactive robots, I argue that these technological players warrant critical investigation and study of their methods of representation. Given their ontological link, I use puppetry to construct a phenomenological understanding of robots by considering the following questions: ""Does robotic performance constitute a creative act?"" and ""Can engineers use puppetry to develop robots that better exhibit behaviors are identified with creative performance?"" Using States' concept of ""binocular vision"" and Dennett's concept of ""intentional systems,"" I propose that robots evoke agency by demonstrating expressive and responsive behaviors. Contrary to the imitative approach which uses realism and life-like features as a starting point, I suggest that engineers adopt the method of puppetry which utilizes movement as the primary means of expression. This approach results in machines that produce motions that appear less rigid and mechanical and are more likely to avoid the Uncanny Valley (Mori 1970). Citing recent theatrical productions (How to Train Your Dragon, King Kong), and my contributions to a robotic marionette system ( Pygmalion Project), I outline how entertainment robotics can use puppetry-inspired choices to create intuitive interfaces for designing and operating robots. I advocate for an approach that acknowledges binocular vision and minimizes the role of mechanical reproduction in favor of essential and abstracted movements. For tele-operated machines, I propose a gesture-based control system that more tightly couples the interaction of the operator's motions with those of the puppet. I anticipate that these methods will lead to robots that are more dynamic and more likely to evoke agency.","Jochum, Elizabeth Ann",0,,955
2631,Virtual learning environments as sociomaterial agents in the network of teaching practice,"This article presents findings related to the sociomaterial agency of educators and their practice in Norwegian education. Using actor-network theory, we ask how Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) negotiate the agency of educators and how they shape their teaching practice. Since the same kinds of VLE tools have been widely implemented throughout Norwegian education, it is interesting to study how practices are formed in different parts of the educational system. This research is therefore designed as a case study of two different teaching contexts representing lecturers from a higher education institution and teachers from primary schools. Data are collected by means of interviews, online logging of VLE activities and self-reported personal logs. From the analysis of the data, three main networks of aligned interests can be identified. In each of those, the sociomaterial agency of the teaching practice with VLE is crucial in shaping and consolidating the network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is little research on the agent characteristics preferred by K-12 students. The main purpose of this study was to examine student preferences for individual pedagogical agents and their preferences for various agent characteristics. Student preferences for the following agent characteristics were assessed using survey methodology: agent gender, age, realism, clothing, personality, speech pace, and tutoring approach. A total of N = 565 students from elementary through high school watched a computer-based multimedia overview of engineering. Four engineering disciplines were introduced by four animated agents: a young female, young male, old female, and old male agent. Immediately after viewing the computer-based overview, students completed surveys assessing preferences for the four agents and for individual agent characteristics. Results indicated that all students preferred agents and specific external agent characteristics that are close to their own external characteristics and favored internal agent characteristics that they felt would promote understanding of the domain. These findings suggest that animated agents used in computer-based K-12 engineering outreach should be close to the student's external characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2641,Pedagogical Agent Signaling of Multiple Visual Engineering Representations: The Case of the Young Female Agent,"Background Prior studies have shown that visual signaling improves learning from text or narration in conjunction with one depictive visual representation; however, engineering instruction typically employs multiple descriptive and depictive visual representations. Animated pedagogical agents (APAs) positively influence student attitudes about engineering. Whether APA signaling improves engineering learning and which APA characteristics are most conducive to learning is largely unknown. Purpose We examined the effects of visual signaling in engineering learning materials with multiple descriptive and depictive visual representations. We compared visual signaling by a young female APA with arrow signaling. Design/Method In the APA signaling condition, at appropriate points within a narration about electric circuits, the relevant areas in a circuit diagram, a sequence of equation calculations, and a Cartesian graph were signaled using APA gestures. In the arrow signaling condition, the same relevant areas were signaled using a dynamic arrow; the nosignaling (control) condition had no visual signaling. Student learning and perceptions were measured with a problem-solving posttest and a survey. Results Results indicated an aptitude-treatment interaction. Low prior knowledge learners had higher learning gains in the APA signaling condition, compared with the no signaling condition; high prior knowledge learners did not benefit from visual signaling. Conclusions Precollege students with low prior knowledge benefit from the signaling by a young female APA in instruction with multiple visual representations; high prior knowledge learners do not benefit from such support.","Johnson, A.

2645,Supporting multimedia learning with visual signalling and animated pedagogical agent: moderating effects of prior knowledge,"An experiment examined the effects of visual signalling to relevant information in multiple external representations and the visual presence of an animated pedagogical agent (APA). Students learned electric circuit analysis using a computer-based learning environment that included Cartesian graphs, equations and electric circuit diagrams. The experiment was a 2 (visual signalling, no visual signalling)x2 (visual APA presence, no visual APA presence) between-subjects design, resulting in four experimental conditions: visual signalling with APA presence (APA+S), visual signalling without APA presence (S), no visual signalling with APA presence (APA) and no visual signalling without APA presence (C). Signalling was provided via gestures of the APA in the APA+S condition and via dynamic arrows in the S condition. To investigate potential moderating effects of prior knowledge on APA presence and visual signalling factors, middle school students were grouped into low prior knowledge (LPK) and high prior knowledge (HPK) groups using scores on a domain pre-test. Results revealed that LPK students had higher post-test scores after learning with visual signalling, resulting in equivalent post-test performance to their HPK counterparts. LPK students also had higher post-test scores, higher ratings of graphics understanding and lower perceived difficulty ratings in conditions that included the visual image of the APA. Conversely, HPK students had better post-test scores after learning without the APA. These results indicate that the effectiveness of visual signalling techniques and the visual presence of an APA is dependent on learner characteristics, including prior domain knowledge.","Johnson, A.

2648,Representation sequencing in computer-based engineering education,"Multimedia engineering instruction typically includes verbal descriptions and diagrams, which can be presented in a contextualized format, using descriptions and illustrations of real-life elements (e.g., light bulb and battery), or in an abstract format, using conventional electrical engineering symbols. How the sequencing of these representation formats influences learning of conceptual knowledge has been examined in prior research. The present study examines how the representation sequencing impacts procedural learning of engineering problem solving. The study compared four sequences of representation (abstract -> abstract, contextualized -> contextualized, contextualized -> abstract, or abstract -> contextualized) during computer-based learning to determine which of the four sequences best promotes student learning. Learning outcomes were measured with a problem-solving posttest and learner perceptions were assessed using a learner questionnaire. The study results indicated that the abstract -> contextualized condition resulted in significantly higher near- and far-transfer posttest scores than the contextualized -> contextualized condition and in significantly higher near-transfer posttest scores than the contextualized -> abstract condition. Computer-based instruction in engineering problem solving for novice learners should initially employ abstract representations that convey the conceptually-relevant solution procedures shared across similar problems. Providing a variety of problem contexts in later stages of learning can assist learners in transfer of key procedural problem solving principles to novel problem settings with different superficial features.

GUIs provide interactive capabilities and contextual information for 3D content such as structure-from-motion (SFM) models, and can represent the difference between ""raw data"" and thoughtful, skilled scholarly publications. This project explores the implications of a GUI created with the game engine Unity 3D (Unity) for a series of SFM models recorded at a structure known as the Area B House at the ancient central Italian city of Gabii. Unity's capabilities as a game engine allow for an embodied, reflexive, and design-centered approach to archaeological content. This presents some challenges to a strict interpretation of the New Materialism, and its call for ""unmediated"" interaction with archaeological things. On the contrary, design oriented thinking encourages us to balance human factors (i.e., the user experience) with the representations of things that constitute our content. The Area B House interface thus embraces a ""symmetrical"" view of materiality, wherein humans and things are equally important agents in entangled, recursive relationships. This is particularly true as entanglement, a key concept in symmetrical archaeology, manifests in the ""emergent systems"" of gameplay that arise out of embodied experiences with archaeological sites. This thesis will situate the theoretical implications of our interface within some longstanding debates about archaeological objectivity, representation, and communication.","Johnson, Tyler",0,,962

2662,An Agent-Based Intervention to Assist Drivers Under Stereotype Threat: Effects of In-Vehicle Agents' Attributional Error Feedback,"For members of a group negatively stereotyped in a domain, making mistakes can aggravate the influence of stereotype threat because negative stereotypes often blame target individuals and attribute the outcome to their lack of ability. Virtual agents offering real-time error feedback may influence performance under stereotype threat by shaping the performers' attributional perception of errors they commit. We explored this possibility with female drivers, considering the prevalence of the women-are-bad-drivers stereotype. Specifically, we investigated how in-vehicle voice agents offering error feedback based on responsibility attribution (internal vs. external) and outcome attribution (ability vs. effort) influence female drivers' performance under stereotype threat. In addressing this question, we conducted an experiment in a virtual driving simulation environment that provided moment-to-moment error feedback messages. Participants performed a challenging driving task and made mistakes preprogrammed to occur. Results showed that the agent's error feedback with outcome attribution moderated the stereotype threat effect on driving performance. Participants under stereotype threat had a smaller number of collisions when the errors were attributed to effort than to ability. In addition, outcome attribution feedback moderated the effect of responsibility attribution on driving performance. Implications of these findings are discussed.","Joo, Y.

2664,"On the Coevolution of Stereotype, Culture, and Social Relationships: An Agent-Based Model","The theory of constructuralism describes how shared knowledge, representative of cultural forms, develops between individuals through social interaction. Constructuralism argues that through interaction and individual learning, the social network (who interacts with whom) and the knowledge network (who knows what) coevolve. In the present work, we extend the theory of constructuralism and implement this extension in an agent-based model (ABM). Our work focuses on the theory's inability to describe how people form and utilize stereotypes of higher order social structures, in particular observable social groups and society as a whole. In our ABM, we formalize this theoretical extension by creating agents that construct, adapt, and utilize social stereotypes of individuals, social groups, and society. We then use this model to carry out a virtual experiment that explores how ethnocentric stereotypes and the underlying distribution of culture in an artificial society interact to produce varying levels of social relationships across social groups. In general, we find that neither stereotypes nor the form of underlying cultural structures alone are sufficient to explain the extent of social relationships across social groups. Rather, we provide evidence that shared culture, social relations, and group stereotypes all intermingle to produce macrosocial structure.","Joseph, K.",0,10.1177/0894439313511388,970
2668,Time to manage: patient strategies for coping with an absence of care coordination and continuity,"This paper examines how people with chronic illnesses respond to absences of continuity and coordination of care. Little work has been done on how the ill person might mitigate flaws in a less than optimal system. Our qualitative research, carried out among 91 participants in Australia, reveals that people with chronic illnesses create strategies to facilitate the management of their care. These strategies included efforts to improve communication between themselves and their health care practitioners; keeping personal up-to-date medication lists; and generating their own specific management plans. While we do not submit that it is patients' responsibility to attend to gaps in the health system, our data suggests that chronically ill people can, in and through such strategies, exert a measure of agency over their own care; making it effectively more continuous and coordinated. Participants crafted strategies according to the particular social and bodily rhythms that their ongoing illnesses had lent to their lives. Our analysis advances the view that the ill body itself is capable of enfolding the health system into the rhythms of illness - rather than the ill body always fitting into the overarching structural tempo. This entails an agent-centric view of time in illness experience. A Virtual Abstract of this paper can be found at: https://youtu.be/UwbxlEJOTx8","Jowsey, T.",0,10.1111/1467-9566.12404,971

For instance, virtual faces allow real-time Human Computer retroactions between physiological measures and the virtual agent. Objectives:The goal of this study was to initially assess concomitants and construct validity of a newly developed set of virtual faces expressing six fundamental emotions (happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust). Recognition rates, facial electromyography (zygomatic major and corrugator supercilii muscles), and regional gaze fixation latencies (eyes and mouth regions) were compared in 41 adult volunteers (20 male, 21 female) during the presentation of video clips depicting real vs. virtual adults expressing emotions. Results: Emotions expressed by each set of stimuli were similarly recognized, both by men and women. Accordingly, both sets of stimuli elicited similar activation of facial muscles and similar ocular fixation times in eye regions from man and woman participants. Conclusion: Further validation studies can be performed with these virtual faces among clinical populations known to present social cognition difficulties. Brain Computer Interface studies with feedback-feedforward interactions based on facial emotion expressions can also be conducted with these stimuli.","Joyal, C. C.",0,10.3389/fnhum.2014.00787,972
2679,,"Autonomous virtual characters are important in a growing number of applications ranging from simulation-based training to computer games. In this dissertation I propose a new data-based mobile manipulation framework for achieving real-time autonomous characters able to perform full-body interactions with the environment. The overall approach relies on few example motions in order to guide the generation of complex movements that replicate human-like characteristics. The proposed framework is based on three major components. The first one consists of a fast locomotion module that generates controllable models from single motion examples, and is capable of independent control of direction, orientation and velocity, with known coverage and quality characteristics. The approach is computationally efficient and achieves high controllability of stepping behaviors, thus addressing key properties for supporting a variety of whole-body manipulation tasks. The second component relies on the proposed locomotion controller applied to multiple locomotion behaviors in order to plan multi-behavior paths around obstacles. A new locomotion planning approach is proposed where the behavioral capabilities of the character are considered during the path planning stage, in order to address trade-offs related to path length and preferred navigation behavior when selecting narrow passages to take. The approach relies on new types of operations with planar navigation meshes, reaching fast execution times suitable for real-time applications. The last component focuses on the coordination between locomotion and upper-body manipulation. The proposed approach is based on learning spatial coordination features from example motions and on associating body-environment proximity information to the body configurations of each example motion. Body configurations then become the input to a regression system which in turn is able to generate new interactions for different situations in similar environments. The regression model is capable of encoding and replicating key spatial strategies with respect to body coordination and management of environment constraints. Obtained results successfully synthesize complex full-body actions such as opening doors and drawing in a wide whiteboard. The models proposed in this dissertation achieve new interactive controllers able to synthesize coordinated full-body motions for a variety of complex interactions requiring body mobility and manipulation.","Juarez Perez, Alain",0,,973
2680,Perception of animacy in dogs and humans,"Humans have a tendency to perceive inanimate objects as animate based on simple motion cues. Although animacy is considered as a complex cognitive property, this recognition seems to be spontaneous. Researchers have found that young human infants discriminate between dependent and independent movement patterns. However, quick visual perception of animate entities may be crucial to non-human species as well. Based on general mammalian homology, dogs may possess similar skills to humans. Here, we investigated whether dogs and humans discriminate similarly between dependent and independent motion patterns performed by geometric shapes. We projected a side-by-side video display of the two patterns and measured looking times towards each side, in two trials. We found that in Trial 1, both dogs and humans were equally interested in the two patterns, but in Trial 2 of both species, looking times towards the dependent pattern decreased, whereas they increased towards the independent pattern. We argue that dogs and humans spontaneously recognized the specific pattern and habituated to it rapidly, but continued to show interest in the 'puzzling' pattern. This suggests that both species tend to recognize inanimate agents as animate relying solely on their motions.","Judit, A.",0,10.1098/rsbl.2017.0156,974
2685,,"Teachers can be influential change agents in transforming their schools if they regularly reflect on their pedagogical practices, looking for improvements that will help all learners reach their full potential. However, in many sub-Saharan African countries, teachers seldom get an opportunity to collaboratively reflect on their practices. Action research, as an in-service professional development strategy, can be an ideal means of empowering teachers to collaboratively reflect on and improve their pedagogy to be more inclusive. Drawing from collaborative action research projects conducted by teachers in two primary schools in Zanzibar, Tanzania, this article explores the role of collaborative action research in developing the capacity of teachers to inform improvements in their pedagogical practices. The findings show how the participating teachers, with scaffolding influence from a critical friend (research facilitator), developed professionally along their zones of proximal development by promoting their pedagogical and research skills to enhance the presence, participation and achievement of all learners in their schools. Based on the findings, the article shows both the advantages and disadvantages of using collaborative action research in teacher professional development in the study context.

2688,Neural Correlates of Variations in Human Trust in Human-like Machines during Non-reciprocal Interactions,"As intelligent machines have become widespread in various applications, it has become increasingly important to operate them efficiently. Monitoring human operators' trust is required for productive interactions between humans and machines. However, neurocognitive understanding of human trust in machines is limited. In this study, we analysed human behaviours and electroencephalograms (EEGs) obtained during non-reciprocal human-machine interactions. Human subjects supervised their partner agents by monitoring and intervening in the agents' actions in this non-reciprocal interaction, which reflected practical uses of autonomous or smart systems. Furthermore, we diversified the agents with external and internal human-like factors to understand the influence of anthropomorphism of machine agents. Agents' internal human-likenesses were manifested in the way they conducted a task and affected subjects' trust levels. From EEG analysis, we could define brain responses correlated with increase and decrease of trust. The effects of trust variations on brain responses were more pronounced with agents who were externally closer to humans and who elicited greater trust from the subjects. This research provides a theoretical basis for modelling human neural activities indicate trust in partner machines and can thereby contribute to the design of machines to promote efficient interactions with humans.","Jung, E.

2691,"Policy for physical education and school sport in England, 2003-2010: vested interests and dominant discourses","Background: The salience of physical education and school sport (PESS) in England changed dramatically in the 2000s in terms of central government investment and political interests. The government put in place the physical education, school sport and club links strategy and the physical education and sport strategy for young people for a wide-ranging array of social objectives. Although policy research relating to PESS has centred on the sport policy-making process and the role of government or agents, including teachers, has been growing from the 2000s, this paper argues for the need to explore the social construction and constitution of school knowledge underpinned and influenced by particular dominant vested interests and their associated discourses to understand certain pedagogical implications for young people.Method: Applying the educational policy sociology approach adapted from Basil Bernstein's work on the social construction of pedagogic discourse, the focus of this paper was to identify the main discourses which constructed and constituted policy for PESS from 2003 to 2010 in England. Qualitative content analysis on six policy documents and 467 media articles was conducted.Findings: This paper identifies five discourses constructing and constituting policy for PESS during the period under study: sport, health, citizenship, lifelong participation and Olympic legacy. These are sources of policy for PESS that were constructed in Bernstein's re-contextualising field. This paper also seeks to show the complexity of policies and strategies for PESS in that they are anchored in a web of significations in terms of complex connections between elements of discourses. It can be argued that as a structure-in-dominance, policies for PESS reinforced competitive sport-based conceptions of physical education and, arguably, created a limited universe of possibilities, of what was thinkable, for and as PESS.Conclusions: This paper argues that the inclusions and exclusions of discourses from policy for PESS are all politically charged, and will have an impact on the quality of young people's education and their life chances in the future. Furthermore, this paper proposes that we need to explore in further depth the processes of how to maximise the possibilities of realising quality PESS in order for young people to learn citizenship, foster health improvement and facilitate lifelong participation in physical activities.","Jung, H.",0,10.1080/17408989.2015.1050661,977
2694,,"The motion of a humanoid robot is one of the most intuitive communication channels for human-robot interaction. Previous studies have presented related knowledge to generate speech-based motions of virtual agents on screens. However, physical humanoid robots share time and space with people, and thus, numerous speechless situations occur where the robot cannot be hidden from users. Therefore, we must understand the appropriate roles of motion design for a humanoid robot in many different situations. We achieved the target knowledge as motion-design guidelines based on the iterative findings of design case studies and a literature review. The guidelines are largely separated into two main roles for speech-based and speechless situations, and the latter can be further subdivided into idling, observing, listening, expecting, and mood-setting, all of which are well-distributed by different levels of intension. A series of experiments proved that our guidelines help create preferable motion designs of a humanoid robot. This study provides researchers with a balanced perspective between speech-based and speechless situations, and thus they can design the motions of a humanoid robot to satisfy users in more acceptable and pleasurable ways.

2697,"Location and Modality Effects in Online Dating: Rich Modality Profile and Location-Based Information Cues Increase Social Presence, While Moderating the Impact of Uncertainty Reduction Strategy","This study investigates how different interface modality features of online dating sites, such as location awareness cues and modality of profiles, affect the sense of social presence of a prospective date. We also examined how various user behaviors aimed at reducing uncertainty about online interactions affect social presence perceptions and are affected by the user interface features. Male users felt a greater sense of social presence when exposed to both location and accessibility cues (geographical proximity) and a richer medium (video profiles). Viewing a richer medium significantly increased the sense of social presence among female participants whereas location-based information sharing features did not directly affect their social presence perception. Augmented social presence, as a mediator, contributed to users' greater intention to meet potential dating partners in a face-to-face setting and to buy paid memberships on online dating sites.","Jung, S.",1,10.1089/cyber.2017.0027,979
2701,Promoting Relational Agent for Health Behavior Change in Low and Middle - Income Countries (LMICs): Issues and Approaches,"The use of contemporary technologies in healthcare systems to improve quality of care and to promote behavioral healthcare outcomes are prevalent in high-income countries. However, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are not receiving the same advantages of technology, which may be due to inadequate technological infrastructure and financial resources, lack of interest among policy makers and healthcare service providers, lack of skills and capacity among healthcare professionals in using technology based interventions, and resistance of the public to the use of technologies for healthcare or health promotion activities. Technology-based interventions offer considerable promise to develop entirely new models of healthcare both within and outside of formal systems of care and offer the opportunity to have a large public health impact. Such technology-based interventions could be used to address targeted global health problems in LMICs, including the chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - a growing health system burden in LMICs. Major preventable behavioral risk factors of chronic NCDs are increasing in LMICs, and innovative interventions are essential to address these risk factors. Computer-based or mobile-based virtual coaches or Relational Agents (RAs) are increasingly being explored for counseling patients to change their health behavior in high-income countries; however, the use of RAs in LMICs has not been studied. In this paper, we summarize the growing application of RA technology in behavior change interventions in high-income countries and describe the potential of its use in LMICs. Finally, we review the potential barriers and challenges in promoting RAs in LMICs.","Kabir, M. F.",0,10.1007/s10916-019-1360-z,980
2704,Optimal Dynamic Mechanism Design and the Virtual-Pivot Mechanism,"We consider the problem of designing optimal mechanisms for settings where agents have dynamic private information. We present the virtual-pivot mechanism, which is optimal in a large class of environments that satisfy a separability condition. The mechanism satisfies a rather strong equilibrium notion (it is periodic ex post incentive compatible and individually rational). We provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for immediate incentive compatibility for mechanisms that satisfy periodic ex post incentive compatibility in future periods. The result also yields a strikingly simple mechanism for selling a sequence of items to a single buyer. We also show that the allocation rule of the virtual-pivot mechanism has a very simple structure (a virtual index) in multiarmed bandit settings. Finally, we show through examples that the relaxation technique we use does not produce optimal dynamic mechanisms in general nonseparable environments.","Kakade, S. M.",0,10.1287/opre.2013.1194,981
2707,,"This thesis presents the research and development of a novel text based goal-orientated conversational agent (CA) for the Urdu language called UMAIR (Urdu Machine for Artificially Intelligent Recourse). A CA is a computer program that emulates a human in order to facilitate a conversation with the user. The aim is investigate the Urdu language and its lexical and grammatical features in order to, design a novel engine to handle the language unique features of Urdu. The weakness in current Conversational Agent (CA) engines is that they are not suited to be implemented in other languages which have grammar rules and structure totally different to English. From a historical perspective CA’s including the design of scripting engines, scripting methodologies, resources and implementation procedures have been implemented for the most part in English and other Western languages (i.e. German and Spanish). The development of an Urdu conversational agent has required the research and development of new CA framework which incorporates methodologies and components in order overcome the language unique features of Urdu such as free word order, inconsistent use of space, diacritical marks and spelling. The new CA framework was utilised to implement UMAIR. UMAIR is a customer service agent for National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) designed to answer user queries related to ID card and Passport applications. UMAIR is able to answer user queries related to the domain through discourse with the user by leading the conversation using questions and offering appropriate advice with the intention of leading the discourse to a pre-determined goal. The research and development of UMAIR led to the creation of several novel CA components, namely a new rule based Urdu CA engine which combines pattern matching and sentence/string similarity techniques along with new algorithms to process user utterances. Furthermore, a CA evaluation framework has been researched and tested which addresses the gap in research to develop the evaluation of natural language systems in general. Empirical end user evaluation has validated the new algorithms and components implemented in UMAIR. The results show that UMAIR is effective as an Urdu CA, with the majority of conversations leading to the goal of the conversation. Moreover the results also revealed that the components of the framework work well to mitigate the challenges of free word order and inconsistent word segmentation.","Kaleem, Mohammed",0,,982
2708,,"This article approaches newcomer migrant girls' experiences with social competition and relational aggression. This the authors do through a detailed analysis of the interactional practices that a group of preschool-aged girls make use of as they socially exclude one of two newcomer migrant girls from participating in a sharing activity involving self-made artefacts. The data is drawn from ethnography combined with video recordings of natural and situated activities of the girls' interactions in a Norwegian day-care institution over the course of nine months. Combining structural and social-constructivist perspectives, the authors discuss how a day-care group is a social field comprising multiple subfields characterized by agents struggling over position and power. Overall, this article addresses another side of the generally accepted positive view of day care for migrant children, revealing how relational aggression might be embedded within seemingly harmless activities and set in everyday child-governed activities.

2711,The carbon rent economics of climate policy,"By reducing the demand for fossil fuels, climate policy can reduce scarcity rents for fossil resource owners. As mitigation policies ultimately aim to limit emissions, a new scarcity for ""space"" in the atmosphere to deposit emissions is created. The associated scarcity rent, or climate rent (that is, for example, directly visible in permit prices under an emission trading scheme) can be higher or lower than the original fossil resource rent. In this paper, we analyze analytically and numerically the impact of mitigation targets, resource availability, backstop costs, discount rates and demand parameters on fossil resource rents and the climate rent. We assess whether and how owners of oil, gas and coal can be compensated by a carbon permit grandfathering rule. One important finding is that reducing (cumulative) fossil resource use could actually increase scarcity rents and benefit fossil resource owners under a permit grandfathering rule. For our standard parameter setting overall scarcity rents under climate policy increase slightly. While low discount rates of resource owners imply higher rent losses due to climate policies, new developments of reserves or energy efficiency improvements could more than double scarcity rents under climate policy. Another important implication is that agents receiving the climate rent (regulating institutions or owners of grandfathered permits) could influence the climate target such that rents are maximized, rather than to limit global warming to a socially desirable level. For our basic parameter setting, rents would be maximized at approximately 650 GtC emissions (50% of business-as-usual emissions) implying a virtual certainty of exceeding a 2 degrees C target and a likelihood of 4 degrees C warming.

2713,Relationship between familiarity and humanness of robots - quantification of psychological impressions toward humanoid robots,"We investigate the relationships between familiarity and humanness of humanoids from psychological perspective of view. Two thousand six hundred and twenty-four people from their 10s to 70s in Japan evaluated familiarity and humanness of different 11 humanoids based on the psychological scales which are developed for evaluation of humanoids. Results showed that robot-like robots which have round shapes are evaluated higher in familiarity and lower in humanness than robot-like robots which have mechanic appearance. Androids which have totally human-like appearances are evaluated higher in humanness and familiarity than robots which are partly human-like, while one android was rated high in humanness but low in familiarity. Relatedly, repulsion which reflects a value toward the existence of humanoids bears a proportionate relationship to humanness. Higher humanness with humanoids related to higher repulsion. In sum, the relationship between familiarity and humanness is curvilinear, while repulsion and humanness shows a linear relationship. We discussed the importance of appearance of robots and interaction with robots to introduce robots toward ordinary people.","Kamide, H.",0,10.1080/01691864.2014.893837,985
2717,Can a microwave heat up coffee? How English- and Japanese-speaking children choose subjects in lexical causative sentences,"Languages differ greatly in how they express causal events. In languages like Japanese, the subjects of causative sentences, or causers, are generally animate and intentional, whereas in other languages like English, causers range widely from animate beings to inanimate objects (e.g. Wolff, Jeon & Li, 2009). This paper explores when children learn to represent cause in their native tongue and how this learning occurs over the course of development. English- and Japanese-speaking preschoolers watched animations that were caused by (i) humans acting intentionally, (ii) humans acting accidentally, (iii) objects that generate energy (e.g. a machine), and (iv) objects that do not generate energy (e.g. a tool). Children were then asked to choose a good description of the event between two options. At age three, English- and Japanese-speaking children performed the task in similar ways, attending only to the intention of causal agents; however, at age four, speakers of the two languages diverged. English speakers were more likely to accept energy-generating objects such as machines as the subject of a lexical causative sentence than Japanese speakers.","Kanero, J.",0,10.1017/s0305000915000331,986
2720,An Expressive Virtual Audience with Flexible Behavioral Styles,"Currently, expressive virtual humans are used in psychological research, training, and psychotherapy. However, the behavior of these virtual humans is usually scripted and therefore cannot be modified freely at runtime. To address this, we created a virtual audience with parameterized behavioral styles. This paper presents a parameterized audience model based on probabilistic models abstracted from the observation of real human audiences dn (n = 16) The audience's behavioral style is controlled by model parameters that define virtual humans' moods, attitudes, and personalities. Employing these parameters as predictors, the audience model significantly predicts audience behavior. To investigate if people can recognize the designed behavioral styles generated by this model, 12 audience styles were evaluated by two groups of participants. One group dn (n = 22) was asked to describe the virtual audience freely, and the other group dn (n = 22) was asked to rate the audiences on eight dimensions. The results indicated that people could recognize different audience attitudes and even perceive the different degrees of certain audience attitudes. In conclusion, the audience model can generate expressive behavior to show different attitudes by modulating model parameters.","Kang, N.",0,10.1109/taffc.2013.2297104,987

To investigate this subject, we designed a 3 x 3 factorial between-subjects experiment involving three conditions of behavioral realism: high realism, low realism, and audio-only (displaying no behavior at all) and three conditions of reciprocal self-disclosure: high disclosure, low disclosure, and no disclosure. We measured users' feelings of social presence (Copresence, Social Attraction, and Emotional Credibility), rapport, perception of the quality of users' own responses (Embarrassment and Self-Performance), emotional state (PANAS), perception of an interaction partner (Person Perception), self-reported self-disclosure, speech fluency (Pause Fillers and Incomplete Words), and Verbal Self-Disclosure. We observed some contradictory outcomes in users' subjective reports. However, the results of objective data analysis demonstrated that users disclosed greater Verbal Self-Disclosure (medium level of intimacy) when interacting with computer interviewers that displayed high behavioral realism and high self-disclosure. Users also delivered more fluent speech when interacting with computer interviewers that displayed high behavioral realism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Kang, S.

2735,,"Intelligent applications such as Apple Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa have gained tremendous popularity in recent years. With human-like understanding capabilities and natural language interface, this class of applications is quickly becoming people’s preferred way of interacting with their mobile, wearable and smart home devices. There have been considerable advancement in machine learning research that aim to further enhance the understanding capability of intelligent applications, however there exist significant roadblocks in applying state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques to a real-world use case. First, as machine learning algorithms becomes more sophisticated, it imposes higher computation requirements for the underlying software and hardware system to process intelligent application request efficiently. Second, state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques is not guaranteed to provide the same level of prediction and classification accuracy when applied to tasks required in real-world intelligent applications, which are often different and more complex than what are studied in a research environment. This dissertation addresses these roadblocks by investigating the key challenges across multiple components in an intelligent application system. Specifically, we identify the key compute and data challenges and presents system design and techniques. To improve the computational performance of the hardware and software system, we challenge the status-quo approach of cloud-only intelligent application processing and propose computation partitioning strategies that effectively leverage both the cycles in the cloud and on the mobile device to achieve low latency, low energy consumption and high datacenter throughput. We characterize and taxonomize state-of-the- art deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) applications to identify the algorithmic design elements and computational patterns that render conventional GPU acceleration techniques ineffective on this class of applications. Leveraging their unique characteristics, we design and implement a novel fine-grain cross-input batching techniques for providing GPU acceleration to a number of state-of-the-art NLP applications. For the data component, large scale and effective training data, in addition to algorithm, is necessary to achieve high prediction accuracy. We investigate the challenge of effective large-scale training data collection via crowdsourcing. We propose novel metrics to evaluate the quality of training data for building real-word intelligent application systems. We leverage this methodology to study the trade-off of multiple crowdsourcing methods and provide recommendations on best training data crowdsourcing practices.","Kang, Yiping",0,,991

This system overcomes the semantic gap through optimized iterative learning and also provides a better exploration of solution space. Support vector machine learning automatically updates the weights of preferences for relevant images based on the both relevant and irrelevant feedback images. The firefly optimizer guides the swarm agents to move towards the cluster of relevant images in the exploration of the search space based on user's feedback.

Over two years, I led an initiative in MIT's Imagination, Computation, and Expression (ICE) Laboratory conducting experiments involving > 10,000 participants to understand the impacts of virtual identities on users in virtual environments. Using a computer science learning platform and game of our own creation as an experimental setting, we have been studying the impacts of avatar use on users' performance and engagement in computer science learning environments. This is a topic of increasing importance in human-computer interaction [69, 130, 132, 310, 452, 549]. While a great deal of work focuses on procedural thinking and problem solving, we argue that attending to learners' identities and their engagement to be equally important. We systematically explored the impacts of different avatar types on users, beginning with distinctions between anthropomorphic vs. non-anthropomorphic avatars, user likeness vs. non-likeness avatars, and other conditions informed by insights from the learning sciences and sociology. Our studies have revealed that avatars can support, or harm, performance and engagement. Several notable trends are: 1) simple abstract avatars (such as geometric shapes) are especially effective when the player is experiencing failure, e.g., while debugging, 2) likeness avatars (avatars in a user's likeness) are not always effective, 3) role model avatars (in particular scientist avatars) are often effective, and 4) successful likeness avatars that are a user's likeness when doing well and otherwise abstract are effective.

2742,Modeling the effect of electric vehicle adoption on pedestrian traffic safety: An agent-based approach,"When operated at low speeds, electric and hybrid vehicles have created pedestrian safety concerns in congested areas of various city centers, because these vehicles have relatively silent engines compared to those of internal combustion engine vehicles, resulting in safety issues for pedestrians and cyclists due to the lack of engine noise to warn them of an oncoming electric or hybrid vehicle. However, the driver behavior characteristics have also been considered in many studies, and the high end-prices of electric vehicles indicate that electric vehicle drivers tend to have a higher prosperity index and are more likely to receive a better education, making them more alert while driving and more likely to obey traffic rules. In this paper, the positive and negative factors associated with electric vehicle adoption and the subsequent effects on pedestrian traffic safety are investigated using an agent-based modeling approach, in which a traffic micro-simulation of a real intersection is simulated in 3D using AnyLogic software. First, the interacting agents and dynamic parameters are defined in the agent-based model. Next, a 3D intersection environment is created to integrate the agent-based model into a visual simulation, where the simulation records the number of near-crashes occurring in certain pedestrian crossings throughout the virtual time duration of a year. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out with 9000 subsequent simulations performed in a supercomputer to account for the variation in dynamic parameters (ambient sound level, vehicle sound level, and ambient illumination). According to the analysis, electric vehicles have a 30% higher pedestrian traffic safety risk than internal combustion engine vehicles under high ambient sound levels. At low ambient sound levels, however, electric vehicles have only a 10% higher safety risk for pedestrians. Low levels of ambient illumination also increase the number of pedestrians involved in near-crashes for both electric vehicles and combustion engine vehicles.","Karaaslan, E.",0,10.1016/j.trc.2018.05.026,996

Therefore, in this study explanations have been stated as how the learning objects defined by means of using the terminology in a developed ontology and kept in objects repository should be presented to learners with the aim of facilitating significant learning through a pedagogical agent developed in the light of cognitive theories, and subsequently the effects of Semantic Web Based Learning (SWBL) on the learning performance and satisfaction of pre-service teachers in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) course are explored. This study employed the quasi-experimental research method, and the participants were 98 pre-service teachers. The experimental group was taught by SWBLE, while the control group was taught by Traditional Teaching (TT). The study results indicated the following: (a) regarding learning achievements, pre-service teachers who learned via the SWBL demonstrated higher learning performance than pre-service teachers who received the TT; (b) on the learning satisfaction survey, pre-service teachers who learned via the SWBL were largely satisfied with the SWBL that was designed purposefully for this study.

2750,,"Flipped Classroom (FC) has become an increasingly popular model in many disciplines in today’s educational system. In order for the FC model to be effective, it is important for the student to have self-regulation skills. It is especially important that students have advanced self-regulatory skills so that the online learning process of the FC model can be successfully completed. It is believed that the metacognitive support (MS) provided by the pedagogical agent during the online process of the FC model will contribute to the development of self-regulation skills of the students. The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of MS via pedagogical agent in the FC model on students’ self-regulation skills. The research was carried out according to experimental design, and the participants of the research consist of 102 university students. The data of the study were collected using self-regulated learning scale. As a result of the research, it was seen that the students of the experimental group who were provided MS with the pedagogic agent were found to have a statistically significant higher level of self-regulation skills than the control group students who were not provided with MS. Several suggestions have been made for the use of pedagogical agent-assisted MS in the design of FC courses.

2753,"Relationships between teachers ' pedagogical beliefs, subject cultures, and mediation practices of students' use of digital technology","Drawing on the data from 26 interviews with different subject teachers in two countries, Estonia and Latvia, this study aimed to reveal how pedagogical beliefs and subject cultures shape the ways primary and secondary school teachers mediate students' use of digital technology. Teachers are acknowledged to be important socializing agents, affecting young people's experiences with digital technology, but it is still unclear how the mediation practices of teachers are related to such intrinsic factors as teachers' beliefs about the nature of learning, nature of technology, self-efficacy beliefs, and subject cultures. Our study indicates that teachers mainly act as guides or coaches to help students make sense of the various opportunities that digital technology provide. Teachers also use a variety of restrictions related to technology use according to their dominant pedagogical beliefs and subject domains. These two roles are not mutually exclusive, combining according to what teachers believe will best support learning. A small group of teachers in our sample also strive to broaden students' understanding and adopt new skills for using technology in innovative ways. Implications for teacher training and peer-to-peer learning are discussed based on our findings.","Karaseva, A.",1,10.5817/cp2015-1-6,999

His objective is to generate theoretical proposals for addressing differently the analysis of hospitals governance in the aims to assess their performance and how to improve that performance. The methodology applied approach uses a case study using mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) for data collection. It uses (1) hospital data to measure the output of hospitals, (2) literature review to identify among others, events and interventions recorded in the history of hospital during the study period and (3) information from individual interviews to validate the interpretation of the results of the previous two sources of data and understand the responsiveness of management team referral hospital during times of change. The study brings four theoretical propositions: (1) Interaction between key agents is a positive force driving adaptation if the actors share a same vision, (2) The strength of the interaction between agents is largely based on the nature of institutional arrangements, which in turn are shaped by the actors themselves, (3) The owner and the management team play a decisive role in the implementation of effective institutional arrangements and establishment of positive interactions between agents, (4) The analysis of recipient population's perception of health services provided allow to better tailor and adapt the health services offer to the population's needs and expectations. Research shows that it isn't enough just to provide support (financial and technical), to manage a hospital for operate and adapt to a changing environment but must still animate, considering that it is a complex adaptive system and that this animation is nothing other than the induction of a positive interaction between agents.","Karemere, H.",0,10.1186/s13031-015-0046-5,1000

However, there is a lack of psychological data on spatial behavior in the larger scale social settings and over extended periods of time. In this paper, we present a social navigation model that aims at generating human-like spatial behavior for a virtual human in a social setting with group dynamics. We employ an engineering approach by defining a dynamic representation of interest and then using it as the psychometric function that regulates the behavior of the agent. We evaluate our model by means of two test cases that address different aspect of the model and serve as a proof of concept. Our work is a step toward models for generating more plausible social spatial behavior for virtual characters that is based on both internal dynamics and attributes of the social environment.

2769,,"The last ten years have seen robots become smaller, lighter and more maneuverable than ever before, paving the way for their use in the service sector, and even in our homes. A key aspect that elevates a network of robots over a bed of sensors is the ability of individual units to autonomously navigate, forming a sensor-actuator network. These added degrees of freedom demand that we revisit existing motion planning and navigation algorithms and extend them to be able to better contribute to the services they are designed to provide. In deploying autonomous robots away from laboratory-controlled settings and in to real-world environments, care must be taken because they share their space with other autonomous agents. For instance, a typical home robot has to account for people as well as their pets. Imparting a fair degree of autonomy to robot navigation tasks thus requires reasoning about the mobility of other entities in the path-planning process. This is not a trivial task because such agents can not often be easily characterized or quantified, e.g. human navigation depends on many factors including the perception of hazards, experience from long-term memory, even whim. In this thesis, we take a deep look at the role of the information available to path-planning algorithms in the context of the mobile target-tracking problem. We start with the problem formulation (Chapter 2), in which robots need to keep track of a single mobile target for as long a duration of time as possible. In the game-theoretic sense, the information available to the target has a different characteristic than the information available to the robots. For example, target behavior varies from adversarial ones in defense applications to cooperative ones in service applications. In the chapters that follow, we present the main contributions of this thesis with this role of information during the path-planning process being the common thread. Traditional surveillance applications assume the worst-case – the target is an adversary actively trying to escape from the robots. We model this strategic interaction with the theory of pursuit-evasion games, wherein a robot pursues a target, which in turn tries to evade it. We study a mathematical variant of the Lion and Man game in the presence of an obstacle, and show that the final outcome of whether the lion can track down the man depends, in closed form, on the initial conditions (Chapter 3). We derive optimal player strategies that work regardless of what the other player does, thus providing the worst-case guarantees that such applications demand. At the opposite end of the spectrum, there exist service applications where the target’s trajectory is known to the robots before they need to move. Our motivating example is mobile telepresence, or virtual presence – an emerging technology that enables people to participate in environments they are not physically present in. Specifically, we present a navigation algorithm for a first-of-its-kind person-following robot with telepresence and monitoring applications (Chapter 4). We require that in the presence of another person, the robot should ensure a safe distance by following that person’s path without losing track. We present a heuristic planning approach that accounts for both non-holonomic constraints and trajectory smoothness. Further, a control-theoretic implementation is provided. Targets that navigate autonomously usually do so with their own intentions. While it is uncertain how they navigate, their behavior may neither be adversarial, nor completely known to the robots in advance. We present a novel data-driven probabilistic mobility model that can be used by path planners to reason about the uncertainties in decisions made by an individual who is navigating in an indoor environment (Chapter 6). We show that it is possible to preserve long temporal histories over an abstracted representation of the environment, which helps predict future mobility of the target better than previous approaches.

2770,,"Coordination plays a key role in efficiently solving multi-agent problems such as exploration of unknown environments, search and rescue, and surveillance. Planning in a highly coordinated fashion causes traditional search algorithms to perform poorly as it creates combinatorial search spaces that renders exploration versus exploitation dilemma challenging as well. Recently, there has been great improvement in stochastic planning in large search spaces with sampling based algorithms. One particular algorithm is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which is an anytime stochastic planning algorithm. MCTS employs the well-established multi-armed bandit theory to solve optimization problems by asymmetrically sampling actions where it foresees the existence of an optimal solution. In this thesis, we propose new algorithms and heuristics in order to address several challenges arising due to highly coordinated planning in physical and abstract domains. Our algorithms improve scalability for search in large domains, provides data-driven evaluation functions to guide the search algorithm better, and enables finite search algorithms to produce infinite length solutions. In the first part of this thesis, we study two multi-robot planning problems that require high degree of coordination, patrolling and task allocation. The main challenge for these domains is the large search space. For patrolling, we propose a novel search technique, the Monte Carlo Tree Search with Useful Cycles, which can generate optimal cyclic patrol policies with theoretical convergence guarantees. For task allocation, we develop a parallelized MCTS based planner where branch and bound paradigm is integrated to the search algorithm for admissible pruning. In the second part of this thesis, we study two coordinated abstract planning problems within the field of procedural content generation, goal-driven computer narrative generation and Sokoban puzzle level creation. In these problems, virtual agents coordinate their actions to procedurally create stories and puzzles which have numerous application areas ranging from video games to education. We formulate both story generation and Sokoban puzzle generation as optimization problems and propose data-driven heuristic evaluation metrics for efficient coordinated solutions using MCTS.","Kartal, Bilal",0,,1004

2774,,"Infectious diseases are the largest killers of children and young adults in developing countries, and continue to pose a high burden on global health. This dissertation concerns related topics for combating infectious-disease epidemics, and is organized into three main chapters. While each chapter revolves around a specific topic in the general domain of public-health policymaking, the unifying theme of this research is using agent-based simulation methodology for modeling and analysis of infectious-disease epidemics. The first chapter targets the topic of how best to allocate constrained resources to control an epidemic. In this study, we use a collection of computational techniques, including computer simulation and numerical optimization algorithms, to develop a simulation-optimization framework for addressing the resource-allocation problem as applied to an epidemic. The goal is to relax the restrictive assumptions held by traditional analytical approaches, thereby facilitating a more valid model that is necessarily more complex, and to extend the method to support a general class of resource-allocation problems with realistic assumptions about population structure, disease description, and interventions. The second chapter presents a series of studies on transmission dynamics of tuberculosis (TB), and addresses the impact of various control strategies for combating TB epidemics. Using an agent-based simulation model of a TB epidemic in a household-structured population, we estimate the timing of TB transmission among household and community members. Moreover, we consider multiple case-finding strategies, including household contact tracing and a community active approach, and evaluate the population-level impact of each intervention for controlling disease incidence. Finally, the third chapter analyzes estimation bias of the recent-transmission rate in molecular studies of TB. Analysis of population-based DNA data continues to serve as the main method to estimate the proportion of TB incidence due to recent transmission, which in turn has important implications for understanding the dynamics of transmission and policymaking. Previous studies have identified a number of factors affecting the precision of this approach in various settings, but the exact relationship of such factors remains uncertain. In this study, we aim to quantify the role of such factors, and develop a decision tool for adjusting the estimated ratio of infection due to recent transmission. Using an agent-based simulation model of TB as a virtual laboratory, we implement a sequence of statistically controlled experiments with regard to combinations of several factors. The results enable us to compute the estimation bias for various levels of each factor, and can serve as a decision-support tool for adjusting the estimation error in future molecular studies of TB. In summary, this dissertation concerns critical global-health issues in understanding, controlling, and policy-making concerning infectious-disease epidemics, and offers a multidisciplinary approach to such problems using advanced computer-simulation techniques and analytical tools. The agent-based simulation approach is a novel technique that is increasing in popularity across the literature and in several fields. This brings to bear the power and effectiveness of such models in various applications, and their promising contributions for control and policymaking of infectious diseases.","Kasaie Sharifi, Parasto Alsadat",0,,1006

A fairly new program at San Francisco State University, Metro focuses on increasing the retention and persistence rates for first-generation college-going students of color, while at the same time empowering them to become social critics and agents of change. Metro Academy is a redesign of the critical first two years of college, when students at public institutions are most likely to drop out. The linked courses, a unique core component of the program, are intentionally infused with social justice perspectives and real-world topics, and they employ a critical pedagogy approach. The quantitative findings revealed that Metro students were more likely to persist and be in good standing than their matched comparison group and all first-time freshmen at the University. The primary phase of this study, the qualitative findings, indicated that Metro's social justice model of education provided the pedagogical space for students to build and cultivate the knowledge, skills, and tools to challenge and counter oppression they may encounter in their lives. Three major themes emerged from the qualitative data with respect to Metro's model and application: (a) Socially Responsive Education; (b) Metro's Learning Community; and (c) Connecting to Community. By illuminating the students' voices and perspectives, this study provides an in-depth analysis and suggests promising practices that institutions can utilize to better serve the needs historically marginalized students.","Kased, Rama Ali",0,,1007

2778,Those Virtual People all Look the Same to me: Computer-Rendered Faces Elicit a Higher False Alarm Rate Than Real Human Faces in a Recognition Memory Task,"Virtual as compared with real human characters can elicit a sense of uneasiness in human observers, characterized by lack of familiarity and even feelings of eeriness (the ""uncanny valley"" hypothesis). Here we test the possibility that this alleged lack of familiarity is literal in the sense that people have lesser perceptual expertise in processing virtual as compared with real human faces. Sixty-four participants took part in a recognition memory study in which they first learned a set of faces and were then asked to recognize them in a testing session. We used real and virtual (computer-rendered) versions of the same faces, presented in either upright or inverted orientation. Real and virtual faces were matched for low-level visual features such as global luminosity and spatial frequency contents Our results demonstrated a higher response bias toward responding ""seen before"" for virtual as compared with real faces, which was further explained by a higher false alarm rate for the former. This finding resembles a similar effect for recognizing human faces from other than one's own ethnic groups (the ""other race effect""). Virtual faces received clearly higher subjective eeriness ratings than real faces. Our results did not provide evidence of poorer overall recognition memory or lesser inversion effect for virtual faces, however. The higher false alarm rate finding supports the notion that lesser perceptual expertise may contribute to the lack of subjective familiarity with virtual faces. We discuss alternative interpretations and provide suggestions for future research.","Katsyri, J.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01362,1009
2779,,"The uncanny valley hypothesis, proposed already in the 1970s, suggests that almost but not fully humanlike artificial characters will trigger a profound sense of unease. This hypothesis has become widely acknowledged both in the popular media and scientific research. Surprisingly, empirical evidence for the hypothesis has remained inconsistent. In the present article, we reinterpret the original uncanny valley hypothesis and review empirical evidence for different theoretically motivated uncanny valley hypotheses. The uncanny valley could be understood as the naïve claim that any kind of human-likeness manipulation will lead to experienced negative affinity at close-to-realistic levels. More recent hypotheses have suggested that the uncanny valley would be caused by artificial–human categorization difficulty or by a perceptual mismatch between artificial and human features. Original formulation also suggested that movement would modulate the uncanny valley. The reviewed empirical literature failed to provide consistent support for the naïve uncanny valley hypothesis or the modulatory effects of movement. Results on the categorization difficulty hypothesis were still too scarce to allow drawing firm conclusions. In contrast, good support was found for the perceptual mismatch hypothesis. Taken together, the present review findings suggest that the uncanny valley exists only under specific conditions. More research is still needed to pinpoint the exact conditions under which the uncanny valley phenomenon manifests itself.

At the same time, the hypothesis has become associated with many computer-animated films that have aimed at high realism. In the present investigation, we tested whether semirealistic animated film characters do in fact elicit negative evaluations. Fifty-four participants were asked to evaluate five matched film excerpts from each of cartoonish, semirealistic, and human-acted films. Mixed model analyses were conducted to reduce the effects of participant and stimulus related confounds. Explicit selections made after the experiment confirmed that participants associated semirealistic film characters correctly with the UV. Semirealistic animated characters also received higher eeriness ratings than the other film characters. In particular, two semirealistic films 'Beowulf'and The Polar Express' were selected the most often explicitly, and 'Beowulf also received higher eeriness ratings than any other film. Somewhat unexpectedly, cartoonish characters received the highest strangeness ratings and (after confound correction) the lowest likability ratings. Taken together, the present findings demonstrate that semirealistic animated film characters are more eerie than cartoonish characters or real actors, and hence provide evidence for the existence of the UV in animated film characters.","Katsyri, J.",0,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.09.010,1011

The predominant condition of the discipline in my view is a certain persistence towards ambiguity, towards a professional and creative field that is in constant state of being in-between and becoming. I have also elaborated that the embedded approach in education cannot fall under a specific theory of learning, but rather celebrate the diversity of activities in teaching and learning that go beyond singular didactics. I have structured the text around three case examples of different pedagogical situations in order to reflect on various teaching and learning conditions within interiors education. The examples wish to buttress the necessity for holistic discourse for comprehending the pedagogy of interiors, that span from encountering of an individual to curriculum development. I wish to draw attention to the potential in the discipline of interiors itself, that may embed inherent pedagogical qualities as abilities for shared approaches towards the uncertain; Interiors of pedagogy. Thus, arguing that the practice of interiors may leap far beyond vocational didactics as an active agent continuously defining its own way of learning. The text wishes to contribute further discussion on how to approach and find ways of knowing and learning in interiors.

2794,,"This thesis aims to provide an original context for the emergent use of Web 2.0 technologies by brands and their communication agents (advertising, PR and marketing) as they engage consumers in (a branded form of) dialogue. This is achieved by exploring the content and style of brand-consumer communications in Web 2.0 platforms, by appraising advertising discourses in collaborative and interactive environment of Twitter. This study focuses in particular on the use of language and the role that other communicative modes play in Web 2.0-mediated interactions and the possible implications they might have on brand-consumer power relations. This thesis adopts a critical inter-disciplinary approach, and is designed to inform the emerging field of digital commercial communications. More specifically, by applying social and cultural theories of new media with the social Web, this study sets out to contribute to emerging literature and debates on the socio-economic implications of Web 2.0 communications in the context of advertising. Critical theories of advertising and new media have been utilised to shape a framework for analysing communications in collaborative and often interactive digital advertising settings. This, and a body of primary research through first-hand interviews, plus analysis of exemplar of Web 2.0-mediated brand-consumer communications, enables me to consider more broadly the ways in which capitalism has been repositioned within the new digital environment. To achieve this, this study has appropriated two research methods in it’s handling of primary evidence. The first part of analysis appraises eight semi-structured interviews I conducted with digital strategy makers and ‘brand ambassadors’ working within the contemporary international advertising industry, acting on behalf of multinational brands. The second part analyses the content of brand-consumer communications within Web 2.0 platforms, notably Twitter, through four different sectors spanning service, product and cause sectors. Cases are of Starbucks Coffee (fast moving consumer goods), Dell Computers (IT sector), Burberry (luxury fashion) and Yes Scotland (a political cause). The overarching aim is to assess product or service-driven digital advertising strategies that have most effectively exploited (or best lend themselves to) social Web platforms to leverage their ideology and generate social supports. The results of my analysis suggest that although Web 2.0-mediated communications between brands and consumers exhibit some characteristics of participatory culture, the actual nature of the conversational qualities and the types of interaction spans a much wider spectrum. Some discourses are in fact monologue, while others contain consumer-generated responsive dialogue and more proportionate mutual discourse. The latter ultimately contributes in co-creating and shaping discourses that reinforce and stabilise existing hierarchical relations between producers and consumers.","Kazeroun, Mohammad Hossein",0,,1016

2798,,"Background: Information technology can help individuals to change their health behaviors. This is due to its potential for dynamic and unbiased information processing enabling users to monitor their own progress and be informed about risks and opportunities specific to evolving contexts and motivations. However, in many behavior change interventions, information technology is underused by treating it as a passive medium focused on efficient transmission of information and a positive user experience. Objective: To conduct an interdisciplinary literature review to determine the extent to which the active technological capabilities of dynamic and adaptive information processing are being applied in behavior change interventions and to identify their role in these interventions. Methods: We defined key categories of active technology such as semantic information processing, pattern recognition, and adaptation. We conducted the literature search using keywords derived from the categories and included studies that indicated a significant role for an active technology in health-related behavior change. In the data extraction, we looked specifically for the following technology roles: (1) dynamic adaptive tailoring of messages depending on context, (2) interactive education, (3) support for client self-monitoring of behavior change progress, and (4) novel ways in which interventions are grounded in behavior change theories using active technology. Results: The search returned 228 potentially relevant articles, of which 41 satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found that significant research was focused on dialog systems, embodied conversational agents, and activity recognition. The most covered health topic was physical activity. The majority of the studies were early-stage research. Only 6 were randomized controlled trials, of which 4 were positive for behavior change and 5 were positive for acceptability. Empathy and relational behavior were significant research themes in dialog systems for behavior change, with many pilot studies showing a preference for those features. We found few studies that focused on interactive education (3 studies) and self-monitoring (2 studies). Some recent research is emerging in dynamic tailoring (15 studies) and theoretically grounded ontologies for automated semantic processing (4 studies). Conclusions: The potential capabilities and risks of active assistance technologies are not being fully explored in most current behavior change research. Designers of health behavior interventions need to consider the relevant informatics methods and algorithms more fully. There is also a need to analyze the possibilities that can result from interaction between different technology components. This requires deep interdisciplinary collaboration, for example, between health psychology, computer science, health informatics, cognitive science, and educational methodology.

As such, it represents a change in the way some adults understand children as thinkers, meaning makers, communicators, and moral agents. The second dimension is pedagogical. It is the idea that a guided, open-structured, dialogical speech community which he called ""community of philosophical inquiry"" (CPI)--is the most appropriate way to practice the philosophical curriculum that he had developed with students. This paper explores CPI as a concrete application of John Dewey's educational theory, which posits a drive towards the reconstruction of habits--including, and perhaps primarily, the reconstruction of habits of belief--as an ongoing result of the dialectical relationship between our current habits and what he calls ""impulse,"" and works to overcome through dialogue the gaps Dewey identified between child and curriculum, the ""psychological and the logical,"" and ultimately, between child and adult.

2805,Comparing Robot Embodiments in a Guided Discovery Learning Interaction with Children,"The application of social robots to the domain of education is becoming more prevalent. However, there remain a wide range of open issues, such as the effectiveness of robots as tutors on student learning outcomes, the role of social behaviour in teaching interactions, and how the embodiment of a robot influences the interaction. In this paper, we seek to explore children's behaviour towards a robot tutor for children in a novel guided discovery learning interaction. Since the necessity of real robots (as opposed to virtual agents) in education has not been definitively established in the literature, the effect of robot embodiment is assessed. The results demonstrate that children overcome strong incorrect biases in the material to be learned, but with no significant differences between embodiment conditions. However, the data do suggest that the use of real robots carries an advantage in terms of social presence that could provide educational benefits.","Kennedy, J.",0,10.1007/s12369-014-0277-4,1020
2808,,"Mongolian overtone singing (höömii) and Mongolian wrestling songs (tsols) are vocal styles that evoke physical and mental strength in the vocalist through the accessing of nature. The phrase “höömii-tsol-thinking computer” conveys my end-goal while composing, performing, and researching for my original composition strong.mng. I wanted to create a work in which the computer would be informed by the performance methods and philosophies employed during Mongolian höömii and tsols. Strong.mng is a 25-minute production for dancer, live digital illustrator, and overtone singer with a laptop computer serving as both a fixed and interactive responsive musical instrument. The music draws upon themes from höömii and tsols through the lens of virtual fieldwork, which was the research method I used to inform strong.mng. Through the composing and performing of strong.mng, I arrived at the following three-part hypothesis: firstly, the development of a robust symbiotic relationship between höömii, tsols, and today’s electronic music technology may transform the technological devices used into agents of deep ecology and bodily interconnectedness. Secondly, this transformation may metamorphose the performer into a more courageous being who is strengthened both physically and mentally by the Mongolian belief that, when performing höömii and tsols, the musician is drawn into kinship with nature. Lastly, I believe some computer music is restrained in its potential by techno-somatic discreteness as well as anthropocentrism, and that applying philosophies from höömii and tsols can help move computer music more towards a physically embodying means of sonification; one that is also akin with the natural world.","Kennedy, Justin Leo",0,,1021
2809,Perceptual Effects of Inconsistency in Human Animations,"The individual shape of the human body, including the geometry of its articulated structure and the distribution of weight over that structure, influences the kinematics of a person's movements. How sensitive is the visual system to inconsistencies between shape and motion introduced by retargeting motion from one person onto the shape of another? We used optical motion capture to record five pairs of male performers with large differences in body weight, while they pushed, lifted, and threw objects. From these data, we estimated both the kinematics of the actions as well as the performer's individual body shape. To obtain consistent and inconsistent stimuli, we created animated avatars by combining the shape and motion estimates from either a single performer or from different performers. Using these stimuli we conducted three experiments in an immersive virtual reality environment. First, a group of participants detected which of two stimuli was inconsistent. Performance was very low, and results were only marginally significant. Next, a second group of participants rated perceived attractiveness, eeriness, and humanness of consistent and inconsistent stimuli, but these judgements of animation characteristics were not affected by consistency of the stimuli. Finally, a third group of participants rated properties of the objects rather than of the performers. Here, we found strong influences of shape-motion inconsistency on perceived weight and thrown distance of objects. This suggests that the visual system relies on its knowledge of shape and motion and that these components are assimilated into an altered perception of the action outcome. We propose that the visual system attempts to resist inconsistent interpretations of human animations. Actions involving object manipulations present an opportunity for the visual system to reinterpret the introduced inconsistencies as a change in the dynamics of an object rather than as an unexpected combination of body shape and body motion.","Kenny, S.",0,10.1145/3301411,1022
2814,The Influence of Socializing Agents and Teaching Context Among Teachers of Different Dispositions Toward Change,"Physical education teachers have been criticized for not implementing progressive or innovative instruction resulting in enhanced student knowledge and skills for lifetime participation in physical activity. Purpose: To investigate how teachers with varying dispositions toward change perceive socializing agents and teaching context as barriers to or facilitators of making pedagogical change. Methods: Thirty-two teachers completed a survey of personal dispositions toward change and participated in in-depth interviews. Results: Teachers perceived that students' response to instructional methods and student contact time (days/week), as well as interactions with teaching colleagues and administrators influenced their ability to make pedagogical changes. Teachers with limited student contact time reported scheduling as a barrier to change, whereas daily student contact was a facilitator. Change-disposed teachers were more likely to promote student learning and assume leadership roles. Conclusion: Reform efforts should include consideration of teacher dispositions and student contact time.","Kern, B.",0,10.1123/jtpe.2018-0175,1023
2818,A Growing Disconnection From Nature Is Evident in Cultural Products,"Human connection with nature is widely believed to be in decline even though empirical evidence is scarce on the magnitude and historical pattern of the change. Studying works of popular culture in English throughout the 20th century and later, we have documented a cultural shift away from nature that begins in the 1950s. Since then, references to nature have been decreasing steadily in fiction books, song lyrics, and film storylines, whereas references to the human-made environment have not. The observed temporal pattern is consistent with the explanatory role of increased virtual and indoors recreation options (e.g., television, video games) in the disconnect from nature, and it is inconsistent with a pure urbanization account. These findings are cause for concern, not only because they imply foregone physical and psychological benefits from engagement with nature, but also because cultural products are agents of socialization that can evoke curiosity, respect, and concern for the natural world.","Kesebir, S.",0,10.1177/1745691616662473,1024
2820,COMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING: AN IS RESEARCH APPROACH TO ADDRESS WICKED PROBLEMS WITH BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS,"Wicked problems like sustainable energy and financial market stability are societal challenges that arise from complex sociotechnical systems in which numerous social, economic, political, and technical factors interact. Understanding and mitigating these problems requires research methods that scale beyond the traditional areas of inquiry of information systems (IS) individuals, organizations, and markets and that deliver solutions in addition to insights. We describe an approach to address these challenges through competitive benchmarking (CB), a novel research method that helps interdisciplinary research communities tackle complex challenges of societal scale by using different types of data from a variety of sources such as usage data from customers, production patterns from producers, public policy and regulatory constraints, etc. for a given instantiation. Further, the CB platform generates data that can be used to improve operational strategies and judge the effectiveness of regulatory regimes and policies. We describe our experience applying CB to the sustainable energy challenge in the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) in which more than a dozen research groups from around the world jointly devise, benchmark, and improve IS-based solutions.","Ketter, W.",0,10.25300/misq/2016/40.4.12,1025
2824,A MULTIAGENT COMPETITIVE GAMING PLATFORM TO ADDRESS SOCIETAL CHALLENGES,"The shift toward sustainable electricity systems is one of the grand challenges of the 21st century. Decentralized production from renewable sources, electric mobility, and related advances are at odds with traditional power systems where central, large-scale generation of electricity follows inelastic consumer demand. Information systems innovations can enable new forms of dynamic electricity trading that leverage real-time consumption information and that use price signals to incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. However, the best designs for these innovations, and the societal implications of different design choices, are largely unclear. We are addressing these challenges through the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC), a competitive gaming platform on which numerous research groups now jointly devise, benchmark, and improve IS-based solutions to the sustainable electricity challenge. Based on the Power TAC community's results, we give preliminary empirical evidence for the efficacy of competitive gaming platforms, and for the community's contributions toward resolving the sustainable electricity challenge.","Ketter, W.",0,10.25300/misq/2016/40.2.09,1026
2828,,"The last two decades have set the global trend of internationalized education on a new course. Besides the usual flow of international students from their home countries to Western universities, an opposite flow emerged. In the Middle East, for instance, the number of international campuses nearly doubled between 2000 and 2009, and Egypt has been no exception. Starting 2003, Egypt has witnessed a remarkable surge of private international universities that use English as a medium of instruction, adopt foreign curricula and have partnerships with universities in Europe, North America, and recently Asia. This trend has raised identity loss concerns among many intellectuals and educational researchers whose worries mainly revolved around national, religious, and linguistic identities. This longitudinal qualitative study, thus, aimed to understand how Egyptian freshman students at an international University in Cairo construct and negotiate their national, religious and linguistic identities. A semi-structured interview was conducted with 12 students at three different points of their first year at the university, and a focus group was organized at the beginning of their second year. Results revealed a more complex picture than the widespread simplistic rhetoric about international universities’ influence on students’ identity construction. The participants’ social and academic backgrounds and unique life experiences were an important factor in their identity construction and negotiation; they seemed to determine the ranking of those identities on their hierarchy of identities, which in turn shaped how they constructed and negotiated them. Moreover, participants realized and used their agency to negotiate their identities and resolve identity crises when these happened. They also resorted to other identity agents, particularly family and students’ clubs. This study contributes to the Egyptian debate on educational reform and adds to the literature on English as a medium of instruction, identity formation, and internationalized education by shedding light on the intricate ways in which students navigate through international education, and by suggesting pedagogical and policy implications applicable not only to liberal-education institutions in the region, but perhaps also to other universities in Europe and North America that attract international students, particularly with the recent waves of refugees from the Middle East.","Khabbar, Sanaa",0,,1027
2829,Self-organization in in aggregating robot swarms: A DW-KNN topological approach,"In certain swarm applications, where the inter-agent distance is not the only factor in the collective behaviours of the swarm, additional properties such as density could have a crucial effect. In this paper, we propose applying a Distance-Weighted K-Nearest Neighbouring (DW-KNN) topology to the behaviour of robot swarms performing self-organized aggregation, in combination with a virtual physics approach to keep the robots together. A distance-weighted function based on a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) interpolation approach, which is used to evaluate the robot density in the swarm, is applied as the key factor for identifying the K-nearest neighbours taken into account when aggregating the robots. The intra virtual physical connectivity among these neighbours is achieved using a virtual viscoelastic-based proximity model. With the ARGoS based-simulator, we model and evaluate the proposed approach, showing various self-organized aggregations performed by a swarm of N foot-bot robots. Also, we compared the aggregation quality of DW-KNN aggregation approach to that of the conventional KNN approach and found better performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

2833,Social Transmission of Experience of Agency: An Experimental Study,"The sense of controlling one's own actions is fundamental to normal human mental function, and also underlies concepts of social responsibility for action. However, it remains unclear how the wider social context of human action influences sense of agency. Using a simple experimental design, we investigated, for the first time, how observing the action of another person or a robot could potentially influence one's own sense of agency. We assessed how observing another's action might change the perceived temporal relationship between one's own voluntary actions and their outcomes, which has been proposed as an implicit measure of sense of agency. Working in pairs, participants chose between two action alternatives, one rewarded more frequently than the other, while watching a rotating clock hand. They judged, in separate blocks, either the time of their own action, or the time of a tone that followed the action. These were compared to baseline judgements of actions alone, or tones alone, to calculate the perceptual shift of action toward outcome and vice versa. Our design focused on how these two dependent variables, which jointly provide an implicit measure of sense of agency, might be influenced by observing another's action. In the observational group, each participant could see the other's actions. Multivariate analysis showed that the perceived time of action and tone shifted progressively toward the actual time of outcome with repeated experience of this social situation. No such progressive change occurred in other groups for whom a barrier hid participants' actions from each other. However, a similar effect was observed in the group that viewed movements of a human-like robotic hand, rather than actions of another person. This finding suggests that observing the actions of others increases the salience of the external outcomes of action and this effect is not unique to observing human agents. Social contexts in which we see others controlling external events may play an important role in mentally representing the impact of our own actions on the external world.","Khalighinejad, N.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01315,1029

We report the results of an experiment based on the Desert Survival task, where the effect of agent attractiveness on persuasion was tested. The results suggest that the attractive agent was significantly more persuasive in changing the participant's opinion than was the unattractive agent. Furthermore, greater behavioral change was observed when the participant interacted with the attractive agent, in terms of persuasiveness, including the attribution of more positive personality traits toward this agent (the attractiveness stereotype). These findings provide further evidence of the powerful influence of the agent's physical appearance on the human user in an interaction-based context. We conclude by pointing toward future research and potential within the area.","Khan, R. F.",0,10.1080/10447318.2013.839904,1030
2839,,"The demand for electric power has been steadily increasing, and this trend is expected to continue over the coming decades. With the increased usage of fossil fuels, there has been a growing concern with the environmental impacts of electric power generation. Therefore, penetration of renewable sources of energy in the modern electric grid has also been increasing. The intermittent nature of renewables introduces uncertainty in the electric grid, which has a negative impact on grid reliability. To address these challenges, renewables are supplemented with energy storage systems (ESS). This dissertation evaluates ESS technologies according to their applications. A generalized method is proposed for ESS sizing for microgrids. This method can be successfully applied to any load profile; it also takes into account operating temperature and aging factors. In addition, this dissertation presents a variety of ESS life balancing solutions using the new framework of Flexible Distribution of EneRgy and Storage Resources (FDERS). It is based on an in-situ reconfiguration approach through 'virtual' reactance and/or 'virtual' inertia to change the 'electrical' position of each DER without physically displacing it in the microgrid system. Several approaches toward balancing the ESS utilization are proposed taking advantage of the flexibility offered by FDERS framework. It is shown that the estimated ESS cycle life is dependent on factors such as cycling sequence, pattern, and occurrence. Finally, this dissertation proposes a multi-agent based fleet vehicle-to-grid (V2G) control strategy that intelligently computes each vehicle's load share based on its battery state-of-health (SoH). Unlike state-of-the-art V2G systems, which treat all the fleet electric vehicles equally with no regard to their diverse driving histories and unequal battery aging, the proposed control strategy employs a programmable on-board smart device to estimate the vehicle's battery SoH. When multiple vehicles are connected to an isolated microgrid, the individual load shares are dependent on their latest SoH value.","Khasawneh, Hussam Jihad",0,,1031

In this paper, we explored the potentials of increasing the effectiveness of requests aiming to promote pro-environmental behaviors by engaging users in a social dialog, given the effects of two possible personas that are more related to the buildings (i.e., building vs. building manager). We tested our hypotheses and evaluated our findings in virtual and physical environments and found similar effects in both environments. Our results showed that social dialog involvement persuaded respondents to perform more pro-environmental actions. However, these effects were significant when the requests were delivered by an agent representing the building. In addition, these strategies were not equally effective across all types of people and their effects varied for people with different characteristics.

Employing communication systems to enable buildings to interact with their occupants and influence the way they behave could significantly reduce energy consumption. We investigated the effectiveness of different delivery styles (i.e., avatar, voice, and text), as well as the impact of communicator's persona (i.e., building facility manager and building itself) and gender (i.e., male and female) on occupants' compliance with pro-environmental requests. The results showed that avatar is more effective than voice and voice is more effective than text on promoting compliance with persuasive pro-environmental requests. In addition, results showed greater compliance with requests made by the persona of a building facility manager than the persona of the building itself. Finally, participants were more likely to comply with the female communicator than the male communicator. Accordingly, this new interaction between buildings and their occupants could impact human behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Khashe, S.",1,10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.040,1033
2848,,"To achieve human like functionality, artificial arms are required to be incorporated with the sense of touch that can be achieved by affixing tactile sensors to them. The user operating these artificial arms, for any Human–Computer Interactive task, should be able to perceive the same tactile sensation as is acquired by the tactile sensor fitted artificial arms. This work is an initial step to interface artificial tactile sensations of robots with human perception. Pressure distribution images are acquired while a robot arm fitted with a tactile sensor palpates embossed digits (0–9) and are classified. The image classification results are transmitted via control signals as vibrotactile stimuli to humans using vibration motors attached on their backs. Vibrotactile stimulus is chosen as a feedback sensation in an attempt to not engage visual/auditory channels such that the work can be extended in a multitasking environment in future. Vibrotactile stimuli are also essential for a person using prosthetic arm, suffering from sensory-motor disabilities that inhibit the use of the audio and/or visual sensory channels as well as for applications such as tele-operation. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis during vibrotactile stimulus presentation as well as subjects’ response evaluation show that vibrotactile stimuli for particular digits as recognized from tactile data is capable of imparting information from artificial somato-sensation to humans.

2853,Role of Gaze Cues in Interpersonal Motor Coordination: Towards Higher Affiliation in Human-Robot Interaction,"Background The ability to follow one another's gaze plays an important role in our social cognition; especially when we synchronously perform tasks together. We investigate how gaze cues can improve performance in a simple coordination task (i.e., the mirror game), whereby two players mirror each other's hand motions. In this game, each player is either a leader or follower. To study the effect of gaze in a systematic manner, the leader's role is played by a robotic avatar. We contrast two conditions, in which the avatar provides or not explicit gaze cues that indicate the next location of its hand. Specifically, we investigated (a) whether participants are able to exploit these gaze cues to improve their coordination, (b) how gaze cues affect action prediction and temporal coordination, and (c) whether introducing active gaze behavior for avatars makes them more realistic and human-like (from the user point of view). Methodology/Principal Findings 43 subjects participated in 8 trials of the mirror game. Each subject performed the game in the two conditions (with and without gaze cues). In this within-subject study, the order of the conditions was randomized across participants, and subjective assessment of the avatar's realism was assessed by administering a post-hoc questionnaire. When gaze cues were provided, a quantitative assessment of synchrony between participants and the avatar revealed a significant improvement in subject reaction-time (RT). This confirms our hypothesis that gaze cues improve the follower's ability to predict the avatar's action. An analysis of the pattern of frequency across the two players' hand movements reveals that the gaze cues improve the overall temporal coordination across the two players. Finally, analysis of the subjective evaluations from the questionnaires reveals that, in the presence of gaze cues, participants found it not only more human-like/realistic, but also easier to interact with the avatar. Conclusion/Significance This work confirms that people can exploit gaze cues to predict another person's movements and to better coordinate their motions with their partners, even when the partner is a computer-animated avatar. Moreover, this study contributes further evidence that implementing biological features, here task-relevant gaze cues, enable the humanoid robotic avatar to appear more human-like, and thus increase the user's sense of affiliation.","Khoramshahi, M.",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0156874,1035
2858,,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) constitute a rising class of targets for the next generation of therapeutic intervention. Though they play a fundamental role in many biological processes and almost all pathological conditions including cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases, , PPIs remain underrepresented in drug discovery. Small molecules are the ideal candidates for PPI inhibitors due to low production cost and better absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties compared to biological agents. Discovering small molecule inhibitors of PPIs has proven to be difficult because of the relatively large contact areas between proteins. Herein are described novel approaches to the chemical synthesis as well as a screening tool which will facilitate the discovery of small molecule inhibitors of PPIs. Currently, molecules derived from multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are rarely distributed in general screening libraries. The exceptions are special scaffolds, e.g. dihydropyrimidines, whose class includes the blockbuster Ca antagonist, Nifedipine. Interestingly, however, MCR molecules have been frequently described as inhibitors of PPIs. Examples include p53/mdm21,2, Bcl23, HIV-1/gp414, CCR55 and oxytocin antagonists6. These findings support the notion that MCR molecules are especially suitable for mimicking peptides. We have developed a virtual library of scaffolds derived from a diverse set of MCRs which are easily chemically accessible. In addition, our lab has set forth to discover novel MCRs to add to our virtual library. One such scaffold described in this dissertation is derived from the Ugi-4-component-5- cenetered reaction. A novel amidation of this classic scaffold adds a true four-component reaction to our MCR database. The scope and limitations of this reaction are described in detail allowing for an accurate representation of compounds with a high probability of being synthesized. Various cyclizations of this scaffold are also explored and described in detail. A receptor-based drug discovery approach can be applied when an accurate threedimensional (3D) structure of a specific PPI complex is available. A novel, complementary and transformative docking approach for the rational design of small molecule inhibitors was developed for our virtual library based on the “anchor” concept. Applying our method, we efficiently discovered several new scaffolds of inhibitors of the p53/MDM2 interaction with lower micromolar affinity binding to MDM2, which can serve as starting point for medicinal chemistry optimization. In summary, the methods and tools described in this dissertation are important contributions to the fields of medicinal chemistry and structure-based drug discovery because they combine structural insights and ligand design to expedite the discovery of novel small molecule inhibitors of PPIs.","Khoury, Kareem",0,,1036
2859,,"Teacher leadership, social justice, and self-efficacy are fundamental educational constructs that if collectively applied may facilitate the continuous development of pedagogical practices that bring forth academic equity and success to all students. Currently, the collective application of these constructs is critical because of the increase in diversity across socio-economic and ethnic groups among students and teachers in our educational systems. Thus, exemplary and socially just educational practices that can effectively meet the academic and professional needs of all are paramount in our educational communities. This empirical investigation assesses how mentor teachers can actively participate as pioneers for educational improvement, through their professional commitment as teacher leaders who are socially just and highly efficacious. The purpose of this study was to examine the attributes and the perceptions of teacher leadership, social justice, and self-efficacy that existed among five mentor teachers as they mentored and supported novice in-service teachers. The study used descriptive and embedded multiple case study analyses to empirically assess the strengths and areas of improvement needed among the mentor teachers related to the three constructs (teacher leadership, social justice, and self-efficacy). The findings revealed that mentor teachers areas of strength appeared to be in the teacher leadership and self-efficacy constructs, and their area of improvement needed appeared to be related to the social justice construct. Further, the number of years in teaching experience was not necessarily associated with mentor teachers’ perceptions of their effectiveness in teacher leadership, social justice and self-efficacy. This study contributes to educational research with implications that social justice is a vital educational construct in which all educators should demonstrate competence while they serve as agents of socialization in educational contexts. Altogether, teacher leadership, social justice, and self-efficacy are important educational constructs that if successfully applied in our educational communities, have the potential to generate exemplary pedagogical practices among mentor teachers and classroom teachers and positive academic outcomes for students.","Kibe, Grace W.",0,,1037
2860,,"The introduction of autonomous agents to replace humans in unfavorable and unreachable environments has been a longstanding goal in the field of robotics. The existing work of various researchers address several challenges involved in design or control of such robotic systems. However, existing solutions have been unable to offer users an easy and efficient programming environment for developing versatile robotic applications. These inadequacies have given rise to the development of a new robot programming language, called Programming LAnguage for Synchronous Agents (PLASA). The main objective of this paper is to give a brief introduction about the newly developed robot programming language, PLASA, which facilitates the rapid implementation of co-operative applications on multiple physical robots, in dynamic environments. The syntax and semantics of this language are similar to those in many other high-level programming languages. In addition to the features offered by other high-level languages, PLASA offers two novel instructions: ""do instruction'', which helps in executing the main motion primitives, and ""query instruction'', which helps in executing a great variety of geometric and mathematical queries. A compiler produces a program that is executed by a virtual machine in each of the robots. The virtual machine offers a key characteristic that guarantees the timely execution of robots' movements through a synchronization protocol. To verify the correct functionality of the co-operative applications, a simulator that includes the proposed components has been provided. The developed language offers abstraction for hiding complex network details and delivers human-readable language; these features make the programming environment suitable for anyone to control robot systems, regardless of expertise. The synchronization and co-ordination mechanisms provided by the language ensure the safety and prompt execution of robot operations in a robot system developed using PLASA.","Kilaru, Jyothsna",0,,1038

This research work develops a three-phased approach for integrating principles of a circular economy system within a course in energy policy. The phases involve scanning available resources, identifying possible matches based on the quality of energy, namely exergy, and determining solution areas. The case study is a university-founded dairy facility in the province of Ankara, Turkey with a biogas production potential of 982 m(3) per day. Four scenarios are analyzed based on options for combined heat and power, organic Rankine cycle, waste heat recovery, absorption chillers, ground source heat pumps, photovoltaic thermal arrays, and/or low-speed wind turbines. In total, 184.1 kW(e) of high exergy power and 285.3 kW(t) of low exergy thermal power may be produced. Further evaluation of the scenarios indicates that the level of exergy match may reach 0.87 while primary energy and primary exergy savings over separate energy production from renewables may be 38% and 61%, respectively. The solution areas can address aspects of an energy, water, and food nexus based on energy from waste, energy for irrigation and agriculture, and other linkages. The results are used to engage students in advancing the Sustainable Energy Action Plans of local municipalities. The approach has applicability to other cases in a time when pedagogical innovation is urgently needed to stimulate environmental sustainability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Sources ranging from the newly defined Hoarding Disorder diagnosis in the DSM-V, to popular media, to agents of the burgeoning clutter-management industry describe disorder in terms of an irrational attachment, closeness, or overidentification with objects. At the same time, these sources imagine order to result from the cool distance and controlled passion a person is able to maintain toward his or her possessions. Drawing on more than twenty interviews and numerous fieldwork encounters with professional organizers (POs) in Toronto between 2014 and 2015, this article describes how POs aim to reorient their clients materially, morally, and affectively to relieve the disorder they report in their lives. Here, I argue, POs emerge as a species of late capitalist healer whose interventions are animated by a paradoxical double movement. For just as POs act to loosen the object attachments and disrupt the secret sympathy their clients share with their possessions, they operate within a realm of magical correspondence where matter and mind are imagined to reflect and affect one another, and where bringing order to a client's possessions means also bringing order to his or her mind.","Kilroy-Marac, K.",0,10.14506/ca31.3.09,1040

However, the stringent payload of a single agent or small UASs reduces their overall practicality and effectiveness. My research aims to address these inherent limitations of small UASs with a swarm by holding the required formation in order to distribute tasks and payload among multiple UASs. The goal of this research is to overcome the challenges of operating multi-agent systems by developing phasic navigation and guidance algorithms. Aircraft dynamics and their interactions with surrounding agents are highly nonlinear, which makes autonomous formation flight very sensitive to aircraft initial conditions. The phasic navigation algorithms are proposed and consist of hybrid mathematical approaches: Frenet-Serret curvature control, Hungarian algorithm and moving mesh methods. At the first phase, the curvature control allieviates the sensitivity to initial conditions of multi-agent UASs in unstructured environments by matching agents’ heading angle to the united direction. A variation of Hungarian algorithm is implemented with a moving virtual terminal to assign each agent to the formation position. In the second phase of navigation, the moving mesh methods are applied for holding the formation by defining the outer agents’ position for the boundary condition. The significance of the moving mesh methods is a scalability and a inherent intercollision avoidance. Due to the profound difference between the longitudinal and lateral-directional motion of a fixed-wing aircraft, a multi-scale moving point guidance algorithm has been designed to create the separate virtual reference points in the longitudinal and lateral-direction planes for the first time. This method has been shown to greatly reduce tracking oscillations and improve the overall tracking quality and coherency of the formation. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to ensure the stability and robustness of implementing proposed algorithms through an essentially exhaustive search. A broad range of random initial conditions have been used to validate the effectiveness of guidance, navigation, and control algorithms. Another unique contribution of this work is the validation and verification of proposed algorithms by the hardware-in-the-loop testbed and the numerous flight tests. The hardware-in-the-loop testbed is designed to test the avionics and communication before the flight test by simulating onboard 6-degrees of freedom nonlinear equations of motion. Over one hundred flight tests have been conducted using three distinct aircraft platforms between 2016 and 2018 to validate the fundamental building blocks of this architecture. In summary, this dissertation provides a conceptual and practical foundation for guidance, navigation, and control of multi-agent cooperative/collaborative UASs by unique approaches.","Kim, A.

2869,The role of affective and motivational factors in designing personalized learning environments,"In this paper, guidelines for designing virtual change agents (VCAs) are proposed to support students' affective and motivational needs in order to promote personalized learning in online remedial mathematics courses. Automated, dynamic, and personalized support is emphasized in the guidelines through maximizing interactions between VCAs and individual students. The strategies that VCAs convey throughout the interactions are constructed to support emotion regulation and motivation based on theories and prior research on emotions and motivation. The availability and customizability of VCAs enable the strategies to be implemented in real-time and customized for individual students. Implications of the design guidelines for personalized, online learning contexts are discussed and future research directions are recommended as well.","Kim, C.",0,10.1007/s11423-012-9253-6,1043

2874,,"<SPAN style=""LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">This thesis combines multi-agent knowledge sharing with ensemble methods to produce a new style of learning system for open environments. When we coordinate smart objects properly, we can produce a form of collective intelligence from their collaboration. Traditional ensemble methods show better classification performance, while agent-based systems might not guarantee their performance for classification. Traditional ensemble methods work as closed and centralised systems, while agent-based systems are natural vehicles for classifiers in an open context. We designed an open and social ensemble learning architecture, named J-model, to merge the conflicting benefits of the two research domains. The J-model architecture is based on a service choreography approach for coordinating classifiers. Coordination protocols are defined by interaction models that describe how classifiers will interact with one another in a peer-to-peer manner. The peer ranking algorithm recommends more appropriate classifiers to participate in an interaction model to boost the success rate of results of their interactions. Coordinated participant classifiers who are recommended by the peer ranking algorithm become an ensemble classifier within J-model.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><SPAN style=""LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"">We evaluated J-model’s classification performance with 13 UCI machine learning benchmark data sets and a virtual screening problem as a realistic classification problem. J-model showed better performance of accuracy, for 9 benchmark sets out of 13 data sets, than 8 other representative traditional ensemble methods. J-model gave better results of specificity for 7 benchmark sets. In the virtual screening problem, J-model gave better results for 12 out of 16 bioassays than already published results. We defined different interaction models for each specific classification task and the peer ranking algorithm was used across all the interaction models. Our research contributions to knowledge are as follows. First, we showed that service choreography can be an effective ensemble coordination method for classifiers in an open context. Second, we used interaction models that implement task specific coordinations of classifiers to solve a variety of representative classification problems. Third, we designed the peer ranking algorithm which is generally and independently applicable to the task of recommending appropriate member classifiers from a classifier pool based on an open pool of interaction models and classifiers.","Kim, Jinhan",0,,1046
2875,,"We speak to express ourselves. Sometimes words can capture what we mean; sometimes we mean more than can be said. This is where our visible gestures—those dynamic oscillations of our gaze, face, head, hand, arms and bodies—help. Not only do these co-verbal visual signals help express our intentions, attitudes and emotion, they also help us engage with our conversational partners to get our message across. Understanding how and when a message is supplemented, shaped and changed by auditory and visual signals is crucial for a science ultimately interesting in the correct interpretation of transmitted meaning. This special issue highlights research articles that explore co-verbal and nonverbal signals, a key topic in speech communication since these are crucial ingredients in the interpretation of meaning. That is, the meaning of speech is calibrated, augmented and even changed by co-verbal/speech behaviours and gestures including the talker's facial expression, eye-contact, gaze-direction, arm movements, hand gestures, body motion and orientation, posture, proximity, physical contact, and so on. Understanding expressive signals is a vital step for developing machines that can properly decipher intention and engage as social agents. The special issue is divided into three parts: Auditory-visual speech perception; Characterization and perception of auditory-visual prosody; Computer-generated auditory-visual speech.

2878,Caregiving role in human-robot interaction: A study of the mediating effects of perceived benefit and social presence,This study investigates whether assigning a caregiving role to a robot or to its human interactant has psychological effects on the quality of human-robot interaction (HRI). College students interacted with a social robot in a between-subjects experiment (N = 60) with two manipulated conditions: one where the robot played the role of an ophthalmologist (with participants serving as patients) and one where participants played the role of the ophthalmologist (with the robot serving as the patient). Results suggest that being a recipient of caregiving acts leads users to form more positive perceptions of the robot than being an ostensible caregiver to the robot. Results also indicate that perceived benefit of being in a relationship with the robot mediates the effects of the caregiving role on relationship satisfaction with-and trust towards the robot while feelings of social presence mediate the effects on humanlike-ness and intelligence of the robot. These findings demonstrate the applicability of the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm to the context of HRI. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"Kim, K.

2881,,"Teachers are expected to act ethically and provide moral role models in performing their duties, even though teacher education has often relegated the cultivation of teachers' ethical awareness and moral development to the margins. When it is addressed, the main theoretical assumptions have relied heavily on the cognitivist developmental theories of Piaget and Kohlberg. A major pedagogical problem in adopting these theories of moral reasoning is that they may not help teachers to act as moral agents in real-life classrooms. This paper argues that one underlying difficulty is the insufficient attention given to the role of emotion in moral reasoning, even though it is increasingly accepted that rationality is laced with emotions and, moreover, emotions are crucial in brain functioning. This paper presents recent empirical findings, viewing them through the lens of dynamic systems theory, and discusses how they may help to inform and strengthen the cultivation of teachers' moral/ethical literacy in teacher education.","Kim, Minkang",0,,1049
2882,HoloBox: Augmented Visualization and Presentation with Spatially Integrated Presenter,"While visualization alone can play a meaningful role, visualized images today often fail to invoke active engagement from the audience. In numerous cases, a human presenter's interactive involvement can drastically enhance the engagement with visualization. In this paper, we propose and further develop a novel concept called augmented presentation, in which a human presenter occupies the same physical space as the visualization, thereby presenting and interacting with the visualized information seamlessly. We focus mainly on investigating the potential of the presenter by referring to the interaction framework for visualization and the proposed presenter's roles. Depending on the type of interaction and level of engagement, the presenter's role may vary from a narrator to an augmenter who may be regarded as part of the visualization. Further developing the idea of augmented presentation, we designed and implemented a presentation system named HoloBox. Then, we conducted two user studies to investigate the possibilities of HoloBox as a new presentation channel. The results suggest that our new form of augmented presentation has the potential to enhance the quality of presentations and enrich the audience experience with regard to visualization. In terms of the presenter, five out of six participants chose HoloBox as their preferred presentation method despite the extra effort required to make a presentation. We believe that our augmented presentation can support new forms of visualization and information delivery.","Kim, M.",0,10.1093/iwc/iwy007,1050

A ranking system has been developed that utilizes ranked perspectives to map Islamic organizations on a set of socio-cultural, political and behavioral scales based on their web site corpus. Simultaneously, a gold standard ranking of these organizations was created through domain experts and compute expert-to-expert agreements and present experimental results comparing the performance of the QUIC based scaling system to another baseline method for organizations. The QUIC based algorithm not only outperforms the baseline methods, but it is also the only system that consistently performs at area expert-level accuracies for all scales. Also, a multi-scale ideological model has been developed and it investigates the correlates of Islamic extremism in Indonesia, Nigeria and UK. This analysis demonstrate that violence does not correlate strongly with broad Muslim theological or sectarian orientations; it shows that religious diversity intolerance is the only consistent and statistically significant ideological correlate of Islamic extremism in these countries, alongside desire for political change in UK and Indonesia, and social change in Nigeria.

2885,,"In recent years, multi-agent traffic simulation has been widely used to accurately evaluate the performance of a road network considering individual and dynamic movements of vehicles under a virtual roadway environment. Given initial traffic demands and road conditions, the simulation is executed with multiple iterations and provides users with converged roadway conditions for the performance evaluation. For an accurate traffic simulation model, the driver’s learning behavior is one of the major components to be concerned, as it affects road conditions (e.g., traffic flows) at each iteration as well as performance (e.g., accuracy and computational efficiency) of the traffic simulation. The goal of this study is to propose a realistic learning behavior model of drivers concerning their uncertain perception and interactions with other drivers. The proposed learning model is based on the Extended Belief-Desire-Intention (E-BDI) framework and two major decisions arising in the field of transportation (i.e., route planning and decision-making at an intersection). More specifically, the learning behavior is modeled via a dynamic evolution of a Bayesian network (BN) structure. The proposed dynamic learning approach considers three underlying assumptions: 1) the limited memory of a driver, 2) learning with incomplete observations on the road conditions, and 3) non-stationary road conditions. Thus, the dynamic learning approach allows driver agents to understand real-time road conditions and estimate future road conditions based on their past knowledge. In addition, interaction behaviors are also incorporated in the E-BDI framework to address influences of interactions on the driver’s learning behavior. In this dissertation work, five major human interactions adopted from a social science literature are considered: 1) accommodation, 2) collaboration, 3) compromise, 4) avoidance, and 5) competition. The first three interaction types help to mimic information exchange behaviors between drivers (e.g., finding a route using a navigation system) while the last two interaction types are relevant with behaviors involving non-information exchange behaviors (e.g., finding a route based on a driver’s own experiences). To calibrate the proposed learning behavior model and evaluate its performance in terms of inference accuracy and computational efficiency, drivers’ decision data at intersections are collected via a human-in-the-loop experiment involving a driving simulator. Moreover, the proposed model is used to test and demonstrate the impact of five interactions on drivers’ learning behavior under an en route planning scenario with real traffic data of Albany, New York, and Phoenix, Arizona. In this dissertation work, two major traffic simulation platforms, AnyLogic® and DynusT®, are used for the demonstration purposes. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model is effective in modeling realistic learning behaviors of drivers in conduction with interactions with other drivers.","Kim, Sojung",0,,1052
2886,Anthropomorphized Helpers Undermine Autonomy and Enjoyment in Computer Games,"Although digital assistants with humanlike features have become prevalent in computer games, few marketing studies have demonstrated the psychological mechanisms underlying consumers' reactions to digital assistants and their subsequent influence on consumers' game enjoyment. To fill this gap, the current study examined the effect of anthropomorphic representations of computerized helpers in computer games on game enjoyment. In the current research, consumers enjoyed a computer game less when they received assistance from a computerized helper imbued with humanlike features than from a helper construed as a mindless entity. We offer a novel mechanism that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper can undermine individuals' perceived autonomy during a computer game. Across six experiments, we show that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper reduced game enjoyment across three different games. By measuring participants' perceived autonomy (study 1) and employing moderators such as importance of autonomy (studies 2, 3, and 4), we also provide evidence that the reduced feeling of autonomy serves as the mechanism underlying the backfiring effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of anthropomorphism on game enjoyment can be extended to other game-related outcomes, such as individuals' motivation to persist in the game (studies 4 and 5).","Kim, S.",0,10.1093/jcr/ucw016,1053

As these robots are designed to look and behave like humans, consumers attribute human traits to thema phenomenon known as the Eliza Effect. In four experiments, we show that the anthropomorphism of a consumer robot increases psychological warmth but decreases attitudes, due to uncanniness. Competence judgments are much less affected and not subject to a decrease in attitudes. The current research contributes to research on artificial intelligence, anthropomorphism, and the uncanny valley phenomenon. We suggest to managers that they need to make sure that the appearances and behaviors of robots are not too human-like to avoid negative attitudes toward robots. Moreover, managers and researchers should collaborate to determine the optimal level of anthropomorphism.","Kim, S. Y.",0,10.1007/s11002-019-09485-9,1054
2892,"A framework for evaluating user involvement methods in architectural, engineering, and construction projects","Architects can hardly evaluate and compare different user involvement methods and choose appropriate ones for their projects unless they have a framework that connects theoretical concepts of user involvement with practical methods. This paper seeks to develop such a framework that satisfies the following four characteristics: (1) architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) project context; (2) direct mapping of the methods; (3) including virtual users as computational agents; and (4) the architect's perspective. This paper then reviews seven user involvement methods that are used in practice and classifies them using the framework. As a result, two challenges of existing methods are discovered under this framework: most methods in practice involve users indirectly, and the construction phase still lacks formalized user involvement methods. Thus, the use of virtual design and construction is proposed to address such challenges. This research contributes a framework that connects theories of user involvement with the practical methods to AEC projects.","Kim, T. W.",0,10.1080/00038628.2015.1008397,1055

The study used an explanatory mixed methods research design. First, a classroom-based experiment was conducted with one hundred twenty 9th graders learning introductory algebra (53% male and 47% female; 51% Caucasian and 49% Latino). The results revealed that learner gender was a significant factor in the learners' evaluations of their agent (eta(2) = .07), the learners' task-specific attitudes (eta(2) = .05), and their task-specific self-efficacy (eta(2) = .06). In-depth interviews were then conducted with 22 students selected from the experiment participants. The interviews revealed that Latina and Caucasian females built a different type of relationship with their agent and reported more positive learning experiences as compared with Caucasian males. The females' favorable view of the agent-based learning was largely influenced by their everyday classroom experiences, implying that students' learning experience in real and virtual spaces was interconnected.","Kim, Y.",1,10.1037/a0031027,1058
2900,How social distance shapes human-robot interaction,"This paper investigates how social distance can serve as a lens through which we can understand human-robot relationships and develop guidelines for robot design. In two studies, we examine the effects of distance based on physical proximity (proxemic distance), organizational status (power distance), and task structure (task distance) on people's experiences with and perceptions of a humanlike robot. In Study 1, participants (n=32) played a card-matching game with a humanlike robot. We manipulated the power distance (supervisor vs. subordinate) and proxemic distance (close vs. distant) between participants and the robot. Participants who interacted with the supervisor robot reported a more positive user experience when the robot was close than when the robot was distant, while interactions with the subordinate robot resulted in a more positive experience when the robot was distant than when the robot was close. In Study 2, participants (n=32) played the game in two different task distances (cooperation vs. competition) and proxemic distances (close vs. distant). Participants who cooperated with the robot reported a more positive experience when the robot was distant than when it was close. In contrast, competing with the robot resulted in a more positive experience when it was close than when the robot was distant. The findings from the two studies highlight the importance of consistency between the status and proxemic behaviors of the robot and of task interdependency in fostering cooperation between the robot and its users. This work also demonstrates how social distance may guide efforts toward a better understanding of human-robot interaction and the development of effective design guidelines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2902,Anthropomorphism of computers: Is it mindful or mindless?,"In analyzing the human tendency to treat computers as social actors (CASA), researchers tend to rule out the anthropomorphism explanation because anthropomorphism is understood to be ""a sincere, conscious belief"" that computers are human and/or deserving of human attributions. But, does anthropomorphism have to be necessarily mindful? Could it not also be a mindless tendency, especially given that most of us have somewhat long associations with our computers and have built human-like bonds with them? We examined these questions empirically by investigating whether the user tendency to treat computers as human beings is conscious (mindful) or non-conscious (mindless). We manipulated two variables (presence/absence of human-like agent and the low/high interactivity) on a health website and experimentally investigated whether they serve as anthropomorphic cues to trigger mindful attributions of human-ness to the website or mindless evaluations of the site in human terms. We found evidence for mindless anthropomorphism, with implications for user judgments of credibility of information on the site. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study explored if an embodied agent could be used to help alleviate student anxiety in classrooms. To examine this potential, agent-guided algebra lessons were developed, in which an animated agent was equipped with prescriptive instructional guidance and anxiety treating messages. The lessons were deployed in regular mathematics classrooms, one lesson per day over a week, with 138 boys and girls in the 9th grade in the United States. After taking the weeklong agent-based lessons, students decreased in their mathematics anxiety (p = .042) and increased in mathematics learning (p = .001), regardless of the presence or absence of the agents' anxiety messages. The presence of the agents' messages only seemed to make gea difference for high-anxiety students.

2907,,"The entertainment industry is a highly competitive and risky business with only few successes. The ways in which we experience music, movies, games, books, and television in our lives have changed significantly in the past few decades, depending more on people's experiences. As these mainstream forms of entertainment are experience goods, it is hard to measure the value and fit of the product before trial. Thus, it is important for the entertainment industry to effectively engage and captivate the target audience by seizing their positions and by anticipating the consumer needs ahead of time. This demand-side challenge is coupled with challenges on the monetization side; specific pricing strategies may encourage consumers to engage the product early, reinforcing social dynamics that lead to eventual adoption by many. This dissertation consists of two essays that explore these commonly found challenges in the entertainment business. The first essay is focused on understanding the social dynamics underlying the blockbuster phenomenon. The second essay concerns the widely used ""freemium"" pricing strategy by electronic content providers and digital publishers. The first essay ties the social dynamics of consumers to the blockbuster phenomenon commonly found in the entertainment industry. The market for the entertainment industry is dominated by limited number of blockbusters capturing disproportionately large shares of sales and revenues (also known as the `Murphy's law'). These blockbusters get revealed relatively early but are also extremely hard to predict before launch. Many have tried to explain sales and revenues with industry characteristics, such as the presence of stars, budget, and reviews and ratings; however, only few have addressed the role of social dynamics in the entertainment business. We specifically study the effect of social influence on different stages of the decision making process—the consideration set formation stage and the choice stage—and relate it to the empirical findings on blockbusters. Specifically, we propose two agent-based social observing models depending on when consumers learn about previously made choices during the decision making process. We find that social influence in the choice stage leads to a distribution of market shares that is highly skewed with a long, heavy tail. Also, success and failures are revealed early in the tenure only when social influence is present. However, the underlying behavior of consumers depend highly on when the social influence is present during the decision making process, the type of the information about others' choices. and the number of alternatives in the market. The second essay studies the optimal design of a freemium pricing strategy. Many web-enabled services (e.g., Hulu), digital games (e.g., Angry Birds), and applications for tablet computers and smartphones (e.g., Merrian-Webster dictionary) are available in both free and premium versions. Under the freemium model, a firm provides some portion of the product for free, but a premium is charged for advanced features, functionality, or virtual goods. We specifically examine the optimal quality in the free version, the amount of advertising to be shown in the free and paid version, and the price to charge for the paid version when a firm adopts a freemium pricing strategy. We consider a two-stage consumer adoption model in which consumers first try the free version and then decide whether to buy the paid version. Adoption depends on the quality and the rate of advertising. The firm earns advertising revenue from the free and/or paid versions, which depends on the duration of usage of the game, and sales revenue from the premium version. The analytical results suggest that profit maximization does not maximize the switching rate from the free to premium versions. It is optimal to give more for free than is needed to maximize the switching rate for greater demand and advertising revenue. The optimal price is higher when only the free version has advertisements compared to whe","Kim, Yena Stephanie",0,,1062
2908,,"Many multi-agent applications may involve a notion of spatial coherence. For instance, simulations of virtual agents often need to model a coherent group or crowd. Alternatively, robots may prefer to stay within a pre-specified communication range. This work proposes an extension of a decentralized, reactive collision avoidance framework, which defines obstacles in the velocity space, known as Velocity Obstacles (VOs), for coherent groups of agents. The extension, referred to in this work as a Loss of Communication Obstacle (LOCO), aims to maintain proximity among agents by imposing constraints in the velocity space and restricting the set of feasible controls. If the introduction of LOCOs results in a problem that is too restrictive, then the proximity constraints are relaxed in order to maintain collision avoidance. A weighted velocity selection scheme is utilized in order to steer agents towards their goals, as well as agents which are farther away and thus might be violating proximity constraints. The approach is fast and integrates nicely with the Velocity Obstacle framework. It is shown to yield improved coherence for groups of robots connected through an input constraint graph, while moving with constant velocity. The approach is evaluated for collisions, computational cost and proximity constraint maintenance through a series of simulated environments, which have single and multiple team variations. The experiments show that improved coherence is achieved while maintaining collision avoidance, at a small computational cost and path quality degradation. In order to experimentally validate new algorithms, such as the LOCO approach, having a software infrastructure capable of running a plethora of algorithms on many agents is needed. When moving from virtual agents to robotic systems, these algorithms take the form of a controller. Composing various controllers together to create a diverse testbed environment is also essential for the development process of new algorithms. Thus, this work additionally describes a software infrastructure for developing controllers and planners for robotic systems, referred to here as PRACSYS . At the core of the software is the abstraction of a dynamical system, which, given a control, propagates its state forward in time. The platform simplifies the development of new controllers and planners and provides an extensible framework that allows complex interactions between one or many controllers, as well as motion planners. For instance, it is possible to compose many control layers over a physical system, to define multi-agent controllers that operate over many systems, to easily switch between different underlying controllers, and plan over controllers to achieve feedback-based planning. Such capabilities are especially useful for the control of hybrid and cyber-physical systems, which are important in many applications.

2909,"Auditory traits of ""own voice""","People perceive their recorded voice differently from their actively spoken voice. The uncanny valley theory proposes that as an object approaches humanlike characteristics, there is an increase in the sense of familiarity; however, eventually a point is reached where the object becomes strangely similar and makes us feel uneasy. The feeling of discomfort experienced when people hear their recorded voice may correspond to the floor of the proposed uncanny valley. To overcome the feeling of eeriness of own-voice recordings, previous studies have suggested equalization of the recorded voice with various types of filters, such as step, bandpass, and low-pass, yet the effectiveness of these filters has not been evaluated. To address this, the aim of experiment 1 was to identify what type of voice recording was the most representative of one's own voice. The voice recordings were presented in five different conditions: unadjusted recorded voice, step filtered voice, bandpass filtered voice, low-pass filtered voice, and a voice for which the participants freely adjusted the parameters. We found large individual differences in the most representative own-voice filter. In order to consider roles of sense of agency, experiment 2 investigated if lip-synching would influence the rating of own voice. The result suggested lip-synching did not affect own voice ratings. In experiment 3, based on the assumption that the voices used in previous experiments corresponded to continuous representations of non-own voice to own voice, the existence of an uncanny valley was examined. Familiarity, eeriness, and the sense of own voice were rated. The result did not support the existence of an uncanny valley. Taken together, the experiments led us to the following conclusions: there is no general filter that can represent own voice for everyone, sense of agency has no effect on own voice rating, and the uncanny valley does not exist for own voice, specifically.","Kimura, M.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0199443,1064
2911,Social influence in a virtual tunnel fire - Influence of conflicting information on evacuation behavior,"Evacuation from a smoke filled tunnel requires quick decision-making and swift action from the tunnel occupants. Technical installations such as emergency signage aim to guide tunnel occupants to the closest emergency exits. However, conflicting information may come from the behavior of other tunnel occupants. We examined if and how conflicting social information may affect evacuation in terms of delayed and/or inadequate evacuation decisions and behaviors. To this end, forty participants were repeatedly situated in a virtual reality smoke filled tunnel with an emergency exit visible to one side of the participants. Four social influence conditions were realized. In the control condition participants were alone in the tunnel, while in the other three experimental conditions a virtual agent (VA) was present. In the no-conflict condition, the VA moved to the emergency exit. In the active conflict condition, the VA moved in the opposite direction of the emergency exit. In the passive conflict condition, the VA stayed passive. Participants were less likely to move to the emergency exit in the conflict conditions compared to the no-conflict condition. Pre-movement and movement times in the passive conflict condition were significantly delayed compared to all other conditions. Participants moved the longest distances in the passive conflict condition. These results support the hypothesis that social influence affects evacuation behavior, especially passive behavior of others can thwart an evacuation to safety.

2916,Social influence on route choice in a virtual reality tunnel fire,"Introduction: Evacuation from tunnel fire emergencies requires quick decision-making and swift action from the tunnel occupants. Social influence (SI) has been identified as an important factor in evacuation. Methods: Two experimental groups were immersed into a virtual road tunnel fire. In the SI group participants saw a virtual agent moving on the shortest route to the nearest emergency exit. In the control group, participants were alone. Destination and exit choices were analyzed using functional analysis and inferential statistics. Results: SI affected route choice during evacuation but not destination choice: There were no group differences regarding destination choice. Participants in the SI group were more likely to choose a route similar to the virtual agent. Participants in the control group were more likely to choose a longer route along the tunnel walls. Discussion: Social influence does not only affect behavior activation but also more subtle choices, such as route choice, during evacuation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2924,"Testing the comparative effects of physical activity advice by humans vs. computers in underserved populations: The COMPASS trial design, methods, and baseline characteristics","While physical inactivity is a key risk factor for a range of chronic diseases and conditions associated with aging, a significant proportion of midlife and older adults remain insufficiently active. This is particularly true for ethnic minority populations such as Latino adults for whom few culturally adapted programs have been developed and tested. The major objective of this 12-month cluster-randomized controlled trial is to test the comparative effectiveness of two linguistically and culturally adapted, community-based physical activity interventions with the potential for broad reach and translation. Ten local community centers serving a sizable number of Latino residents were randomized to receive one of two physical activity interventions. The Virtual Advisor program employs a computer-based embodied conversational agent named ""Carmen"" to deliver interactive, individually tailored physical activity advice and support. A similar intervention program is delivered by trained Peer Advisors. The target population consists of generally healthy, insufficiently active Latino adults ages 50 years and older living within proximity to a designated community center. The major outcomes are changes in walking and other forms of physical activity measured via self-report and accelerometry. Secondary outcomes include physical function and well-being variables. In addition to these outcome analyses, comparative cost analysis of the two programs, potential mediators of intervention success, and baseline moderators of intervention effects will be explored to better determine which subgroups do best with which type of intervention. Here we present the study design and methods, including recruitment strategies and yield as well as study baseline characteristics.","King, A. C.",0,10.1016/j.cct.2017.07.020,1067
2938,,"This thesis will examine three podcasts produced between 2014 and 2019. Using a sociological lens, it discusses how: podcasters’ and guests’ identities are presented, communities are built, and the way that these podcasters are active agents within a religious paradigm in the context of United States. The medium of podcasting is under studied in the field of religion, and sociology more generally outside its efficacy in academia. This thesis serves to fill said literature gap by adapting research previously done on topics such as blogs, video games, and social media sites to fit the medium of podcasts. This thesis shows that there are four ways that podcasters’ present their identity, these are: direct, through question and answer, dissipated, and through narrative. Each type is first discussed as ideal types, then muddied due to not one podcast presenting in a single way. Next, the functions of these virtual communities are shown, specifically through the creation and sharing of specific community knowledge; and the creation of a sense of belonging through inclusive language and the building of a non-hierarchical support system. Next, it discusses two forms of agency, the first is agency through resistance, the second is agency through piety. The first agency framework used is the commonly accepted framework within feminist scholarship. The second framework stemmed from the work of Saba Mahmood’s (2005) canonical work on the Egyptian mosque movement. These two frameworks are discussed through a triple-faceted dynamic that consists of a discourse that is situated in the personal experiences of the podcasters’ and hermeneutical interpretation, which is reflected on and interpreted by the virtual community, that in turn, shapes the way these women view the world and their relationship with the sacred text.","King, Matthew Jason",0,,1068

2941,,"This thesis is an analysis of the social, political and historical inter-relationships between moving image technologies, constructions of gender and sexuality, and theories of science and technology. Presented as a series of case-studies on film, video, medical imaging and computer technology in the work of five women artists, this thesis looks at the way in which artistic practice overturns traditional theories of technology as purely ‘instrumental’, theories of the subject in which identity is tied to the body, and the assumption that women do not access technology in a sophisticated way. It considers the various ways in which women artists have engaged with, and subverted, the explicit body in representation through deploying new moving image technologies at the historical moment of their widespread distribution across domestic, artistic, pornographic and medical spheres. It ends by asking what is the political potential in challenging the anthropomorphic and destabilizing the figurative through abstraction? Beginning with an investigation into the way in which Carolee Schneemann uses the material properties of film to establish a haptic encounter, in which female and feline bodies are caught up in a sexual economy of touch (pet/petting), this thesis then looks at the work of Kate Craig and the mutual expansion of pornography and home-video technology, questioning the emergence of the ‘amateur’ in relation to theories of power and gender; offers a technological and philosophical modeling of medical imaging technology (taking endoscopy in the work of Mona Hatoum as a case study); and re-evaluates the use of binary in information systems beyond a limiting analogy with ‘Western binaries’ through the work of Nell Tenhaaf. Using the languages of art history together with science & technology studies, medical discourse and feminism, this research theorises gender, technology and medicine as systems of representation that are all deeply inter-connected.","Kinsey, C.

2942,Comparison of SSVEP BCI and Eye Tracking for Controlling a Humanoid Robot in a Social Environment,"Recent advances in humanoid robot technologies have made it possible to inhabit a humanlike form located at a remote place. This allows the participant to interact with others in that space and experience the illusion that the participant is actually present in the remote space. Moreover, with these humanlike forms, it may be possible to induce a full-body ownership illusion, where the robot body is perceived to be one's own. We show that it is possible to induce the full-body ownership illusion over a remote robotic body with a highly robotic appearance. Additionally, our results indicate that even with nonmanual control of a remote robotic body, it is possible to induce feelings of agency and illusions of body ownership. Two established control methods, an SSVEP-based BCI and eye tracking, were tested as a means of controlling the robot's gesturing. Our experience and the results indicate that both methods are tractable for immersive control of a humanoid robot in a social telepresence setting.","Kishore, S.",0,10.1162/PRES_a_00192,1072

We present three narratives in which multiple pre-kindergarten agents (students, teachers, and administrators) used their power within the Writer's Workshop to a) ensure writing was a daily practice in pre-kindergarten classrooms, b) to write about stories often censored in early childhood classrooms, and c) claim new writing identities. The two classrooms we describe used similar pedagogical structures to teach writing following the decades-old traditions of Writer's Workshop; however, we found that what happened within those traditionsamong children, teachers, and school administratorstransformed contemporary practices of literacy education. All three stories share a common thread; when positioned within the structure of a Writer's Workshop, young authors and their teachers claim power and, ultimately, assert their voices.","Kissel, B.

2953,,"Assigning a group of mobile agents to perform certain tasks defined by their locations and priorities is a major research problem in optimization in general and particularly in multi-robot systems. This problem can be formulated as variants of the well-known Multiple-Depots, Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (MDMTSP), in which the agents start their travel from an initial location (a depot), and the goal is to obtain a solution that either minimizes the total of all tour lengths (the classical case), minimizes the length of the longest tour (the min-max case), or maximizes a profit of performing tasks taking into account the cost of travel to these tasks (the profitable case). It should be noted that while these problems are variants of the same problem, they are usually solved by specialized algorithms tailored for each specific variant. In this work, agents interact in a virtual economic market that can be used to solve all three variants of the problem with minor changes to the algorithm. The motivation behind using a market-based approach is mostly because of the ability of economic markets to get good results, in a short span of time, for large-scale problems, and in complex and dynamic situations. The market-based solution developed in this work demonstrates near-optimal results for all three variants, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, each tailored for a specific variant. Moreover, the ability to obtain near-optimal results in the face of changes is demonstrated in scenarios that include the appearance and disappearance of tasks and the addition and removal of agents. The approach is further enhanced by introducing hierarchies into the market, where tasks are geographically clustered to expedite the search in large problems. Finally, the market-based approach is also enhanced using fuzzy logic to reduce the sensitivity of the cost of travel to tasks, whose location is uncertain. This work makes several new contributions to the field. First, while market-based solutions to the MTSP have been proposed in the past, this approach is the first one to include hierarchical markets and presents better and faster results with fewer constraints than previous approaches. Second, this is the first algorithm that is both as near-optimal as algorithms tailored for each specific MTSP variant and that can handle all three variants of the MDMTSP like other meta-heuristic algorithms. In particular, this solution obtains results that are very close, in terms of optimality, to the results obtained by linear programming for the classical case and the MTSP with constant profits case, but at a significantly reduced calculation time. For the min-max case, the current solution improves over the best known solution in terms of cost, by as much as 75%, albeit at a longer runtime. Finally, this solution is scalable to large problem instances and can be used as an online algorithm that handles changes in the scenario during runtime. As a whole, this novel approach is everything required from an algorithm for assigning mobile agents to tasks: near-optimal, versatile, robust to scenario changes, and fast.","Kivelevitch, Elad",0,,1075
2954,Spontaneous social distancing in response to a simulated epidemic: a virtual experiment,"Background: Studies of social distancing during epidemics have found that the strength of the response can have a decisive impact on the outcome. In previous work we developed a model of social distancing driven by individuals' risk attitude, a parameter which determines the extent to which social contacts are reduced in response to a given infection level. We showed by simulation that a strong response, driven by a highly cautious risk attitude, can quickly suppress an epidemic. However, a moderately cautious risk attitude gives weak control and, by prolonging the epidemic without reducing its impact, may yield a worse outcome than doing nothing. In real societies, social distancing may arise spontaneously from individual choices rather than being imposed centrally. There is little data available about this as opportunistic data collection during epidemics is difficult. Our study uses a simulated epidemic in a computer game setting to measure the social distancing response. Methods: Two hundred thirty participants played a computer game simulating an epidemic on a spatial network. The player controls one individual in a population of 2500 (with others controlled by computer) and decides how many others to contact each day. To mimic real-world trade-offs, the player is motivated to make contact by being rewarded with points, while simultaneously being deterred by the threat of infection. Participants completed a questionnaire regarding psychological measures of health protection motivation. Finally, simulations were used to compare the experimentally-observed response to epidemics with no response. Results: Participants reduced contacts in response to infection in a manner consistent with our model of social distancing. The experimentally observed response was too weak to halt epidemics quickly, resulting in a somewhat reduced attack rate and a substantially reduced peak attack rate, but longer duration and fewer social contacts, compared to no response. Little correlation was observed between participants' risk attitudes and the psychological measures. Conclusions: Our cognitive model of social distancing matches responses to a simulated epidemic. If these responses indicate real world behaviour, spontaneous social distancing can be expected to reduce peak attack rates. However, additional measures are needed if it is important to stop an epidemic quickly.","Kleczkowski, A.",0,10.1186/s12889-015-2336-7,1076
2959,Aristotle's Concept of Chance as an Investigative Tool in Gersonides' Wars of the Lord,"The article focuses on Gersonides' use of Aristotle's concept of chance (Physics II.4-6) as an investigative tool in his inquiries in the Wars of the Lord. Four examples are studied: Divine providence (Wars IV), the agent that generates animate substances (Wars V.3), the agent of miracles (Wars VI. 2.10), and the creation of the world (Wars VI.1). Gersonides' inquiries involve various applications of the passages on chance in Physics II. In the discussions of providence and of the agent that generates animate substances, Gersonides invokes the criterion of rarity. By negating the possibility that they are generated by chance he shows that the phenomena or events in question are produced by a purposeful efficient cause. In his expositions of the first criterion for distinguishing between the generated and ungenerated and of the creation of the heavens he employs the criterion of rarity to rebut objections to his thesis. In the discussion of the agent of miracles, he applies the distinction between determinate and indeterminate causes: a miracle has a determinate cause and thus cannot be a matter of chance. In his discussion of the generation of the heavenly bodies, Gersonides draws on Aristotle's refutation (Physics II.4) of Democritus's assertion that the heavens were generated ""spontaneously,"" whereas animals and plants do not come into existence by chance. He demonstrates, on the basis of their functionality, that the heavens do have an efficient cause.","Klein-Braslavy, S.",0,,1077
2960,,"Cognitive load reduction strategies traditionally seek to reduce the amount of extraneous mental effort required of the learner. Researchers, through effective instructional design, seek to eliminate load-causing agents that are extraneous to the learning topic at hand. However, cognitive load theory research has now shifted to also include the exploration of strategies that seek to reduce the inherent complexities of the target topic itself. The current study seeks to apply two such intrinsic cognitive load reduction strategies—personalization and contextualization. Previous research suggests that cognitive load can be reduced by personalizing the learning environment, which serves to meet the interests of each learner as well as to provide a familiar environment, or prior knowledge script, for the learner. By utilizing instructional materials for which learners already have an established script, personalized materials are able to reduce the number of novel elements that must be individually processed by the learner, and by so doing, effectively reduce cognitive load. Research also suggests that personalized learning environments can also be more intrinsically motivating for learners, a tenant that is again assessed in the current study. Intrinsic cognitive load reduction research likewise suggests that new topics be presented serially, and in isolation from confounding authentic contexts when possible, in order to reduce the number of elements that must be simultaneously processed that might otherwise outstrip learners’ available cognitive resources. Contrarily, second language acquisition research suggests that new target lexical items are best learned through inferring a new term’s meaning through a rich authentic context. Studies contend that learners are able to map a lexicon’s form to its meaning most effectively when new terms are interpreted through highly contextualized imbedded learning environments. The current study sought to determine how a multimedia tutorial’s level of personalization and contextualization could be manipulated to improve foreign language lexical learning, reduce cognitive load, and improve motivation for learning. A sample population of beginning college Spanish language learners (n = 128) was subjected to four different versions of a multimedia tutorial (i.e., personalized-contextualized, personalized-decontextualized, generic-contextualized, and generic-decontextualized). Following the tutorial, learners were tested for their ability to retain the novel content and transfer this content to new environments. Additionally, learners were asked to rank their motivation for learning the new topic, and the cognitive load endured during the learning and testing processes. Achievement results showed a significant interaction effect for personalization and contextualization. When learners were asked to solve a complex problem utilizing the new target lexical terms, personalized-contextualized learners and generic-decontextualized learners were more effective than their contemporaries. A significant interaction effect was also demonstrated for cognitive load, which suggested that personalized-contextualized and generic-decontextualized learners suffered less cognitive load when completing a complex task than other learners. Finally, results showed a positive effect for motivation demonstrated by learners who were exposed to a personalized learning environment as opposed to a generic learning environment.","Kleinman, Curtis",1,,1078
2961,,"Abstract: Despite consensus that successful change management depends on how change is communicated to employees, the dynamic communication process between change agents and recipients remains largely unexplored. We discuss how change language can capture recipients' resistance to and readiness for change, in terms of change versus sustain talk, and adopt a coding instrument from clinical psychology (Motivational Interviewing Skill Code, MISC). We explore whether autonomy-restrictive change agent behaviours may contribute to resistance to change. In a preliminary study, we demonstrate the applicability of the MISC for studying ambivalence in change-related interactions. Next, in a quantitative study of 28 dyadic interactions from a student sample, we examine how change agent behaviours elicit recipients' resistance during the interaction flow, using lag sequential analysis. Our findings show that autonomy-restrictive agent behaviours evoke sustain talk. Recipients' sustain talk in turn evokes autonomy-restrictive agent behaviour. We discuss implications for conceptualizing resistance to change as a dynamically emerging conversational construct and point out practical implications for change agents.

2964,Interactionism in the age of ubiquitous telecommunication,"The following paper aims to engage recent reconsiderations of Gibson's theory of affordances and Goffman's concept of copresence in the context of the material turn - especially in the form expressed by Bruno Latour's actor-network theory. The paper's central claim is that microsociology cannot avoid engaging material turn theory. It will be argued that contemporary attempts to reconceptualize classical microsociological frameworks set out on a path that invariably leads to problems investigated by thinkers like Latour: as communication technology advances, the importance of mediated interaction grows, prompting attempts to update interactionism for non-face-to-face interactions such as teleconferencing, social networks and virtual reality. These new social situations are then made sense of in terms of the way these technologies have a transformative effect on interaction. This effect be it a modifier of the temporal structure of the interaction, or of the interactional capacity of the agents is argued to always lead back to a central question of the material turn: if technology is a static transformational effect, where is its agency? Or, conversely: if a technological object's effect is uniform across all external factors, how is that not a form of technological determinism? The paper investigates whether attempts to avoid determinism manage to keep Latourian metaphysics at bay. The paper concludes by suggesting that contemporary social theory must work towards a middle way that does not gloss over important contributions of material turn theorists whilst also not ignoring the importance of considering human political responsibility.","Klowait, N.

2965,When Cars Hit Trucks and Girls Hug Boys: The Effect of Animacy on Word Order in Gestural Language Creation,"A well-known typological observation is the dominance of subject-initial word orders, SOV and SVO, across the world's languages. Recent findings from gestural language creation paradigms offer possible explanations for the prevalence of SOV. When asked to gesture transitive events with an animate agent and inanimate patient, gesturers tend to produce SOV order, regardless of their native language biases. Interestingly, when the patient is animate, gesturers shift away from SOV to use of other orders, like SVO and OSV. Two competing hypotheses have been proposed for this switch: the noisy channel account (Gibson etal., 2013) and the role conflict account (Hall, Mayberry, & Ferreira, 2013). We set out to distinguish between these two hypotheses, disentangling event reversibility and patient animacy, by looking at gestural sequences for events with two inanimate participants (inanimate-inanimate, reversible). We replicated the previous findings of a preference for SOV order when describing animate-inanimate, irreversible events as well as a decrease in the use of SOV when presented with animate-animate, reversible events. Accompanying the drop in SOV, in a novel condition we observed an increase in the use of SVO and OSV orders when describing events involving two animate entities. In sum, we find that the observed avoidance of SOV order in gestural language creation paradigms when the event includes an animate agent and patient is driven by the animacy of the participants rather than the reversibility of the event. We suggest that findings from gestural creation paradigms are not automatically linkable to spoken language typology.","Kocab, A.",0,10.1111/cogs.12555,1081

Ideally, these skills encompass an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the ways in which a system, such as a Web search engine, functions. In order to investigate youths' conceptions of the Google search engine, a drawing activity was conducted with 26 HackHealth after-school program participants to elicit their mental models of Google. The findings revealed that many participants personified Google and emphasized anthropomorphic elements, computing equipment, and/or connections (such as cables, satellites and antennas) in their drawings. Far fewer participants focused their drawings on the actual Google interface or on computer code. Overall, their drawings suggest a limited understanding of Google and the ways in which it actually works. However, an understanding of youths' conceptions of Google can enable educators to better tailor their digital literacy instruction efforts and can inform search engine developers and search engine interface designers in making the inner workings of the engine more transparent and their output more trustworthy to young users. With a better understanding of how Google works, young users will be better able to construct effective queries, assess search results, and ultimately find relevant and trustworthy information that will be of use to them.","Kodama, C.",0,10.1007/s10791-017-9306-x,1082

In one alternative, the portrait frame rotates whereas the actual portrait stays motionless and fronto-parallel; in the other, we replace the (flat!) portrait with a volumetric object. These variations yield exactly the same optical stimulation in frontal view, but become grossly different in very oblique views. We also let participants sample their momentary awareness through "" gauge object'' settings in static displays.

2978,Evolution of protolinguistic abilities as a by-product of learning to forage in structured environments,"The skills required for the learning and use of language are the focus of extensive research, and their evolutionary origins are widely debated. Using agent-based simulations in a range of virtual environments, we demonstrate that challenges of foraging for food can select for cognitive mechanisms supporting complex, hierarchical, sequential learning, the need for which arises in language acquisition. Building on previous work, where we explored the conditions under which reinforcement learning is out-competed by seldom-reinforced continuous learning that constructs a network model of the environment, we now show that realistic features of the foraging environment can select for two critical advances: (i) chunking of meaningful sequences found in the data, leading to representations composed of units that better fit the prevalent statistical patterns in the environment; and (ii) generalization across units based on their contextual similarity. Importantly, these learning processes, which in our framework evolved for making better foraging decisions, had been earlier shown to reproduce a range of findings in language learning in humans. Thus, our results suggest a possible evolutionary trajectory that may have led from basic learning mechanisms to complex hierarchical sequential learning that can support advanced cognitive abilities of the kind needed for language acquisition.","Kolodny, O.",0,10.1098/rspb.2015.0353,1085

Topic 1: VRACK study and improvement Ankle impairment and lower limb asymmetries in strength and coordination are common symptoms for individuals with selected musculoskeletal and neurological impairments. The virtual reality augmented cycling kit (VRACK) was designed as a compact mechatronics system and a compatible module that can be mounted on most bicycles to convert them to virtual reality (VR) cycles for lower limb and mobility rehabilitation. Novel hardware components with sensors instrument monitor physiological and biomechanical parameters of participants by measuring interaction forces and cardiac activity during cycling in a virtual environment. A kinematics measurement was also added to the system. This modular adaptive system will be attached to a universal stationary bike. A personal computer can be used as an interface for the data acquisition and virtual reality environment. Due to the constrained problem definition, a combination of inertial measurement unit (IMU) and Kalman filtering was recruited to compute the optimal pedal angular displacement during a dynamic cycling exercise. Using a novel benchmarking method accuracy of the IMU-based kinematics measurement was evaluated. Relatively accurate angular measurements were achieved. The enhanced VRACK system can serve as a rehabilitation device to monitor biomechanical and physiological variables during cycling on a stationary bike. Topic 2: Smart Bike The purpose of this project is to create a ""Smart Bike"" that will increase a cyclist's safety by tapping into the rider's visual, hearing and tactile senses. The proposed kit will be equipped with all means for monitoring and providing feedback to the cyclist and will be completely modular and easy to use. Customers' needs and perspective were determined and analyzed through statistics, interviews, and testimonials. The final product will be a detecting and responsive system in the form of a modular kit that includes proximity sensors, laser lights, vibrators, LED lights, Bluetooth module, Arduino microcontroller and a speaker. These components will be battery-powered and will work in unison to produce a novel product that will project a bike lane on the ground, interacting with cyclists, providing information to the cyclists by audit, visual, and haptic feedbacks and increase the awareness of both the cyclist and any nearby motorists. Topic3: iVRACK project and its preliminary design In this study we will develop, a user-tailored home-based intelligent virtual reality cycling rehabilitation kit (iVRACK) to promote health, fitness and mobility in both healthy individuals and those with neuromuscular and cardiopulmonary disorders. The cycling kit is composed of instrumented pedals and handlebars for the purpose of measuring a user's interaction with a stationary exercise bicycle. The novel hardware will be enriched by an `agent' acting as a virtual intelligent physical therapist (ViPT). The system will be developed iteratively integrating the input from users (patients and clinicians), cycling and game experts, engineers from multiple backgrounds and rehabilitation clinician-scientists. The system mainly targets the health improvement of individuals with motor or cardiovascular disorders, but most of the deliverables are expected also to benefit healthy individuals seeking to maintain or improve their fitness; and the essential hardware components will be designed for volume manufacturing and consumer-acceptable pricing.","Kong, Qingchao Andy",0,,1086
2982,,"A new form of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using the Varian RapidArc® treatment system has the potential to improve cancer treatments by delivering comparable dose distributions as TomoTherapy ®1 at a rate that is 5 to 15 times faster 2. The goal of this thesis was to compare the sensitivity of an electronic portal imaging device (EPID), film, and the ArcCheck™ device as tools for evaluation of IMRT treatments. To accomplish this, we introduced systematic errors in MLC leaf position and perform theoretical and experimental evaluations. The comparisons were made by analyzing changes in the gamma function as systematic MLC gap errors were introduced into the patient treatment plan. To study this, dynamic prostate Rapidarc™ plans were developed in Eclipse™ using the RANDO anthropomorphic phantom. After the plans were developed, the files were exported in DICOM-RT (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine — Radiation Therapy) format, and a program was written to modify the MLC leaf position. The files were imported back into Eclipse and recalculated using simulated film, EPID, and ArcCheck phantoms. Before measuring the plans with the devices, each instrument was calibrated and repeatability tests were performed to determine the variation in a single plan. After the delivery of the same plan eight times, film was found to have the largest variation in average gamma of 0.31 ± 0.13. When the setup was not moved in between measurements, the ArcCheck and EPID had significantly smaller variations in average gamma of 0.10 ± 0.04 and 0.07 ± 0.03 respectively. When the setup was moved and realigned in between measurements, the average gamma variation was found to be 0.22 ± 0.10 and 0.11 ± 0.05 for the ArcCheck and EPID. As a result of the higher variation, it was decided that testing should be performed without moving the detector during the course of the measurements. Film, unfortunately, had to be changed in between tests, which resulted in a high level of variation. After calibration, the original five plans and their modified MLC gap variants were tested. A comparison of the Eclipse plans with changes in leaf position to the original plan with 0 mm change in gap shows that the film should have the least sensitivity to changes in average gamma. When looking at the measured results with changes in MLC gap compared to the measured plan with 0 mm change in leaf position, we see that film incorrectly appears to have the highest sensitivity. The cause of this was due to the large variation in average gamma discovered during the repeatability tests. By comparing the repeatability value of 0.31 ± 0.13 to the sensitivity curve generated by Eclipse, it is estimated that film cannot accurately measure changes in systematic gap less than 2 mm. A similar value was found by Yan et al. 15 when using the 2 % / 2 mm γ <= 1 pass rate. The EPID and ArcCheck displayed significantly less variation in average gamma during static tests (0.07 ± 0.03 and 0.10 ± 0.04 respectively). Using the Eclipse calculated graph showing changes in average gamma compared to changes in MLC gap, we find that the EPID and ArcCheck should be able to measure systematic MLC errors of greater than 0.3mm. Previous analysis on MLC motion indicates that most positional errors are below 0.5 mm16 , which makes it difficult to conclude if the repeatability of the device is limited by the detector, or by actual errors in MLC leaf position on the treatment machine. For systematic gap width changes in the range of 0 to 1 mm, the EPID and ArcCheck show similar sensitivity. This thesis has focused on how the average gamma value changes when comparing systematic changes in MLC gap to their original unchanged plan. Although the results are not conclusive, they do indicate that further testing may be warranted. Future testing should involve other treatment sites with steeper dose gradients such as head and neck plans. To ensure clinical relevancy, measurements should also focus on smaller systematic errors based on actual expected","Konieczny, Jeff",0,,1087
2983,Extended Mind and After: Socially Extended Mind and Actor-Network,"The concept of extended mind has been impressively developed over the last 10 years by many philosophers and cognitive scientists. The extended mind thesis (EM) affirms that the mind is not simply ensconced inside the head, but extends to the whole system of brain-body-environment. Recently, some philosophers and psychologists try to adapt the idea of EM to the domain of social cognition research. Mind is socially extended (SEM). However, EM/SEM theory has problems to analyze the interactions among a subject and its surroundings with opposition, antagonism, or conflict; it also tends to think that the environment surrounding the subject is passive or static, and to neglect the power of non-human actants to direct and regulate the human subject. In these points, actor-network theory (ANT) proposed by Latour and Callon is more persuasive, while sharing some important ideas with EM/SEM theory. Actor-network is a hybrid community which is composed of a series of heterogeneous elements, animate and inanimate for a certain period of time. I shall conclude that EM/SEM could be best analyzed as a special case of actor-network. EM/SEM is a system which can be controlled by a human agent alone. In order to understand collective behavior, philosophy and psychology have to study the actor-network in which human individuals are situated.","Kono, T.",0,10.1007/s12124-013-9242-2,1088
2984,,"Using a pure machine learning approach to enable the generation of behavior for agents in serious gaming applications can be problematic, because such applications often require human-like behavior for agents that interact with human players. Such human-like behavior is not guaranteed with e.g. basic reinforcement learning schemes. Cognitive models can be very useful to establish human-like behavior in an agent. However, they require ample domain knowledge that might be difficult to obtain. In this paper, a cognitive model is taken as a basis, and the addition of scenario specific information is for a large part automated by means of machine learning techniques. The performance of the approach of automatically adding scenario specific information is rigorously evaluated using a case study in the domain of fighter air combat. An evolutionary algorithm is proposed for automatically tailoring a cognitive model for situation awareness of fighter pilots. The standard algorithm and several extensions are evaluated with respect to performance in air combat. The results show that it is possible to apply the algorithm to optimize belief networks for cognitive models of intelligent agents (adversarial fighters) in the aforementioned domain, thereby reducing the effort required to elicit knowledge from experts, while retaining the required ‘human-like’ behavior.

2987,Implementation via rights structures,"Implementation of socially desirable alternatives can be thought of as a way to design power distribution in a society such that the equilibrium outcomes coincide with the alternatives chosen at each preference profile. In this paper, we introduce a new institutional framework for implementation, which takes power distribution in a society as its point of departure. We use the notion of a rights structure, introduced by Sertel (2001), to formalize the power distribution in a society. We formulate and characterize implementability via rights structures under different specifications, which require having well-defined convergence dynamics and being consistent with farsighted behavior. We identify how implementation via rights structures is related to implementation via mechanisms. In the presence of at least three agents, we find the class of rights structures, implementability via which is equivalent to Nash and strong Nash implementability. We also introduce a strategic counterpart of implementation via rights structures in terms of deviation-constrained mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The most important questions are those of privacy and data protection, safety and responsibility as well as involvement of vulnerable persons and deception. Consequently, the ethical principles of nonmaleficence, beneficence, autonomy and fairness should be transposed to robotics. Clear answers and solutions are not yet available for every ethical challenge in robotics; however, the development of ethical guidelines for deployment of robots and research in the field of social service robots (SSR) are essential steps in order to embed ethics into dealing with socially assistive robots. This article provides some practical suggestions on this issue from a robotics project.","Kortner, T.",0,10.1007/s00391-016-1066-5,1091
2990,Agency and Gender Influence Older Adults' Presence-Related Experiences in an Interactive Virtual Environment,"While virtual humans are increasingly used to benefit the elderly, considerably little is still known about older adults' virtual experiences. However, due to age-related changes, older adults' perceptions of virtual environments (VEs) may be unique. Hence, our objective was to examine possible gender differences in immersion, flow, and emotional states as well as physical and social presence in elderly males and females interacting either with a computer-controlled agent or a human-controlled avatar. Seventy-eight German-speaking older adults were randomly assigned to an avatar or an agent condition and were exposed to a brief social encounter in a virtual cafe. Results indicate no overall gender differences, but a significant effect of agency on social presence, physical presence, immersion, and flow. Participants in the avatar condition reported higher levels in all measures, except for involvement. Furthermore, significant genderxagency interactions were found, with females showing more social presence, spatial presence, and flow when interacting with a human-controlled avatar and more realism when conversing with an agent. Also, all participants showed significant changes in their affect post exposure. In sum, older adults' virtual experiences seem to follow unique patterns, yet, they do not preclude the elderly from successfully participating in VEs.","Kothgassner, O.

2997,Virtual social support buffers stress response: An experimental comparison of real-life and virtual support prior to a social stressor,"Background and objectives: Face-to-face and text-based social support have been shown to attenuate stress responses in past studies. Yet as social interactions increasingly take place online by means of virtual humans, our objective was to examine whether different forms of social support (virtual vs. real) prior to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) would also decrease stress. Additionally, the effect on subsequent real-life social behaviors (helping and approach) was evaluated while controlling for affective states and social presence. Methods: 56 participants were either supported by an avatar, an agent, a real human or received no support before completing the TSST and two subsequent social behavior tasks (pen task and seating task). Results: Results show no difference in agency regarding social presence. Yet, participants with agent support and no support had significantly higher heart rates during the TSST and reported to be more worried. Also, they were more irritated and showed significantly slower helping reactions (picking up pens). Limitations: A limitation to this study is that only emotional verbal and non-verbal support were provided by a stranger. Different forms of support as well as a different source (i.e., a friend) may have a more pronounced effect on stress buffering. Conclusions: Virtual social support is as effective as face-to-face support in terms of stress buffering, as long as the recipient has the impression that it is provided by another human (via an avatar). This has wide ranging implications not only for health-related application in prevention and treatment but also for further research.","Kothgassner, O. D.",0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.11.003,1093
3006,"Real-life prosocial behavior decreases after being socially excluded by avatars, not agents","The concept of social exclusion has recently gained more attention in the context of online social interactions. However, there is only little data regarding the impact of virtual social exclusion on subsequent real-life social behaviors. Thus, this study set out to examine a virtual version of the common social exclusion scenario, the Cyberball-Paradigm (Williams & Jarvis, 2006), and test for behavioral consequences in a sample of 45 students. Both the virtual characters' agency and the experience of social presence were controlled for. Findings indicate that ostracized individuals show less prosocial behavior in a helping task and keep more seating distance to a confederate than included participants. Also, virtual social exclusion constitutes a significant threat to fundamental human needs like social control, selfesteem and belonging and causes an increase in uncertainty, sadness and anger as well as a decrease in happiness. Avatars and agents seemed to equally endanger human needs and lead to the same seating distance. However, avatar excluded persons also had higher levels of sadness and were less helpful than avatar included persons, who in turn were more confident. Thus, while the Media Equation Concept (Nass & Moon, 2000) holds true for the immediate reaction to social exclusion (i.e., avatars and agents equally threaten fundamental needs), the delayed emotional and behavioral reactions differ for avatars and agents, possibly because they are preceded by cognitive evaluation (c.f.,Temporal Need-Threat Model; Williams, 2009). Implications of these findings for everyday online social interactions (i.e., in MMORPG5) are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Kothgassner, O.

3015,,"Augmented reality (AR) is a technique to augment virtual objects such as sound, video and graphics, etc in the real environment captured through sensors like camera and viewed from an AR device such as smart phone, glasses. Nowadays AR has been widely applied in many fields like education, art and entertainment. The development of computer vision techniques especially 3D reconstruction, object tracking are crucial for the development of AR system. In this thesis, the aim is to obtain a dense piecewise planar reconstruction of a static scene from multiple image frames based on a factorization framework. Integrating all the relevant constraints in a global objective function, we are able to effectively leverage on the scene smoothness prior afforded by the dense formulation, as well as imposing the necessary algebraic constraints required by the shape matrix. These constraints also help to robustly decompose the measurement matrix into the underlying low-rank subspace and the sparse outlier part. Numerically, we achieve the constrained factorization and decomposition via modifying a recently proposed proximal alternating robust subspace minimization algorithm. The results show that our algorithm is effective in handling real life sequences, and outperforms other algorithms in recovering motions and dense scene estimate. This novel planar reconstruction technique is especially beneficial for the reconstruction of indoor scenes, since artificial planes almost dominate the entire indoor scene. After we obtain the dense planar reconstruction, a simple inference based on plane geometry can be applied to infer the most likely support planes or obstacles, which is important for AR system and even for indoor navigation of robotic agent.","Kou, Wen",0,,1096
3016,,"The rational design of novel chemotherapeutics is based upon knowledge of the intermolecular interactions between ligands and their targets, and the physical, topological and dynamic properties of those ligands within the biological environment. The pyrrolo(2,1-c)(1,4)benzodiazepine-5-ones (PBDs) are a family of sequence-selective, DNA minor groove-binding antitumour agents that inhibit transcriptional events and DNA replication. The effect of pH and salt concentrations on the conjugation rates of two PBDs with short DNA sequences were quantified by HPLC analysis. To further understand how the binding interactions of PBDs with DNA are affected by varying electrolyte conditions, computational techniques including conformational searching and molecular dynamics simulations were applied. The effect of the environment on the conformation of ligands and their target interactions was further evaluated and utilised in the design of Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors. Inhibition of this PPI increases the free concentration of Nrf2, a redox transcription factor which plays important roles in controlling xenobiotic and oxidative stress. Inhibitors could therefore act as cytoprotective agents in a range of diseases. A series of peptides with minor sequence modifications that interact with Keap1 were evaluated using computational approaches including: conformational searching (MacroModel), simulated annealing and molecular dynamics (Desmond). Binding poses of peptides in complex with Keap1 based on the structural information from the crystal structure of the Keap1-Nrf2 complex (PDB entry 1X2R) were predicted using several molecular docking programs (Hex, GLUE, Glide, GOLD). Finally, a series of reference crystal structures of a small molecule and peptides in complex with Keap1 were used as templates for the rational design of potential inhibitors of the Keap1-Nrf2 PPI. ‘Scaffold hopping’ (Spark) and free energy perturbation (FEP) (MCPRO) calculations were applied during the inhibitor design to provide possible replacements for key structural elements. This resulted in a virtual library of potential non-peptide inhibitors of the Keap1-Nrf2 PPI for future synthesis and evaluation.","Kramar, S.",0,,1097
3018,Influence of Ethnic Group-Membership and Gaze Direction on the Perception of Emotions. A Cross-Cultural Study between Germany and China,"Emotional facial expressions provide important nonverbal cues in human interactions. The perception of emotions is not only influenced by a person's ethnic background but also depends on whether a person is engaged with the emotion-encoder. Although these factors are known to affect emotion perception, their impact has only been studied in isolation before. The aim of the present study was to investigate their combined influence. Thus, in order to study the influence of engagement on emotion perception between persons from different ethnicities, we compared participants from China and Germany. Asian-looking and European-looking virtual agents expressed anger and happiness while gazing at the participant or at another person. Participants had to assess the perceived valence of the emotional expressions. Results indicate that indeed two factors that are known to have a considerable influence on emotion perception interacted in their combined influence: We found that the perceived intensity of an emotion expressed by ethnic in-group members was in most cases independent of gaze direction, whereas gaze direction had an influence on the emotion perception of ethnic out-group members. Additionally, participants from the ethnic out-group tended to perceive emotions as more pronounced than participants from the ethnic in-group when they were directly gazed at. These findings suggest that gaze direction has a differential influence on ethnic in-group and ethnic out-group dynamics during emotion perception.","Kramer, K.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0066335,1098
3024,Smile and the world will smile with you-The effects of a virtual agent's smile on users' evaluation and behavior,"Recent studies have demonstrated that people show social reactions when interacting with human-like virtual agents. For instance, human users behave in a socially desirable way, show increased cooperation or apply human-like communication. It has, however, so far not been tested whether users are prone to mimic the artificial agent's behavior although this is a widely cited phenomenon of human human communication that seems to be especially indicative of the sociality of the situation. We therefore conducted an experiment, in which we analyzed whether humans reciprocate an agent's smile. In a between-subjects design, 104 participants conducted an 8-min small-talk conversation with an agent that either did not smile, showed occasional smiles, or displayed frequent smiles. Results show that although smiling did not have a distinct impact on the evaluation of the agent, the human interaction partners themselves smiled longer when the agent was smiling.

On the effects of rapport behavior and gender of a virtual agent in an instructional interaction,"While numerous research endeavors address the effects of pedagogical agents, the role of the agent's gender and its rapport behavior has been neglected. We hypothesize that a minimal amount of behavioral realism induced by display of rapport is necessary for any social effects to occur in human-computer interaction. Further, in line with results from STEM research on female role models, we assume that especially for female learners a same sex agent will be beneficial. In a 2 (student gender) x 2 (agent gender) x 2 (rapport behavior yes/no) between subjects design, we investigate whether virtual agents can help enhance participants' performance, effort and motivation in mathematics. Female and male participants (N = 128) interacted with a male or female virtual agent that either displayed rapport or no rapport. Our results confirm the expected main effect of rapport. However, against expectations, our results do not support the assumption that a same sex agent is beneficial for female learners. Participants' performance and effort were significantly enhanced when interacting with an agent of opposite gender that displayed rapport. Our results have implications on designing agents for education and training purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Kramer, N. C.",1,10.1016/j.compedu.2016.04.002,1100

In a between subjects experimental setting, 79 participants interacted with a virtual agent who either displayed socially responsive nonverbal behavior or not. Results demonstrate that although there was no main effect of socially responsive behavior on participants' subjective experience of rapport and on connectedness with the agent, those people with a high need to belong reported less willingness to engage in social activities after the interaction with a virtual agent but only if the agent displayed socially responsive behavior.

Methods: A single-blinded, mixed methods, randomized, multisite trial compared MPathic-VR (N = 210) to computer-based learning (N = 211). Primary outcomes: communication scores during repeat interactions with MPathic-VR's intercultural and interprofessional communication scenarios and scores on a subsequent advanced communication skills objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare outcomes. Secondary outcomes: student attitude surveys and qualitative assessments of their experiences with MPathic-VR or computer-based learning. Results: MPathic-VR-trained students improved their intercultural and interprofessional communication performance between their first and second interactions with each scenario. They also achieved significantly higher composite scores on the OSCE than computer-based learning-trained students. Attitudes and experiences were more positive among students trained with MPathic-VR, who valued its providing immediate feedback, teaching nonverbal communication skills, and preparing them for emotion-charged patient encounters. Conclusions: MPathic-VR was effective in training advanced communication skills and in enabling knowledge transfer into a more realistic clinical situation.

3059,To the Fringe and Back: Violent Extremism and the Psychology of Deviance,"We outline a general psychological theory of extremism and apply it to the special case of violent extremism (VE). Extremism is defined as motivated deviance from general behavioral norms and is assumed to stem from a shift from a balanced satisfaction of basic human needs afforded by moderation to a motivational imbalance wherein a given need dominates the others. Because motivational imbalance is difficult to sustain, only few individuals do, rendering extreme behavior relatively rare, hence deviant. Thus, individual dynamics translate into social patterns wherein majorities of individuals practice moderation, whereas extremism is the province of the few. Both extremism and moderation require the ability to successfully carry out the activities that these demand. Ability is partially determined by the activities' difficulty, controllable in part by external agents who promote or oppose extremism. Application of this general framework to VE identifies the specific need that animates it and offers broad guidelines for addressing this pernicious phenomenon.","Kruglanski, A.

The first have agents that are non-coreferential with the subject of the main clause. The second have agents that are coreferential with the subject of the main clause. The first type strongly resemble Greek genitive absolutes because of their high frequency of animate subject complements and the similar way in which they articulate referential coherence. The second type, which always contains a perfect passive participle, from a comparative perspective can be seen as a paradigmatic filler, which is a Latin alternative to an anterior active participle. Their subject complements are less frequently animate and in the word order (iconically) placed close to the subject of the main clause that is also the agent of the ablative absolute.

3066,,"Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in inflammation as well as in the innate and adaptive immune defense through stimulation of Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. Its activity is regulated in vivo by a naturally occurring antagonist, the human IL-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP). Functional homologs of human IL-18BP are encoded by all orthopoxviruses, including variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, and contribute to their virulence by suppressing IL-18 mediated immune response. In this work, we have focused on the structural and functional characterization of human IL-18 in complex with IL-18BP from two distinct species of poxviruses, the ectromelia virus (ECTV) and the Yaba Like Disease Virus (YLDV), using biophysical methods including X-ray crystallography. Through virtual screening and cell-based bioassays, we have also identified small molecules that specifically target hIL-18 and modulate its bioactivity. Here, we describe the first three-dimensional structure of an orthopoxvirus IL-18BP, ECTV IL-18BP, in complex with hIL-18 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to 2.0Å resolution. The hIL-18 structure in the complex shows significant conformational change when compared to the ligand-free hIL-18 NMR solution structure, indicating the binding is mediated via an induced-fit mechanism. ECTV IL-18BP adopts a canonical h-type immunoglobulin-fold and interacts via one edge of its β-sandwich with three induced cavities on the hIL-18 surface, using extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions through conserved residues found in mammalian and orthopoxvirus IL-18BPs. We also determined the three-dimensional structure of a yatapoxvirus IL-18BP, YLDV IL-18BP, in complex with hIL-18 to 1.75Å resolution. Strikingly, YLDV IL-18BP forms a unique disulfide linked homodimer and binds hIL-18 in a 2:2 stoichiometry. Each protomer complex resembles the ECTV IL-18BP:hIL-18 complex while also using an induced fit mechanism to bind hIL-18. Our studies reveal YLDV IL-18BP is unique among the diverse family of mammalian and poxvirus IL-18BPs in that it uses a bivalent binding mode and a unique set of interacting residues for binding hIL-18. Our studies also reveal poxvirus family members neutralize hIL-18 activity with a similar induced fit mechanism despite extensive divergence, suggesting that all IL18BPs use a conserved inhibitory mechanism by blocking a putative receptor-binding site on hIL18.","Krumm, Brian E.",0,,1107

Innovatively, to assess anthropomorphism, we utilized an implicit measurement procedure.

Moreover, compared to the out-group condition, participants who perceived NAO as an in-group member showed greater willingness to interact with robots in general.","Kuchenbrandt, D.",0,10.1007/s12369-013-0197-8,1109
3076,Keep an Eye on the Task! How Gender Typicality of Tasks Influence Human-Robot Interactions,"In an experiment, we tested whether the gender typicality of a human-robot interaction (HRI) task would affect the users' performance during HRI and the users' evaluation, acceptance and anthropomorphism of the robot. participants (38 females and 35 males) performed either a stereotypically male or a stereotypically female task while being instructed by either a 'male' or a 'female' robot. Results revealed that gender typicality of the task significantly affected our dependent measures: More errors occurred when participants collaborated with the robot in the context of a stereotypically female work domain. Moreover, when participants performed a typically female task with the robot they were less willing to accept help from the robot in a future task and they anthropomorphized the robot to a lower extent. These effects were independent of robot and participant gender. Our findings demonstrate that the gender typicality of HRI tasks substantially influences HRI as well as humans' perceptions and acceptance of a robot.","Kuchenbrandt, D.",0,10.1007/s12369-014-0244-0,1110
3081,Increasing Helpfulness towards a Robot by Emotional Adaption to the User,"This article describes an emotional adaption approach to proactively trigger increased helpfulness towards a robot in task-related human-robot interaction (HRI). Based on social-psychological predictions of human behavior, the approach aims at inducing empathy, paired with a feeling of similarity in human users towards the robot. This is achieved by two differently expressed emotional control variables: by an explicit statement of similarity before task-related interaction, and implicitly expressed by adapting the emotional state of the robot to the mood of the human user, such that the current values of the human mood in the dimensions of pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD) are matched. The thereby shifted emotional state of the robot serves as a basis for the generation of task-driven emotional facial-and verbal expressions, employed to induce and sustain high empathy towards the robot throughout the interaction. The approach is evaluated in a user study utilizing an expressive robot head. The effectiveness of the approach is confirmed by significant experimental results. An analysis of the individual components of the approach reveals significant effects of explicit emotional adaption on helpfulness, as well as on the HRI-key concepts anthropomorphism and animacy.","Kuhnlenz, B.",0,10.1007/s12369-013-0182-2,1111

3087,How the Realism of Robot Is Needed for Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorders in an Interview Setting,"The preliminary efficacy of interview training using an android robot whose appearance and movements resemble those of an actual human for treating social and communication difficulties in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been demonstrated. Patient preferences regarding the appearance of robots are crucial for incentivizing them to undergo robot-assisted therapy. However, very little is known about how the realistic nature of an android robot is related to incentivizing individuals with ASD in an interview setting. In this study, individuals with ASD underwent an interview with a human interviewer and an android robot. Twenty-three individuals with ASD (age, 17-25 years) participated in this study. After the interview, the participants were evaluated in terms of their motivation to practice an interview with an android robot and their impression of the nature of the android robot in terms of humanness. As expected, subjects exhibited higher motivation to undergo interview training with an android robot than with a human interviewer. Higher motivation to undergo an interview with the android robot was negatively correlated with the participants' impressions of the extent to which the android robot exhibited humanness. This study brings us one step closer to understanding how such an android robot should be designed and implemented to provide sufficiently realistic interview training that can be of therapeutic value.","Kumazaki, H.",0,10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00486,1113
3096,A pilot study for robot appearance preferences among high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorder: Implications for therapeutic use,"Recent rapid technological advances have enabled robots to fulfill a variety of human-like functions, leading researchers to propose the use of such technology for the development and subsequent validation of interventions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although a variety of robots have been proposed as possible therapeutic tools, the physical appearances of humanoid robots currently used in therapy with these patients are highly varied. Very little is known about how these varied designs are experienced by individuals with ASD. In this study, we systematically evaluated preferences regarding robot appearance in a group of 16 individuals with ASD (ages 10-17). Our data suggest that there may be important differences in preference for different types of robots that vary according to interaction type for individuals with ASD. Specifically, within our pilot sample, children with higher-levels of reported ASD symptomatology reported a preference for specific humanoid robots to those perceived as more mechanical or mascot-like. The findings of this pilot study suggest that preferences and reactions to robotic interactions may vary tremendously across individuals with ASD. Future work should evaluate how such differences may be systematically measured and potentially harnessed to facilitate meaningful interactive and intervention paradigms.","Kumazaki, H.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0186581,1114

We investigated whether impressions of ""humanness"" for android robot might represent a candidate characteristic of an ASD endophenotype. We used a female type of android robot with an appearance similar to that of a real person. Significant differences in overall impressions of 'humanness' for android robot were found between adolescents with ASD and typical development (TD) controls, as well as parents of children with ASD and parents of TD controls.

The aim of this work is to detect the role of visual and vocal cues on dialog turn-change judgment using a conversational agent. The authors compare and study the cues in two experiments. Findings of those experiments suggest that the selected visual turn-yielding cues are more effective than the vocal cues in increasing correct judgment of dialog turn-change.

3121,,"The present work aims at contributing to classical SLA planning research by developing a behavioral respecification of planning. To this end, I adopt a process-oriented, conversation analytic approach in the analysis of thirteen planning sessions, conducted by four groups of adult learners of Italian as a foreign language while preparing for a classroom presentation in their L2. In general terms, planning is defined as a goal-oriented activity that is carried out to prepare for the performance of a given task. Classical SLA research conceptualizes planning in psycholinguistic terms, as an individual, cognitive endeavor, and studies it with a product-oriented approach, focusing on the linguistic gains that can be obtained in the final performance of a task, given different planning conditions (e.g., planning time, guided versus unguided planning, group versus individual planning, etc.). However, this line of research has generally failed to document what learners actually do during planning, and has fundamentally disregarded the social aspects of planning and task performance). Thus, in line with the call for a process-oriented and ecologically sound approach to planning in SLA, and with the behavioral approach adopted in other fields, the present work applies a behavioral and process-oriented approach to the study of group planning, as it is collaboratively accomplished, in situ, by the participants. In my analysis, I rely on the methodological and theoretical tools of ethnomethodological Conversation Analysis (CA), which affords an emic (i.e., participant-related) account of what actually happens in the process of group planning, on a moment-by-moment basis. Specifically, I use CA to demonstrably document: (a) the observable practices enacted by students during planning; (b) the students’ use of available resources; (c) the creation of material artifacts (both oral and written) that reflect the gradual emergence of the planning product in interaction; (d) the students’ emic criteria in carrying out the planning activity and in conceptualizing the final task. In analyzing the present dataset, I explore how students collaboratively create and work on emergent linguistic artifacts, mainly consisting of script lines to be performed in the L2 during the final presentation. Specifically, I focus on those artifacts that emerge orally, get shaped in and through the interaction, and are finally written up in Italian. These artifacts function as public conversational substrates, upon which various operations are performed. Such operations include translations from the L1 to L2 and vice versa, and repair work targeting accuracy and comprehensibility. An analysis of the language alternation patterns enacted by these students also shows how the participants, regardless of their proficiency level in the L2, resourcefully employ the two shared languages in their repertoire (i.e., L1 English and L2 Italian) and co-construct a local interactional order where the alternation between the L1 and the L2 embodies the distinction between planning process (typically conducted in English) and planning product (typically conveyed in Italian). Overall, these findings speak to the distinction between task-as-plan and task-as-activity by showing how students are “active agents” who accomplish the task according to their ongoing interpretations of the task itself and of the instructional setting in which it takes place. In conclusion, the analysis developed in this study allows for a behavioral respecification of planning, which comes to be defined as an intersubjective, goal-oriented activity that is done by multilingual actors as observable behavior, in situ, in and through embodied talk-in-interaction. Planning is thus achieved through the lamination of different semiotic systems and embodied interactional practices, while planning sessions represent particular loci of emergent, accumulative, and cooperative human action where specific language learning behaviors may be expected to occur.

3122,Moving Just Like You: Motor Interference Depends on Similar Motility of Agent and Observer,"Recent findings in neuroscience suggest an overlap between brain regions involved in the execution of movement and perception of another's movement. This so-called ""action-perception coupling"" is supposed to serve our ability to automatically infer the goals and intentions of others by internal simulation of their actions. A consequence of this coupling is motor interference (MI), the effect of movement observation on the trajectory of one's own movement. Previous studies emphasized that various features of the observed agent determine the degree of MI, but could not clarify how human-like an agent has to be for its movements to elicit MI and, more importantly, what 'human-like' means in the context of MI. Thus, we investigated in several experiments how different aspects of appearance and motility of the observed agent influence motor interference (MI). Participants performed arm movements in horizontal and vertical directions while observing videos of a human, a humanoid robot, or an industrial robot arm with either artificial (industrial) or human-like joint configurations. Our results show that, given a human-like joint configuration, MI was elicited by observing arm movements of both humanoid and industrial robots. However, if the joint configuration of the robot did not resemble that of the human arm, MI could longer be demonstrated. Our findings present evidence for the importance of human-like joint configuration rather than other human-like features for perception-action coupling when observing inanimate agents.","Kupferberg, A.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0039637,1118
3128,Fronto-parietal coding of goal-directed actions performed by artificial agents,"With advances in technology, artificial agents such as humanoid robots will soon become a part of our daily lives. For safe and intuitive collaboration, it is important to understand the goals behind their motor actions. In humans, this process is mediated by changes in activity in fronto-parietal brain areas. The extent to which these areas are activated when observing artificial agents indicates the naturalness and easiness of interaction. Previous studies indicated that fronto-parietal activity does not depend on whether the agent is human or artificial. However, it is unknown whether this activity is modulated by observing grasping (self-related action) and pointing actions (other-related action) performed by an artificial agent depending on the action goal. Therefore, we designed an experiment in which subjects observed human and artificial agents perform pointing and grasping actions aimed at two different object categories suggesting different goals. We found a signal increase in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule and the premotor cortex when tool versus food items were pointed to or grasped by both agents, probably reflecting the association of hand actions with the functional use of tools. Our results show that goal attribution engages the frontoparietal network not only for observing a human but also a robotic agent for both self-related and social actions. The debriefing after the experiment has shown that actions of human-like artificial agents can be perceived as being goal-directed. Therefore, humans will be able to interact with service robots intuitively in various domains such as education, healthcare, public service, and entertainment.","Kupferberg, A.",0,10.1002/hbm.23905,1119
3138,Similar impressions of humanness for human and artificial singing voices in autism spectrum disorders,"People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit impairments in the perception of and orientation to social information related to humans, and some people with ASD show higher preference toward human-like robots than other humans. We speculated that this behavioural bias in people with ASD is caused by a weakness in their perception of humanness. To address this issue, we investigated whether people with ASD detect a subtle difference between the same song sung by human and artificial voices even when the lyrics, melody and rhythm are identical. People without ASD answered that the songs sung by a human voice evoked more impressions of humanness (human-likeness, animateness, naturalness, emotion) and more positive feelings (warmth, familiarity, comfort) than those sung by an artificial voice. In contrast, people with ASD had similar impressions of humanness and positive feelings for the songs sung by the human and artificial voices. The evaluations of musical characteristics (complexity, regularity, brightness) did not differ between people with and without ASD. These results suggest that people with ASD are weak in their ability to perceive psychological attributes of humanness. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

3144,Inferring power and dominance from dyadic nonverbal interactions in autism spectrum disorder,"Research studies to date have revealed conflicting results with respect to the processing of nonverbal cues from social interactions in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the contribution of two important factors for the perception of dyadic social interactions, namely (a) the movement contingency and (b) the spatial context. To this end, 26 adult participants with ASD and 26 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched typically developed control participants observed animations presenting nonverbal interactions between two human virtual characters enacting power relationships. We manipulated (a) movement contingency by exchanging one of the two original agents with an agent from another dyad and (b) spatial context by changing agents' spatial orientation to a back-to-back position. Participants were asked to rate dominance and submissiveness of these agents. Results showed that the movement contingency manipulation affected accuracy and consistency of power perception and that the spatial context manipulation slowed down reaction times comparably in both groups. With regard to group differences, individuals with ASD were found to judge power relationships slower compared to control participants, potentially suggesting a more explicit processing style in ASD. Furthermore, the spatial context manipulation slowed down the reaction times more in the contingent compared to the non-contingent conditions only in the ASD group. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate whether individuals with ASD have difficulties in understanding nonverbal cues in a dyadic context by suggesting that they do so in more subtle ways than previously investigated. Autism Res 2019, 12: 505-516 (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay SummaryThis study shows that the ability and speed of judging who is dominant in a social interaction depends on two factors: (a) whether their movements are matched and (b) whether they are facing each other or not. This is similarly the case for participants with and without autism. Interestingly, however, individuals with autism seem to judge generally slower, suggesting a more explicit processing style. The two factors seem to interact, suggesting that nonverbal processing difficulties are subtler than previously thought.","Kuschefski, M.",0,10.1002/aur.2069,1122
3149,Inconsistency of personality evaluation caused by appearance gap in robotic telecommunication,"Compared with other communication media such as cellphones and video chat, teleoperated robots have a physical existence which increases the feeling of copresence. However, the appearance of a teleoperated robot is always the same regardless of the characteristics of its operator. Since people can determine their partner's personality from his/her appearance, a teleoperated robot's appearance might construct a personality that confuses the user. Our research focuses on establishing what kind of appearance of the telecommunication media could prevent confusion and increase the feeling of copresence. In this study, we compare the appearance of three types of communication media (nonhuman-like robot, human-like robot, and video chat with a projection of the speaker). The result shows that, in the case of the human-like robot, the consistency of the personality judgment is better than in the case of the nonhuman-like robot. Also, we found that teleoperated robots transmit a more appropriate context-based atmosphere, while the video chat transmits more nonverbal information, such as facial expressions.","Kuwamura, K.",0,10.1075/is.16.2.10kuw,1123
3153,,"This multi-sited ethnographic case study examines how transnationalism shapes the everyday lives of young immigrant children, particularly their literacies, identities, and learning. This study involved three second-generation Korean immigrant children whose lives encompass multiple languages, cultures, and countries through close connections with their parental homelands. Informed by a transnationalism framework and sociocultural perspective on literacy, I focused on three specific questions: How do second-generation immigrant children engage with language and literacy in and across various spaces? What transnational funds of knowledge do they build as they move across contexts? How do they position themselves and represent their identities? I employed a multi-sited ethnographic stance and collected data for one year in two locations: North Carolina, United States, and Seoul, South Korea. The data collected include participant observations, fieldnotes, parent questionnaires and interviews, child-centered interview activities, artifacts, documents, photographs, and a reflective journal.Findings from the research indicated that second-generation immigrant children play crucial roles in building, maintaining, and extending transnational networks. As these children moved across geographical boundaries, they flexibly drew on multiple languages, linguistic features, and modes. As active agents, they engaged in the circulation of care by circulating love, support, and educational resources with family members across national borders. The children also mobilized their transnational funds of knowledge beyond local-global contexts through playful engagements that I refer to as transcultural play. Finally, the children presented complex and evolving transnational ways of belonging, which demonstrated that active participation in transnational practices does not necessarily lead to strong identification with the parents' home culture. This study provides a more comprehensive and nuanced picture of young immigrant children living in a transnational and transcultural world and challenges previous claims that second-generation immigrants lose meaningful connections with their parental homelands. By demonstrating the flexibility and mobility of young immigrant children's literacies, identities, and learning, I provide theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical insights that are essential for researchers and educators interested in cultivating a transnational curriculum and honoring young immigrant children's mobile experiences.","Kwon, Jungmin",0,,1124
3154,,"Simulation games can be valuable tools for students to learn through experience. Instructional simulation games can decrease time to learn, compared with real-world experience; and students can experience failure without suffering real-world consequences. Such trial-and-error learning can, however, be inefficient and ineffective. Instructional Overlays (IOs) are proposed as a solution to improving learning via simulations and games. IOs allow students to pause a game and do specific learning activities before continuing. However, no Instructional Overlay Design Theory (IO DT) existed. Therefore, this study sought to create an initial IO DT for simulation games. Formative research methods were used. An initial instructional overlay theory was tentatively developed in a previous pre-dissertation study using seven students. To improve this IO DT, seven new players were observed in-depth while playing an online version of the Diffusion Simulation Game (DSG) where instructional overlays were provided. The DSG requires players, acting as change agents, to encourage fictional teachers at a fictional school to adopt an innovation within a virtual year. The DSG is largely based on Diffusion of Innovations (DoI) theory by Everett Rogers. Screencasts of gameplay were recorded digitally, including audio of student verbal think-aloud and observer verbal interaction with players. Results indicated student learning problems which included: uncertainty about when and how to use supportive information in the IO; incomplete application of DoI principles the DSG was designed to teach; focus on winning the game instead of understanding DoI principles; student unwillingness to abandon incorrect beliefs about DoI; lack of proficiency in finding regularities or patterns through gameplay; and cognitive overload. The initial Instructional Overlay Design Theory for simulations and games was modified by adding design guidelines for building game strategies, conducting game experiments, and interpreting game data. Further research is needed, since this was a relatively small multiple-case study, limiting its generalizability.","Kwon, Seolim",0,,1125

Personality patterns were recognized based on non-verbal cues such as the rate, energy, pitch, and silent intervals of speech with patterns of their change. Through experimentation, a maximum pattern classification accuracy of 86.3% was achieved. Using the same data, another pattern classification test was manually carried out by people to see how well the automatic pattern classification of personal traits performed. The results in the second manual test showed an accuracy of 86.6%. This proves that the automatic pattern classification of personal traits can achieve results comparable to the level of performance accomplished by humans. The Silent Intervals feature of the automatic pattern classification performed admirably while in the second test done by people, pitch was a key factor in producing better accuracy.

In such cases, existence of other digital humanoid representations in the virtual environment is a crucial factor. Conformitythe act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to fit with the majorityis one of the most powerful aspects of social influence. In this study, we investigated conformity to virtual humans in an immersive virtual environment, using two experiments. In the first experiment, we investigated whether agents have social influence on the participants by conducting the 1951 Asch conformity experiment. Findings demonstrate that the participants' response times were affected by the judgments of the agents in the virtual environment. In the second experiment, we used a similar method to study how the factors agency and behavioral real ism affect social conformity. Agency is the extent of a user's belief that other humanoid representations represent real people. Behavioral realism is the degree to which humanoid representations behave as they would do in the real world. The results of the experiment showed that conformity can be caused by virtual humans in immersive virtual environments. However, there are no significant results regarding the influence of agency and behavioral realism on conformity.","Kyrlitsias, C.",0,10.1002/cav.1804,1127

In Experiment 1, (N = 76), learners engaged in a computerized Latin practice session that included metalinguistic information in feedback. In Experiment 2, (N = 0), feedback indicated only if learners' responses in practice were right or wrong. Development was operationalized as improvement in accuracy and/or reaction time. Results showed that when feedback was metalinguistic, an intermediate level of formal L2 experience was enough to yield an advantage, however only those learners with very advanced L2 experience showed longer-term retention of that advantage. In contrast, in the absence of metalinguistic feedback, very advanced experience was required for any advantage to appear.

However, the plan-market dichotomy (i.e. the assumption that state and private planning is mutually exclusive) is fallacious. Informed by the neo-institutional economic assumption of rational decisions and the stance of contractual solutions, it rides on the surge in private planning by proposing a taxonomy of planning that combines two modes of planning with two types of planning agent and discusses their possible interrelationships using some neo-institutional economic reasoning informed by the ideas of Coase.

3167,,"People can learn a new concept almost perfectly from just a single example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require hundreds or thousands of examples to perform similarly. People can also use their learned concepts in richer ways than conventional machine learning systems – for action, imagination, and explanation – suggesting that concepts are far more than a set of features, exemplars, or rules, the most popular forms of representation in machine learning and traditional models of concept learning. For those interested in better understanding this human ability, or in closing the gap between humans and machines, the key computational questions are the same: How do people learn new concepts from just one or a few examples? And how do people learn such abstract, rich, and flexible representations? An even greater puzzle arises by putting these two questions together: How do people learn such rich concepts from just one or a few examples? This thesis investigates concept learning as a form of Bayesian program induction, where learning involves selecting a structured procedure that best generates the examples from a category. I introduce a computational framework that utilizes the principles of compositionality, causality, and learning-to-learn to learn good programs from just one or a handful of examples of a new concept. New conceptual representations can be learned compositionally from pieces of related concepts, where the pieces reflect real part structure in the underlying causal process that generates category examples. This approach is evaluated on a number of natural concept learning tasks where humans and machines can be compared side-by-side. Chapter 2 introduces a large-scale data set of novel, simple visual concepts for studying concept learning from sparse data. People were asked to produce new examples of over 1600 novel categories, revealing consistent structure in the generative programs that people used. Initial experiments also show that this structure is useful for one-shot classification. Chapter 3 introduces the computational framework called Hierarchical Bayesian Program Learning, and Chapters 4 and 5 compare humans and machines on six tasks that cover a range of natural conceptual abilities. On a challenging one-shot classification task, the computational model achieves human-level performance while also outperforming several recent deep learning models. Visual ""Turing test"" experiments were used to compare humans and machines on more creative conceptual abilities, including generating new category examples, predicting latent causal structure, generating new concepts from related concepts, and freely generating new concepts. In each case, fewer than twenty-five percent of judges could reliably distinguish the human behavior from the machine behavior, showing that the model can generalize in ways similar to human performance. A range of comparisons with lesioned models and alternative modeling frameworks reveal that three key ingredients – compositionality, causality, and learning-to-learn – contribute to performance in each of the six tasks. This conclusion is further supported by the results of Chapter 6, where a computational model using only two of these three principles was evaluated on the one-shot learning of new spoken words. Learning programs with these ingredients is a promising route towards more humanlike concept learning in machines.

3168,Building machines that learn and think like people,"Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.","Lake, B.

Our aims were to identify and model (1) the affordance related dynamics that define an actor's choice to move an object alone or to pass it to their co-actor and (2) the trajectory dynamics of an actor's hand movements when moving to grasp, relocate, or pass the object. Using a virtual reality pick and place task, we demonstrate that both the decision to pass or not pass an object and the movement trajectories of the participants can be characterized in terms of a behavioral dynamics model. Simulations suggest that the proposed behavioral dynamics model exhibits features observed in human participants including hysteresis in decision making, non-straight line trajectories, and non-constant velocity profiles. The proposed model highlights how the same low-dimensional behavioral dynamics can operate to constrain multiple (and often nested) levels of human activity and suggests that knowledge of what, when, where and how to move or act during pick and place behavior may be defined by these low dimensional task dynamics and, thus, can emerge spontaneously and in real-time with little a priori planning.","Lamb, M.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01061,1133
3178,A Hierarchical Behavioral Dynamic Approach for Naturally Adaptive Human-Agent Pick-and-Place Interactions,"Interactive or collaborative pick-and-place tasks occur during all kinds of daily activities, for example, when two or more individuals pass plates, glasses, and utensils back and forth between each other when setting a dinner table or loading a dishwasher together. In the near future, participation in these collaborative pick-and-place tasks could also include robotic assistants. However, for human-machine and human-robot interactions, interactive pick-and-place tasks present a unique set of challenges. A key challenge is that high-level task-representational algorithms and preplanned action or motor programs quickly become intractable, even for simple interaction scenarios. Here we address this challenge by introducing a bioinspired behavioral dynamic model of free-flowing cooperative pick-and-place behaviors based on low-dimensional dynamical movement primitives and nonlinear action selection functions. Further, we demonstrate that this model can be successfully implemented as an artificial agent control architecture to produce effective and robust human-like behavior during human-agent interactions. Participants were unable to explicitly detect whether they were working with an artificial (model controlled) agent or another human-coactor, further illustrating the potential effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach for developing systems of robust real/embodied human-robot interaction more generally.","Lamb, M.",0,10.1155/2019/5964632,1134
3185,,"On April 20, 2010, explosions at the British Petroleum (BP) Macondo Project in the Gulf of Mexico initiated what would become the world’s largest accidental release of oil into the ocean. This ecological disaster, a unique combination of natural and human causes, is one of many significant traumas over approximately the last two decades that various stakeholders have documented, participated in, and responded to largely through the expanding and increasingly ubiquitous media of the internet, computers, cell phones, and other networked communicative technologies, which both enable and constrain the variety of responses to traumatic events. This dissertation improves our understanding of the discourse conventions in response to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill and other disaster contexts—which I term “disaster zones”—by analyzing the production, distribution (circulation), and consumption (reception) of disaster zone discourse(s). Proceeding from postmodernist and poststructuralist assumptions about subjectivity and discourse, I utilize Grounded Theory, Critical Discourse Analysis, and rhetorical historiography to redefine disaster zone genres and recover disaster zone rhetors through a collective case study of the broad range of literate activities following the 2010 BP oil spill. In Chapter 3, I describe the disaster zone as a discourse community characterized by genre participation—including the rhetorical speech set of kategoria (accusation), apologia (defense), and antapologia (defense critique)—and I suggest that these critical genres constitute an interpretive community. In Chapter 4, I expand upon the above genres to explain the epideictic uses and critiques of (in)eloquence in BP’s damage control discourse. My analysis concludes in Chapter 5 with a reception study of the “center” genre of the online victim compensation interface and a resistance study of “periphery” genres, such as protests, graffiti, and rap music. I conclude that different types of disaster zone genres provide relative constraints and affordances for disaster zone subject positions. For example, “optional” genres (Chapters 3 and 4) represent a mixture of constraints and affordances on social subjects in the disaster zone community, whereas “necessary” genres (Chapter 5) represent extreme genre constraints on institutional or “center” subjects (“victims”) and extreme genre affordances for resistant or “periphery” subjects (“agents”). As defined and applied throughout this dissertation, the disaster zone is a dynamic rhetorical concept for understanding past and future trauma discourses, and my study has implications for research methods, pedagogy, and the disciplinarity of Rhetoric and Writing Studies (RWS). In an effort to contribute to a better understanding of research processes, this project outlines a flexible, recursive Grounded Theory CDA methodology for discourse and genre analyses. Toward pedagogical ends, I offer the Gulf of Mexico disaster zone as a useful teaching case for rhetoric and composition courses at any level, as it clearly illustrates real-world discourse practices and rhetorical appeals. Similarly, the disaster zone genres relating to risk, crisis response, and victim compensation are useful teaching cases for technical and business writing courses. Furthermore, these pedagogical implications centralize RWS as an active and productive discipline central to progressive undergraduate and graduate education. In the complex negotiation of subjectivities through disaster zone genre participation, it becomes imperative for the educated public to understand how discourse—especially technologically mediated discourse—functions rhetorically, or else risk uncritical acceptance of institutional constraints on discourse and subjective agency. The discipline of RWS is specially equipped to characterize and problematize these discourses through scholarship and teaching. As teachers of writing and critical thinking skills, we are in a unique position to help improve c","Lambert, Ross Jacob R. J.",0,,1135

We analyse and describe the transformation of a teacher in the Finnish rural north in one school semester from a ""conforming"" teacher to a ""transformative teacher,"" examining the narrative of her personal journal and ethnographic researcher's journal. By analysing the transformation process of one individual teacher, we identify the contexts that an individual teacher may need to consider when transforming. This paper finds that the pedagogical transformation process did not focus on learning new teaching methods and applying them in class; instead, the pedagogic transformation occurred after the teacher reflected personally and professionally and carried out small, concrete changes. The pedagogical transformation culminated in two turning points and was enabled by professional support, personal support, space, and personal emotional resources. A three-year survey reveals that such a transformation had permanent consequences.","Lanas, Maija",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14681366.2012.759134,1136
3188,,"This article presents an exemplary case study of one elementary education preservice teacher. This exploratory study originated at a large university on the east coast of the United States in the spring semester of 2011, when the student was enrolled in the researcher's class on children's literature. Throughout the course, the instructor noted the student's rapid development of expertise with the course outcomes, and maintained an electronic portfolio of her work. The student then entered the two-year teacher preparation program at the same university and throughout the following two years the student and the instructor continued to maintain an informal professional relationship, meeting to discuss the student's coursework and field experiences. After the student's final year of her teacher preparation coursework and classroom internship, the instructor approached the student about a formal collaboration to explore the student's development of the cognitive and affective aspects of cultural competence. The student enthusiastically agreed to the collaboration, and expressed her willingness to allow her written work from the previous two years to serve as data for the study. Subsequently, the student sent the instructor all of her written assignments that she had completed in her teacher education program that had incorporated children's literature. Referring to Deardorff's (2006, 2009) model as a framework for the study, the following research questions emerged: (1) How do the course content and pedagogical practices in a children's literature class impact one student's development of cultural competence; and (2) How does the student express her developing cultural competence? Findings indicate that when students acquire the skills and dispositions of cultural competence as an integral part of the fabric of course material, those skills and dispositions help them to develop social consciousness, to understand the relationship between teaching and social equity, and to equip themselves to serve as agents of change.","Landa, Melissa Simone",0,,1137
3190,,"The study of quasi-two-dimensional turbulent jets is relevant to chemical reactors, the coking process in oil refinement, as well as rivers flowing into lakes or oceans. In the event of a spillage of pollutants into a river, it is critical to understand how these agents disperse with the flow in order to assess damage to the environment. For such flows, characteristic streamwise and cross-stream dimensions can be much larger than the fluid-layer thickness, and so the flow develops in a confined environment. When the distance away from the discharge location is larger than ten times the fluid-layer thickness, the flow is referred to as a quasi-two-dimensional jet. From experimental observations using dyed jets and particle image velocimetry, we find that the structure of a quasi-two-dimensional jet consists of a high-speed meandering core with large counter-rotating eddies developing on alternate sides of the core. The core and eddy structure is self-similar with distance from the discharge location. The Gaussianity of the cross-stream distribution of the time-averaged velocity is due, in part, to the sinuous instability of the core. To understand the transport and dispersion properties of quasi-two-dimensional jets we use a time-dependent advection--diffusion equation, with a mixing length hypothesis accounting for the turbulent eddy diffusivity. The model is supported by experimental releases of dye in jets or numerical releases of virtual passive tracers in experimentally-measured jet velocity fields. We consider the statistical properties of this flow by releasing and then tracking large clusters of virtual particles in the jet velocity field. The probability distributions of two-point properties (such as the distance between two particles) reveal large streamwise dispersion. Owing to this streamwise dispersive effect, a significant amount of tracers can be transported faster than the speed predicted by a simple advection model. Using potential theory, we determine the flow induced by a quasi-two-dimensional jet confined in a rectangular domain. The streamlines of the induced flow predicted by the theory agree with experimental measurements away from the jet boundary. Finally, we investigate the case of a quasi-two-dimensional particle-laden jet. Depending on the bulk concentration of dense particles, we identify different flow regimes. At low concentrations, the jet features the same core and eddy structure observed without the particles, and thus quasi-two-dimensional jet theory can apply to some extent. At larger concentrations, we observe an oscillating instability of the particle-laden jet.","Landel, Julien Rémy Dominique Gérard",0,,1138
3191,Learning Intercultural Communication Skills With Virtual Humans: Feedback and Fidelity,"In the context of practicing intercultural communication skills, we investigated the role of fidelity in a game-based, virtual learning environment as. well as the role of feedback delivered by an intelligent tutoring system. In 2 experiments, we compared variations on the game interface, use of the tutoring system, and the form of the feedback. Our findings suggest that for learning basic intercultural communicative skills, a 3-dimensional (3-D) interface with animation and sound produced equivalent learning to a more static 2-D interface. However, learners took significantly longer to analyze and respond to the actions of animated virtual humans, suggesting a deeper engagement. We found large gains in learning across conditions. There was no differential effect with the tutor engaged, but it was found to have a positive impact on learner success in a transfer task. This difference was most pronounced when the feedback was delivered in a more general form versus a concrete style.","Lane, H. C.",1,10.1037/a0031506,1139
3195,,"β-secretase (BACE-1), an enzyme critical in the process of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides deposition in human brain, is closely associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A strong need exists, therefore, to identify molecular imaging probes homing at BACE-1 for use with positron emission tomography (PET) that is recognized as an effective tool for detecting AD. Through this imaging, an early diagnosis of AD could be made. Herein, to identify suitable molecular probes for use with PET, we searched the Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agent Database (MICAD), an online database warehousing scientific information regarding molecular imaging and contrast agents, and applied a virtual screening approach against the different confirmations of BACE-1 obtained from the World Wide Protein Database. The lack of considering receptor flexibility is a key drawback in virtual screening for drug discovery. Therefore, we incorporated protein flexibility into the virtual screening by using an ensemble of 143 experimental BACE-1 structures derived from the Protein Data Bank. Finally, the best performing affinity was recorded and used in the ranking of each ligand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first virtual screening approach used to identify four new molecular probes that could target BACE-1 with favorable affinity, a discovery that can lead to the development of new PET probes for the early detection and therapy of AD. However, the actual utility of these probes can only be ascertained after","Lang, Haijing",0,,1140
3198,Introducing and Testing the Creepiness of Situation Scale (CRoSS),"When people interact with novel technologies (e.g., robots, novel technological tools), the word ""creepy"" regularly pops up. We define creepy situations as eliciting uneasy feelings and involving ambiguity (e.g., on how the behave or how to judge the situation). A common metric for creepiness would help evaluating creepiness of situations and developing adequate interventions against creepiness. Following psychometrical guidelines, we developed the Creepiness of Situation Scale (CRoSS) across four studies with a total of N = 882 American and German participants. In Studies 1-3, participants watched a video of a creepy situation involving technology. Study 1 used exploratory factor analysis in an American sample and showed that creepiness consists of emotional creepiness and creepy ambiguity. In a German sample, Study 2 confirmed these subdimensions. Study 3 supported validity of the CRoSS as creepiness correlated positively with privacy concerns and computer anxiety, but negatively with controllability and transparency. Study 4 used the scale in a 2 (male vs. female experimenter) x 2 (male vs. female participant) x 2 (day vs. night) field study to demonstrate its usefulness for non-technological settings and its sensitivity to theory-based predictions. Results indicate that participants contacted by an experimenter at night-time reported higher feelings of creepiness. Overall, these studies suggest that the CRoSS is a psychometrically sound measure for research and practice.","Langer, M.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02220,1141

The targeted study is set in a human-agent interaction with the aim to help the creation of dialogue strategies of an agent based on the user's interests. In this paper, we first describe the system based on linguistic resources such as lexicons, dependency grammars and dialogue information provided by the dialogue system. Second, we explain how the system merges its outputs at the end of each topic sequence. Finally, we present an evaluation of both the linguistic rules and the merging process. The system enables a better identification of the target of the user's likes and dislikes and provides a synthetic representation of the user's interests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

3202,The institutional approach to economic history: Connecting the two strands,"This essay examines the historiography of two episodes in history the scattering of plots in the open fields in the Middle Ages and the transition to the factory system in the Industrial Revolution to shed light on the uses of institutional economics in economic history. In both of these episodes, economic ""just-so"" stories advanced our understanding of history. What animated intellectual innovation in both cases was a bold conjecture about the raison detre of a puzzling institutional structure. But what ultimately enriched our understanding was the process of conjecture and revision those conjectures set off. In both episodes, the revised conjectures that best withstood criticism and revision were those that saw the phenomena not as static snapshots of economic agents confronting an economic problem but rather those that embedded the phenomena within a larger economic problem and within a process of economic change. In the end it is an account of institutional change what I call the good old New Institutional Economics that connects the use of institutional economics to explain puzzling historical phenomenon with the role of institutional economics in addressing the big questions of economic growth.

3203,A cyborg ontology in health care: traversing into the liminal space between technology and person-centred practice,"Person-centred practice indubitably seems to be the antithesis of technology. The ostensible polarity of technology and person-centred practice is an easy road to travel down and in their various forms has been probably travelled for decades if not centuries. By forging ahead or enduring these dualisms, we continue to approach and recede, but never encounter the elusive and the liminal space between technology and person-centred practice. Inspired by Haraway's work, we argue that healthcare practitioners who critically consider their cyborg ontology may begin the process to initiate and complicate the liminal and sought after space between technology and person-centred practice. In this paper, we draw upon Haraway's idea that we are all materially and ontologically cyborgs. Cyborgs, the hybridity of machine and human, are part of our social reality and embedded in our everyday existence. By considering our cyborg ontology, we suggest that person-centred practice can be actualized in the contextualized, embodied and relational spaces of technology. It is not a question of espousing technology or person-centred practice. Such dualisms have been historically produced and reproduced over many decades and prevented us from recognizing our own cyborg ontology. Rather, it is salient that we take notice of our own cyborg ontology and how technological, habitual ways of being may prevent (and facilitate) us to recognize the embodied and contextualized experiences of patients. A disruption and engagement with the habitual can ensure we are not governed by technology in our logics and practices of care and can move us to a conscious and critical integration of person-centred practice in the technologized care environments. By acknowledging ourselves as cyborgs, we can recapture and preserve our humanness as caregivers, as well as thrive as we proceed in our technological way of being.","Lapum, J.",0,10.1111/j.1466-769X.2012.00543.x,1144
3209,A performative and poetical narrative of critical social theory in nursing education: an ending and threshold of social justice,"In this article, a poetical and performative narrative is shared to examine how the use of stories to critically self-reflect on oppression facilitates an understanding of critical social theory in nursing education and impacts social justice. A fusion of prose with a poetical narrative is employed; the latter is reserved to capture the immediacy of personal, emotive, and embodied storied experiences. This deeply intimate and dialogical story begins with a pedagogical experiment created to facilitate nursing students' understanding of critical social theory. Drawing upon Paulo Freire's work, the nursing teacher in a professional development course attempted to deconstruct power relations and cultivate an open and safe learning environment by sharing a poem that depicts her oppression. Students then anonymously wrote a word/statement about their oppression. The teacher created a composite poem from students' words and shared it with the class; it was a powerful moment that highlighted their shared humanity. As a way to further explore stories and consider how to preserve these words, a small group of students and the teacher formed the the oppression group. Towards the end, we conclude an unfinished story by realizing that the chains of oppression are loosening and humanity is surfacing. There is still a camouflaging of an authentic self. There are still stories to be told. The group is not yet certain if a social representation of an authentic self is possible and if all stories can be told. It has become apparent that the personal can play out in social justice as enacted in the classroom between teacher and students and provides an entry point into the development of the capacity to be social agents in nursing. The group simultaneously concludes the story with both an ending and a threshold of social justice.","Lapum, J.",0,10.1111/j.1466-769X.2011.00520.x,1145
3216,Scrutinising the reflexive ethnography of Urban Outcasts,"The core of Bourdieu and Wacquant's epistemic reflexivity' demands an embodied reflexivity which takes up the point of view of the practice and the social problems under study via a reflection and reconstruction of the point of view of the ethnographer as an agent embedded in a scientific practice in the scientific field. This must be done to cast light over the social conditions and conditionings that have a possible effect on the construction of the given scientific object under study. However, measured by these standards, Urban Outcasts remains not as pedagogical as one might wish. Despite all the qualities of this neo classic, it makes the critical assessment of its core results more difficult than necessary and tends to impede the possible transfer of the underlying propositions which were intended to invigorate the comparative sociology of polarization from below'.","Larsen, T.

MethodFifteen participants (age 22-71) received either computer-assisted instruction or one-on-one tutoring in three content domains that were of functional and daily relevance to them: behavioural limits, rights and responsibilities (two modules) and alphabetical sorting. Learning was assessed by means of a series of pretests and four learning cycle post-tests. Both instructional conditions maintained time-on-task and teaching material equivalence, and both incorporated a set of best-practices and empirically supported teaching techniques designed to address attentional deficits, stimulus processing inefficiencies and cognitive load limitations. ResultsStrong evidence of learning was found in both instructional method conditions. Moreover, in all content domains the two methods yielded approximately equivalent rates of learning and learning attainment. ConclusionsThese findings offer tentative evidence that a repetitive, computer-assisted training program can produce learning outcomes in people with mild and moderate cognitive disabilities that are comparable to those achieved by high-quality one-on-one tutoring.","Larson, J.

Engagement at work is found to be significantly lower among contract teachers than among civil service teachers, and the ability of teachers to manage the pedagogical process does not improve with accumulated experience.

Successful advising systems increase student retention, improve graduation rates and help students meet educational goals. Research in academic advising shows a trend of integrating electronic technologies that advisors must adopt to increase their roles in student education, while resources are limited and the proportion of students increases. The main objective of this work is to deploy an expert-based natural language academic advising system, to manage multiple straightforward advising tasks and allow advisors to engage in non-mundane educative tasks. This system features a conversational agent as the user interface, includes modules for data collection, user data management, an academic advising knowledge base and a web design structure for the implementation platform. This system also includes an expert-based system to manage academic tasks such as course sequence planning, and a method to allow the users to contribute to the academic knowledge base. The system is operational for several hundred students of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Florida. This works covers the design, development, deployment and evaluation of this system. The students used the system during three experimental phases. For the third phase, the system performed well, obtaining close to 80%, on the traditional language processing measures of precision, recall, accuracy and F1 score. Assessment from the constituencies showed positive and assuring reviews. The development of this innovative application involves three research contributions to the field. Firstly, a comprehensive literature search and assessment of the academic advising field with recommended solutions based on the latest technological innovations. Secondly, the design of the first-known academic advising multi-task conversational system, using a robust and scalable linguistically inspired algorithm to resolve ambiguous references, suitable for conditions where large corpora of data are not available. The system contains measures for self-evaluation and for upgrading the knowledge base without involvement from the system developers. Thirdly, the implementation and evaluation of the system in a real-world scenario, which shows the viability of the application and initiated the development of a corpus for academic advising, valuable for the language processing and academic research communities.","Latorre-Navarro, Edward M.",0,,1149
3222,Not Alone Here?! Scalability and User Experience of Embodied Ambient Crowds in Distributed Social Virtual Reality,"This article investigates performance and user experience in Social Virtual Reality (SVR) targeting distributed, embodied, and immersive, face-to-face encounters. We demonstrate the close relationship between scalability, reproduction accuracy, and the resulting performance characteristics, as well as the impact of these characteristics on users co-located with larger groups of embodied virtual others. System scalability provides a variable number of co-located avatars and Al-controlled agents with a variety of different appearances, including realistic-looking virtual humans generated from photogrammetry scans. The article reports on how to meet the requirements of embodied SVR with today's technical off-the-shelf solutions and what to expect regarding features, performance, and potential limitations. Special care has been taken to achieve low latencies and sufficient frame rates necessary for reliable communication of embodied social signals. We propose a hybrid evaluation approach which coherently relates results from technical benchmarks to subjective ratings and which confirms required performance characteristics for the target scenario of larger distributed groups. A user-study reveals positive effects of an increasing number of co-located social companions on the quality of experience of virtual worlds, i.e., on presence, possibility of interaction, and co-presence. It also shows that variety in avatar/agent appearance might increase eeriness but might also stimulate an increased interest of participants about the environment.","Latoschik, M.

3228,,"This work suggests a control method for the terrain-following formation motion of a group of communicating autonomous agents. The presented approach centers on defining a suitable set of constraints for formation keeping task that shall be fulfilled while agents are negotiating an unknown terrain toward the predefined goal location. It allows agents to maintain a general geometric formation shape, while allowing each individual formation member freedom of maneuver, required for terrain collision free motion. Formation structure is defined with the use of virtual leader. Formation keeping constraints are defined with plane surfaces, specified relative to position and navigation vector of the virtual leader. Formation navigation and guidance constraints are defined using navigation vectors of formation members and the virtual leader. Alternative designs for the constraints derived with parabolic, cone, and cylindrical surfaces are considered. Formation control is derived using the Udwadia-Kalaba equation, following corresponding approach to the development of control methods for constraint based dynamical systems, including leader-follower systems defined using geometric constraints. Approach to terrain following motion requiring agents to stay within bounds of cylindrical corridor volumes built around their respective navigation vectors is assumed. Individual formation primitives and multi-level, hierarchical, formation structures are considered. Simulations, based on three degrees of freedom nonlinear model of an agent, performed using Mathematica and specifically developed combined Maya-Mathematica modeling and simulation system, demonstrate that a flexible terrain following formation motion is achieved with the presented sets of constraints.","Latyshev, Simon",0,,1151
3229,,"Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a new imaging modality for breast imaging. In tomosynthesis, multiple images of the compressed breast are acquired at different angles, and the projection view images are reconstructed to yield images of slices through the breast. One of the main problems to be addressed in the development of DBT is the optimal parameter settings to obtain images ideal for detection of cancer. Since it would be unethical to irradiate women multiple times to explore potentially optimum geometries for tomosynthesis, it is ideal to use a computer simulation to generate projection images. Existing tomosynthesis models have modeled scatter and detector without accounting for oblique angles of incidence that tomosynthesis introduces. Moreover, these models frequently use geometry-specific physical factors measured from real systems, which severely limits the robustness of their algorithms for optimization. The goal of this dissertation was to design the framework for a computer simulation of tomosynthesis that would produce images that are sensitive to changes in acquisition parameters, so an optimization study would be feasible. A computer physics simulation of the tomosynthesis system was developed. The x-ray source was modeled as a polychromatic spectrum based on published spectral data, and inverse-square law was applied. Scatter was applied using a convolution method with angle-dependent scatter point spread functions (sPSFs), followed by scaling using an angle-dependent scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR). Monte Carlo simulations were used to generate sPSFs for a 5-cm breast with a 1-cm air gap. Detector effects were included through geometric propagation of the image onto layers of the detector, which were blurred using depth-dependent detector point-spread functions (PRFs). Depth-dependent PRFs were calculated every 5-microns through a 200-micron thick CsI detector using Monte Carlo simulations. Electronic noise was added as Gaussian noise as a last step of the model. The sPSFs and detector PRFs were verified to match published data, and noise power spectrum (NPS) from simulated flat field images were shown to match empirically measured data from a digital mammography unit. A novel anthropomorphic software breast phantom was developed for 3D imaging simulation. Projection view images of the phantom were shown to have similar structure as real breasts in the spatial frequency domain, using the power-law exponent β to quantify tissue complexity. The physics simulation and computer breast phantom were used together, following methods from a published study with real tomosynthesis images of real breasts. The simulation model and 3D numerical breast phantoms were able to reproduce the trends in the experimental data. This result demonstrates the ability of the tomosynthesis physics model to generate images sensitive to changes in acquisition parameters.","Lau, Beverly Amy",0,,1152
3230,,"An increasing number of older workers, specifically middle-aged workers between 50 and 60 years of age, are staying in the workforce. Implicit stereotyping of middle-aged workers on aging may cause the formation of erroneous judgments about ability to learn new things compared to younger adults, resulting in a lack of performance or hesitation to learn new skills or training to learn them. Recent successes with the use of animated pedagogical agents in creating a social connection and changing attitudes might influence perceived ability to complete tasks successfully (“I can do it”). However, it is not clear what effect a fully embodied pedagogical agent (FEPA) with human-like gestures, facial expression, eye gaze, human voice, and body movements will have on the self-efficacy of middle-aged workers when engaged in a work-related learning task that requires the acquisition of new knowledge. A quantitative, experimental, pretest-posttest control-group design with two groups was conducted with a sample (N = 68) from a private medical school in the Southwest United States. An independent samples t test found no difference between groups on the gain scores. A general linear model repeated measures found no interaction between gender and age on pretest and posttest scores. A paired samples t test showed significance in gains between pre- and posttest; however, this was an expected result that validated the instructional module. No difference in gain scores may have occurred because both conditions used a human voice. No effect within and between subjects on gender and age may indicate that middle-aged learners compared to young adults are less influenced by the gender of a FEPA. Also, no difference between groups on the gain scores may indicate that human voice alone might be effective for supporting positive affective outcomes. Further research using a no FEPA, no voice condition may yield results to affirm the notion that human voice alone may be as effective as both FEPA and voice.","Laubscher, Rory R.",0,,1153
3231,Synchronization Can Influence Trust Following Virtual Interaction,"Synchronization has recently received attention as a form of interpersonal interaction that may affect the affiliative relationships of those engaged in it. While there is evidence to suggest that synchronized movements lead to increased affiliative behavior (Hove & Risen, 2009; Valdesolo & DeSteno, 2011; Wiltermuth & Heath, 2009), the influence of other interpersonal cues has yet to be fully controlled. The current study controls for these features by using computer algorithms to replace human partners. By removing genuine interpersonal interaction, it also tests whether sounds alone can influence affiliative relationships, when it appears that another human agent has triggered those sounds. Results suggest that subjective experience of synchrony had a positive effect on a measure of trust, but task success was a similarly good predictor. An objective measure of synchrony was only related to trust in conditions where participants were instructed to move at the same time as stimuli.","Launay, J.",0,10.1027/1618-3169/a000173,1154
3234,Invariant conditions in value system simulation models,"This paper presents a framework for the integration of supply chain (or logistics/distribution), value chain (or financial), and business process (or operational/manufacturing) simulation models, which should facilitate assessing the impact of supply chain and operational changes on an enterprise's financial performance. A Design Science approach is taken to demonstrate that the REA ontology, which provides a shared conceptual ground for these three model types, and its axioms, which describe invariant conditions for value systems, can help to build conceptually sound simulation models and identify the integration points between these models. It is further shown how these three types of simulation models can be integrated into one value system model for discrete event simulation, making use of the ExSpecT simulation tool. With this ontology-based framework, simulation model builders should be able to scope their models better and define integration points with other models, which is expected to promote the (re)use of simulation models for different purposes (e.g., simulating logistical, operational and financial performance).

3236,,"Contesting international strategies for combatting child labour that derive from modern, Western conceptions of childhood, several developing country organizations have embraced the principle of child protagonism by declaring that working children can become the leading agents in struggles to advance their interests when they are mentored in forming their own independent organizations. This thesis first explores how an African NGO, informed by its urban animation experiences, developed its own specific discourse of child protagonism and employed it as the basis for establishing an African working children's organization designed to provide compensatory literacy and skills training and to empower members to improve their own and other children's working conditions. The thesis considers this foundational child protagonism discourse in light of data collected in Senegal by means of participant observation and interviews in grassroots groups and associations of working children, as well as in the offices of both the local NGO and its international NGO donor. Fieldwork revealed limitations of the specific child protagonism practice pursued over the past two decades. Specifically, redirecting resources from direct pedagogical accompaniment of grassroots working child groups towards bureaucratic capacity building for the “autonomization” of higher hierarchical levels of the organization, as well as towards international meetings, has resulted in the organization's diminished impact for vulnerable groups in Dakar, particularly migrant girl domestic workers. Deepening implication with international donors has forced shifts in the priorities of the local NGO and the working children's organization it facilitates, yet the two have been largely successful in buffering donor probes precisely into the ground level effectiveness of their child protagonism strategy. No previous independent research has sought to confront the discourse of child protagonism with a comprehensive examination of a working children's organization's practice, from its most local processes to its international dimensions and donor relations.","Lavan, Daniel",0,,1156
3237,,"The Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE) first emerged as a warning against making industrial robots appear so highly human-like that they could unsettle the real humans around them. It proposed a specific pattern of negative emotional responses to entities that were almost but not quite human, and has been proposed as the reason why some entities such as dolls, mannequins and zombies may appear unsettling. The aim of this thesis was to move beyond an anecdotal explanation to understand more about the perception of near-human faces, and how this compares to the perception of human and non-human faces. The aims were to explore the relationship between the human-likeness of faces and emotional responses to them, to understand reactions to and descriptions of near-human faces, to explore aspects of how near-human faces are processed and to explore whether mismatched emotional expressions might contribute to the perception of some near-human faces as eerie. Five studies were carried out using face images whose human-likeness was systematically controlled or measured. A non-linear relationship between human-likeness and eeriness was found, but the near-human faces were not always the eeriest images. Near-human faces were found to be subject to the effects of inversion, and inversion was found to heighten perceptions of eeriness. Faces were created which contained mismatched emotional expressions, and the blends combining happy faces with angry or fearful eyes were rated as the most eerie. Incongruities between aspects of appearance or behaviour had been cited as explanations for the UVE in the past but this thesis presents the first evidence that differences in eeriness may result from incongruities between emotional expressions. Directions for future research have been suggested to explore these findings in a wider context and to understand more about the UVE.","Lay, Stephanie",0,,1157
3238,,"The uncanny valley effect (UVE) is a negative emotional response experienced when encountering entities that appear almost human. Research on the UVE typically investigates individual, or collections of, near human entities but may be prone to methodological circularity unless the properties that give rise to the emotional response are appropriately defined and quantified. In addition, many studies do not sufficiently control the variation in human likeness portrayed in stimulus images, meaning that the nature of stimuli that elicit the UVE is also not well defined or quantified. This article describes design criteria for UVE research to overcome the above problems by measuring three variables (human likeness, eeriness, and emotional response) and by using stimuli spanning the artificial to human continuum. These criteria allow results to be plotted and compared with the hypothesized uncanny valley curve and any effect observed can be quantified. The above criteria were applied to the methods used in a subset of existing UVE studies. Although many studies made use of some of the necessary measurements and controls, few used them all. The UVE is discussed in relation to this result and research methodology more broadly.

3242,,"A key issue in the architectural design of atria museums is the variety of ways users can interact with the three-dimensional layout of space to create emergent patterns of spatial navigation. This issue is addressed in the context of a coherent body of literature which, together with space syntax theory and method, real time observations, agent-based models and virtual reality environments provides a specific rigour in the spatial analysis of the layouts and exploration patterns. The intention is to evolve an overview of these three-dimensional spatial and navigational aspects; thus enriching the development of the two-dimensional space syntax approach and contributing to a better understanding of the architectural design of museums. Most space syntax studies on human navigation focus on spatial characteristics and route choices in two dimensions and have not yet properly addressed the effect of the third dimension on exploration. This thesis studies three European atria museums: the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh and the Acropolis Museum in Athens, which, taken together, provide a basis for investigating the theoretical and methodological questions of this thesis. The analysis begins from the apparent similarities among the museums, creating a suitable background for exploring critical differences with regards to their spatial layout and visiting patterns. The results deriving from this analysis are then used to create systematic variations in the virtual reality (VR) experiment being conducted at the Ashmolean Museum, examining correspondences between users’ experiences in the real and in virtual environments. Significant analogies are demonstrated between real and virtual behaviour with the findings showing how the museums’ three‐dimensional architectural design impacts significantly on the navigational processes of visitors. Although the atria in all three buildings are used as compositional devices structuring relationships between exhibition spaces and the three dimensional organisation of buildings, there are significant differences in terms of how this relationship is structured and the differing impacts produced on navigation patterns and gaze directions. The present study ultimately leads to a deeper understanding of architectural design regarding three-dimensional museum environments, and its implications for users’ social and cognitive processes.","Lazaridou, A.",0,,1159
3244,Spectres haunting: Postcommunism and postcolonialism,"In this essay, I attempt to take stock of recent suggestions that the literatures and cultures of the former Soviet bloc countries be considered ""postcolonial"". I begin by asking what is intended by this suggestion. While it is necessary to recognize that the Russian imperium and the Soviet order that succeeded it were clearly colonial in character, there are some good reasons to wonder whether the assimilation of ""post-Soviet"" criticism to ""the postcolonial"" is a good idea. Concerning postcolonial studies itself, I argue that the enterprise has hitherto been animated by a species of third worldism that has retarded understanding of the contemporary world-system; in particular, the post-olonialist idea of ""the west"" as the super-agent of domination in the modern global order strikes me as being deeply misconceived. On the ""post-Soviet"" side of the ledger, I worry both about a premature (if understandable) anti-Marxism and a tendency to insist precisely on that narrative of ""the west"" that postcolonial studies, in its indispensable critique of Eurocentrism, has managed to dislodge.","Lazarus, N.",0,10.1080/17449855.2012.658243,1160
3245,The influence of dynamics and speech on understanding humanoid facial expressions,"Human communication relies mostly on nonverbal signals expressed through body language. Facial expressions, in particular, convey emotional information that allows people involved in social interactions to mutually judge the emotional states and to adjust its behavior appropriately. First studies aimed at investigating the recognition of facial expressions were based on static stimuli. However, facial expressions are rarely static, especially in everyday social interactions. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the dynamics inherent in a facial expression could be fundamental in understanding its meaning. In addition, it has been demonstrated that nonlinguistic and linguistic information can contribute to reinforce the meaning of a facial expression making it easier to be recognized. Nevertheless, few studies have been performed on realistic humanoid robots. This experimental work aimed at demonstrating the human-like expressive capability of a humanoid robot by examining whether the effect of motion and vocal content influenced the perception of its facial expressions. The first part of the experiment aimed at studying the recognition capability of two kinds of stimuli related to the six basic expressions (i.e. anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise): static stimuli, that is, photographs, and dynamic stimuli, that is, video recordings. The second and third parts were focused on comparing the same six basic expressions performed by a virtual avatar and by a physical robot under three different conditions: (1) muted facial expressions, (2) facial expressions with nonlinguistic vocalizations, and (3) facial expressions with an emotionally neutral verbal sentence. The results show that static stimuli performed by a human being and by the robot were more ambiguous than the corresponding dynamic stimuli on which motion and vocalization were associated. This hypothesis has been also investigated with a 3-dimensional replica of the physical robot demonstrating that even in case of a virtual avatar, dynamic and vocalization improve the emotional conveying capability.","Lazzeri, N.",0,10.1177/1729881418783158,1161

3251,"Cultural and Identity Transmission in Mixed Couples in Quebec, Canada: Normalizing Plural Identities as a Path to Social Integration","Drawing on eighty interviews with mixed couples in Quebec, this article discusses how parents in such unions negotiate strategies of cultural transmission and develop identity projects for their children, that is, blueprints for the children's ethnic identities. Our data show that instead of one person having to take on the other's culture, and the children adopting that culture, both partners usually embrace cultural differences as enriching for themselves, their children, and the society in which they live. It is not so much a question of transmitting a heritage but rather making available a set of virtual cultural resources to the child that he or she will activate (or not) later in life. We argue that through the choices they make, mixed couples contribute to shaping a society where plural identities are normalized. In so doing, they become important agents of social change and participate in the creation of an enduring diversity, a long-term transformation of Quebec society, and even contribute to the multiple meanings of Quebecois.","Le Gall, J.",0,10.1177/0002716215602705,1163

It follows the development of the security epistemic community in these areas which formed a new identity of the settlers. The increase of religious-Zionist youth in combat units and officer courses in the IDF due to these academies altered the positioning of the settlers and all religious Zionists in Israeli society vis-a-vis non-religious elites, the ultra-orthodox, and religious-Zionist groups who did not join the pre-military academy revolution.

3257,,"This dissertation emerged in the wake of the 2008 real-estate crisis and a will to discuss, understand and project the role professional architecture might play in reorganizing collective stakes. The aim was to understand how architecture’s expert knowledge contributed to the political construction of reality. This was developed through the study of a group of Portuguese architects and architecture practices from mid-20th century, specifically from 1945 to 1969. The study of the career of Portuguese architect Fernando Távora (1923-2005) was the starting point and mediator to a specific collective universe of professional formation, urban development and political embattlement. Távora was agent of a culture of architecture in which the ideas of respecting the context, commitment to local needs and history, internationally projected by the reputation of Porto architects Álvaro Siza Vieira and Eduardo Souto de Moura, were first articulated. Thus, this dissertation transports a dual questioning: how did post-war Portuguese architects interpret the discipline as politically committed? And, what can we learn from this specific case about the political constitution of the practice of professional architecture? These questions are answered through the study of two elements of professional-political construction: expert discourses and their relations to government, power and political ideology; architecture designs and their relation to the transformation of Portuguese landscapes. The study of discourses cross-reads the development of architecture expert discourses with the emergence of problems of government and languages of power and govenment. This study of discourses derives from an ethnographic study of architecture designs, based on guidelines from material and spatial anthropology. This dissertation attempts to seize architectural designs in their articulations and projections of community, comfort, modernity and culture. The first part of the dissertation, comprising chapters 1 to 3, addresses the formation of a collective project for professional architecture developed by young architects in the post-war, and attempting to draw democratic ideals and practices closer. The second part, comprising chapters 4 to 6, addresses how this collective project of architecture involved the putting forward of a particular view of the city and its edifying mission in national well-being. The third part, comprising chapter 7, adresses how this style of apprehending the city was practiced in the case of an urban renewal process. These parts assemble together a specific urban history and culture, pedagogical experiments in architecture education, and architectural practices that sought to reframe Portuguese urban reality through a professional reframing. This dissertation discusses the intimacies and distinctions between a professional and a political project, transported by the debated identification of being Portuguese with being modern. It discusses how a project of architecture practice articulated a style of apprehending the city and, thus, of performing a desired urban community through the bodies of architecture. It presents arguments for the discussion of how modern architecture practices perform the nation-state and national culture. It identifies how an architecture for a true national culture, with a style of apprehending the city, made a political construction pass through the practice of spatial organization. This dissertation aims to contribute to the identification of some elements allowing to draw architecture’s expert culture closer to democracy.

3258,The Regional Healthcare Ecosystem Analyst (RHEA): a simulation modeling tool to assist infectious disease control in a health system,"Objective As healthcare systems continue to expand and interconnect with each other through patient sharing, administrators, policy makers, infection control specialists, and other decision makers may have to take account of the entire healthcare 'ecosystem' in infection control. Materials and methods We developed a software tool, the Regional Healthcare Ecosystem Analyst (RHEA), that can accept user-inputted data to rapidly create a detailed agent-based simulation model (ABM) of the healthcare ecosystem (ie, all healthcare facilities, their adjoining community, and patient flow among the facilities) of any region to better understand the spread and control of infectious diseases. Results To demonstrate RHEA's capabilities, we fed extensive data from Orange County, California, USA, into RHEA to create an ABM of a healthcare ecosystem and simulate the spread and control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Various experiments explored the effects of changing different parameters (eg, degree of transmission, length of stay, and bed capacity). Discussion Our model emphasizes how individual healthcare facilities are components of integrated and dynamic networks connected via patient movement and how occurrences in one healthcare facility may affect many other healthcare facilities. Conclusions A decision maker can utilize RHEA to generate a detailed ABM of any healthcare system of interest, which in turn can serve as a virtual laboratory to test different policies and interventions.","Lee, B.

3268,,"The increasingly diverse profiles of English users worldwide, fueled by globalization, bear witness to the hegemonic status of English as a global lingua franca. However, despite the current dynamic sociolinguistic realities, native speaker models and standards still endure as the primary benchmarks for English education in most parts of the world, propagating social, educational, and linguistic inequalities. In this ever-changing global linguistic landscape, English as a second/foreign language (ESL/EFL) teachers stand at the very center of these tensions, and there is a strong need for ESL/EFL teachers worldwide to enact educational changes for promoting linguistic equality. Otherwise, the firmly entrenched native speaker ideology will only reinforce the “othering” process of those who fall on the wrong side of the binary (i.e., “non” native English speakers), thereby restricting ownership of the world’s foremost powerful language. Teacher identity casts a major influence on teaching practices and thus, this study aims to shed light on the developmental trajectories of teacher identity formation. In particular, with the strong belief that teacher trainees, the future agents of the English language teaching arena, possess the potential to bring about change, this study aims to examine professional identity formations of four native English speaking and three non-native English speaking teacher trainees within the distinctive professional milieu of a U.S.-based second language (L2) teacher education program. The conceptual premise underpinning this study is that language and identity are inextricably intertwined and mutually constitutive. Hence, narrative interviews comprised the backbone of this study while a questionnaire and emailed documents merged together to present comprehensive contours of L2 teacher identity formations. Drawing on a narrative-biographical lens, this study first presents vignettes of the participants’ previous and personal backgrounds which have shaped their own teacher identity. Then, to unveil how the previous backgrounds are negotiated in their developing teacher identity, this study examines the participants’ educational experiences in the L2 teacher education program. Finally, to document the nexus of L2 teacher identity and native speaker status, this study ventures into underexplored territory by introducing voices from both native and non-native English speaking teacher trainees in contexts where traditional privilege and marginalization coexist. The research findings show that the participants bring their own socio-culturally derived conceptions of teacher identity to teacher education programs, which are largely aligned with their worldviews of what ideal teachers ought to be. The study findings also underscore the importance of L2 teacher education programs in establishing and reconstructing professional teacher identity, which occurred along three vectors: identity-in-discourse, identity-in-practice, and the development of discipline-specific professional knowledge (i.e., teacher language awareness). The study findings further indicate that there is an inextricable link between the participants’ native speaker statuses and their professional identity formations. The participants’ native speaker statuses condition their teacher identities by constructing perimeters around their strengths, weaknesses, professional roles, career trajectories and aspirations. The study findings confirm the existence of the hegemonic representation of standard English and native speaker ideology that are still deeply entrenched in today's increasingly globalized and multilingual world. Based on the key findings unearthed in this study, theoretical, and pedagogical implications are discussed.","Lee, HyeJin",0,,1169

In this study, university students learned words of a foreign language, with temporally contingent PAGI (live group) or recorded version of PAGI (recorded group), which played pre-recorded sequences from live sessions. The result revealed that students in the live group scored considerably better than those in the recorded group.

This study simulates product diffusion through multi-agent simulation (MAS) and determines product specifications that can maximise future sales by adapting ordinal optimisation. MAS constructs a virtual market of agents (consumers) and predicts the sales volume by simulating the product selection process of individual agents. By interacting with the MAS, the ordinal optimisation rapidly determines the product specifications of maximum sales with few computations. An empirical experiment conducted on the Korean smartphone market yielded interesting results, i.e., it is desirable for companies with high brand values not to offer low-performance products but to make additional efforts to increase satisfaction with hardware specifications, while a high-end policy of product quality and a low-price sales strategy may be more beneficial for increasing sales volumes for companies with low brand values.","Lee, H.",0,10.1080/01605682.2018.1447250,1171
3276,,"An important goal of intelligent systems is to carry out human-like actions, either alone or in collaboration with a person. Instead of requiring professional engineers to explicitly program these behaviors, systems could instead learn them automatically by observing videos of humans demonstrating the tasks. However, this is challenging due to the large number and variety of actions that people perform in the context of dynamic and uncontrolled real environments. For example, people may carry out the same action differently, or react differently to the same situation. Moreover, many human behaviors have complex movements that are difficult to observe accurately. In this thesis we describe novel computer vision approaches to observe and learn activities from human demonstration videos. We specifically focus on using first-person and close up videos for learning new activities, rather than traditional third-person videos that have static and global fields of view. Since the specific objective of these studies is to build intelligent agents that can interact with people, these types of videos are beneficial for understanding human movements, because first-person and close up videos are generally goal-oriented and have similar viewpoints as those of intelligent agents. We present new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches to learn the spatial/temporal structure of the demonstrated human actions, and use the learned structure and models to analyze human behaviors in new videos. We then demonstrate intelligent systems based on the proposed approaches in two contexts: (i) collaborative robot systems to assist users with daily tasks, and (ii) an educational scenario in which a system gives feedback on their movements. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our approach in enabling intelligent systems to observe and learn from human demonstration videos.","Lee, Jangwon",0,,1172
3277,Can Autonomous Vehicles Be Safe and Trustworthy? Effects of Appearance and Autonomy of Unmanned Driving Systems,"Although autonomous vehicles are increasingly becoming a reality, eliminating human intervention from driving may imply significant safety and trust-related concerns. To address this issue from a psychological perspective, this study applies layers of anthropomorphic cues to an artificial driving agent and explicates the process in which these cues promote positive evaluations and perceptions of an unmanned driving system. In a between-subjects factorial experiment (N = 89) consisting of three unmanned driving scenarios, participants interacted with an artificial driving agent with different levels of anthropomorphic cues induced by the variations in appearance (human-like vs. gadget-like) and autonomy (high vs. low) of the agent. The results indicated that human-like appearance and high autonomy were more effective in eliciting positive perceptions of the agent. In addition, a mediation analysis revealed that the greater level of anthropomorphism induced by human-like appearance and high autonomy in the agent evoked the feelings of social presence, which in turn positively affected the perceived intelligence and safety of and trust in the agent, suggesting that the extent to which users perceive the driving agent as intelligent, safe, and trustworthy is largely determined by the feelings of social presence experienced during their interaction.","Lee, J.

3281,Anthropomorphic Design: Emotional Perception for Deformable Object,"Despite the increasing number of studies on user experience (UX) and user interfaces (UI), few studies have examined emotional interaction between humans and deformable objects. In the current study, we investigated how the anthropomorphic design of a flexible display interacts with emotion. For 101 unique 3D images in which an object was bent at different axes, 281 participants were asked to report how strongly the object evoked five elemental emotions (e.g., happiness, disgust, anger, fear, and sadness) in an online survey. People rated the object's shape using three emotional categories: happiness, disgust-anger, and sadness-fear. It was also found that a combination of axis of bending (horizontal or diagonal axis) and convexity (bending convexly or concavely) predicted emotional valence, underpinning the anthropomorphic design of flexible displays. Our findings provide empirical evidence that axis of bending and convexity can be an important antecedent of emotional interaction with flexible objects, triggering at least three types of emotion in users.","Lee, J.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 408 survey responses obtained from Amazon website panels were used to test the proposed hypotheses through a structural equation modeling analysis. Findings - The results show that three dimensions of value-creating practices, namely, social networking, community engagement and brand use, had positive effects on trusting beliefs; trusting beliefs had positive effects on solution acceptance and stickiness; and solution acceptance had a positive effect on stickiness. Risk aversion moderated the trusting beliefs-stickiness relationship. Research limitations/implications - A key limitation of this study is related to the sample collected from Amazon website panels, which may limit the generalizability of results to other OTC members. The results have important theoretical and practical implications in OTC settings. For example, OTCs should be used by members as key platforms for acquiring trust information prior to their behaviors. Originality/value - This study extends the OTC literature by integrating different research realms into the proposed research model for a better understanding of the relationships between value-creating practices, trusting beliefs and OTC behaviors.","Lee, K.

This implies that there will be a negative impact on the suburban area that originally hosted the complex, but we do not know the magnitude of the impact. Therefore, this paper presents a micro-level estimation of the impact on the city commerce with an agent-based model. This model is calibrated by the micro-level population census data, the time-use data, and the geographic data. Agent behavior is formally specified to illustrate the daily activities of diverse population types, and particularly the model observes how many agents pass by commercial buildings of interest. With the described model, we performed a virtual experiment that examines the strengths of factors in negatively influencing the city commerce. After the experiment, we statistically validated the model with the survey data from the real world, which resulted in relatively high correlation between the real world and the simulations.","Lee, S.",0,10.18564/jasss.2719,1176

However, the empirical literature has had difficulty proving a basic tenet, namely that an agent has more success when the agent uses a signal. This paper provides evidence based on a field experiment in an online dating market. Participants are randomly endowed with two or eight ""virtual roses"" that a participant can use for free to signal special interest when asking for a date. Our results show that, by sending a rose, a person can substantially increase the chance of the offer being accepted, and this positive effect is neither because the rose attracts attention from recipients nor because the rose is associated with unobserved quality. Furthermore, we find evidence that roses increase the total number of dates, instead of crowding out offers without roses attached. Despite the positive effect of sending roses, a substantial fraction of participants do not fully utilize their endowment of roses and even those who exhaust their endowment on average do not properly use their roses to maximize their dating success.","Lee, S.",0,10.1007/s10683-014-9425-9,1177
3292,,"Interactive narrative environments offer significant potential for creating engaging narrative experiences. Increasingly, applications in education, training, and entertainment are leveraging narrative to create rich interactive experiences in virtual storyworlds. A key challenge posed by these environments is devising accurate models of director agents’ strategies that make director intervention and action decisions to craft customized story experiences for users. Director agents work behind the scenes to direct a cast of non-player characters and storyworld events for the unfolding narrative. Although a growing body of research has investigated techniques for modeling director agents in interactive narrative, prior work has focused on models learned from simulated data or pre-authored models. A promising approach is developing an empirically driven model of director agents’ decision-making strategies. In this work, we propose a dynamic Bayesian network framework for modeling director agent narrative decision-making. To create empirically informed models of director agent decision-making strategies, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study with an interactive narrative-centered learning environment. In the study, the wizard served as a “human director agent.” Machine learning was used to automatically acquire the conditional probabilities for the dynamic Bayesian networks. The machine-learned models were then empirically evaluated to investigate their effectiveness and efficiency in real-time. Results of the study are encouraging and suggest that empirically driven models of director agent decision-making strategies can offer significant predictive power.","Lee, Seung Y.",0,,1178

A two-way ANOVA test was conducted to analyze the effects of self-disclosure and reciprocity on user satisfaction with a conversational agent. The interactional effect of self-disclosure and reciprocity on user satisfaction was not significant, but the main effects proved to be both significant. PLS analysis results showed that perceived trust and interactional enjoyment are significant mediators in the relationship between communication variables and user satisfaction. In addition, reciprocity is a stronger variable than self-disclosure in predicting relationship building between an agent and a user. Finally, user satisfaction is an influential factor of intention to use. These findings have implications from both practical and theoretical perspective.","Lee, S.

3295,,"Electrochemistry is found to be a difficult topic to learn due to its abstract concepts that involve three representation levels. Research showed that animation and simulation using Information and Communication Technology can help students to visualize and thus enhance students' understanding in learning abstract chemistry topics. As a result, an interactive multimedia module with a pedagogical agent (IMMPA) named EC Lab was developed to assist students in the learning of Electrochemistry. There were 35 students and seven experts involved in this formative evaluation to test the usability and effectiveness of the module developed. Instruments involved were module evaluation questionnaire, module reliability questionnaire, module validity questionnaire, pretest, post-test and motivation questionnaire. Results showed that the students and experts rated the module developed as high (M = 3.94) and very high quality (M = 4.45). Besides, the respondents also see the module as reliable (M = 3.87) and valid (M = 4.51). Students have higher scores on their post-test and have gained higher motivation level after learning with the IMMPA EC Lab. However, some corrections and modifications have been made based on feedback and suggestions from the respondents to improve the quality of IMMPA EC Lab.","Lee, Tien Tien",0,,1180
3297,,"In order to evaluate the quality of Internet of Things (IoT) environments in smart houses, large datasets containing interactions between people and ubiquitous environments are essential for hardware and software testing. Both testing and simulation require a substantial amount of time and volunteer resources. Consequently, the ability to simulate these ubiquitous environments has recently increased in importance. In order to create an easy-to-use simulator for designing ubiquitous environments, we propose a simulator and autonomous agent generator that simulates human activity in smart houses. The simulator provides a three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI) that enables spatial configuration, along with virtual sensors that simulate actual sensors. In addition, the simulator provides an artificial intelligence agent that automatically interacts with virtual smart houses using a motivation-driven behavior planning method. The virtual sensors are designed to detect the states of the smart house and its living agents. The sensed datasets simulate long-term interaction results for ubiquitous computing researchers, reducing the testing costs associated with smart house architecture evaluation.

3305,The effects of various multimedia instructional materials on students' learning responses and outcomes: A comparative experimental study,"We examine whether an e-learning curriculum involving various multimedia instructional materials (MIMs) can stimulate learners' socialness perceptions, and whether the difference in style has a specific effect on the students' emotional states (arousal, pleasure, and flow experience) that consequently affect the students' learning motivations and learning outcomes. We apply an experimental design to three groups of students and compared three types of presentation methods: (a) a PowerPoint presentation (b) a PowerPoint presentation guided by a human-like animated character; (c) a PowerPoint presentation guided by a monster-like animated character. The analysis results show that various types of MIMs result in various social cues that have a significant effect on the students' socialness perceptions, arousal, pleasure, flow experience, learning motivation, and learning outcome. We contribute to the field of e-learning by integrating MIM, social response theory, flow theory, and learning theory into an innovative model, which sheds light on the perspective that the three groups of various MIMs stimulate an emotional state of students and maximize their learning outcomes. Therefore, when designing the e-learning curricula with animated characters, we recommend that teachers consider how these designs affect students' emotional responses to ensure the best learning outcomes.

3308,,"Cognitive disequilibrium and its affiliated affective state of confusion have been found to positively correlate with learning, presumably due to the effortful cognitive activities that accompany their experience. Although confusion naturally occurs in several learning contexts, we hypothesize that it can be induced and scaffolded to increase learning opportunities. We addressed the possibility of confusion induction in a study where learners engaged in trialogues on research methods concepts with animated tutor and student agents. Confusion was induced by staging disagreements and contradictions between the animated agents, and then inviting the (human) learners to provide their opinions. Self-reports of confusion indicated that the contradictions were successful at inducing confusion in the minds of the learners. A second, more objective, method of tracking learners’ confusion consisted of analyzing learners’ performance on forced-choice questions that were embedded after contradictions. This measure was also found to be revealing of learners’ underlying confusion. The contradictions alone did not result in enhanced learning gains. However, when confusion had been successfully induced, learners who were presented with contradictions did show improved learning compared to a no-contradiction control. Theoretical and applied implications along with possible future directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Lehman, Blair",0,,1183
3317,,"Confusion provides opportunities to learn at deeper levels. However, learners must put forth the necessary effort to resolve their confusion to convert this opportunity into actual learning gains. Learning occurs when learners engage in cognitive activities beneficial to learning (e.g., reflection, deliberation, problem solving) during the process of confusion resolution. Unfortunately, learners are not always able to resolve their confusion on their own. The inability to resolve confusion can be due to a lack of knowledge, motivation, or skills. The present dissertation explored methods to aid confusion resolution and ultimately promote learning through a multi-pronged approach. First, a survey revealed that learners prefer more information and feedback when confused and that they preferred different interventions for confusion compared to boredom and frustration. Second, expert human tutors were found to most frequently handle learner confusion by providing direct instruction and responded differently to learner confusion compared to anxiety, frustration, and happiness. Finally, two experiments were conducted to test the effectiveness of pedagogical and motivational confusion regulation interventions. Both types of interventions were investigated within a learning environment that experimentally induced confusion via the presentation of contradictory information by two animated agents (tutor and peer student agents). Results showed across both studies that learner effort during the confusion regulation task impacted confusion resolution and that learning occurred when the intervention provided the opportunity for learners to stop, think, and deliberate about the concept being discussed. Implications for building more effective affect-sensitive learning environments are discussed.","Lehman, Blair Allison",0,,1184
3318,In Good Company? Perception of Movement Synchrony of a Non-Anthropomorphic Robot,"Recent technological developments like cheap sensors and the decreasing costs of computational power have brought the possibility of robotic home companions within reach. In order to be accepted it is vital for these robots to be able to participate meaningfully in social interactions with their users and to make them feel comfortable during these interactions. In this study we investigated how people respond to a situation where a companion robot is watching its user. Specifically, we tested the effect of robotic behaviours that are synchronised with the actions of a human. We evaluated the effects of these behaviours on the robot's likeability and perceived intelligence using an online video survey. The robot used was Care-O-bot3, a non-anthropomorphic robot with a limited range of expressive motions. We found that even minimal, positively synchronised movements during an object-oriented task were interpreted by participants as engagement and created a positive disposition towards the robot. However, even negatively synchronised movements of the robot led to more positive perceptions of the robot, as compared to a robot that does not move at all. The results emphasise a) the powerful role that robot movements in general can have on participants' perception of the robot, and b) that synchronisation of body movements can be a powerful means to enhance the positive attitude towards a non-anthropomorphic robot.","Lehmann, H.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0127747,1185
3322,,"When interacting, people imitate each other. This tendency is truly ubiquitous and occurs in many different situations and behaviours. But what causes it? Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to imitation. In this thesis, I focus on three candidate mechanisms: simulation, temporal adaptation, and the goal to affiliate with others. I start by discussing different imitative behaviours, and reviewing the evidence that imitation might at times emerge spontaneously. I also review the evidence suggesting that the three candidate mechanisms might be involved in such emergent imitation. Then, I present three sets of experiments. In the first set, I investigate the role of simulation in language processing. In three experiments, I test the hypothesis that comprehenders use their language production system to simulate their interlocutor, which in turn facilitates their ability to predict the next word they will see or hear. I manipulate whether participants read the sentences silently or aloud and measure their ability to predict the final word of a sentence. My results demonstrate that prediction is enhanced when people use their production system during reading aloud. This gives some credence to the idea that simulation is routinely engaged in language processing, which in turn opens up a possibility that it may contribute to linguistic imitation. In the second set of experiments, I investigate whether temporal adaptation leads agents to imitate features of their partner’s actions. In three experiments, I test this by manipulating the partner’s response speed and the information about the partner’s actions. I show that agents imitate response speed when they are able to observe the partner. Moreover, they adapt to the specific temporal pattern of their partner’s actions. These findings provide evidence for the engagement of the temporal adaptation mechanism during motor interactions, and for its involvement in imitation. In the third set of experiments, I turn to the hypothesis that people engage in linguistic imitation because they want to harness the social benefits it brings. I investigate a key assumption of this hypothesis: that imitation has positive consequences for the social interaction. In three experiments, I manipulate whether participants’ word choice is imitated or counter-imitated by their conversational partner and measure how it affects the participants’ evaluation of the interaction and the partner, and their willingness to cooperate with the partner. I find evidence that linguistic imitation has positive social consequences. These results are consonant with the claim that imitation is motivated by the goal to affiliate and foster social relations. Taken together, these findings suggest that imitation might occur both in motor actions and language, and that it might have diverse causes. My work on language suggests that the tendency to linguistically imitate others could both result from the simulation mechanism, and be motivated by the goal to affiliate. My work on motor actions shows that automatic temporal adaptation contributes to emergent imitation during interactions. This research is conducive to the greater aim of cross-examining the currently known mechanisms of imitation.","Lelonkiewicz, Jarosław Roman",0,,1186

Topics related to the ways, means, and outcomes of SNS use in education and training contexts constitute a fresh research area within the field of educational technology. This mixed-methods research project gathered information regarding the use of SNS in education and training settings. Respondents to an Internet survey showed familiarity with a range of social media software, and several had used social network sites including Facebook, Ning, and MySpace in their professional practices. Respondents identified these sites as offering support for communication and community building, and rated this affordance as the most useful aspect of SNS for use in educational settings. Privacy control settings were the individual SNS feature identified as most important in the educational use of SNS. Personal publishing, content creation, and multimedia display functions were also rated as important. Respondents supported the utility of social network sites for use in the delivery of education. Themes expressed in the data regarding participant views of the use and importance of various features of educational social software indicated apparent acceptance of SNS-type tools as potential agents of paradigmatic change (as per Kuhn, 1996) in educational domains. Respondents made substantial commitments to working toward support of a new paradigm shaped by the use of SNS and social media tools.","LeNoue, Marvin Dale",0,,1187

3325,Engaging adolescents in a computer-based weight management program: avatars and virtual coaches could help,"Objective This research focuses on the potential ability of animated avatars (a digital representation of the user) and virtual agents (a digital representation of a coach, buddy, or teacher) to deliver computer-based interventions for adolescents' chronic weight management. An exploration of the acceptance and desire of teens to interact with avatars and virtual agents for self-management and behavioral modification was undertaken. Materials and Methods The utilized approach was inspired by community-based participatory research. Data was collected from 2 phases: Phase 1) focus groups with teens, provider interviews, parent interviews; and Phase 2) mid-range prototype assessment by teens and providers. Results Data from all stakeholder groups expressed great interest in avatars and virtual agents assisting self-management efforts. Adolescents felt the avatars and virtual agents could: 1) reinforce guidance and support, 2) fit within their lifestyle, and 3) help set future goals, particularly after witnessing the effect of their current behavior(s) on the projected physical appearance (external and internal organs) of avatars. Teens wanted 2 virtual characters: a virtual agent to act as a coach or teacher and an avatar (extension of themselves) to serve as a ""buddy"" for empathic support and guidance and as a surrogate for rewards. Preferred modalities for use include both mobile devices to accommodate access and desktop to accommodate preferences for maximum screen real estate to support virtualization of functions that are more contemplative and complex (e.g., goal setting). Adolescents expressed a desire for limited co-user access, which they could regulate. Data revealed certain barriers and facilitators that could affect adoption and use. Discussion The current study extends the support of teens, parents, and providers for adding avatars or virtual agents to traditional computer-based interactions. Data supports the desire for a personal relationship with a virtual character in support of previous studies. The study provides a foundation for further work in the area of avatar-driven motivational interviewing. Conclusions This study provides evidence supporting the use of avatars and virtual agents, designed using participatory approaches, to be included in the continuum of care. Increased probability of engagement and long-term retention of overweight, obese adolescent users and suggests expanding current chronic care models toward more comprehensive, socio-technical representations.","LeRouge, C.",0,10.1093/jamia/ocv078,1189

3331,,"Teachers’ professional development tended to be centered upon how to enrich teachers’ professional knowledge and pedagogical skills for improvement of students’ learning or even how to restructure and reconstruct the school for the transformation of educational structure and culture. Yet, in fact, the crux of the matter is whether teachers’ professional knowledge and their pedagogical skill can still be put to use in face of many situational constraints. Given the fact that these 15 years of educational change seemed to be making about-face turn, can teachers still have alternative ways to unleash their interior professional capacities? This study is an action research drawing upon Gadamer’s theory of ‘hermeneutic of experience of language’ in an attempt to explore the spatiality and feasibility of teachers’ professional development as individuals. This study design consisted of 3 stages. In the first phase, five teachers were invited to narrate their teaching experiences, reflect on the roles they played as teachers in the turbulent situation, and explore their personal values. As for the second phase, the researcher uncovered her personal teaching experience to broaden the interviewees’ perspectives. When it came to the last phase, the researcher adopted the “hermeneutics experience of language” approach in interacting with the interviewees on an equal basis so as to facilitate both parties’ deeper reflection on the value of education. Through this action research, three important findings were identified. As shown in the first phase of study, it was found that the five interviewees’ relatively simple ‘fore-structure of understanding’ at their entry into the profession did have an impact on their later teaching performance. Besides, their lack of awareness of ‘the principle of history of effect’ did weaken their responsiveness to the sudden changes in the macro social setting and micro school environment. As a result, when confronted with the ‘diversity’, ‘volatility’ and ‘uncertainty’ of the teaching profession while at the same time, having to cope with the challenges brought about by the situational changes, the five interviewees suffered from a varying degree of imbalance. From the second phase of study, it was found that ‘the principle of history of effect’ had some effect on the five interviewees’ ‘self-understanding’. The researcher made a written account of the interviewees’ narrations and then reorganized them. Reading their own stories from a different perspective not only helped them realize how ‘the principle of history of effect’ had influenced their understanding about a teacher’s role, but also threw light on different views towards teaching professionalism. The researcher’s own story further facilitated interviewees’ reflection and recollection of their teaching experiences. The researcher’s story was like a mirror, enabling the interviewees to notice the similarities and differences in their teaching as compared to the researcher’s. This interplay between familiar and strange experiences as a result made an imperceptible impact, preparing them for the next phase of ‘hermeneutics of experience of language’. According to the findings in the third phase of study, ‘hermeneutics of experience of language’ could facilitate a teacher’s professional growth and understanding. As stated by Gadamer, exchanges had the power to transform, and as long as the exchanges were successful, both parties would experience changes. Admittedly, when the researcher and the interviewees were interacting and exchanging their experiences on a professional platform with equality and openness as well as viewing issues from new perspectives, they could get new understanding and knowledge about different educational issues. This research has demonstrated how the five interviewees were shaped by ‘the principle of history of effect’ and how the agents of ‘narrative studies’ and ‘hermeneutics of experience of language’ enhanced","Leung, Chung Yin",0,,1191

In the present study we investigated the involvement of the larynx motor representation in singing perception. Twenty-one non-musicians listened to short tones sung by a human voice or played by a machine and performed a categorization task. Thereafter continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the right larynx premotor area or on the vertex and the test administered again. Overall, reaction times (RTs) were shorter after stimulation over both sites. Nonetheless and most importantly, RTs became longer for sung than for ""machine"" sounds after stimulation on the larynx area. This effect suggests that the right premotor region is functionally involved in singing perception and that sound humanness modulates motor resonance.","Leveque, Y.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00418,1193

3344,"Tests of Concepts About Different Kinds of Minds: Predictions About the Behavior of Computers, Robots, and People","This research investigates adults' understanding of differences in the basic nature of intelligence exhibited by humans and by machines such as computers and robots. We tested these intuitions by asking participants to make predictions about the behaviors of different entities in situations where actions could be based on either goal-directed intentional thought or more mechanical nonintentional thought. Across several studies, adults made more intentional predictions about the behavior of humans than about the behavior of robots or computers. Although initial experiments demonstrated that participants made very similar predictions for computers and anthropomorphic robots, when asked to track robots' attention to objects, participants began to predict more intentional behaviors for the robot. A multiple regression demonstrated that differential behavioral predictions about mechanical and human entities were associated with ratings of goal understanding but not overall intelligence of current computers/robots. These findings suggest that people differentiate humans and computers along the lines of intentionality but initially equate robots and computers. However, the tendency to equate computers and robots can be at least partially overridden when attention is focused on robots engaging in intentional behavior.","Levin, D.

3349,Security of Separated Data in Cloud Systems with Competing Attack Detection and Data Theft Processes,"Empowered by virtualization technology, service requests from cloud users can be honored through creating and running virtual machines. Virtual machines established for different users may be allocated to the same physical server, making the cloud vulnerable to co-residence attacks where a malicious attacker can steal a user's data through co-residing their virtual machines on the same server. For protecting data against the theft, the data partition technique is applied to divide the user's data into multiple blocks with each being handled by a separate virtual machine. Moreover, early warning agents (EWAs) are deployed to possibly detect and prevent co-residence attacks at a nascent stage. This article models and analyzes the attack success probability (complement of data security) in cloud systems subject to competing attack detection process (by EWAs) and data theft process (by co-residence attackers). Based on the suggested probabilistic model, the optimal data partition and protection policy is determined with the objective of minimizing the user's cost subject to providing a desired level of data security. Examples are presented to illustrate effects of different model parameters (attack rate, number of cloud servers, number of data blocks, attack detection time, and data theft time distribution parameters) on the attack success probability and optimization solutions.","Levitin, G.",0,10.1111/risa.13219,1196

In a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment, observers watched one of four versions of a dialogue between a customer and sales support agent, which differed with respect to the agent's response latency and conversational contingency. Results confirmed deleterious effects of non-contingency on outcomes. Contingency moderated latency effects.

This phenomenon, known as the uncanny valley, is assumed to be evolutionary in origin, perhaps tapping into modules for disgust or attractiveness that detect violations of our normal expectations regarding social signals. Here, we test an alternative hypothesis that the uncanny valley is developmental in origin and, thus, that specific early experience with real human faces leads to its eventual emergence. To test this idea, we measured visual preferences in response to all possible pairs of a human face, realistic avatar face, and an unrealistic avatar face in groups of 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-month-old infants. Consistent with the developmental hypothesis, we found that the uncanny valley effect emerges at 12 months of age suggesting that perceptual experience with real human faces is critical to its emergence.

Using radical constructivism, society can be considered from the perspective of asking the question, ""Who conceives of society?"" In Luhmann's social systems theory, this question itself is considered as a construct of the communication among reflexive agents. > Problem . Structuration of expectations by codes operating in interhuman communications positions both communicators and communications in a multi-dimensional space in which their relations can be provided with meaning at the supra-individual level. The codes can be functionally different and symbolically generalized. > Method . More than Luhmann, I focus on the hypothetical status of the communication of meaning and the uncertainty involved. Meaning can be communicated because of reflexivity in interhuman communications; meaning cannot be observed. > Results . The communication (and reflexive translation) of denotations between semantic domains can generate ""horizons of meaning"" as reflexive orders that remain structurally coupled to individual minds. This elusive order contains a trade-off between ""organization"" at interfaces integrating (differently coded) expectations at each moment of time, and the potential of further differentiation among symbolically generalized codes of communication in a ""self-organization"" over time. > Implications . One can model the coding in the communication of meaning as latent variables (eigenvectors) that evolve as an implication of the interacting intentions and expectations. The structure of expectations can be visualized (at each moment) and animated (over time) using semantic maps. The self-organizing horizons of meaning operate in a multidimensional space different from the network topology, and at another pace, since meaning is provided to events from the perspective of hindsight. > Constructivist content . This perspective of the radical constructedness of social reality transforms the status of agency and organization in sociological theorizing from a source of change to a resource of communicative competencies and reflexive performativity.","Leydesdorff, L.",0,,1199
3359,Development of engagement evaluation method and learning mechanism in an engagement enhancing rehabilitation system,"Maintaining and enhancing engagement of patients during stroke rehabilitation exercises are in the focus of current research. There have been various methods and computer supported tools developed for this purpose, which try to avoid mundane exercising that is prone to become a routine or even boring for the patients and leads to ineffective training. This paper proposes a strategy bundle-based smart learning mechanism (SLM) to increase the efficiency of rehabilitation exercises. The underpinning strategy considers motor, perceptive, cognitive and emotional aspects of engagement. Part of a cyber-physical stroke rehabilitation system (CP-SRS), the proposed SLM is able to learn the relationship between the actual engagement levels and applied stimulations. From a computational point of view, the SLM is based on multiplexed signal processing and a machine learning agent. The paper presents the mathematical concepts of signal processing, the reasoning algorithms, and the overall embedding of the SLM in the CP-SRS. Regression and classification are two possible solutions for this learning mechanism. Computer simulation is conducted to investigate the limitations of the proposed learning mechanism and compare the results of different machine learning methods. We simulate regression with artificial neural network (ANN), and classification with ANN and Naive Bayes (NB). Results show that classification with NB is more promising in practice since it is less sensitive to the deviations in the inputs than the applied version of ANN. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

3363,"Spatial analysis of dual-scale water stresses based on water footprint accounting in the Haihe River Basin, China","Water scarcity and degradation of water quality in river basins are among the major issues addressed by water resources management authorities. Moreover, two typical challenges associated with water resources management include naturally unbalanced distribution and administrative disparities under multiple jurisdictions at the watershed scale. Effective accounting and management methods are thus desired to deal with such challenges. Water footprint accounting is widely used for assessing natural water resources availability and supporting optimal allocation among multiple jurisdictions, representing a useful tool for improving watershed sustainability. Not only will this enable successful revealing of the direct water consumption by relevant agents, but also indirect water consumption by concerning users. Such a method is particularly useful for addressing water-related issues in numerous watersheds of developing countries, which are subject to diverse water stressors. Hence, this study aimed at conducting water footprint accounting under city/regional and basin scales for the investigation of the amounts of blue and gray water in the Haihe River Basin (HRB), China. The Blue Water Footprint Index (BWFI) and the Gray Water Footprint Capacity Coefficient (K) were introduced to comprehensively evaluate water scarcity in terms of quantity and quality. The results revealed that all cities of the HRB suffered from extreme water scarcity. The industrial sector was identified as the primary contributor to the blue water footprint at the watershed. The agricultural gray-water footprint of the HRB accounted for 54% of the total. The exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) was adopted to analyze the spatial auto-correlation features of blue and gray water in the HRB. The results indicated that Dezhou and Binzhou had the highest water deficiency in both of the water stresses, and that Xinxiang, Puyang, Anyang and Jiaozuo had the highest water problem predominantly due to water quality stress.","Li, C.

3367,,"The dissertation examined the impact of agents’ conversational formality on the learning of summarization skills and learner impressions in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) with trialogues (a teacher agent, a student agent, and a human learner). Formal language is in the informational genre (as opposed to narrative) and increases with word abstractness, syntactic complexity, referential cohesion, and deep cohesion. At the other end of the continuum, informal discourse tends to have concrete words, simple syntax, low cohesion (because knowledge-based inferences can fill the gaps), and high narrativity. There have been no experimental investigations that have manipulated teacher language because it is difficult and unreliable to have teachers systematically change their language in real world settings. This dissertation manipulated agents’ communication language with three styles: (1) a formal condition in which both the teacher agent and the student agent spoke with a formal communication style, (2) an informal condition in which both agents spoke informally, and (3) a mixed condition in which the teacher agent spoke formally, whereas the student agent spoke informally. Unfortunately, results did not show significant effects of the formality manipulation on learning performance and learner impressions when adjusted with Bonferroni correction for 16 tests.

A qualitative assessment of the direction of quantitative effects demonstrated that robots were more persuasive and perceived more positively when physically present in a user's environment than when digitally-displayed on a screen either as a video feed of the same robot or as a virtual character analog; robots also led to better user performance when they were collocated as opposed to shown via video on a screen. However, participants did not respond differently to physical robots and virtual agents when both were displayed digitally on a screen - suggesting that physical presence, rather than physical embodiment, characterizes people's responses to social robots. Implications for understanding psychological response to physical and virtual agents and for methodological design are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

3369,Simulation of cross-border competitions of free Internet content providers,"This paper describes the cross-border competition between two of the largest free Internet content providers in China through the use of multi-agent technology. Case studies are conducted for both TENCENT and Qihoo 360, with their customers being simulated as agents in a model for products selection. The result of different competition strategies of the two enterprises is obtained from the virtual market. The results indicate that cross-border competition is unable to improve the market share of the two leading Internet content providers. The findings suggest that keeping one of the three proposed Nash equilibriums is the recommended strategy for companies involved in cross-border competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

3372,Adaptive learning algorithm of self-organizing teams,"In order to improve the ability of achieving good performance in self-organizing teams, this paper presents a self-adaptive learning algorithm for team members. Members of the self-organizing teams are simulated by agents. In the virtual self-organizing team, agents adapt their knowledge according to cooperative principles. The self-adaptive learning algorithm is approached to learn from other agents with minimal costs and improve the performance of the self-organizing team. In the algorithm, agents learn how to behave (choose different game strategies) and how much to think about how to behave (choose the learning radius). The virtual team is self-adaptively improved according to the strategies' ability of generating better quality solutions in the past generations. Six basic experiments are manipulated to prove the validity of the adaptive learning algorithm. It is found that the adaptive learning algorithm often causes agents to converge to optimal actions, based on agents' continually updated cognitive maps of how actions influence the performance of the virtual self-organizing team. This paper considered the influence of relationships in self-organizing teams over existing works. It is illustrated that the adaptive learning algorithm is beneficial to both the development of self-organizing teams and the performance of the individual agent. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

3375,Social robots and virtual agents as lecturers for video instruction,"One emerging convention in video lectures is to show presentation slides with an inset video of the instructor's head. Substituting a robot or a digital agent for the video of the instructor could radically decrease production time and cost; thus, the influence of a digital agent or robot on the learner should be evaluated. Agent-based alternatives for a talking head were assessed with an experiment comparing human and agent lecturers in a video from a popular online course. Participants who saw the inset video of the actual lecturer replaced by an animated human lecturer recalled less information than those who saw the recording of the human lecturer. However, when the actual lecturer was replaced with a social robot, knowledge recall was higher with an animated robot than a recording of a real robot. This effect on knowledge recall was moderated by gender. Attitudes were more positive toward human lecturers than toward robots. An initial proof-of-concept demonstrates that although a human lecturer is preferable, robotic and virtual agents may be viable alternatives if designed properly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

3383,Integrating representation learning and skill learning in a human-like intelligent agent,"Building an intelligent agent that simulates human learning of math and science could potentially benefit both cognitive science, by contributing to the understanding of human learning, and artificial intelligence, by advancing the goal of creating humanlevel intelligence. However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge; in addition to being a poor model of human acquisition of prior knowledge, manual knowledge-encoding is both time-consuming and error-prone. Previous research has shown that one of the key factors that differentiates experts and novices is their different representations of knowledge. Experts view the world in terms of deep functional features, while novices view it in terms of shallow perceptual features. Moreover, since the performance of learning algorithms is sensitive to representation, the deep features are also important in achieving effective machine learning. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm that acquires representation knowledge in the form of ""deep features"", and demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain of algebra as well as synthetic domains. We integrate this algorithm into a machine-learning agent, SimStudent, which learns procedural knowledge by observing a tutor solve sample problems, and by getting feedback while actively solving problems on its own. We show that learning ""deep features"" reduces the requirements for knowledge engineering. Moreover, we propose an approach that automatically discovers student models using the extended SimStudent. By fitting the discovered model to real student learning curve data, we show that it is a better student model than human-generated models, and demonstrate how the discovered model may be used to improve a tutoring system's instructional strategy.

The regulation of p70S6K1 is controlled by multiple phosphorylation events in its catalytic, autoinhibitory and hydrophobic domains. The mTORC1 and S6 kinase (S6K) pathways are involved in the physiology of diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, benign tumor syndrome, organ hypertrophy, neurological disorders and aging. Molecules were identified by virtual screenings that are potential p70S6K1 inhibitors. The occurrence of a more specific inhibitor than staurosporine (STU) for p70S6K1 was detected by testing the main plane, hydrogen bonds and specificity on alternative kinases (MAPK,e.g). Ligand 1571 was specific for p70S6K1 and did not bind to other protein kinases. Ligand 1571 was a more specific inhibitor for p70S6K1 than STU.

3389,Getting the point: Which kinds of gestures by pedagogical agents improve multimedia learning?,"Previous studies have shown that students learn better from an online lesson when a gesturing pedagogical agent is added (Mayer & DaPra, 2012; Wang, Li, Mayer, & Liu, 2018). The goal of this study is to pinpoint which aspect of a gesturing pedagogical agent causes an improvement in learning from an online lesson. College students learned about neural transmission in an online multimedia lesson that included a pedagogical agent who displayed specific pointing gestures (i.e., pointing to the specific component in the diagram being mentioned in the narration), general pointing gestures (i.e., pointing in the general direction of the diagram), nonpointing gestures (moving hands as beats, moving an arm up or down, or crossing two hands), or no gestures. An analysis of students’ eye movements during learning showed that students in the specific-pointing group paid more attention to task-related elements than did students in the other groups (as indicated by fixation time and fixation count on the target area of interest). Students in the specific-pointing group also performed better than the other groups on retention and transfer tests administered immediately after the lesson and after a 1-week delay. The results show that an active ingredient in effective pedagogical agents is the use of specific pointing gestures. This work helps clarify the embodiment principle and image principle by isolating specific pointing (or deictic gestures) as a key feature that makes gesturing effective in multimedia lessons.

3412,,"Modular vehicles are vehicles with interchangeable substantial components also known as modules. Fleet modularity provides extra operational flexibility through on-field actions, in terms of vehicle assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration (ADR). The ease of assembly and disassembly of modular vehicles enables them to achieve real-time fleet reconfiguration, which is proven as beneficial in promoting fleet adaptability and in saving ownership costs. The objective of military fleet operation is to satisfy uncertain demands on time while providing vehicle maintenance. To quantify the benefits and burdens from modularity in military operation, a decision support system is required to yield autonomously operation strategies for comparing the (near) optimal fleet performance for different vehicle architectures under diverse scenarios. The problem is challenging because: 1) fleet operation strategies are numerous, especially when modularity is considered; 2) operation actions are time-delayed and time-varying; 3) vehicle damages and demands are highly uncertain; 4) available capacity for ADR actions and vehicle repair is constrained. Finally, to explore advanced tactics enabled by fleet modularity, the competition between human-like and adversarial forces is required, where each force is capable to autonomously perceive and analyze field information, learn enemy's behavior, forecast enemy's actions, and prepare an operation plan accordingly. Currently, methodologies developed specifically for fleet competition are only valid for single type of resources and simple operation rules, which are impossible to implement in modular fleet operation. This dissertation focuses on a new general methodology to yield decisions in operating a fleet of autonomous military vehicles/robots in both conventional and modular architectures. First, a stochastic state space model is created to represent the changes in fleet dynamics caused by operation actions. Then, a stochastic model predictive control is customized to manage the system dynamics, which is capable of real-time decision making. Including modularity increases the complexity of fleet operation problem, a novel intelligent agent based model is proposed to ensure the computational efficiency and also imitate the collaborative decisions making process of human-like commanders. Operation decisions are distributed to several agents with distinct responsibility. Agents are designed in a specific way to collaboratively make and adjust decisions through selectively sharing information, reasoning the causality between events, and learning the other's behavior, which are achieved by real-time optimization and artificial intelligence techniques. To evaluate the impacts from fleet modularity, three operation problems are formulated: (i) simplified logistic mission scenario: operate a fleet to guarantee the readiness of vehicles at battlefields considering the stochasticity in inventory stocks and mission requirements; (ii) tactical mission scenario: deliver resources to battlefields with stochastic requirements of vehicle repairs and maintenance; (iii) attacker-defender game: satisfy the mission requirements with minimized losses caused by uncertain assaults from an enemy. The model is also implemented for a civilian application, namely the real-time management of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs). As the number of RMS configurations increases exponentially with the size of the line and demand changes frequently, two challenges emerge: how to efficiently select the optimal configuration given limited resources, and how to allocate resources among lines. According to the ideas in modular fleet operation, a new mathematical approach is presented for distributing the stochastic demands and exchanging machines or modules among lines (which are groups of machines) as a bidding process, and for adaptively configuring these lines and machines for the resulting shared demand under a limited inventory of configurable components.","Li, Xingyu",0,,1212
3413,Two-stage interaction between word order and noun animacy during online thematic processing of sentences in Mandarin Chinese,"How different sources of linguistic information are used during online language comprehension is a central question in psycholinguistic research. This study used eye-tracking and electrophysiological techniques to investigate how and when word order and noun animacy interact with each other during online thematic processing of Mandarin Chinese sentences. The initial argument in the sentence is animate or inanimate and the following verb disambiguates it as an agent or patient. The results at the verb revealed that, at the early processing stage, the patient-first sentences elicited longer gaze duration and larger N400 than the agent-first ones only when the initial argument was inanimate; however, at the late stage, the patient-first sentences elicited prolonged second-pass time and enhanced P600 only when the initial argument was animate. In addition, the brain oscillations at the verb also showed different patterns in the early and later window latencies. The present results suggested that the online thematic processing of Mandarin Chinese sentences involves not only universal processing strategies (subject-preference) but also language-specific strategies as well. That is, in Mandarin Chinese, noun animacy interacts with word order immediately during online sentence comprehension; the initial processing results can be overridden by additional interpretively relevant information types at a later stage. Those results provided important indications for the language comprehension models.","Li, X. Q.",0,10.1080/23273798.2014.954590,1213
3417,How the speed of working memory updating influences the on-line thematic processing of simple sentences in Mandarin Chinese,"This ERP study used electrophysiological technique to examine how individual differences in the speed of working memory updating influence the use of syntactic and semantic information during on-line sentence argument interpretation, and the time course of that working memory updating effect. The basic structure of the experimental sentences was ""Noun + Verb + adverb + 'le' + a two-character word"", with the Noun being the sentence initial argument. This initial argument is animate or inanimate and the following verb disambiguates it as an agent or patient. The results at the initial argument revealed that, the quick-updating group elicited a larger positivity over the frontal cortex (within 500-800 ms post-noun onset) as compared with the slow-updating group. At the following disambiguating verb, the slow-updating group only showed a word order effect, indicating that the patient-first condition elicited a larger P600 (within 500-1,000 ms post-verb onset) than the agent-first one; for the quick-updating group, at the early stage of processing, the patient-first sentences elicited a larger N400 (within 300-500 ms post-verb onset) than the agent-first ones only when the initial argument was inanimate; however, at the late stage, the patient-first sentences elicited an enhanced P600 (within 800-1,000 ms post-verb onset) only when the initial argument was animate. These results suggested that the speed of working memory updating not only influences the maintenance of sentence argument when the contents of working memory change but also influences the efficiency of integrating that argument with the verb at a late time point. When integrating the argument with the disambiguating verb, individuals with quick-updating ability can combine multiple sources of information (both noun animacy and word order), and conduct rapid and fine-grained two-stage processing; individuals with slow-updating ability, however, only rely on one dominant source of information types (word order), and conducted slow and course-grained processing.","Li, X.

3421,4D-SAS: A Distributed Dynamic-Data Driven Simulation and Analysis System for Massive Spatial Agent-Based Modeling,"Significant computation challenges are emerging as agent-based modeling becomes more complicated and dynamically data-driven. In this context, parallel simulation is an attractive solution when dealing with massive data and computation requirements. Nearly all the available distributed simulation systems, however, do not support geospatial phenomena modeling, dynamic data injection, and real-time visualization. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed dynamic-data driven simulation and analysis system (4D-SAS) specifically for massive spatial agent-based modeling to support real-time representation and analysis of geospatial phenomena. To accomplish large-scale geospatial problem-solving, the 4D-SAS system was spatially enabled to support geospatial model development and employs high-performance computing to improve simulation performance. It can automatically decompose simulation tasks and distribute them among computing nodes following two common schemes: order division or spatial decomposition. Moreover, it provides streaming channels and a storage database to incorporate dynamic data into simulation models; updating agent context in real-time. A new online visualization module was developed based on a GIS mapping library, SharpMap, for an animated display of model execution to help clients understand the model outputs efficiently. To evaluate the system's efficiency and scalability, two different spatially explicitly agent-based models, an en-route choice model, and a forest fire propagation model, were created on 4D-SAS. Simulation results illustrate that 4D-SAS provides an efficient platform for dynamic data-driven geospatial modeling, e.g., both discrete multi-agent simulation and grid-based cellular automata, demonstrating efficient support for massive parallel simulation. The parallel efficiency of the two models is above 0.7 and remains nearly stable in our experiments.","Li, Z. Q.",0,10.3390/ijgi5040042,1215

Users will inevitably self-disclose some types of personal information while interacting with IoT-CAs. In this study, users' willingness to disclose different types of information to IoT-CAs in two smart spaces (living space and workspace) and two user contexts (one user or two users) was investigated. One living space and one workspace were built for users to experience interactions with IoT-CAs. Subsequently, users' willingness to self-disclose six types of personal information was measured. Two experiments were separately conducted for a single user (N = 36) and two users (N = 48). The results indicated that users were most willing to disclose information about their tastes and interests and least willing to disclose money information. Users in the living space were willing to disclose more information than those in the workspace, which was mediated by users' expectations for the reciprocal services of IoT-CAs rather than the awareness of other persons or external factors. Participants had a high private self-awareness in the living space and workspace; their attention was focused on themselves rather than on external factors in smart spaces.","Li, Z.

3428,Contract design on digital platform for the risk-averse retailer with moral hazard: Wholesale price vs two-part tariff,"Purpose The advent of e-commerce has prompted the proliferation of digital platforms for virtual products. This reinforces the importance of the contract design problem between the virtual product supplier (he) and the digital platform retailer (she). The purpose of this paper is to investigate a principal-agent problem in a virtual product supply chain, in which the retailer's sales-effort investment level to sell the virtual product is unobservable to the supplier, and the market demand is unknown to both parties. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the supplier designs two kinds of contracts (wholesale price contract and two-part tariff contract) to maximize his profit, while the retailer determines her sales-effort investment level and the virtual product's retail price. The results of two different types of contracts are compared to explore in depth the effect of contract choices on the participants' profits. Findings The authors show that the comparative results of the optimal wholesale prices, retail prices and sales-effort investment levels between these two kinds of contracts all rely on the retailer's risk-averse degree. Specifically, both the supplier and the whole supply chain prefer the two-part tariff contract rather than the wholesale price contract, the retailer should do opposite when she is low risk-averse, whereas there is no distinction for the retailer's utilities between these two kinds of contracts when she is more risk-averse. Originality/value The value of the research rests on the use of principal-agent theory in the contracts of virtual products considering the retailer's sales-effort and risk-aversion degree. The research will serve as a guide for the virtual products' supplier and the platform retailer in decision-making processes.","Li, Z. Z.",0,10.1108/k-05-2017-0177,1217

3432,,"Membrane transporters are widely expressed throughout the body, transporting nutrients, metabolites, toxins, and drugs across cellular membranes. In drug development, transporters are clinically important for drug absorption and disposition, and play significant roles in pharmacokinetics and treatment response. In addition, there is a growing interest in physiologic roles of transporters as polymorphisms in many drug transporters have been significantly associated with human diseases. Metformin is widely used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes. It exists primarily as a hydrophilic cation at physiological pHs, and therefore, membrane transporters are involved in its intestinal absorption, tissues distribution, and renal elimination. Multiple organic cation transporters play roles in the pharmacokinetics of metformin, and many of them play important roles in its pharmacological response, as mediators of metformin entry into target tissues. Here, we investigated transporters of metformin, with an emphasis on the pharmacological and biological roles of transporters in the intestine and liver. We characterized the human thiamine transporter (THTR-2; SLC19A3), which plays a major role in the intestinal absorption of thiamine (Vitamin B1). We found that human THTR-2 is capable of transporting other compounds including the drugs metformin and famotidine, and the neurotoxin MPP +. Other chemical agents including phenformin, chloroquine, verapamil, famotidine, amprolium, and pyrithiamine were inhibitors of hTHTR-2 mediated uptake of both thiamine and metformin. Interestingly, previous studies from our laboratory and others identified thiamine as an endogenous substrate for several organic cation transporters including OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1. In our second study, we focused on the endogenous role of OCT1, which is the major hepatic transporter for metformin. Through extensive experiments in Oct1 knockout mice, our data support the notion that hepatic thiamine deficiency is the underlying mechanism for the clinical phenotypes associated with reduced OCT1 function, particularly elevated LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol levels. Our data suggest that reduced OCT1-mediated thiamine uptake in the liver leads to reduced levels of thiamine pyrophosphate, TPP, and a decreased activity of key TPP-dependent enzymes. As a result, there is a shift from glucose to fatty acid oxidation in the liver, which disrupts key metabolic flux pathways. In parallel, through analysis of published genomewide association studies, we show that reduced function OCT1 polymorphisms are associated with several metabolic traits in humans. Taken together, our studies suggest that changes in OCT1 activity modulate the disposition of thiamine and its active metabolite, TPP, which results in alterations in hepatic energy metabolism, ultimately affecting total body energy homeostasis. Finally, we developed a comparative structural model of OCT1 that discriminates ligands from non-ligands and is the model together with an in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to screen a drug library to explore the molecular properties of drugs interacting with OCT1. To extend the in silico methods in predicting endogenous metabolites that interact with OCT1, we conducted a virtual screen of 29,332 human metabolites against the structure-based model and an SAR model generated from the HTS data. In conclusion, our findings have important implications for understanding metformin absorption and disposition, and have expanded our understanding of the physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of membrane transporters.","Liang, Xiaomin",0,,1219
3433,,"This paper investigates the place of pedagogy in language-in-education policy through an analysis of how the macro-level of government policy interacts with the micro-level of local educational practice. It argues that pedagogy is typically considered a micro-level activity and policy frequently devolves decision-making about pedagogy to micro-level agents. For this reason, pedagogy is often invisible in policy texts. Pedagogy becomes a concern for macro-level policy when micro-level practice is constructed as being a problem and policy seeks to intervene to reform practice. However, whether pedagogy is explicitly discussed in policy, it remains nonetheless relevant for policy implementation and ultimately for the success of policy change. The silence about pedagogy in policy texts may render invisible the capacity for pedagogical change at the micro-level and the capabilities and resources needed to effect change. The paper will examine these issues through an investigation of a series of language policy contexts in which pedagogy is either an explicit concern or it remains implicit.","Liddicoat, Anthony J.",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/18334105.2014.11082025,1220
3434,Exploring the effects of specialist versus generalist embodied virtual agents in a multi-product category online store,"Embodied virtual agents have been increasingly implemented in e-commerce websites to provide a more natural, social, and engaging way to deliver product information to online shoppers. The media equation theory posits that users' responses to computer agents adhere to human-to human social rules; hence, effective designs of embodied virtual agents should be based upon social psychology rules. One such rule is the notion of specialisation. While the concept of media specialisation in terms of TVs, computers, websites, web agents, smartphones, and voice assistants have been examined; no studies have yet to explore the effects of specialists and generalist embodied virtual agents in a multi-product category online store. To bridge this research gap, an experiment was conducted in which university undergraduates (n = 132) were randomly divided to interact with either a multi-product category website that incorporated specialist virtual agents or a multi-product category website that deployed a generalist virtual agent. Consistent with the hypotheses of this study, it was shown that the use of specialist virtual agents (as compared to a generalist virtual agent) enhanced perceptions of agent expertise, information credibility, website trust (ability, benevolence, integrity), and purchase intention. Meditation analyses revealed that the effects of agent specialisation on purchase intention were mediated by perceived virtual agent expertise, perceived information credibility, and website trust (ability, benevolence, integrity). Finally, the effects of agent specialisation were shown to be more evident for females than for males. Theoretical and practical implications related to virtual agent specialisation in the context of multi-product category online stores are discussed in this paper.","Liew, T.

This is unfortunate, as many websites today utilize non-interactive talking avatars that provide one-way dialogue in the forms of greetings, introduction of the company, and description of products and services offered. To bridge this gap, our study aims to investigate the effects of non-interactive talking avatar on perceptions of social presence, credibility, website trust, and patronage intention in an online store. Comparing between the experimental (website with avatar) and control (website without avatar) conditions, the experimental results showed that perceived social presence was significantly enhanced by the presence of the non-interactive talking avatar. Furthermore, the presence of the avatar had positive effects on website trust and patronage intention among male participants; but had negative effects on perceptions of information credibility and website patronage intention among females. Analysis based on participants' comments suggests that females were more critical towards certain shortcomings of the non-interactive talking avatar; citing limited interactivity and artificial dialogue from text-to-speech engine. Additionally, the comment analysis suggests that females preferred processing textual over auditory information (as spoken by the avatar) about the products in the online store. Theoretical and managerial implications related to non-interactive talking avatars are discussed in this paper.","Liew, T. W.",0,10.1186/s13673-017-0123-4,1222

3446,,"This dissertation describes how, despite severe political and economic pressures, the U.S. Navy of the Interwar Period tested new doctrines, experimented with advanced technology, and projected itself into the future through simulated conflicts at the Naval War College.

The records of the College and the personal papers of the game participants reflect a steady evolution of strategic and tactical thought that was eventually illustrated in actual combat. These records serve to help recast the reputation of the Naval War College as an agent of preparation and innovation, and the wargames and the instruments of that agency.

Instead, they were a great common playing field, a shared experience, and a palimpsest that both enabled and recorded the Navy’s path to wartime readiness. The games were transformative due in large part to their sheer persistence, ubiquity and flexibility.","Lillard, John M.",0,,1225
3447,Different responses of the right superior temporal sulcus to visual movement feedback during self-generated vs. externally generated hand movements,"An important implication of several recent accounts of motor control is that sensory feedback from self-generated movements is relatively attenuated based on predictions issued by the agent's motor system. Such a relative attenuation of sensory information during actions has already been demonstrated in the somatosensory domain. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a virtual reality-based setup to investigate a potential attenuation of brain responses to realistic visual movement feedback during active vs. passive right-hand movements. The participants' right unseen hand was rotated either by the participants themselves or by the experimenter, while the participants received visual movement feedback via a photorealistic virtual 3D hand driven by their real hand movements, or received no visual feedback. We observed a significant interaction between movement type (active vs. passive) and movement feedback (vision vs. no vision) in the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), which showed relatively attenuated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal differences in movements with vs. without visual feedback when those movements were actively vs. passively executed. This finding suggests that STS activity caused by visual feedback from the moving body may be attenuated based on the agent's motor predictions.","Limanowski, J.",0,10.1111/ejn.13824,1226

Participants were 135 college students randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions formed by a 2 x 2 factorial design with agent presence as one factor (agent vs. no-agent) and type of verbal feedback it provided as the other factor (simple feedback vs. elaborate feedback). Results revealed that participants who learned with the animated agent that delivered elaborate feedback had significantly higher scores on a learning measure compared to participants who learned with an agent that provided simple feedback. The results are interpreted from both social agency and cognitive load theoretical perspectives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Lin, L. J.",1,10.1016/j.compedu.2013.04.017,1227
3455,Visualized Emotion Ontology: a model for representing visual cues of emotions,"Background: Healthcare services, particularly in patient-provider interaction, often involve highly emotional situations, and it is important for physicians to understand and respond to their patients' emotions to best ensure their well-being. Methods: In order to model the emotion domain, we have created the Visualized Emotion Ontology (VEO) to provide a semantic definition of 25 emotions based on established models, as well as visual representations of emotions utilizing shapes, lines, and colors. Results: As determined by ontology evaluation metrics, VEO exhibited bettermachine-readability (z = 1.12), linguistic quality (z = 0.61), and domain coverage (z = 0.39) compared to a sample of cognitive ontologies. Additionally, a survey of 1082 participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk revealed that a significantly higher proportion of people agree than disagree with 17 out of our 25 emotion images, validating the majority of our visualizations. Conclusion: From the development, evaluation, and serialization of the VEO, we have defined a set of 25 emotions using OWL that linked surveyed visualizations to each emotion. In the future, we plan to use the VEO in patient-facing software tools, such as embodied conversational agents, to enhance interactions between patients and providers in a clinical environment.","Lin, R.",0,10.1186/s12911-018-0634-6,1228
3461,,"During the past decades, there has been a growing body of research on the development of new methodologies in system sciences in public health. While systems thinking is prevalent in the practice of public health, there is a need for tools to quantify the multidimensional and multidisciplinary aspects of such thinking. In this thesis, we focus on two system science methods: Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) and System Dynamics (SD). We begin with an ABM to simulate the effects of an urban food desert environment on school-aged children. The data that was used to inform this model is based on children in low-income neighborhoods of Baltimore City. The baseline model was used to predict changes in body mass index due to eating behaviors of simulated children interacting with their food environment. The model was then used as a virtual social laboratory by introducing interventions into the environment and assessing their effects on child behaviors and weight gains. For our second application of systems science, we developed an SD model to study the stability of community functioning (CF) after a natural disaster. We define CF as a measure of a broad range of community activities in providing services to its residents. We studied the dynamic response of CF post-disaster from two different aspects: resilience, which indicates the speed of recovery after event, and resistance, which measures the degree to which a community can continue to function during the event. Key components that support or reduce CF were identified and were quantified as variables in a system of ordinary differential equations. The data for the model was obtained at the county level for 3143 United States counties, and the model results for resilience and resistance ratings were presented in a series of maps so that the regional patterns of our findings could be visualized. Finally, our last application was an SD model applied in a different public health context: an analysis of the mechanisms underlying the health system in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2012. We were interested in the Pay-for-Performance (P4P) intervention, in which relatively small health facilities were given bonus payments as a reward for year-to-year improvements in quality and quantity of health services. A recently published data analysis of the P4P intervention showed no improvement in health services. By working with some of the researchers who participated in this intervention, we were able to develop causal loops in the system associated with some of the key interactions that were generated within the health facilities. We then synthesized these loops into a model of differential equations with delays. We were able to generate several scenarios that indicate that the failure of P4P may be caused by poor implementation processes and gaming within the system. In summary, we demonstrate how ABM and SD can naturally embody systems thinking into a quantitative form, and can produce a wide array of numerical and visual results that capture the complex processes that characterize public health.","Lin, Sen",0,,1229

This study adopted a design-based approach to incorporate robotic assistance in investigating the book-locating behaviors of child patrons, and developed a service robot for child patrons in library settings. We describe the iterative cycles and process to develop a robot to assist with locating resources in libraries. Stakeholders, including child patrons and librarians, were consulted about their needs, preferences, and performance in locating library resources with robotic assistance. Their needs were analyzed and incorporated into the design of the library robot to provide comprehensive support. The results of the study suggest that the library robot was effective as a mobile and humanoid service agent for providing motivation and knowledgeable guidance to help child patrons in the initially complicated sequence of locating resources.","Lin, W.

3466,,"This dissertation is presented in two related components. The first part is The Supreme Price, an award-winning, feature-length documentary film that I directed and produced about women and the pro-democracy movement in Nigeria. In 1993, Nigerians elected M.K.O. Abiola as president in a historic vote that promised to end years of military dictatorship. Shortly after the election, there was a military coup. General Sani Abacha seized power and had Abiola arrested and jailed. While Abiola was in prison, his wife, Kudirat Abiola, took over leadership of the pro-democracy movement. She was assassinated by agents of the military junta in 1996. M.K.O Abiola died in prison two years later under mysterious circumstances. The film interweaves past and present as this story is told through the eyes of their daughter, Hafsat Abiola, who was about to graduate from Harvard when her mother was murdered. Determined not to let her parents’ democratic ideals die with them, Hafsat returns to Nigeria after years in exile and is at the forefront of a progressive movement to empower women and dismantle the patriarchal structure of Nigerian society. The second part of my dissertation consists of written critical reflections on the theoretical, technical, artistic and pedagogical aspects of my feminist filmmaking practice, grounded in my historical research on the political culture in Nigeria. Taking an interdisciplinary, pluralist approach within a theoretical framework of transnational feminism, I incorporated analysis of both Western and African perspectives. I used biography, trauma studies, political science, geographical, economic and foreign policy analysis, extensive audio-visual archival research and photographs to provide a detailed historical backdrop and theoretical context for understanding the life and legacy of Yoruba, Muslim human rights activist, Kudirat Abiola. I explore her and her daughter’s usage of media platforms to amplify their voices across borders, strategically creating archived, historical multimedia records of their opposition to the military regime in Nigeria. Through discussion of my in-depth work with archival footage, and through describing the distribution, impact and outreach of the film, I aim to show how The Supreme Price functions to represent and preserve a key aspect of women’s history in Nigeria, filling a void in the Nigerian educational system where history as an academic subject has been eliminated from most primary and secondary school curriculums. In my roles as director, producer and cinematographer, my documentary filmmaking practice was itself an act of transnational, multicultural solidarity, collaboration and synthesis resulting in a final film that is a hybrid artefact – simultaneously feminist and African. This dissertation illuminates how The Supreme Price has broken new ground in Nigeria where Nollywood has been the dominant framework for film productions and the genre of independently-made, transnational, feminist, political, historical documentaries directed by women and focused on women’s lives and legacies is nascent.","Lipper, Joanna Helene",0,,1231
3467,The topography of the uncanny valley and individuals' need for structure: A nonlinear mixed effects analysis,"The uncanny valley hypothesis suggests that robots that closely resemble humans elicit feelings of eeriness. We focused on individual differences in the uncanny valley experience, which have been largely neglected to date. Using a mixed effects modelling approach, we tested whether individual differences in the need for structure predict uncanny valley sensitivity. Two experiments (Ns = 226 and 336) with morphed stimuli confirmed the uncanny valley effect. A moderator effect of need for structure was found in Experiment 2, which used a fine-grained manipulation of human likeness, but not in Experiment 1, which used a 3-step manipulation. The results provide tentative evidence that individuals who respond negatively to a lack of structure show a more pronounced (""deeper"") uncanny valley effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

3471,"What Second Order Science Reveals About Scientific Claims: Incommensurability, Doubt, and a Lack of Explication","The traditional sciences often bracket away ambiguity through the imposition of ""enabling constraints""-making a set of assumptions and then declaring ceteris paribus. These enabling constraints take the form of uncritically examined presuppositions or ""uceps."" Second order science reveals hidden issues, problems and assumptions which all too often escape the attention of the practicing scientist. These hidden values-precisely because they are hidden and not made explicit-can get in the way of the public's acceptance of a scientific claim. A conflict in understood meaning-between the scientist's restricted claims and the public's broader understanding of those same claims can result in cognitive dissonance or the equivalent of the Mori Uncanny Valley. Scientists often react to these differences by claiming ""incommensurability"" between their restricted claim and the public's understanding. Second order science, by explicating the effects of variations in values assumed for these uceps and associated impacts on related scientific claims, can often moot these assertions of incommensurability and thereby promote greater scientific understanding. This article explores how second order science can address issues of public doubt regarding the scientific enterprise using examples from medicine, diet and climate science.","Lissack, M.",0,10.1007/s10699-016-9484-9,1233
3472,What makes a good metaphor? A cross-cultural study of computer-generated metaphor appreciation,"Computers are now able to automatically generate metaphors, but some automatically generated metaphors are more well received than others. In this article, we showed participants a series of ""A is B"" type metaphors that were either generated by humans or taken from the Twitter account ""MetaphorIsMyBusiness"" (@MetaphorMagnet), which is linked to a fully automated metaphor generator. We used these metaphors to assess linguistic factors that drive metaphor appreciation and understanding, including the role of novelty, word frequency, concreteness, and emotional valence of the topic and vehicle terms. We additionally assessed how these metaphors were understood in three languages, including English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese, and whether participants thought they had been generated by a human or a computer. We found that meaningfulness, appreciation, speed in finding meaning, and humanness ratings were reliably correlated with each other in all three languages, which we interpret to indicate a more general property of ""metaphor quality."" We furthermore found that in all three languages, conventional metaphors and those that contained an ""optimal"" (intermediate) degree of novelty were more likely to be perceived to be of higher quality than those that were extremely creative. Further analysis of the English data alone revealed that those metaphors that contained negatively valenced vehicle words and infrequent vehicle terms (in comparison with the topic terms) were more likely to be considered high-quality metaphors. We discuss the implications of these findings for the (improvement of) automatic generation of metaphor by computers, for the persuasive function of metaphor, and for theories of metaphor understanding more generally.","Littlemore, J.",0,10.1080/10926488.2018.1434944,1234

3482,Should Machines Express Sympathy and Empathy? Experiments with a Health Advice Chatbot,"When we ask a chatbot for advice about a personal problem, should it simply provide informational support and refrain from offering emotional support? Or, should it show sympathy and empathize with our situation? Although expression of caring and understanding is valued in supportive human communications, do we want the same from a chatbot, or do we simply reject it due to its artificiality and uncanniness? To answer this question, we conducted two experiments with a chatbot providing online medical information advice about a sensitive personal issue. In Study 1, participants (N=158) simply read a dialogue between a chatbot and a human user. In Study 2, participants (N=88) interacted with a real chatbot. We tested the effect of three types of empathic expressionsympathy, cognitive empathy, and affective empathyon individuals' perceptions of the service and the chatbot. Data reveal that expression of sympathy and empathy is favored over unemotional provision of advice, in support of the Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm. This is particularly true for users who are initially skeptical about machines possessing social cognitive capabilities.

3488,Representing Affective Facial Expressions for Robots and Embodied Conversational Agents by Facial Landmarks,"Affective robots and embodied conversational agents require convincing facial expressions to make them socially acceptable. To be able to virtually generate facial expressions, we need to investigate the relationship between technology and human perception of affective and social signals. Facial landmarks, the locations of the crucial parts of a face, are important for perception of the affective and social signals conveyed by facial expressions. Earlier research did not use that kind of technology, but rather used analogue technology to generate point-light faces. The goal of our study is to investigate whether digitally extracted facial landmarks contain sufficient information to enable the facial expressions to be recognized by humans. This study presented participants with facial expressions encoded in moving landmarks, while these facial landmarks correspond to the facial-landmark videos that were extracted by face analysis software from full-face videos of acted emotions. The facial-landmark videos were presented to 16 participants who were instructed to classify the sequences according to the emotion represented. Results revealed that for three out of five facial-landmark videos (happiness, sadness and anger), participants were able to recognize emotions accurately, but for the other two facial-landmark videos (fear and disgust), their recognition accuracy was below chance, suggesting that landmarks contain information about the expressed emotions. Results also show that emotions with high levels of arousal and valence are better recognized than those with low levels of arousal and valence. We argue that the question of whether these digitally extracted facial landmarks are a basis for representing facial expressions of emotions is crucial for the development of successful humanrobot interaction in the future. We conclude by stating that landmarks provide a basis for the virtual generation of emotions in humanoid agents, and discuss how additional facial information might be included to provide a sufficient basis for faithful emotion identification.","Liu, C.

3494,,"This paper presents a method of designing a more human-like walking pattern for a bipedal humanoid robot. Motivated by biomechanical studies on human walking, we model the walking pattern with continuous and differentiable mathematical functions. For dynamic balance of the robot, we design a pattern generator based on the ZMP (Zero-Moment Point) criterion. In comparison to the conventional bent-knee walking pattern, the proposed walking pattern involves three-dimensional motion of the upper body. With the proposed walking pattern the robot can walk with almost stretched knees at low and medium walking speeds. This paper also presents a body posture control method. The controller is based on sensory feedback and modifies the reference walking pattern in real time in order to stabilize the robot. We have implemented the proposed walking pattern and control method on the humanoid robot NAO. Walking experiments have verified that the proposed scheme improves the dynamic balance of the robot. Besides, we have investigated the energy consumption at the knee joint actuators and the overall energy consumption at all the joints of both legs, by using NAO that fulfills the conventional walking pattern and the proposed walking pattern respectively. Experiments have proved that (i) knee-stretched motion can improve the walking efficiency of a humanoid robot; and (ii) the proposed walking pattern is more efficient.

3496,Two Techniques for Assessing Virtual Agent Personality,"Personality can be assessed with standardized inventory questions with scaled responses such as ""How extraverted is this character?"" or with open-ended questions assessing first impressions, such as ""What personality does this character convey?"" Little is known about how the two methods compare to each other, and even less is known about their use in the personality assessment of virtual agents. We tested what personality virtual agents conveyed through gesture alone when the agents were programmed to display introversion versus extraversion (Experiment 1) and high versus low emotional stability (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, both measures indicated participants perceived the extraverted agent as extraverted, but the open-question technique highlighted the perception of both agents as highly agreeable whereas the inventory indicated that the extraverted agents were also perceived as more open to new experiences. In Experiment 2, participants perceived agents expressing high versus low emotional stability differently depending on assessment style. With inventory questions, the agents differed on both emotional stability and agreeableness. With the open-ended question, participants perceived the high stability agent as extraverted and the low stability agent as disagreeable. Inventory and open-ended questions provide different information about what personality virtual agents convey and both may be useful in agent development.","Liu, K.",0,10.1109/taffc.2015.2435780,1240
3501,Machines versus humans: People's biased responses to traffic accidents involving self-driving vehicles,"Although self-driving vehicles (SDVs) bring with them the promise of improved traffic safety, they cannot eliminate all crashes. Little is known about whether people respond crashes involving SDVs and human drivers differently and why. Across five vignette-based experiments in two studies (total N = 1267), for the first time, we witnessed that participants had a tendency to perceive traffic crashes involving SDVs to be more severe than those involving conventionally human-driven vehicles (HDVs) regardless of their severity (injury or fatality) or cause (SDVs/HDVs or others). Furthermore, we found that this biased response could be a result of people's reliance on the affect heuristic. More specifically, higher prior negative affect tagged with an SDV (vs. an HDV) intensifies people's negative affect evoked by crashes involving the SDV (vs. those involving the HDV), which subsequently results in higher perceived severity and lower acceptability of the crash. Our results imply that people's over-reaction to crashes involving SDVs may be a psychological barrier to their adoption and that we may need to forestall a less stringent introduction policy that allows SDVs on public roads as it may lead to more crashes that could possibly deter people from adopting SDVs. We discuss other theoretical and practical implications of our results and suggest potential approaches to de-biasing people's responses to crashes involving SDVs.","Liu, P.",0,10.1016/j.aap.2019.02.012,1241
3504,Fuzzy context-specific intention inference for robotic caregiving,"To provide timely and appropriate assistance, robots must have the capability of proactively understanding a user's personal needs, the so-called human intention inference. In human-human interaction, humans have a natural and implicit way to infer others' intentions by selecting correlated context features and interpreting these features based on their life experience. However, robots do not have this capability and it is not realistic to build an explicit formula to associate human intentions with context. In this article, a novel fuzzy context-specific intention inference method is developed for human-like implicit human intention inference. With a fuzzy manner, context features are converted into discrete context statuses, which are similar to human subjective feelings. An intention-centered common sense database is developed consisting of correlated fuzzy context statuses, object affordances, and their relationship with human intentions. With this database, a Fuzzy Naive BayesianNetwork algorithm is adopted for implicit intention inference. Homescenario results validated the fuzzy context-specific intention inference methods reliability and lab scenario results validated the fuzzy context-specific intention inference methods effectiveness and robustness. This work is expected to develop intuitive and effective human-robot interaction, consequently enhancing the adoption of assistive technologies and improving the independence of the disabled and elderly in activities of daily living.","Liu, R.",0,10.1177/1729881416662780,1242

3510,,"Control of 3D dynamic walking in bipedal legged machines or humanoid robots remains a challenging problem. To address the complexity brought by the high degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the target system, very often a simple template model is used as an intermediate bridge. A template model is typically much simpler, but can still capture the key characteristics of the dynamics of a particular motion. Usually, a control policy is first developed to regulate the behavior of the template model, then resultant trajectories of the template model are mapped to the whole-body motion of the more complex robot through some optimization-based task-space control strategies. Currently, the most widely used walking template is the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM). It has gained popularity due to its simple linearized dynamics, and walking controllers based on the LIPM have had some success. However, the resultant walking gaits from the LIPM miss some of the dynamics that can lead to more efficient gaits such as those in a human. This is due in part to its constant height assumption and the lack of a double support phase. Recently, an alternative walking template called the Dual-SLIP (spring-loaded inverted pendulum) model (or Bipedal SLIP model) has been proposed. This model has its roots in biomechanics studies. With leg compliance it can faithfully reproduce the ground reaction force (GRF) patterns and center of mass (CoM) vertical oscillations observed during human walking. Also its bipedal nature allows it to seamlessly integrate the double support phase during walking. It even has the potential to become a general template that can model both walking and running. The behavior of the 3D Dual-SLIP model is much more difficult to regulate than its 2D counterpart. And the problem is accentuated when walking over uneven terrain, especially with step height uncertainty. However, to actually use this model as a walking template for a humanoid, the 3D extension is necessary. With such motivation, this thesis is dedicated to develop a dynamic walking controller for a humanoid based on the 3D Dual-SLIP model while traversing uneven terrain. The development is divided into three stages. In the first stage the focus is on 3D walking over flat ground. A new optimization-based approach is proposed to find periodic walking gaits. Through analysis of the dynamics of the 3D Dual-SLIP model, a novel symmetry condition has been identified that is used to greatly simplify the optimization process. It has also been found during the study that the regular conservative 3D Dual-SLIP model is not capable of generating forward walking at speeds faster than 1.4 m/s (assuming a leg length of 1 m). To address this limitation, a variant of the regular Dual-SLIP model, the actuated Dual-SLIP, is introduced to address high-speed walking. With bio-inspired leg actuation, the model can walk up to 2 m/s, which is at the top end of the range of human walking speeds. Since the periodic gaits of the 3D Dual-SLIP model are found to not be self-stable, a discrete-time infinite-horizon LQR controller has been developed to regulate the state of the model. Through this approach, the controller can recover from significant disturbances by automatically adapting footstep positions during walking. In the second stage, the development of the first stage is extended to known uneven terrain, which is the first time the 3D Dual-SLIP model has been used to generate dynamic walking gaits over uneven terrain. Since the symmetry condition can no longer be used to aid in the search for periodic gaits over uneven terrain, an improved CoM trajectory and footstep position generation method is developed based on multiple-shooting optimization that is applicable to both flat ground and uneven terrain (with elevation changes up to +/-10% of leg length per step). The resultant gait for flat ground is consistent with that found with the simpler approach of the first stage. The gait over uneven terrain also shows a rich set of human-like characteristics as observed","Liu, Yiping",0,,1245
3511,,"Materials that are organic-based and exhibit oxidative catalytic activity, including free-radical pathways, while being refractory to the activated oxygen species are not known. The synthesis of several classes of such materials, their electronic and structural characterizations as well as catalytic properties are reported. Their rational molecular design and biologically inspired reactivity are based on enzymatic active sites, which are reengineered into robust metal-organic fluoroalkylated scaffolds that, for the first time, exhibit structural asymmetry and tunable π–π interactions both in solution and solid state. In these complexes, labile C–H bonds are replaced with chemically and thermally resistant C–F bonds to create a “Teflon coating” of the metal active site, keeping it open for catalysis while protecting the molecule against self-decomposition. The first part presents the synthesis, spectroscopic and X-ray structural characterization of new, mixed alkyl-perfluoroalkyl trispyrazolylborate (Tp) ligands and several of their sodium and silver derivatives. These complexes are subject to an N3-coordinating agent bearing a -1 charge. The metal is encapsulated in a fluorine-rich environment and exhibits a high Lewis acidity, allowing additional coordination by toluene, triphenylphosphine, methyldiphenylphosphine and triphenylphosphine oxide. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the new materials allows for the development of a structural model that predicts interatomic distances and the relative stability of this class of compounds. The balancing of electronic and steric effects of substituents on the Tp and additional ligands can lead to remarkably stable compounds in solution and the solid state, even when metals particularly prone to reduction (such as silver) are involved. Examples among the new complexes are provided. The second part describes the design of two new classes of macrocyclic organic chromophores with enhanced N4-coordinating ability and -2 charges, belonging to the family of fluoroalkylated phthalocyanines and produced as their zinc and cobalt complexes. The first class, bearing trifluoromethyl groups, exhibits reduced steric hindrance and solvent-dependent aggregation. A direct correlation between the degree of dimerization and the solvent’s hydrogen bond donor ability is established. The second class constitutes the first asymmetric perfluorinated phthalocyanines, a property imparted by a combination of fluorine atoms and perfluoroisopropyl groups. X-ray crystal structures reveal tunable π–π stacking in the solid state for representatives of both classes. The new compounds’ ability to catalytically activate oxygen from air and consequently oxidize substrates is tested on two processes of industrial importance: the environmentally benign conversion of corrosive thiols to disulfides and the photocatalytic oxidation of (S)-citronellol. The extreme electronic deficiency imparted on the metal complexes supports a new strategy for broadening catalytic activity to include thiols with poor basicity, which under normal circumstances cannot be oxidized. Quantitative substrate conversion and virtual immunity of the catalysts to chemical attacks is demonstrated for the first time in a metal-organic assembly through oxygen consumption and stability studies, thus opening pathways for development of new materials","Loas, Andrei Ioan",0,,1246
3512,,"Marketers continue to understand that over-exposing consumers to advertisements enhances brand and product recall, but this situation also agitates consumers. Advertisements purposefully serve as distracting agents that disrupt consumer focus and create freedom-threatening situations. According to the theory of psychological reactance, this causes people to do anything possible (even if it is violent) to restore that lost freedom; hence, the likelihood for an aggressive consumer response to an advertisement. Furthermore, while marketing exists in all countries, the United States and United Kingdom are two of the world's richest countries. Firms in these societies advertise with some of the largest advertising budgets in the world, exposing their citizens to the highest online advertising levels possible. This study focused on: (1) how intrusive online advertisements are perceived, (2) how much reactance online ads arouse, (3) if online advertising locations and levels of animation contribute to greater levels of reactance arousal, and (4) if heightened states of reactance lead to aggressive consumers. These effects were measured amongst British and American consumers. It was found that country of origin best explains results for perceptions of ad intrusiveness. US participants experienced this to greater levels than UK subjects; however, UK subjects began the study with already higher perceptions that ads are intrusive. Fully animated ads on the right side of the page were perceived as the most intrusive. Similar results were achieved for reactance arousal. US and UK subjects both became highly reactant with US subjects experiencing it more, but UK subjects began in already higher reactant states. It was unclear which treatment combination achieved this, however. Age was also evaluated as a covariate, revealing that older US consumers perceive online ads to be more intrusive and more highly reactant to them than younger shoppers from the UK. While not clear on which advertising treatment combinations best explain it, the analysis revealed that increases in intrusive levels increase reactance arousal and, as reactance arousal increases, so does the desire to respond aggressively to the advertised brand or product as a consumer.","Lobus, Christopher A.",0,,1247
3513,Mixed reality emergency management: bringing virtual evacuation simulations into real-world built environments,"Computer-based evacuation simulations are important tools for emergency managers. These simulations vary in complexity and include 2D and 3D GIS-based network analyses, agent-based models, and sophisticated models built on documented human behaviour and particle dynamics. Despite the influential role of built environments in determining human movement, a disconnect often exists between the features of the real world and the way they are represented within these simulation environments. The proliferation of emergency management location-aware mobile devices, along with a recent infatuation for augmented reality (AR), has resulted in new wayfinding and hazard assessment tools that bridge this gap, allowing users to visualize geospatial information superimposed on the real world. In this paper, we report research and development that has produced AR geovisual analytical systems, enabling visual analysis of human dynamics in multi-level built environments with complex thoroughfare network infrastructure. We demonstrate prototypes that show how mixed reality visual analysis of intelligent human movement simulations built in virtual spaces can become part of real space. This research introduces a fundamentally new way to view and link simulations of people with the real-world context of the built environment: mixed reality crowd simulation in real space.","Lochhead, I.",0,10.1080/17538947.2018.1425489,1248
3515,,"Success or failure of future information and communication services in general and mobile communications in particular is greatly dependent on the level of personalisations they can offer. While the provision of anytime, anywhere, anyhow services has been the focus of wireless telecommunications in recent years, personalisation however has gained more and more attention as the unique selling point of mobile devices. Smart phones should be intelligent enough to match user’s unique needs and preferences to provide a truly personalised service tailored for the individual user. In the first part of this thesis, the importance and role of personalisation in future mobile networks is studied. This is followed, by an agent based futuristic user scenario that addresses the provision of rich data services independent of location. Scenario analysis identifies the requirements and challenges to be solved for the realisation of a personalised service. An architecture based on IP Multimedia Subsystem is proposed for mobility and to provide service continuity whilst roaming between two different access standards. Another aspect of personalisation, which is user preference modelling, is investigated in the context of service selection in a multi 3rd party service provider environment. A model is proposed for the automatic acquisition of user preferences to assist in service selection decision-making. User preferences are modelled based on a two-level Bayesian Metanetwork. Personal agents incorporating the proposed model provide answers to preference related queries such as cost, QoS and service provider reputation. This allows users to have their preferences considered automatically.","Lohi, Abdolkhalil",0,,1249
3516,Empowering parents through an action research parenting program,"The goal of this article is to consider action research with parents and specifically describe the experience of two parents during a parenting program that employed an action research framework and consider how action research empowered them. Data collection lasted for 24 weeks and included reflection commentaries, home journals, email communication, action plan writing, a conversational group interview, and artefacts. The two case studies exemplify how the methodology of action research as the framework of a parenting program empowered them to develop their own understanding of parenting, to generate theory and develop skills to cope with parenting issues. These cases include: the lone scientist who reflects on her own practice and re-conceptualizes her parenting and the team player who considers the playgroup as a learning community in which she learns from others. This study, especially the in-depth analysis of the two parents, highlights that action research is a promising component of parent education programs because it provides parents with the space and flexibility to be agents of their own learning and development; a framework which others can build on to enrich the action research and early education literature.","Loizou, E.",0,10.1177/1476750313476311,1250

The authors draw from the literature that acknowledges children as active agents and supports them in participating in their daily environments, constructing their world, and learning. The goal of this study is to describe the process the authors followed to include the needs of a child within the spectrum of our learning community. Data include participant observations, informal conversations with children and teachers, photos, videos, and planning documents. The main findings suggest that through the specific pedagogical framework, children were involved in decision making, actively participated in play, developed a sense of belonging, and participated in power shifts; and adults exposed themselves to the uncertain. Such experiences provide the context under which the proposed empowerment pedagogy is unfolded. The proposed pedagogy, listening to a child’s needs, suggests that teaching and thus learning can and should be a true exploration and meaningful experience for all.

3519,,"The purpose of this study is to investigate how emotionally enabled virtual agents (VAs) in healthcare provision training simulations allow for a more effective level of understanding on how an emotionally enhanced scenario can affect different aspects of learning. This is achieved by developing virtual agents that respond to the user’s emotions and personality. The developed system also provides visual and auditory representations of the virtual agents’ state of mind. To enable the fulfilment of this purpose an experimental framework for incorporating emotional enhancements (concentrating on negative emotions such as stress, fear, and anxiety) into virtual agents in virtual training applications for healthcare provision is designed and implemented. The framework for incorporating emotional enhancements is designed based on previous research, on psychological theories (with input by experienced psychologists) and from input of experts in the area of healthcare provision. For testing the framework and answering the research question of this thesis the researcher conducted nine case studies. The participants were nursing students in the area of healthcare provision, and more specifically in the area of mental health, specialising in caring for patients with dementia. The results of the study showed that the framework and its implementation succeeded in providing a realistic learning experience, stimulated a better set of responses from the user, improved their level of understanding on how an emotionally enhanced scenario can affect the learning experience and helped them become more empathetic towards the person they cared for.","Loizou, Michael",0,,1252
3520,,"This qualitative study used a case study approach to investigate the use of creative approaches in promoting inclusive cultures for literacy learning in mainstream primary schools. Phase 1 used creative methodologies to explore the views and experiences of upper- primary pupils (n=22) on their level of participation in the management of their literacy learning needs. Phase 2, which took central place in this study utilised practices from Appreciative Inquiry to explore and examine groups of teachers' (n=10), parents' (n=9) and upper-primary school pupils' (n= 12) perceptions of the visual and verbal texts produced in Phase 1 and, to investigate what participants viewed as 'best practice teaching and learning methodologies' used to meet the needs of learners who struggle with literacy and also their practical propositions for change. The total study was underpinned by ethical principles and the ethical standards set by the host institution. Key findings demonstrated that dialogical modes of professional learning had tremendous potential for unsettling common habits of mind, recognising the best of existing practices, and stimulating ideas for classroom and institutional transformation. For example, participants recognised: the interwoven nature of pupil well-being and literacy success; the benefits of variety in pedagogical and assessment practices; the centrality of teachers in school enhancement processes; the roles of parents and pupils in developing inclusive literacy practices; the potential benefits of involving pupils and parents in collaborative inquiry, and, furthermore, participants reconceptualised pupils as active social agents. Although this was a small-scale qualitative study the findings have implications for practitioners demonstrating that inclusive literacy pathways are holistic, personalised, integrated, participatory, balanced and empowering. The implications of findings for schools are that they would benefit from capacity building in action-research methodologies and leadership that supports collaborative inquiry. Policy-makers should be making time and resources available to enable schools to engage in learner-centered school improvement processes.","Long, Marie Louise",0,,1253

While most of the work on the uncanny valley is focused on finding a way to surpass the uncanny valley and how certain things could be designed to increase or decrease the uncanniness of an animation, this paper investigates how removing certain blendshapes from the facial animation changes our perception about the eeriness of that animation. The goal is to identify the “necessary” blendshapes which bring about a significant change the perceived uncanniness of the animation. For achieving this, participants undergo visual tests which entails observing short animated clips expressing different emotions and recording the human-likeness and uncanniness, as perceived by the observers. The results validate some of the existing theories about the uncanny valley and also identify the necessary blendshapes for every emotion. The results show that removing the blendshapes not only affects the eeriness but also the perceived human-likeness and may change our perception of the emotion expressed in the animation.","Lonkar, Ameya",0,,1254
3522,"High Modernism, Conflict, and the Nature of Change in Canada: A Look at Seeing Like a State","Seeing Like a State (1998), anthropologist James C. Scott's critique of twentieth-century development and the ideology of ""high modernism'' that animates it, has shaped the writing of Canadian history, as it has in so many other fields. Environmental historians of Canada, particularly those who study hydroelectric development in the postwar period, have found it especially useful because it links social and environmental change to political power, putting nature at the core of the project of modernization. This article reviews some of that literature to illustrate and critique Scott's key concepts and arguments. Specifically, it takes issue with Scott's contention that high modernist development pitted local knowledge against the expertise of the state's agents. The article also challenges the declensionist narrative offered in the book, which portrays the nature of high modernist change solely in terms of degradation. Finally, it suggests that adopting the very way of seeing that Scott criticizes - an imperial, encompassing, reductive vision - has, and can hold out, the promise for a better kind of development.","Loo, T.",0,10.3138/chr.3035,1255
3523,"Financial Crisis, Virtual Carbon in Global Value Chains, and the Importance of Linkage Effects. The Spain-China Case","Trade has a disproportionate environmental impact, while the international fragmentation of production promotes different patterns of intermediate inputs and final goods. Therefore, we split up the balance of domestic embodied emissions in trade (BDEET) to assess it. We find that Spain has a significant emissions deficit with China between 2005 and 2011. The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 reduced Spanish imports of pollution-intensive inputs from China and slightly improved the BDEET. China primarily exports indirect virtual carbon, representing 86% of the total, especially from Production of electricity, gas, and water sector. These linkages effects in China indicate that post-Kyoto agreements must focus not only on traded goods but also on the environmental efficiency of all domestic production chains. The methodology proposed allows us to identify the agents responsible for this trade in both Spain and China, namely the sectors importing intermediate inputs (Construction and Transport equipment) and industries and consumers importing final goods (Textiles, Other manufactures, Computers, and Machinery). The relevant sectors uncertainties found when we compare the results for BDEET and emissions embodied in bilateral trade (BEET) lead us to recommend the former methodology to evaluate the implications of environmental and energy policy for different industries and agents.","Lopez, L.

Measurements were taken for a range of beam energies beams and field sizes in heterogeneous block phantoms and anthropomorphic phantom, which mimics lung, spine, ribs, and tissue. Heterogeneous interfaces and buildup regions were investigated in the block phantom setups. The measurements were taken using an ion chamber and diode detectors. Dose in a humanoid phantom at our patient target volume and out of field regions wre investigated in the anthropomorphic phantom. Data from the planning systems were computed for each scenario, and compared to our benchmark measurements using percent differences. The best results between data from the algorithms and our measurements occur after the buildup region in solid water for block phantoms, and at the treatment isocenter in anthropomorphic phantom. The cumulative results from the block phantoms (using a 3% difference from benchmark as our passing criteria) indicate that in general, AXB performs the best, but in some regions other algorithms excel over AXB. iPlan MC performs better at points outside the beam. AAA performs as well as AXB at the lung interfaces. MC and AAA perform best in the buildup regions. All algorithms except PB are within 5% difference from our benchmark measurements at the isocenter. Differences between our measurements and algorithm data are much greater for the off-axis points. In summary, there is an obvious lack of accuracy for doses to critical structures outside any primary beam. Further studies will need to be done to understand the risk of dose to OARs outside the primary fields. The data for the anthropomorphic phantom indicates that all the algorithms accurately compute dose to targets within lung, excluding PB. Finally, our study displays the possible power behind AXB, overall outperforming the other algorithms.","Lopez, Phillip M.",0,,1257
3527,Computational Functionalism for the Deep Learning Era,"Deep learning is a kind of machine learning which happens in a certain type of artificial neural networks called deep networks. Artificial deep networks, which exhibit many similarities with biological ones, have consistently shown human-like performance in many intelligent tasks. This poses the question whether this performance is caused by such similarities. After reviewing the structure and learning processes of artificial and biological neural networks, we outline two important reasons for the success of deep learning, namely the extraction of successively higher level features and the multiple layer structure, which are closely related to each other. Then some indications about the framing of this heated debate are given. After that, an assessment of the value of artificial deep networks as models of the human brain is given from the similarity perspective of model representation. Finally, a new version of computational functionalism is proposed which addresses the specificity of deep neural computation better than classic, program based computational functionalism.","Lopez-Rubio, E.",0,10.1007/s11023-018-9480-7,1258

3530,Simulation for Interpretation: A Methodology for Growing Virtual Cultures,"Agent-based social simulation is well-known for generative explanations. Following the theory of thick descriptionwe extend the generative paradigm to interpretative research in cultural studies. Using the example of qualitative data about criminal culture, the paper describes a research process that facilitates interpretative research by growing virtual cultures. Relying on qualitative data for the development of agent rules, the research process combines several steps: Qualitative data analysis following the Grounded Theory paradigm enables concept identification, resulting in the development of a conceptual model of the concept relations. The software tool CCD is used in conceptual modelling which assists semi-automatic transformation in a simulation model developed in the simulation platform DRAMS. Both tools preserve traceability to the empirical evidence throughout the research process. Traceability enables interpretation of simulations by generating a narrative storyline of the simulation. Thereby simulation enables a qualitative exploration of textual data. The whole process generates a thick description of the subject of study, in our example criminal culture. The simulation is characterized by a socio-cognitive coupling of agents' reasoning on the state of the mind of other agents. This reveals a thick description of how participants make sense of the phenomenology of a situation from the perspective of their world-view.","Lotzmann, U.",0,10.18564/jasss.3451,1260

The study investigated how the TAIL approach affected community college chemistry students' (n = 21) learning gains and perceptions during a 1.5-hour intervention when compared with the direct instruction approach. A mixed methodology was used that included both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results led to the following three key findings for novice learners: (a) TAIL had a statistically significant effect on students' procedural application skills improvement when compared with direct instruction; (b) The magnitude of the between-group difference (Cohen's d = 1.41) indicated that TAIL had a cumulative effect on students' learning gains due to its ability to incorporate multiple components including Inquiry, Guidance, Technology, and Collaboration; (c) When combining measures of students' performance and perceived mental effort, TAIL demonstrated high-instructional efficiency with a significant difference in teaching factual knowledge and procedural applications when compared with direct instruction. In summary, the outcome of this study demonstrated both the effectiveness and efficiency of the TAIL approach as a student-centered pedagogy in teaching a basic scientific topic. This study provided a practical demonstration of the pedagogical shift in teaching science from teacher-centered direct instruction to student-centered learning by using computer software as a pedagogical agent.

3533,,"Others with whom we do not relate are sometimes likened to objects or machines. Perceiving others as relational partners could contribute to their acknowledgment as human beings. To test the idea that social relatedness constitutes a fundamental dimension of humanness perception is the main goal of this thesis. It is hypothesized that perceiving the outgroup as taking part in relations with the ingroup reduces outgroup dehumanization to a greater extent than when its members are not taking part in such relations. It also aims to explore the extent to which the ingroup is (de)humanized according to its participation in social relations. It was found that social relations between ingroup and outgroup decreased outgroup dehumanization when compared to the absence of relation. Evidence on the moderating role of status in the perceived humanness of high and low status, fictional and natural groups, was also presented. Additionally, social relations between outgroup members (in which ingroup members were not involved) also had an effect on the perceived humanness of both groups. Finally, initial findings of studies using a minimal groups’ paradigm were presented. In these studies, outgroup dehumanization also occurred but was not moderated by (anticipated) social relations between the groups. This thesis represents a new take on this phenomenon by providing a relational approach to the (de)humanization of ingroup and outgroup. Therefore, social relatedness is advanced as a dimension that underlies how human we perceive our own group and other groups to be. Alternate abstract:","Louceiro, Ana Filipa de Sequeira",0,,1262
3534,,"Intrastate conflicts involving multiple actors have grown in number since 1946. Evidence suggests that shifts in alliances between actors in intrastate conflicts change the nature of the conflict and its duration. The extant literature is unable to answer questions related to how alliances may shift over the course of a conflict and how those shifts affect the conflict and vice versa. The consequence is that it is not possible to answer questions about how alliances evolve over time, how the key actors in a conflict change over time, or how alliances will adapt in response to different situations. Recent research on intrastate conflicts has focused on the conditions that lead to conflicts, while research on security-based alliances has focused on when nation-states choose to form alliances and who would make attractive alliance partners. Neither have focused on overtime dynamics. The primary goal of this dissertation is to demonstrate a generalized approach that enables researchers to study alliance dynamics in intrastate conflicts. This is accomplished by extending the Regional Threat Evaluator (RTE), a dynamic-network multi-agent simulation model of intrastate conflict that has been used in previous work with DARPA, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratories. Virtual experiments were run to test the effects that different alliance theories have. Overtime results were analyzed to determine who the key actors were, how alliance network properties changed, and how much activity emerged. Data about the conflict in Iraq are used to ground the initial model parameters and compare simulation results to. Results show that the alliance logic used affects the key actors that emerge, the overtime alliance network topology, and the overtime activity level of the actors. Correlations between network-level measurements and system-level behavior indicate that increasing alliance network density can decrease conflict. Additionally, one of the alliance logics produced results that had qualitatively similar characteristics to the real data, giving insight into how actors in the conflict may think about alliance formation. In summary, this thesis develops a framework that can be used by researchers and policy analysts to understand overtime alliance dynamics and their implications on conflicts.","Louie, Marcus A.",0,,1263

3544,Natural forces as agents: Reconceptualizing the animate-inanimate distinction,"Research spanning multiple domains of psychology has demonstrated preferential processing of animate as compared to inanimate entities a pattern that is commonly explained as due to evolutionarily adaptive behavior. Forces of nature represent a class of entities that are semantically inanimate but which behave as if they are animate in that they possess the ability to initiate movement and cause actions. We report an eye-tracking experiment demonstrating that natural forces are processed like animate entities during online sentence processing: they are easier to integrate with action verbs than instruments, and this effect is mediated by sentence structure. The results suggest that many cognitive and linguistic phenomena that have previously been attributed to animacy may be more appropriately attributed to perceived agency. To the extent that this is so, the cognitive potency of animate entities may not be due to vigilant monitoring of the environment for unpredictable events as argued by evolutionary psychologists but instead may be more adequately explained as reflecting a cognitive and linguistic focus on causal explanations that is adaptive because it increases the predictability of events.

To motivate children to complete a dietary assessment, researchers could use animated, customisable agents; embed the assessment process into a video game; or add narratives to encourage self‐reporting behaviour. To improve accuracy, the intake environment could be recreated virtually; training sessions could be interspersed to improve portion estimation; and implicit attitudinal measures could be incorporated as a control or to increase validity.

3555,,"Path planning aims at navigating a robot from an initial configuration to a goal configuration without violating various constraints. The problem of path planning is theoretically intractable (PSPACE hard), but in everyday life we (as human beings) navigate in our environment without much difficulty. This is partially due to the experiences we learned since childhood. The learning process may be complex, but one of the reasons that we can learn such tasks is that most objects we encounter today are similar or identical to the objects we encountered yesterday or even years ago. Environments with similar objects are quite common. For example, desks and chairs in a classroom or in an office may be moved around from one place to another frequently, but unfamiliar items are seldom introduced. Even different environments, such as two apartments, or a manufacturing factory and an airport garage, may share many similar items. The main differences are usually in the arrangements. Similar environments can also be found in simulated reality, e.g., in different levels of a video game or in the different regions of a virtual reality world, where many objects are intentionally duplicated to reduce the (e.g., modeling and rendering) complexity. A dynamic environment where obstacles allowed to move can be considered as a continuous sequence of similar static environments due to motion coherence. We term ""discrete similar-workspace problem"" for static environments and ""continuous similar-workspace problem"" for dynamic environments. In this thesis, I investigated path planners that can address both problems and recognize this similarity in order to significantly improve efficiency and completeness. More specifically, I developed a path planner which exploits similarity across different static environments. This planner remembers the computation (the ""mental image"") for every obstacle encountered. Given a new problem, by carefully reusing these existing computations, the planner quickly builds a roadmap from its knowledge base. In order to improve reusability, I also designed a new shape matching method for polygons. The experimental results show that the planner is 3–8 orders of magnitude faster than most existing methods in environments with various similarity. Moreover, the success rate is kept at 100%. In other words, once a query is solved, it guarantees to be able to find a collision free path in the subsequent runs. Environments with dynamic obstacles can also be viewed as a sequence of similar environments. In fact, existing methods have explored the temporal coherence (i.e. similarity) and gain efficiency by preserving the bulk of the roadmap and only repairing the invalid part due to motions of obstacles. However, all these methods repair blindly and periodically at fixed time intervals with little attempt to analyze the similarity or changes of the planning spaces across different time instances. This results in either redundant updates or failure to detect invalid edges and nodes. Based on the assumption that obstacles move along some known trajectories, we proposed a motion planner that detects critical moments when the topology of the free configuration space changes. The critical moments can be classified into two categories: 1) a time of contact is when the space between two configuration obstacles closes, and 2) a time of separation is when the space opens up. As shown in the experimental results, our planner not only avoids redundant computation (about one order of magnitude faster) but also improves the chances of finding a valid path. In many real life applications such as rescue robots and autonomous vehicles, the robot may have no prior knowledge of obstacles' motions. I developed a new geometric tool which allows the robot to determine the critical moments when the robot and obstacles can collide. Then, only at such critical moments, the robot updates its belief of the environment and re-plans if necessary. The main challenge in predicting collision stems from the assumption that obstacles' motio","Lu, Yanyan",0,,1271

3557,,"The adoption of social media applications offers new alternatives for individuals to interact during emergency situations, expanding from a classical face-to-face communication to a virtual environment where a vast number of individuals can be reached simultaneously. The implementation of this technology results in a vast amount of data being generated, disseminated and considered in the individual’s decision-making process. Despite expert recognition that the integration of social media into disaster response strategies may contribute to situational awareness, they have been reluctant to fully adopt it because it has the potential to exacerbate the negative impact of disasters.To understand why, this dissertation contributes to the emergency management domain by exploring how social media can be leveraged during natural disasters. Specifically, the research contributes from three different angles: 1) Investigating the body of knowledge to understand social media in the context of disaster response, 2) Understanding the implications of bias when dealing with social media extracted data, along with its repercussions when selecting leading indicators for evacuation, and 3) Exploring how public sentiment emerges and is shaped by social interactions. As each of these angles addresses a different aspect of social media impacts, three different studies were conducted. First, a grounded theory approach was implemented to identify the characteristics of social media that could be exploited, as well as those that inhibit adoption. The analysis identified three major benefits including: 1) support situational awareness, 2) faster information diffusion, and 3) monitoring activities and coordination. Factors that inhibit the adoption were clustered into social and technical limitations. Second, the analysis of public sentiment and the implications of bias towards three of the costliest hurricanes on US record, hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria, was conducted considering Twitter and U.S official environmental sensors data. The effects of bias were analyzed by comparing the outcomes of two well-known methods for model selection, Lasso method with Bootstrapping and a bias correction causal inference model. Our findings indicate significant differences in predictions between the traditional and bias correction model, suggesting emergency managers to correct for biases when seeking to integrate public sentiment in their strategies. Third, a Brownian agent-based model of collective emotions, with foundations on the psychological theory of Circumplex Model of Affect, was developed to explore how public’s collective sentiment is altered according to the available communication methods and the type of community the individual is part of. The analyzed communication preferences include face-to-face and social media, while the types of communities explored are tight-knit, traditional, urban modern and social media. Insights from the agent-based model suggest community structure highly influences the rate and shape of public sentiment. Also, social media’s faster dissemination rates play a significant role on the resulting public sentiment. Emergency managers benefit from the developed simulation as they can have a reference map for how a community’s communication preference influences the resulting public sentiment.Overall, the findings of this research will enable emergency managers to better understand the role of social media during disasters as well as inform the development of emergency management strategies by recognizing how social media can impact the dynamics of public perception and behavior.","Luna, Sergio",0,,1273
3561,A Discussion of the Favorable Factors for the Economic System's Utility Growth Rate,"Some virtual economic systems are constructed. The agents in the systems are linked crossover by different network structures and endowed with goods and the same symmetric Cobb-Douglas utility function. Their Cobb-Douglas utility growth rates (UGR) are compared with each other after the systems reach their eventual equilibriums. We try to discover how the network structures and how the endowments affect the UGR. Furthermore, the possible factors including group size, trade sequence, turnover, and number of trades are taken into account. Some but not all of the factors listed above may impact the UGR. The aim of this paper is to select the effective ones and try to improve the UGR by manipulating these factors. We discovered that the small-world network surpasses other networks to achieve the highest UGR. Besides, another way to improve UGR is to endow the agents with proper volume of goods.","Luo, L.

3563,,"Character animation plays a central role in many applications such as embodied conversational agents (ECA), humanoid robots and computer animated films. Key frame animation, as a traditional way of making animation, is laborious and time consuming. This thesis presents several methods for generating expressive gesture and body motions on either ECAs or humanoid robots. The goal of the research is to capture important motion properties and synthesize full body motions of desired qualities requiring minimal user input. To achieve this goal, this thesis develops models for both gesture and body motion. For gesture, a two layer system, implemented on a Honda humanoid robot, was designed to generate a full range of gesture types from arbitrary text. The system first selects gestures types probabilistically from input text and then aligns matching gesture templates - trajectory curves that define the gesture - with speech. An evaluation of the model's parameters demonstrated that our system could generate motions of different levels of expressiveness, excitement and speech synchronization. As a next step, the ""chameleon effect"", the tendency of people to adopt the postures, gestures, and mannerisms of their interaction partners [20] was examined, as a way to guide gesture algorithms for human-robot/agent interaction. Evidence was found suggesting that people prefer gestures similar to their own over gestures similar to those of other people. With respect to body motion, two architectures were proposed to add expressive body motions to gesture animation in order to generate full body animation. The first one is a hybrid system that uses motion capture data and procedural animation to add lower body movement and spine rotation respectively. Naturalness is the most important factor in the design. The second one extends this research to generate stylized body motion. The model takes a statistics-based approach using a small, personalized database of body motion clips. A perceptual study validates that the system is able to capture important aspects of expression. In order to better understand the relationship between gesture and posture, a separate experiment was conducted to evaluate different factors that might affect human's sensitivity to motion realism when motion transplantation is applied. Motion transplantation, transplanting the motion of certain body parts from one clip to another that just contains arm gestures, is a simple yet powerful solution to add variance to body motions. However, it will break the coordination among body parts and potentially generate unrealistic body motions. The experiments found that the presence of posture-gesture mergers, defined as when posture and gesture are integrated into a whole unied movement [59, 60], in the source motion lowers output quality. A distance metric based on motion energy variation was found to be related to people's sensitivity to motion realism. In summary, this thesis covers several experiments on understanding motion properties and explores methods for gesture and body motion modeling. It represents a step towards creating expressive full body motions for ECAs or Humanoid robots automatically.","Luo, Pengcheng",0,,1275
3564,Modeling the Strategic Behavior of Drivers for Multi-Lane Highway Driving,"Current state-of-the-art highway traffic flow simulators rely extensively on models using formulas similar to those describing physical phenomena, such as forces, viscosity, or potential fields. These models have been carefully calibrated to represent the overall flow of traffic and they can also be extended to account for the cognitive limitations of the driver, such as reaction times. However, there are some aspects of driver behavior, such as strategic planning, that are difficult to formulate mathematically. In this article, we describe the YAES-DSIM highway simulator, which integrates virtual physics models with an agent-based model. The virtual physics component models the physical vehicle and the subconscious aspects of the driver behavior, while the agent component is responsible for the strategic and tactical decisions, which are difficult to model using virtual physics. We focus on the lane change decisions of the drivers, with special attention to the optimal lane positioning for a safe exit. We have used the model to simulate the flow of traffic on Highway 408 in Orlando, Florida, and to study the impact of various tactical and strategic decisions on the efficiency and safety of the traffic.","Luo, Y.",0,10.1080/15472450.2014.889964,1276

Subjects were presented with 12 computer-generated 3D models in two background variants. For the first group 12 models were rendered on a neutral background (empty room) and for the second group the same models were rendered on a suitable background, which was relevant to a given model (science-fiction scenery, town etc.). The aim of this study was to check whether the background context would influence differences in comfort level, human-likeness rating and emotional reaction to the models. A statistically significant difference in comfort levels was observed only for one of the models, the same situation was noticed for emotional reactions. We also tested the possibility of existence of more than one uncanny valley related to different factors as suggested in Katsyri et al.","Lupkowski, P.",0,10.1007/s12369-018-0490-7,1277
3571,A satisfaction-based model for affect recognition from conversational features in spoken dialog systems,"Detecting user affect automatically during real-time conversation is the main challenge towards our greater aim of infusing social intelligence into a natural-language mixed-initiative High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) audio control spoken dialog agent. In recent years, studies on affect detection from voice have moved on to using realistic, non-acted data, which is subtler. However, it is more challenging to perceive subtler emotions and this is demonstrated in tasks such as labeling and machine prediction. This paper attempts to address part of this challenge by considering the role of user satisfaction ratings and also conversational/dialog features in discriminating contentment and frustration, two types of emotions that are known to be prevalent within spoken human-computer interaction. However, given the laboratory constraints, users might be positively biased when rating the system, indirectly making the reliability of the satisfaction data questionable. Machine learning experiments were conducted on two datasets, users and annotators, which were then compared in order to assess the reliability of these datasets. Our results indicated that standard classifiers were significantly more successful in discriminating the abovementioned emotions and their intensities (reflected by user satisfaction ratings) from annotator data than from user data. These results corroborated that: first, satisfaction data could be used directly as an alternative target variable to model affect, and that they could be predicted exclusively by dialog features. Second, these were only true when trying to predict the abovementioned emotions using annotator's data, suggesting that user bias does exist in a laboratory-led evaluation. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

3576,A fully automated conversational agent for promoting mental well-being: A pilot RCT using mixed methods,"Fully automated self-help interventions can serve as highly cost-effective mental health promotion tools for massive amounts of people. However, these interventions are often characterised by poor adherence. One way to address this problem is to mimic therapy support by a conversational agent. The objectives of this study were to assess the effectiveness and adherence of a smartphone app, delivering strategies used in positive psychology and CBT interventions via an automated chatbot (Shim) for a non-clinical population - as well as to explore participants' views and experiences of interacting with this chatbot. A total of 28 participants were randomized to either receive the chatbot intervention (n = 14) or to a wait-list control group (n = 14). Findings revealed that participants who adhered to the intervention (n = 13) showed significant interaction effects of group and time on psychological well-being (FS) and perceived stress (PSS-10) compared to the wait-list control group, with small to large between effect sizes (Cohen's d range 0.14-1.06). Also, the participants showed high engagement during the 2-week long intervention, with an average open app ratio of 17.71 times for the whole period. This is higher compared to other studies on fully automated interventions claiming to be highly engaging, such as Woebot and the Panoply app. The qualitative data revealed sub-themes which, to our knowledge, have not been found previously, such as the moderating format of the chatbot. The results of this study, in particular the good adherence rate, validated the usefulness of replicating this study in the future with a larger sample size and an active control group. This is important, as the search for fully automated, yet highly engaging and effective digital self-help interventions for promoting mental health is crucial for the public health.","Ly, K.

The nature of visual information that is used for a collision free interaction requires further understanding. We aim to manipulate the nature of visual information in two forms, global and local information appearances. Sixteen healthy participants navigated towards a target in an immersive computer-assisted virtual environment (CAVE) using a joystick. A moving passive obstacle crossed the participant's trajectory perpendicularly at various pre-defined risks of collision distances. The obstacle was presented with one of five virtual appearances, associated to global motion cues (i.e., a cylinder or a sphere), or local motion cues (i.e., only the legs or the trunk). A full body virtual walker, showing both local and global motion cues, used as a reference condition. The final crossing distance was affected by the global motion appearances, however, appearance had no qualitative effect on motion adaptations. These findings contribute towards further understanding what information people use when interacting with others.","Lynch, S. D.",0,10.1109/tvcg.2017.2718514,1280

3587,,"For a long time, humans have been communicating with others through voice, facial expressions, and body movements. If a humanoid robot has a human-habitual, natural, and human-like interactive form, it tends to be accepted by humans. To date, the majority of the existing humanoid robots have had difficulty in interacting with humans in a human-like way. This study focuses on this issue and develops a socially interactive system for enhancing the natural communication ability of a humanoid robot. The system, which is implemented in an android robot, BHR-4, features hearing, voice conversation, and facial and body emotional expression capabilities. Then, a full-body social motion planner for a humanoid robot is presented. The objective of this planner is to control the whole-body motion of the robot in a way similar to that of humans. Finally, experiments are conducted on the robot regarding its interactions with humans in a pure indoor environment. It is expected that the socially interactive system can enhance the natural communication ability of an android robot. The results of the experiments show that the combination of verbal behavior with facial expressions and body movements is better than verbal behavior alone, verbal behavior combined with facial expressions, or verbal behavior combined with body movements.

Less is known about the ontogenetic origin of this bias. In 4 experiments, we found that 9- to 10-month-old infants expected a human hand, but not a mechanical tool with similar affordances, to be the primary cause of nonrandom sampling events that resulted in regular color patterns in visual displays. Infants did not have such expectations when the sampling appeared random with no regular compositions in the outcome. These findings provide the first evidence that by about 9 months of age, infants infer the presence of an intentional agent from the perception of regularity.","Ma, L. L.",0,10.1037/a0029620,1283

3597,"In the uncanny valley, transportation predicts narrative enjoyment more than empathy, but only for the tragic hero","The uncanny valley is a term used to describe the phenomenon that human simulations that are nearly but not quite realistic often give viewers an uneasy, eerie feeling. Given the prevalence of computer-animated human characters and a narrative framework in videogames, serious games, and health-related scenarios, it is important to examine how the uncanny valley influences narrative empathy and enjoyment. In a 2 x 2 x 2 between-groups posttest-only experiment, 738 participants took the role of a patient in a virtual consultation with a doctor; the consultation varied in the doctor's character (hero or villain), its subplot ending (happy or tragic), and its depiction (computer animated or real). The participants' posttest results showed greater emotional empathy and enjoyment in the hero condition and no significant difference in emotional empathy for the computer animation but greater narrative enjoyment and persuasion. Just endings (hero rewarded, villain punished) elicited much greater pleasure than unjust endings. In comparing computer animation with recorded video, emotional empathy was a significantly stronger predictor of narrative enjoyment than transportation only for the real hero with a tragic ending. The enjoyment and persuasiveness of the computer-animated doctor patient consultation bodes well for the use of animation in interactive visual narratives.","MacDorman, K.

3600,Reducing consistency in human realism increases the uncanny valley effect; increasing category uncertainty does not,"Human replicas may elicit unintended cold, eerie feelings in viewers, an effect known as the uncanny valley. Masahiro Mori, who proposed the effect in 1970, attributed it to inconsistencies in the replica's realism with some of its features perceived as human and others as nonhuman. This study aims to determine whether reducing realism consistency in visual features increases the uncanny valley effect. In three rounds of experiments, 548 participants categorized and rated humans, animals, and objects that varied from computer animated to real. Two sets of features were manipulated to reduce realism consistency. (For humans, the sets were eyes-eyelashes-mouth and skin-nose-eyebrows.) Reducing realism consistency caused humans and animals, but not objects, to appear eerier and colder. However, the predictions of a competing theory, proposed by Ernst jentsch in 1906, were not supported: The most ambiguous representations those eliciting the greatest category uncertainty were neither the eeriest nor the coldest.

3602,Individual differences predict sensitivity to the uncanny valley,"It can be creepy to notice that something human-looking is not real. But can sensitivity to this phenomenon, known as the uncanny valley, be predicted from superficially unrelated traits? Based on results from at least 489 participants, this study examines the relation between nine theoretically motivated trait indices and uncanny valley sensitivity, operationalized as increased eerie ratings and decreased warmth ratings for androids presented in videos. Animal Reminder Sensitivity, Neuroticism, its Anxiety facet, and Religious Fundamentalism significantly predicted uncanny valley sensitivity. In addition, Concern over Mistakes and Personal Distress significantly predicted android eerie ratings but not warmth. The structural equation model indicated that Religious Fundamentalism operates indirectly, through robot-related attitudes, to heighten uncanny valley sensitivity, while Animal Reminder Sensitivity increases eerie ratings directly. These results suggest that the uncanny valley phenomenon may operate through both sociocultural constructions and biological adaptations for threat avoidance, such as the fear and disgust systems. Trait indices that predict uncanny valley sensitivity warrant investigation by experimental methods to explicate the processes underlying the uncanny valley phenomenon.","MacDorman, K.

3604,The uncanny valley does not interfere with level 1 visual perspective taking,"When a computer-animated human character looks eerily realistic, viewers report a loss of empathy; they have difficulty taking the character's perspective. To explain this perspective-taking impairment, known as the uncanny valley, a novel theory is proposed: The more human or less eerie a character looks, the more it interferes with level 1 visual perspective taking when the character's perspective differs from that of the human observer (e.g., because the character competitively activates shared circuits in the observer's brain). The proposed theory is evaluated in three experiments involving a dot-counting task in which participants either assumed or ignored the perspective of characters varying in their human photorealism and eeriness. Although response times and error rates were lower when the number of dots faced by the observer and character were the same (congruent condition) than when they were different (incongruent condition), no consistent pattern emerged between the human photorealism or eeriness of the characters and participants' response times and error rates. Thus, the proposed theory is unsupported for level 1 visual perspective taking. As the effects of the uncanny valley on empathy have not previously been investigated systematically, these results provide evidence to eliminate one possible explanation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We report results from studies that we have conducted with Billie, an IVA employed as a vocabulary trainer, as well as research findings on the acceptance of the agent as a trainer by adults and children. The results show that Billie can train humans as well as a human teacher can and that both adults and children accept the IVA as a trainer. The advantages of IVAs are multiple. First, their teaching methods can be based on neuropsychological research findings concerning memory and learning practice. Second, virtual teachers can provide individualized training. Third, they coach users during training, are always supportive, and motivate learners to train. Fourth, agents will reside in the user's mobile devices and thus be at the user's disposal everywhere and anytime. Agents in apps will make foreign language training accessible to anybody at low cost.

The first chapter provides the background information required to understand the molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics simulation (MD) studies conducted and discussed in this thesis. This introductory chapter is organized as follows: the first section is an introduction to molecular recognition in protein-ligand interactions, the second section introduces computer-aided drug design, the third section introduces homology modelling, the fourth section discusses molecular docking and virtual screening, the fifth section introduces methods for binding affinity prediction and the sixth section explains MD simulations. The second chapter of this thesis proposes a library of compounds with enhanced activity compared to the parent molecule it had been modified from. Tavaborole, the recently approved topological anti-fungal drug, inhibits leucyl tRNA synthetase by irreversible covalent bonding and hinders protein synthesis. The benzo-boroxole pharmacophore of tavaborole is responsible for its unique activity. This study theoretically proposes molecules with improved anti-fungal affinity. The third chapter of this thesis explores the binding pathway of anti-cancer drug, BRACO19 and human telomeric DNA G-quadruplex. G-quadruplex specific ligands that stabilizes the G-quadruplex, have great potential to be developed as anticancer agents. A free human telomeric DNA G-quadruplex and an unbound BRACO19 are simulated and the resulting structure is then compared with an experimentally solved X-ray structure of human telomeric G-quadruplex with a bound BRACO19 intercalated within the G-quadruplex. Three binding modes have been identified: top end stacking, bottom intercalation and groove binding. Bottom intercalation mode (51% of the population) is identical to the binding pose in the X-ray solved crystal structure. The fourth chapter of this thesis compares different topological folds of human telomeric DNA G-quadruplexes (parallel, antiparallel and hybrid) that have been experimentally solved using molecular dynamic simulation to understand the 62-fold preferential selectivity of BRACO19 towards human telomeric DNA G-quadruplex over DNA duplex. Groove binding mode was found to be the most stable binding mode for the duplex and top stacking mode for the G-quadruplexes. The non-existential binding selectivity of BRACO19 can be accounted to the similar groove binding to both the duplex and the G-quadruplex. For that reason, a modification should be induced such that this prospective ligand destabilizes binding to the duplex but stabilizes the G-quadruplex binding.","Machireddy, Babitha",0,,1291

However, the change to digital technology denied the affordances to apply hands-on skill and undermined key elements of the engineering occupational identity.

3616,,"Existing computational cognitive models of spatial memory often neglect difficulties posed by the real world, such as sensory noise, uncertainty, and high spatial complexity. On the other hand, robotics is unconcerned with understanding biological cognition. This thesis takes an interdisciplinary approach towards developing cognitively plausible spatial memory models able to function in realistic environments, despite sensory noise and spatial complexity. We hypothesized that Bayesian localization and error correction accounts for how brains might maintain accurate location estimates, despite sensory errors. We argued that these mechanisms are psychologically plausible (producing human-like behaviour) as well as neurally plausible (implementable in brains). To support our hypotheses, we reported modelling results of neural recordings from rats (acquired outside this PhD), constituting the first evidence for Bayesian inference in neurons representing spatial location, as well as modelling human behaviour data. In addition to dealing with uncertainty, spatial representations have to be stored and used efficiently in realistic environments, by using structured representations such as hierarchies (which facilitate efficient retrieval and route planning). Evidence suggests that human spatial memories are structured hierarchically, but the process responsible for these structures has not been known. We investigated features influencing them using data from experiments in real-world and virtual reality environments, and proposed a computational model able to predict them in advance (based on clustering in psychological space). We have extended a general cognitive architecture, LIDA (Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent), by these probabilistic models of how brains might estimate, correct, and structure representations of spatial locations. We demonstrated the ability of the resulting model to deal with the challenges of realistic environments by running it in high-fidelity robotic simulations, modelled after participants' actual cities. Our results show that the model can deal with noise, uncertainty and complexity, and that it can reproduce the spatial accuracies of human participants.","Madl, Tamas",0,,1294
3617,,"Despite recent advances in the detection and treatment of cancer, it remains the second most common cause of death in the United States, second only to heart disease. It is estimated that half of all men and a third of all women in America will develop cancer in their lifetimes. Traditional chemotherapy is predicated on the idea that rapidly dividing cells (such as tumor cells in nascent stages of cancer development), can be targeted preferentially by chemotherapeutic agents. Commonly, plant alkaloids, such as vincristine and paclitaxel, have been utilized to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Next generation taxoid SB-T-1214, a taxoid superior to paclitaxel, was synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations of the further improved third generation taxoids SB-T-1214-05 and SB-T-1214-06 were performed to investigate the discrepancy in their potencies against certain cancer cell lines. Another natural product, Combretastatin A-4 (CA4) is known to act as a vascular disrupting agent (VDA) by increasing the permeability of tumor vasculature, causing leakage of plasma proteins and reduction of vessel diameter. The reduction in diameter causes high interstitial fluid pressure and results in red blood cell stacking, increasing the viscosity of the blood and effectively choking the tumor of nutrients, resulting in tumor necrosis. In this research, novel fluorine-containing CA4 analogs were designed following virtual screening using DOCK 6.7 and use of docking software with Glide and Autodock Vina.

3619,,"Many real-life problems such as distributed meeting scheduling, mobile frequency allocation and resource allocation can be solved using multi-agent paradigms. Distributed constraint satisfaction problems (DisCSPs) is a framework for describing such problems in terms of related subproblems, called a complex local problem (CLP), which are dispersed over a number of locations, each with its own constraints on the values their variables can take. An agent knows the variables in its CLP plus the variables (and their current value) which are directly related to one of its own variables and the constraints relating them. It knows little about the rest of the problem. Thus, each CLP is solved by an agent which cooperates with other agents to solve the overall problem. Algorithms for solving DisCSPs can be classified as either systematic or local search with the former being complete and the latter incomplete. The algorithms generally assume that each agent has only one variable as they can solve DisCSP with CLPs using “virtual” agents. However, in large DisCSPs where it is appropriate to trade completeness off against timeliness, systematic search algorithms can be expensive when compared to local search algorithms which generally converge quicker to a solution (if a solution is found) when compared to systematic algorithms. A major drawback of local search algorithms is getting stuck at local optima. Significant researches have focused on heuristics which can be used in an attempt to either escape or avoid local optima. This thesis makes significant contributions to local search algorithms for DisCSPs. Firstly, we present a novel combination of heuristics in DynAPP (Dynamic Agent Prioritisation with Penalties), which is a distributed synchronous local search algorithm for solving DisCSPs having one variable per agent. DynAPP combines penalties on values and dynamic agent prioritisation heuristics to escape local optima. Secondly, we develop a divide and conquer approach that handles DisCSP with CLPs by exploiting the structure of the problem. The divide and conquer approach prioritises the finding of variable instantiations which satisfy the constraints between agents which are often more expensive to satisfy when compared to constraints within an agent. The approach also exploits concurrency and combines the following search strategies: (i) both systematic and local searches; (ii) both centralised and distributed searches; and (iii) a modified compilation strategy. We also present an algorithm that implements the divide and conquer approach in Multi-DCA (Divide and Conquer Algorithm for Agents with CLPs). DynAPP and Multi-DCA were evaluated on several benchmark problems and compared to the leading algorithms for DisCSPs and DisCSPs with CLPs respectively. The results show that at the region of difficult problems, combining search heuristics and exploiting problem structure in distributed constraint satisfaction achieve significant benefits (i.e. generally used less computational time and communication costs) over existing competing methods.","Magaji, Amina Sambo-Muhammad",0,,1296
3620,,"This thesis studies rhythm from an evolutionary computation perspective. Rhythm is the most fundamental dimension of music and can be used as a ground to describe the evolution of music. More specifically, the main goal of the thesis is to investigate how complex rhythmic structures evolve, subject to the cultural transmission between individuals in a society. The study is developed by means of computer modelling and simulations informed by evolutionary computation and artificial life (A-Life). In this process, self-organisation plays a fundamental role. The evolutionary process is steered by the evaluation of rhythmic complexity and by the exposure to rhythmic material. In this thesis, composers and musicologists will find the description of a system named A-Rhythm, which explores the emerged behaviours in a community of artificial autonomous agents that interact in a virtual environment. The interaction between the agents takes the form of imitation games. A set of necessary criteria was established for the construction of a compositional system in which cultural transmission is observed. These criteria allowed the comparison with related work in the field of evolutionary computation and music. In the development of the system, rhythmic representation is discussed. The proposed representation enabled the development of complexity and similarity based measures, and the recombination of rhythms in a creative manner. A-Rhythm produced results in the form of simulation data which were evaluated in terms of the coherence of repertoires of the agents. The data shows how rhythmic sequences are changed and sustained in the population, displaying synchronic and diachronic diversity. Finally, this tool was used as a generative mechanism for composition and several examples are presented.","Magalhaes Martins, Joao Pedro",0,,1297
3621,,"Land-cover changes from human land-uses are seen as primary sources of global environmental change. The multitude of forces influencing land change and the complexity of their interactions present substantial challenges for connecting land-use changes to their causes at and between local, regional, and global scales. Due to this complexity, simulation modeling is a primary tool for conceptualizing land-use system structure and testing causal explanations of observed patterns of land changes. Inductive modeling methods, which have been the dominant approach in land change science, have advanced understanding of global patterns and driving forces of land-use and -cover change (LUCC). However, because land-use systems exhibit nonlinear dynamics driven by adaptive responses of human decision-makers, deductive modeling methods that build process-based understanding of land change are also needed. Using two different agent-based models as virtual laboratories, this dissertation explores how individual land users' decision-making processes translate into observed land-use patterns across a spectrum of different land-use systems. The first model represented the decision-making models and interactions of consumer, farmer, and developer agents in land and housing markets in an expanding ex-urban land-use system, which produced development patterns characteristic of 'urban sprawl' from the bottom-up. The same modeling framework was adapted to experimentally test alternative developer decision-making models, and results indicated cognitive biases and credit constraints may lead to inefficient land-use patterns and impediments to adopting ecological subdivision designs. The second model tested mechanistic explanations of empirically-based, system-level patterns of agricultural change due to individual land-user responses to changing environmental, demographic, and economic conditions. Results demonstrated threshold transitions between alternative livelihood strategies defined by interactions between market influence and population pressure. The model was then expanded and applied to a range of real land-use systems. Comparisons across six sites illustrated the varying effects of common processes driving land-use change, and revealed important mechanisms that influenced agents' land-use decisions and resulting patterns of LUCC. Ultimately, agent-based virtual laboratories made explicit and testable connections between individual decision-making processes and system-level patterns of LUCC. I conclude with a synthesis of the insights gained from model experiments, and put forth a framework for a general land systems theory.","Magliocca, Nicholas Rossi",0,,1298
3622,Exploring Agricultural Livelihood Transitions with an Agent-Based Virtual Laboratory: Global Forces to Local Decision-Making,"Rural populations are undergoing rapid changes in both their livelihoods and land uses, with associated impacts on ecosystems, global biogeochemistry, and climate change. A primary challenge is, thus, to explain these shifts in terms of the actors and processes operating within a variety of land systems in order to understand how land users might respond locally to future changes in broader-scale environmental and economic conditions. Using 'induced intensification' theory as a benchmark, we develop a generalized agent-based model to investigate mechanistic explanations of relationships between agricultural intensity and population density, environmental suitability, and market influence. Land-use and livelihood decisions modeled from basic micro-economic theories generated spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural intensification consistent with predictions of induced intensification theory. Further, agent actions in response to conditions beyond those described by induced intensification theory were explored, revealing that interactions among environmental constraints, population pressure, and market influence may produce transitions to multiple livelihood regimes of varying market integration. The result is new hypotheses that could modify and enrich understanding of the classic relationship between agricultural intensity and population density. The strength of this agent-based model and the experimental results is the generalized form of the decision-making processes underlying land-use and livelihood transitions, creating the prospect of a virtual laboratory for systematically generating hypotheses of how agent decisions and interactions relate to observed land-use and livelihood patterns across diverse land systems.","Magliocca, N.

3625,Cross-Site Comparison of Land-Use Decision-Making and Its Consequences across Land Systems with a Generalized Agent-Based Model,"Local changes in land use result from the decisions and actions of land-users within land systems, which are structured by local and global environmental, economic, political, and cultural contexts. Such cross-scale causation presents a major challenge for developing a general understanding of how local decision-making shapes land-use changes at the global scale. This paper implements a generalized agent-based model (ABM) as a virtual laboratory to explore how global and local processes influence the land-use and livelihood decisions of local land-users, operationalized as settlement-level agents, across the landscapes of six real-world test sites. Test sites were chosen in USA, Laos, and China to capture globally-significant variation in population density, market influence, and environmental conditions, with land systems ranging from swidden to commercial agriculture. Publicly available global data were integrated into the ABM to model cross-scale effects of economic globalization on local land-use decisions. A suite of statistics was developed to assess the accuracy of model-predicted land-use outcomes relative to observed and random (i.e. null model) landscapes. At four of six sites, where environmental and demographic forces were important constraints on land-use choices, modeled land-use outcomes were more similar to those observed across sites than the null model. At the two sites in which market forces significantly influenced land-use and livelihood decisions, the model was a poorer predictor of land-use outcomes than the null model. Model successes and failures in simulating real-world land-use patterns enabled the testing of hypotheses on land-use decision-making and yielded insights on the importance of missing mechanisms. The virtual laboratory approach provides a practical framework for systematic improvement of both theory and predictive skill in land change science based on a continual process of experimentation and model enhancement.","Magliocca, N.

3628,Using Pattern-oriented Modeling (POM) to Cope with Uncertainty in Multi-scale Agent-based Models of Land Change,"Local land-use and -cover changes (LUCCs) are the result of both the decisions and actions of individual land-users, and the larger global and regional economic, political, cultural, and environmental contexts in which land-use systems are embedded. However, the dearth of detailed empirical data and knowledge of the influences of global/regional forces on local land-use decisions is a substantial challenge to formulating multi-scale agent-based models (ABMs) of land change. Pattern-oriented modeling (POM) is a means to cope with such process and parameter uncertainty, and to design process-based land change models despite a lack of detailed process knowledge or empirical data. POM was applied to a simplified agent-based model of LUCC to design and test model relationships linking global market influence to agents' land-use decisions within an example test site. Results demonstrated that evaluating alternative model parameterizations based on their ability to simultaneously reproduce target patterns led to more realistic land-use outcomes. This framework is promising as an agent-based virtual laboratory to test hypotheses of how and under what conditions driving forces of land change differ from a generalized model representation depending on the particular land-use system and location.","Magliocca, N.

3630,An Architecture Combining IMS-LD and Web Services for Flexible Data-Transfer in CSCL,"This article presents evaluation data regarding the MAPIS3 architecture which is proposed as a solution for the data-transfer among various tools to promote flexible collaborative learning designs. We describe the problem that this architecture deals with as ""tool orchestration"" in collaborative learning settings. This term refers to a situation where data relevant to a collaborative learning activity need to be forwarded to and processed by various learning technological tools (e.g. a forum, a pedagogical agent, a service or a software component that provides a specific functionality, etc.), in order for the collaborative activity to be efficiently represented and teachers' pedagogical level decisions implemented. To facilitate data-transfer among the various tools and accomplish flexible interventions during runtime, the architecture employs a key component (""mediator component"") which makes use of an IMS-LD based representation of the activity. By implementing the architecture tradeoff analysis method in three case studies, evaluation data regarding the proposed architecture have been recorded and are presented in this paper. Targeted stakeholders (learners, teachers, and developers) provided valuable insights on the capacity of the architecture to efficiently facilitate tool orchestration during the realization of a flexible IMS-LD based course. Additionally, limitations of IMS-LD are discussed and suggestions are made on how to tackle these constraints and increase flexibility during tool orchestration in collaborative learning deployment.","Magnisalis, I.",0,10.1109/tlt.2015.2512604,1302
3632,,"Combinatorial auctions represent sophisticated market mechanisms that are becoming increasingly important in various business applications due to their ability to improve economic efficiency and auction revenue, especially in settings where participants tend to exhibit more complex user preferences and valuations. While recent studies on such auctions have found heterogeneity in bidder behavior and its varying effect on auction outcomes, the area of bidder behavior and its impact on economic outcomes in combinatorial auctions is still largely underexplored. One of the main reasons is that it is nearly impossible to control for the type of bidder behavior in real world or experimental auction setups. In my dissertation I propose two data-driven approaches (heuristic-based in the first part and machine-learning-based in the second part) to design and develop software agents that replicate several canonical types of human behavior observed in this complex trading mechanism. Leveraging these agents in an agent-based simulation framework, I examine the effect of different bidder compositions (i.e., competing against bidders with different bidding strategies) on auction outcomes and bidder behavior. I use the case of continuous combinatorial auctions to demonstrate both approaches and provide insights that facilitate the implementation of this combinatorial design for online marketplaces. In the third part of my thesis, I conduct human vs. machine style experiments by integrating the bidding agents into an experimental combinatorial auction platform, where participants play against (human-like) agents with certain pre-determined bidding strategies. This part investigates the impact of different competitive environments on bidder behavior and auction outcomes, the underlying reasons for different behaviors, and how bidders learn under different competitive environments.","Mahdavi Adeli, Ali",0,,1303
3633,The conceptualization of childhood in North American pediatric dentistry texts: a discursive case study analysis,"BackgroundIn recent years, conceptions of childhood have been evolving towards an increased recognition of children as active agents, capable of participating in the determination of their wellbeing. In pediatric dentistry, the extent to which these conceptions are being discursively endorsed is not well known. AimThe aim of this investigation was to examine the discursive construction of childhood in seminal North American pedagogical dentistry materials. DesignWe conducted a qualitative discourse analysis of a sample of prominent texts using a sociological discourse analysis approach. ResultsWe analyzed the latest edition of Macdonald and Avery's textbook (Chapter: Non pharmacologic management of children's behaviors) and the clinical practice guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, AAPD (Behavior guidance for the pediatric dental patient). The analysis produced five salient discursive categories: socialization through behavior modification; development and behavior; paternalism; the utility of child-centered communication; and consequentialism. While there were instances of a child-centered focus in the texts, the main discourses were rooted in developmentalism and behaviorism. There was scant acknowledgment of the importance of children's agency or voice, which runs contrary to child-centered discourses and practices in related disciplines (e.g., pediatric medicine, nursing). ConclusionPredominant discourses in pediatric dentistry suggest a paternalistic, behaviorist approach to the management' of children in the dental office, focused primarily on completing interventions. Priorities for the future development of pediatric dentistry are discussed, integrating more child-centered approaches.","Makansi, N.",0,10.1111/ipd.12325,1304
3636,Exaggerating Facial Expressions: A Way to Intensify Emotion or a Way to the Uncanny Valley?,"Exaggeration of facial expressions is used in animation and robotics to intensify emotions. However, modifying a human-like face can lead to an unsettling outcome. This phenomenon is known as uncanny valley. The goal of this study was to identify the realism level and magnitude of facial expression that produce the maximum amount of emotional intensity and the minimum amount of perceived strangeness. We studied the perceived intensity of emotion and perceived strangeness of faces with varying levels of realism (from schematic to photorealistic) and magnitude of facial expressions (from neutral to extremely exaggerated). We found that less realistic faces required more exaggeration to reach the emotional intensity of a real human face. While there is a range of emotional intensity that can be expressed by real human faces (from neutral to full intensity), we found that the same range of emotional intensity could be expressed by artificial faces when exaggeration was used. However, attempts to express emotional intensities outside this range using exaggeration led to strange-looking faces at all levels of realism.","Makarainen, M.",0,10.1007/s12559-014-9273-0,1305
3639,,"Believability of characters is an objective in literature, theater, animation, film, and other media. Virtual characters, believable as sharing their ethnic background with users, improve their perception of the character and, sometimes, even their task performance. Social scientists refer to this phenomenon as homophily—humans tend to associate and bond with similar others. Homophily based on ethnic similarity between humans and robots, however, has not previously been tested, in part due to the difficulties of endowing a robot with ethnicity. We tackle this task by attempting to avoid blatant labels of ethnicity such as clothing, accent, or ethnic appearance (although we control for the latter), and instead aim at evoking ethnicity via more subtle verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Until now, when designing ethnically-specific virtual agents, their behaviors have been typically borrowed from anthropological studies and cultural models. Other approaches collect corpora of human interactions in target contexts and select maximally distinctive behaviors for further implementation on a virtual character. In this thesis, we argue that both behaviors that signal differences between an anthropologist and the target ethnicity (rich points), as well as maximally distinctive behaviors between target ethnicities, may vary on their ability to evoke ethnic attribution. We address this discrepancy by performing an additional evaluation of the candidate behaviors on their salience as ethnic cues via online crowdsourcing. The most salient ethnic cues are then implemented on the robot for a study with colocated participants. This methodology has allowed us to design robot characters that elicit associations between the robot's behaviors and ethnic attributions of the characters as native speakers of American English, or native speakers of Arabic speaking English as a foreign language, by members of both of these ethnic communities. Although we did not find evidence of ethnic homophily, we believe that the suggested pathway can be used to create robot characters with a higher degree of perceived similarity, and better chances of evoking homophily effect.","Makatachev, Maxim",0,,1306
3640,,"Information gathered socially online is a key feature of the growth and development of modern society. Presently the Internet is a platform for the distribution of data. Millions of people use Online Social Networks daily as a tool to get updated with social, political, educational or other occurrences. In many cases information derived from an Online Social Network is acted upon and often shared with other networks, without further assessments or judgments. Many people do not check to see if the information shared is credible. A user may trust the information generated by a close friend without questioning its credibility, in contrast to a message generated by an unknown user. This work considers the concept of credibility in the wider sense, by proposing whether a user can trust the service provider or even the information itself. Two key components of credibility have been explored; trustworthiness and expertise. Credibility has been researched in the past using Twitter as a validation tool. The research was focused on automatic methods of assessing the credibility of sets of tweets using analysis of microblog postings related to trending topics to determine the credibility of tweets. This research develops a framework that can assist the assessment of the credibility of messages in Online Social Networks. Four types of credibility are explored (experienced, surface, reputed and presumed credibility) resulting in a credibility hierarchy. To determine the credibility of messages generated and distributed in Online Social Networks, a virtual network is created, which attributes nodes with individual views to generate messages in the network at random, recording data from a network and analysing the data based on the behaviour exhibited by agents (an agent-based modelling approach). The factors considered for the experiment design included; peer-to-peer networking, collaboration, opinion formation and network rewiring. The behaviour of agents, frequency in which messages are shared and used, the pathway of the messages and how this affects credibility of messages is also considered. A framework is designed and the resulting data are tested using the design. The resulting data generated validated the framework in part, supporting an approach whereby the concept of tagging the message status assists the understanding and application of the credibility hierarchy. Validation was carried out with Twitter data acquired through twitter’s Application Programming Interface (API). There were similarities in the generation and frequency of the message distributions in the network; these findings were also recorded and analysed using the framework proposed. Some limitations were encountered while acquiring data from Twitter, however, there was sufficient evidence of correlation between the simulated and real social network datasets to indicate the validity of the framework.","Makinde, Oghenefejiro Winnie",0,,1307
3641,A gender matching effect in learning with pedagogical agents in an immersive virtual reality science simulation,"The main objective of this study is to determine whether boys and girls learn better when the characteristics of the pedagogical agent are matched to the gender of the learner while learning in immersive virtual reality (VR). Sixty-six middle school students (33 females) were randomly assigned to learn about laboratory safety with one of two pedagogical agents: Marie or a drone, who we predicted serve as a role models for females and males, respectively. The results indicated that there were significant interactions for the dependent variables of performance during learning, retention, and transfer, with girls performing better with Marie (d = 0.98, d = 0.67, and d = 1.03; for performance, retention, and transfer, respectively) and boys performing better with the drone (d = -0.41, d = -0.45, d = -0.23, respectively). The results suggest that gender-specific design of pedagogical agents may play an important role in VR learning environments.","Makransky, G.",1,10.1111/jcal.12335,1308
3644,"Changing crops in response to climate: Virtual Nang Rong, Thailand in an agent based simulation","The effects of extended climatic variability on agricultural land use were explored for the type of system found in villages of northeastern Thailand. An agent based model developed for the Nang Rong district was used to simulate land allotted to jasmine rice, heavy rice, cassava, and sugar cane. The land use choices in the model depended on likely economic outcomes, but included elements of bounded rationality in dependence on household demography. The socioeconomic dynamics are endogenous in the system, and climate changes were added as exogenous drivers. Villages changed their agricultural effort in many different ways. Most villages reduced the amount of land under cultivation, primarily with reduction in jasmine rice, but others did not. The variation in responses to climate change indicates potential sensitivity to initial conditions and path dependence for this type of system. The differences between our virtual villages and the real villages of the region indicate effects of bounded rationality and limits on model applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

3655,,"Research aims to define the impact of diverse cultural factors on formation of students' intercultural competences. Study revealed following negative tendencies: students have insufficient knowledge about different cultures, in fact, they do not have any experience of communicating with other cultural representatives, and they are reluctant to integrate with different cultures. These gaps are directly correlated with school culture dimensions, such as: school community diversity, teaching content, and the style of pedagogical relations. Among the positive trends, we can differentiate the following: students' readiness to consider different views in school-related decision-making process; students' belief that they can improve the school culture. The school, as the leading agent of intercultural education, should undertake the responsibility for developing intercultural competencies in students in order to eliminate the identified gaps and strengthen the positive trends, which can be achieved by active, consistent, and purposeful use of intercultural education methods and extracurricular educational strategies.","Malazonia, David",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2331186X.2017.1302867,1310
3659,,"This thesis has attempted to understand the role of mainstream schools: elite English-medium schools, public schools and Islamic madaris in reproducing various social classes in Pakistan. Bourdieu’s theory of social reproduction serves as a major conceptual framework in this study, and it has been complemented by Anyon’s thesis about social class and school knowledge. My study suggests that an unequal availability of capital resources, agents’ class-habitus, and the type of their “cultural currency” act as selection mechanisms that clearly favour some social groups over others. This consolidates existing social-class hierarchy. The ruling classes ensure the transfer of their power and privilege to their children by providing them quality education in elite schools. The disadvantaged classes have no other option than to educate their children either in public schools or Islamic madaris. The new non-elite private schools have blatantly made education a commodity. This has contributed towards educational apartheid in the country. My study underscores that the working-class parents possess cultural capital which they transmit through building efficient learning environments in family settings. Yet, their class-habitus plays a causal role in keeping aspirations low. The three types of schools constitute distinct fields of education and provide a fairly different schooling experience to their students. For instance, these schools have different standards of material/human resources that are likely to instill a hierarchical view of the world among students. Likewise, differing curricular, pedagogical, and student evaluation practices emphasize different cognitive and behavioural skills. These differences can become central features for the reproduction of the division of labour at work and in society between those who plan and manage and those in the work force whose jobs primarily entail carrying out policies made by others. Public school knowledge has some exchange value in the marketplace, but it legitimates the ideology of production for consumption. I recommend that an integrated and equitable system of “national education” is vital for nation building. For future research, I suggest both considering different components of cultural capital other than exposure to high culture and exploring a wide range of dispositions to better understand how they influence one’s actions.","Malik, Akhtar Hassan",0,,1311
3660,,"A moving road vehicle is subjected to many fluid interferences caused by a number of external agents apart from the vehicle itself. Vehicles moving in proximity to a side wall is an interesting aspect that has been little investigated in the literature. This is of great interest in motorsports, more specifically in NASCAR racing. The aim of this thesis is to develop a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model that can simulate the motion of a race car moving close to a side wall with an objective of understanding the influence of this side barrier on the overall aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle, like the force and moment coefficients. Additionally, flow visualization tools are used to gain insights into the flow field and to explain the causes of the observed aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle. This is accomplished by using a generic car model, a 25-degree slant angle Ahmed Body, in proximity to a side wall in a virtual wind tunnel where the vehicle body is allowed to move at constant velocity. This methodology is different from the traditional CFD approach where the air is blown over a stationary vehicle. The simulation process used in this thesis requires the use of a recently developed meshing methodology called the Overset mesh. All simulations were run using a commercial finite volume CFD code called StarCCM+ where the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes URANS fluid flow solver was used to model turbulence. However, the existing literature suggests that no URANS model can correctly predict the flow field around a 25-degree slant Ahmed body model; all models under-predict turbulence in the initial separated shear layer and over-predict the separation region. Subsequently, the first phase of this thesis involved the determination of a modeling methodology that can accurately predict the flow-field over a 25-degree Ahmed body. Two two-equation eddy-viscosity turbulence models, the AKN and SST preferred by many researchers for CFD simulations of massively separated flows, were tested. It turned out that only the latter with modified model coefficients was capable of reproducing the experimental results with a reasonable accuracy. Compared to the eddy viscosity CFD simulations of an isolated 25-degree slant angle Ahmed body seen in existing literature, the results presented in this thesis show significantly better correlations with experiments. The wall proximity studies show a strong influence of the presence of the wall on the overall aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle body. When compared with the experimental studies, although both show similar trends, however, there exists a significant difference between the experimental and CFD predicted results which tend to worsen as one approaches the wall. These differences can be attributed to fact that the CFD emulation of the flow around the side-wall is more realistic compared to the experimental implementation.","Mallapragada, Srivatsa",0,,1312
3661,Using an agent-based crime simulation to predict the effects of urban regeneration on individual household burglary risk,"Making realistic predictions about the occurrence of crime is a challenging research area. City-wide crime patterns depend on the behaviour and interactions of a huge number of people (including victims, offenders, and passers-by) as well as a multitude of environmental factors. Modern criminology theory has highlighted the individual-level nature of crime-whereby overall crime rates emerge from individual crimes that are committed by individual people in individual places-but traditional modelling methodologies struggle to capture the complex dynamics of the system. The decision whether or not to commit a burglary, for example, is based on a person's unique behavioural circumstances and the immediate surrounding environment. To address these problems, individual-level simulation techniques such as agent-based modelling have begun to spread to the field of criminology. These models simulate the behaviour of individual people and objects directly; virtual 'agents' are placed in an environment that allows them to travel through space and time, behaving as they would do in the real world. We outline an advanced agent-based model that can be used to simulate occurrences of residential burglary at an individual level. The behaviour within the model closely represents criminology theory and uses real-world data from the city of Leeds, UK as an input. We demonstrate the use of the model to predict the effects of a real urban regeneration scheme on local households.","Malleson, N.",0,10.1068/b38057,1313

3676,,"Widespread unexplained variations in clinical practices and patient outcomes, together with rapidly growing availability of data, suggest major opportunities for improving the quality of medical care. One way that healthcare practitioners try to do that is by participating in organized healthcare quality improvement collaboratives (QICs). In QICs, teams of practitioners from different hospitals exchange information on clinical practices, with the aim of improving health outcomes at their own institutions. However, what works in one hospital may not work in others with different local contexts, due to non-linear interactions among various demographics, treatments, and practices. I.e., the clinical landscape is a complex socio-technical system that is difficult to search. In this dissertation we develop methods for analysis and modeling of complex systems, and apply them to the problem of healthcare improvement. Searching clinical landscapes is a multi-objective dynamic problem, as hospitals simultaneously optimize for multiple patient outcomes. We first discuss a general method we developed for finding which changes in features may be associated with various changes in outcomes at different points in time with different delays in affect. This method correctly inferred interactions on synthetic data, however the complexity and incompleteness of the real hospital dataset available to us limited the usefulness of this approach. We then discuss an agent-based model (ABM) of QICs to show that teams comprising individuals from similar institutions outperform those from more diverse institutions, under nearly all conditions, and that this advantage increases with the complexity of the landscape and the level of noise in assessing performance. We present data from a network of real hospitals that provides encouraging evidence of a high degree of similarity in clinical practices among hospitals working together in QIC teams. Based on model outcomes, we propose a secure virtual collaboration system that would allow hospitals to efficiently identify potentially better practices in use at other institutions similar to theirs, without any institutions having to sacrifice the privacy of their own data. To model the search for quality improvement in clinical fitness landscapes, we need benchmark landscapes with tunable feature interactions. NK landscapes have been the classic benchmarks for modeling landscapes with epistatic interactions, but the ruggedness is only tunable in discrete jumps. Walsh polynomials are more finely tunable than NK landscapes, but are only defined on binary alphabets and, in general, have unknown global maximum and minimum. We define a different subset of interaction models that we dub as NM landscapes. NM landscapes are shown to have smoothly tunable ruggedness and difficulty and known location and value of global maxima. With additional constraints, we can also determine the location and value of the global minima. The proposed NM landscapes can be used with alphabets of any arity, from binary to real-valued, without changing the complexity of the landscape. NM landscapes are thus useful models for simulating clinical landscapes with binary or real decision variables and varying number of interactions. NM landscapes permit proper normalization of fitnesses so that search results can be fairly averaged over different random landscapes with the same parameters, and fairly compared between landscapes with different parameters. In future work we plan to use NM landscapes as benchmarks for testing various algorithms that can discover epistatic interactions in real world datasets.","Manukyan, Narine",0,,1317
3677,Automated Indexing of Internet Stories for Health Behavior Change: Weight Loss Attitude Pilot Study,"Background: Automated health behavior change interventions show promise, but suffer from high attrition and disuse. The Internet abounds with thousands of personal narrative accounts of health behavior change that could not only provide useful information and motivation for others who are also trying to change, but an endless source of novel, entertaining stories that may keep participants more engaged than messages authored by interventionists. Objective: Given a collection of relevant personal health behavior change stories gathered from the Internet, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated indexing algorithm that could select the best possible story to provide to a user to have the greatest possible impact on their attitudes toward changing a targeted health behavior, in this case weight loss. Methods: An indexing algorithm was developed using features informed by theories from behavioral medicine together with text classification and machine learning techniques. The algorithm was trained using a crowdsourced dataset, then evaluated in a 2x2 between-subjects randomized pilot study. One factor compared the effects of participants reading 2 indexed stories vs 2 randomly selected stories, whereas the second factor compared the medium used to tell the stories: text or animated conversational agent. Outcome measures included changes in self-efficacy and decisional balance for weight loss before and after the stories were read. Results: Participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing website (N=103; 53.4%, 55/103 female; mean age 35, SD 10.8 years; 65.0%, 67/103 precontemplation; 19.4%, 20/103 contemplation for weight loss). Participants who read indexed stories exhibited a significantly greater increase in self-efficacy for weight loss compared to the control group (F-1,F-107=5.5, P=.02). There were no significant effects of indexing on change in decisional balance (F-1,F-97=0.05, P=.83) and no significant effects of medium on change in self-efficacy (F-1,F-107=0.04, P=.84) or decisional balance (F-1,F-97=0.78, P=.38). Conclusions: Personal stories of health behavior change can be harvested from the Internet and used directly and automatically in interventions to affect participant attitudes, such as self-efficacy for changing behavior. Such approaches have the potential to provide highly tailored interventions that maximize engagement and retention with minimal intervention development effort.","Manuvinakurike, R.",0,10.2196/jmir.3702,1318
3680,Backchannel Prediction for Mandarin Human-Computer Interaction,"In recent years, researchers have tried to create unhindered human-computer interaction by giving virtual agents human-like conversational skills. Predicting backchannel feedback for agent listeners has become a novel research hot-spot. The main goal of this paper is to identify appropriate features and methods for backchannel prediction in Mandarin conversations. Firstly, multimodal Mandarin conversations are recorded for the analysis of backchannel behaviors. In order to eliminate individual difference in the original face-to-face conversations, more backchannels from different listeners are gathered together. These data confirm that backchannels occurring in the speakers' pauses form a vast majority in Mandarin conversations. Both prosodic and visual features are used in backchannel prediction. Four types of models based on the speakers' pauses are built by using support vector machine classifiers. An evaluation of the pause-based prediction model has shown relatively high accuracy in consideration of the optional nature of backchannel feedback. Finally, the results of the subjective evaluation validate that the conversations performed between humans and virtual listeners using backchannels predicted by the proposed models is more unhindered compared to other backchannel prediction methods.","Mao, X.",0,10.1587/transinf.2014EDP7214,1319
3685,Effects of lateral head tilt on user perceptions of humanoid and android robots,"Human responses to android and humanoid robots have become an important topic to social scientists due to the increasing prevalence of social and service robots in everyday life. The present research connects work on the effects of lateral (sideward) head tilts, an eminent feature of nonverbal human behavior, to the experience of android and humanoid robots. In two experiments (N= 402; N= 253) the influence of lateral head tilts on user perceptions of android and humanoid robots were examined. Photo portrayals of three different robots (Asimo, Kojiro, Telenoid) were manipulated. The stimuli included head tilts of -20 degrees, -10 degrees (left tilt), +10 degrees, +20 degrees (right tilt) and 0 degrees (upright position). Compared to an upright head posture, we found higher scores for attributed human likeness, cuteness, and spine-tinglingness when the identical robots conveyed a head tilt. Results for perceived warmth, eeriness, attractiveness, and dominance varied with the robot or head tilts yielded no effects. Implications for the development and marketing of android and humanoid robots are discussed. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Mara, M.",0,10.1016/j.chb.2014.09.025,1320

Based on the psychological model of meaning maintenance, we expected that the uncanny valley experience could be mitigated through a fictional story, due to the meaning-generating function of narratives. A field experiment was conducted, in which 75 participants interacted with the humanlike robot Telenoid. Prior to the interaction, they either read a short story, a non-narrative leaflet about the robot, or they received no preliminary information. Eeriness ratings were significantly lower in the science fiction condition than in both other conditions. This effect was mediated by higher perceived human-likeness of the robot. Our findings suggest that science fiction may provide meaning for otherwise unsettling future technologies. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Mara, M.",0,10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.007,1321

3693,,"According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, 60% of participants of a survey said they have witnessed online abuse, and 66% of that abuse occurred via social media. This study looks at online communication, and tests if anonymity increases the amount of abuse that occurs during online communication. A quasi-experiment was developed to look for uncivil discourse using a conversational intelligent agent to create a controlled, repeatable conversational environment. The interactions with the agent occur in two settings: one in public at a kiosk, and a second in private. The researcher hypothesized that the interactions that occur in private would be more abusive than the interactions that occurred in private, due to the anonymity of the conversations. Several thousand interactions were recorded in the two scenarios, and analysis was performed on the conversational data. A custom search engine used a data set of known abuse keywords to flag each conversation as abusive or not abusive. Using this abusive conversation count, a chi-square test of independence was used to determine that the number of abusive interactions with the agent was statistically higher in the private scenario compared to the public scenario. This finding supported the researcher's hypothesis, showing that users were almost twice as likely to use abusive keywords when interacting with the agent in a private setting.","Marcello, Mark",0,,1323
3694,Do We Adopt the Intentional Stance Toward Humanoid Robots?,"In daily social interactions, we need to be able to navigate efficiently through our social environment. According to Dennett (1971), explaining and predicting others' behavior with reference to mental states (adopting the intentional stance) allows efficient social interaction. Today we also routinely interact with artificial agents: from Apple's Sin to GPS navigation systems. In the near future, we might start casually interacting with robots. This paper addresses the question of whether adopting the intentional stance can also occur with respect to artificial agents. We propose a new tool to explore if people adopt the intentional stance toward an artificial agent (humanoid robot). The tool consists in a questionnaire that probes participants' stance by requiring them to choose the likelihood of an explanation (mentalistic vs. mechanistic) of a behavior of a robot iCub depicted in a naturalistic scenario (a sequence of photographs). The results of the first study conducted with this questionnaire showed that although the explanations were somewhat biased toward the mechanistic stance, a substantial number of mentalistic explanations were also given. This suggests that it is possible to induce adoption of the intentional stance toward artificial agents, at least in some contexts.","Marchesi, S.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00450,1324

Humanoid robots are employed in different everyday-life contexts, so it seems relevant to question whether the relationships between human beings and humanoids can be characterized by a mode of interaction typical of the relationships between human beings, that is, the attribution of mental states. Because ToM development continuously undergoes changes from early childhood to late adulthood, we adopted a lifespan perspective. We analyzed contributions from the literature by organizing them around the partition between “mental states and actions” and “human-like features.” Finally, we considered how studying human–robot interaction, within a ToM context, can contribute to our understanding of the intersubjective nature of this interaction.

3717,Combining cognition and emotion in virtual agents,"Purpose - The paper aims to explain the limitations of existing cognitive architectures and affective models, and propose a new cognitive-affective architecture that can be integrated in real intelligent agents to make them more realistic and believable. Design/methodology/approach - The paper evaluates the state of the art, and describes the design and implementation of the cognitive-affective architecture in an agent. A brief evaluation of the agent is provided. Findings - The paper clearly states that it is possible to use cognitive architectures to help, but there is a lack of architectures that address the problem of combining cognition and emotion in agents in a unified, simplified way. A cognitive-affective architecture is useful to make believable intelligent agents in an easier way. Research limitations/implications - The paper does not explore a lot of possible future work that can be done to extend the emotional expressions of the agent, as well as including direct emotional-sensing capabilities in real time. Practical implications - The paper argues about the need to include cognitive-affective architectures in modern intelligent agents. The architecture allows to influence and modify the behavior of the agent in real time, to achieve a more realistic and believable interaction with the user. Social implications - The paper remarks the importance of a cognitive-affective architecture that makes intelligent agents able to help the users in different tasks and environments. Originality/value - The paper describes a new cognitive-affective architecture and its utility for modern intelligent agents. This is proven by including it in a previous agent, which boosts its behavior and emotional expression possibilities and thus improves user experience.","Marco, J. P.",0,10.1108/k-11-2016-0340,1326
3720,Animistic design: how to reimagine digital interaction between the human and the nonhuman,"This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human-machine interaction as a milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a practical-theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the human and the nonhuman. Using a research through making' approach, the article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an open-ended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital interaction, and to engender creative human-nonhuman relationships within a given digital milieu.","Marenko, B.",0,10.1080/14626268.2016.1145127,1327

3723,,"This is a dissertation about youth and the horizons of belonging in postwar France as France attempted to negotiate its position between its old African empire and the new Europe after World War II. I argue that postwar French officials approached imperial renewal in Africa and European unity as “generational projects” that enlisted youth as critical agents in the establishment of fundamentally new kinds of pluralist, democratic, and postnational polities. To overcome colonial domination in the empire and national division in Europe, French politicians, administrators and educators proposed a vast array of education reforms and youth programs in the hopes of stimulating European integration and imperial renewal from the ground up. These proposals shared a good deal in common, despite the radically different political and material situations of postwar French Africa and Western Europe; in both contexts, they focused on making curricular and pedagogical changes to primary and secondary schooling, revising history textbooks, building new institutions of higher education, and developing youth and student exchange programs to unite diverse populations. Within the world of postwar youth and education policy, French officials were in dialogue with two distinct sets of interlocutors—francophone Africans and west Europeans—about two competing political geographies and cultural imaginaries that have typically been treated independently of one another. I emphasize that these actors were actually all part of the same conversation about youth and sociopolitical transformation that was unfolding across metropolitan French, colonial African, and transnational European space. To fill out the contours of that conversation, I tack back and forth between the methodologies of political and intellectual history—I analyze similarities and tensions among specific policies and programs; I map the professional trajectories of key officials who helped shape both colonial and European youth and education initiatives; and I identify contemporary thinkers and commentators who provided a shared vocabulary and common cultural repertoire for French, African and European actors who sought to effect and control social and political change through youth and education policies in the postwar era. By bringing this constellation of people, institutional practices, and ideas into the same frame, I am able to trace how the meaning of race, religious pluralism, and the concept of Europe changed as the imperatives of late colonialism and European integration collided and converged in postwar France. Approaching United Europe and postwar empire as generational projects rather through the lenses of high politics, geostrategy and economic development recasts the nature and the stakes of their points of intersection. I argue that what was really at issue was whether or not black Africans, and black African Muslims in particular, could really be French—and if so, could then also be European? What would that mean for the identity of republican France and Europe more broadly? These were the fundamental questions with which postwar youth and education programs in metropolitan France, French Africa and Western Europe were grappling, questions that remain largely unresolved to this day. This thesis shows that the entangled initiatives to turn African subjects into French citizens and national citizenries in Europe into “Europeans” in the 1940s and 50s did not produce their desired effects. Implemented unevenly and on a small scale, they provided formative experiences for a small cohort of future French, francophone African, and west European leaders, but the majority of French people and other Europeans who came of age during this period did not develop a strong European political identity, just as most French and African youth did not forge a sense of common destiny. On the contrary, concerns about holding on to France’s African empire initially restrained French support for robust political union in Europe, and that transnational campai","Marker, Emily",0,,1329
3724,Models of Human Decision-Making as Tools for Estimating and Optimizing Impacts of Vehicle Automation,"With the development of increasingly automated vehicles (AVs) comes the increasingly difficult challenge of comprehensively validating these for acceptable, and ideally beneficial, impacts on the transport system. There is a growing consensus that virtual testing, where simulated AVs are deployed in simulated traffic, will be key for cost-effective testing and optimization. The least mature model components in such simulations are those generating the behavior of human agents in or around the AVs. In this paper, human models and virtual testing applications are presented for two example scenarios: (i) a human pedestrian deciding whether to cross a street in front of an approaching automated vehicle, with or without external human-machine interface elements, and (ii) an AV handing over control to a human driver in a critical rear-end situation. These scenarios have received much recent research attention, yet simulation-ready human behavior models are lacking. They are discussed here in the context of existing models of perceptual decision-making, situational awareness, and traffic interactions. It is argued that the human behavior in question might be usefully conceptualized as a number of interrelated decision processes, not all of which are necessarily directly associated with externally observable behavior. The results show that models based on this type of framework can reproduce qualitative patterns of behavior reported in the literature for the two addressed scenarios, and it is demonstrated how computer simulations based on the models, once these have been properly validated, could allow prediction and optimization of AV impacts on traffic flow and traffic safety.","Markkula, G.",0,10.1177/0361198118792131,1330

3735,Social communication with virtual agents: The effects of body and gaze direction on attention and emotional responding in human observers,"social communication, the gaze direction of other persons provides important information to perceive and interpret their emotional response. Previous research investigated the influence of gaze by manipulating mutual eye contact. Therefore, gaze and body direction have been changed as a whole, resulting in only congruent gaze and body directions (averted or directed) of another person. Here, we aimed to disentangle these effects by using short animated sequences of virtual agents posing with either direct or averted body or gaze. Attention allocation by means of eye movements, facial muscle response, and emotional experience to agents of different gender and facial expressions were investigated. Eye movement data revealed longer fixation durations, i.e., a stronger allocation of attention, when gaze and body direction were not congruent with each other or when both were directed towards the observer. This suggests that direct interaction as well as incongruous signals increase the demands of attentional resources in the observer. For the facial muscle response, only the reaction of muscle zygomaticus major revealed an effect of body direction, expressed by stronger activity in response to happy expressions for direct compared to averted gaze when the virtual character's body was directed towards the observer. Finally, body direction also influenced the emotional experience ratings towards happy expressions. While earlier findings suggested that mutual eye contact is the main source for increased emotional responding and attentional allocation, the present results indicate that direction of the virtual agent's body and head also plays a minor but significant role.

Here bilayer full polymeric artificial muscles were checked up to very high cathodic potential limits (-2.5 V) in aqueous solution by cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical driven exchange of ions from the conducting polymer film, and the concomitant Faradaic bending movement of the muscle, takes place in the full studied potential range. The presence of trapped counterion after deep reduction was corroborated by EDX determinations giving quite high electronic conductivity to the device. The large bending movement was used as a tool to quantify the amount of water exchanged per reaction unit (exchanged electron or ion). The potential evolutions of self-supported films of conducting polymers or conducting polymers (polypyrrole, polyaniline) coating different microfibers, during its oxidation/reduction senses working mechanical, thermal, chemical or electrical variables. The evolution of the muscle potential from electrochemical artificial muscles based on electroactive materials such as intrinsically conducting polymers and driven by constant currents senses, while working, any variation of the mechanical (trailed mass, obstacles, pressure, strain or stress), thermal or chemical conditions of work. One physically uniform artificial muscle includes one electrochemical motor and several sensors working simultaneously under the same driving reaction. Actuating (current and charge) and sensing (potential and energy) magnitudes are present, simultaneously, in the only two connecting wires and can be read by the computer at any time. From basic polymeric, mechanical and electrochemical principles a physicochemical equation describing artificial proprioception has been developed. It includes and describes, simultaneously, the evolution of the muscle potential during actuation as a function of the motor characteristics (rate and sense of the movement, relative position, and required energy) and the working variables (temperature, electrolyte concentration, mechanical conditions and driving current). By changing working conditions experimental results overlap theoretical predictions. The ensemble computer-generator-muscle-theoretical equation constitutes and describes artificial mechanical, thermal and chemical proprioception of the system.

3745,,"Making the use of an unfamiliar digital user interface (UI) easy, transparent and accessible is a challenging problem, particularly when the interaction occurs without any prior experience. Where and how the user pays attention is critical for the development of an effective human-computer interaction (HCI). The role of attention is particularly important in cases of an inexperienced user, unaccustomed to receiving valuable information for the interaction. Therefore, a recurring problem during an unfamiliar transaction is 'what to do next', where the user fails to anticipate the following step. This problem is well illustrated in the context of transactions using Self-Service Technologies, where the next step is likely to be unidentified by an inexperienced or first-time user, and accentuated by the lack of help or human assistance. This thesis applies an interdisciplinary blend of Psychological, Animation and Hel principles relating to guiding users unfamiliar with the UI to ease the digital interaction. A series of experiments address visuo-spatial mechanisms of guidance to orient and direct user attention during a search of target items inside a UI. Dynamically animated virtual agent (VA) gaze and head cues were found to guide eye gaze and button presses faster than 1-image and 2- image agent cues. When these cues were animated using the principles of animation, they introduced a substantial increase in the likeability of the agent observed but also delaying the response latency. The use of the 'exaggeration' principle of animation was shown to provide the optimal balance between response speed and preference. Following on from the experiments, the thesis develops a formal categorisation for a user who occasionally uses Uls, the Occasional User (OU), and the specific development of a new interaction style for the OU, represented by a guided-user interface, that does not require any prior experience and only a minimum knowledge of to use it. In summary, this overall analysis of guidance mechanisms and unfamiliar Hel contexts indicates that VA visual cues influence the overt allocation of user attention and that, in combination with an ad-hoc interaction style, may be used to enhance occasional digital interactions.","Martinez, Santiago",0,,1336
3746,MARL-Ped: A multi-agent reinforcement learning based framework to simulate pedestrian groups,"Pedestrian simulation is complex because there are different levels of behavior modeling. At the lowest level, local interactions between agents occur; at the middle level, strategic and tactical behaviors appear like overtakings or route choices; and at the highest level path-planning is necessary. The agent-based pedestrian simulators either focus on a specific level (mainly in the lower one) or define strategies like the layered architectures to independently manage the different behavioral levels. In our Multi-Agent Reinforcement-Learning-based Pedestrian simulation framework (MARL-Ped) the situation is addressed as a whole. Each embodied agent uses a model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to learn autonomously to navigate in the virtual environment. The main goal of this work is to demonstrate empirically that MARL-Ped generates learned behaviors adapted to the level required by the pedestrian scenario. Three different experiments, described in the pedestrian modeling literature, are presented to test our approach: (i) election of the shortest path vs. quickest path; (ii) a crossing between two groups of pedestrians walking in opposite directions inside a narrow corridor; (iii) two agents that move in opposite directions inside a maze. The results show that MARL-Ped solves the different problems, learning individual behaviors with characteristics of pedestrians (local control that produces adequate fundamental diagrams, route-choice capability, emergence of collective behaviors and path-planning). Besides, we compared our model with that of Helbing's social forces, a well-known model of pedestrians, showing similarities between the pedestrian dynamics generated by both approaches. These results demonstrate empirically that MARL-Ped generates variate plausible behaviors, producing human-like macroscopic pedestrian flow. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

3749,,The goal of this dissertation consists on the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to generate plausible simulations of pedestrians in different environments. Methodology: We have built a multi-agent framework where each virtual agent learns to control his/her velocity to navigate inside the virtual environment. Each agent learns through the interaction with the virtual environment. The virtual environment has been calibrated using human parameters. The framework allows to experiment with different RL algorithms (Q-learning and Sarsa(lambda)) and several generalization techniques (vector quantization and tile coding). The learned behaviors are analyzed using metrics common in pedestrians models such as the fundamental diagram and density maps. Conclusions of the work: It is empirically demonstrated that this approach is capable of generating plausible pedestrians behaviors. The learned behaviors are robust to the scaling in number of agents and develop abstract capabilities such as tactical decisions and planning. Moreover the learned behaviors generate emergent collective behaviors like line formations. The results are also compared with those generated by the Helbing's social forces model which is an standard inside the pedestrian simulation models.,"Martinez-Gil, Francisco A.",0,,1338
3750,Quantum stochastic walks on networks for decision-making,"Recent experiments report violations of the classical law of total probability and incompatibility of certain mental representations when humans process and react to information. Evidence shows promise of a more general quantum theory providing a better explanation of the dynamics and structure of real decision-making processes than classical probability theory. Inspired by this, we show how the behavioral choice-probabilities can arise as the unique stationary distribution of quantum stochastic walkers on the classical network defined from Luce's response probabilities. This work is relevant because (i) we provide a very general framework integrating the positive characteristics of both quantum and classical approaches previously in confrontation, and (ii) we define a cognitive network which can be used to bring other connectivist approaches to decision-making into the quantum stochastic realm. We model the decision-maker as an open system in contact with her surrounding environment, and the time-length of the decision-making process reveals to be also a measure of the process' degree of interplay between the unitary and irreversible dynamics. Implementing quantum coherence on classical networks may be a door to better integrate human-like reasoning biases in stochastic models for decision-making.","Martinez-Martinez, I.",0,10.1038/srep23812,1339
3752,Embodied Conversational Agents for the Detection and Prevention of Suicidal Behaviour: Current Applications and Open Challenges,"Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are advanced computational interactive interfaces designed with the aim to engage users in the continuous and long-term use of a background application. The advantages and benefits of these agents have been exploited in several e-health systems. One of the medical domains where ECAs are recently applied is to support the detection of symptoms, prevention and treatment of mental health disorders. As ECAs based applications are increasingly used in clinical psychology, and due that one fatal consequence of mental health problems is the commitment of suicide, it is necessary to analyse how current ECAs in this clinical domain support the early detection and prevention of risk situations associated with suicidality. The present work provides and overview of the main features implemented in the ECAs to detect and prevent suicidal behaviours through two scenarios: ECAs acting as virtual counsellors to offer immediate help to individuals in risk; and ECAs acting as virtual patients for learning/training in the identification of suicide behaviours. A literature review was performed to identify relevant studies in this domain during the last decade, describing the main characteristics of the implemented ECAs and how they have been evaluated. A total of six studies were included in the review fulfilling the defined search criteria. Most of the experimental studies indicate promising results, though these types of ECAs are not yet commonly used in routine practice. The identification of some open challenges for the further development of ECAs within this domain is also discussed.","Martinez-Miranda, J.",0,10.1007/s10916-017-0784-6,1340

The work presented in this paper describes the development of an embodied conversational agent used as the main interface in HelPath, a mobile-based application addressed to individuals detected with any of the suicidal behaviours: ideation, planning or attempt. The main objective of HelPath is to continuously collect user's information that, complemented with data from the electronic health record, supports the identification of risks associated with suicidality. Through the virtual agent, the users also receive information and suggestions based on cognitive behaviour therapy that would help them to maintain a healthy condition. The paper also presents the execution of an exploratory pilot to assess the acceptability, perception and adherence of users towards the virtual agent. The obtained results are presented and discussed, and some actions for further improvement of the embodied conversational agent are also identified.","Martinez-Miranda, J.",0,10.1007/s10916-019-1387-1,1341
3761,Modeling the influence of trust on work team performance,"The selection of suitable people to make up a successful work team is not a trivial decision-making process, because of the diversity and complexity of the factors that influence individual and team performance. Teams are assembled by project managers using their experience and the information they have available (although this is frequently scarce, uncertain, and dynamic) about the personal and professional characteristics of potential team members. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based model developed to support this decision-making process where a virtual team can be configured using some selected characteristics of potential team members. Fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules are used to model the interaction between team members and a given set of tasks, generating statistical information that represents possible performance by team members. More specifically, the paper focuses on the concept of trust, an important social skill that influences performance at individual (team member) and global (work team) levels. We describe the implementation of an agent-based simulation system where the user can test different team configurations to compare performance and select the best possible work team for a given project. The evaluation and validation of the model was performed through face validity and historical data validation techniques, which are based on information collected from real work teams.

However, it is currently unclear what physical features non-human agents need to possess in order to trigger mind attribution and whether different aspects of having a mind (e.g., feeling pain, being able to move) need different levels of human-likeness before they are readily ascribed to non-human agents. The current study addresses this issue by modeling how increasing the degree of human-like appearance (on a spectrum from mechanistic to humanoid to human) changes the likelihood by which mind is attributed towards non-human agents. We also test whether different internal states (e.g., being hungry, being alive) need different degrees of humanness before they are ascribed to non-human agents. The results suggest that the relationship between physical appearance and the degree to which mind is attributed to non-human agents is best described as a two-linear model with no change in mind attribution on the spectrum from mechanistic to humanoid robot, but a significant increase in mind attribution as soon as human features are included in the image. There seems to be a qualitative difference in the perception of mindful versus mindless agents given that increasing human-like appearance alone does not increase mind attribution until a certain threshold is reached, that is: agents need to be classified as having a mind first before the addition of more human-like features significantly increases the degree to which mind is attributed to that agent.","Martini, M.

3766,,"In most Intelligent Tutoring Systems, the help messages (hints) are not very clear for students as they are only presented textually and have little connection with the task elements. This can lead to students’ undesired behaviors, like gaming the system, associated with low performance. In this paper, the authors aim at evaluating if the gestures of an animated pedagogical agent to explain hints related to equation solving improves the students’ understanding of these help messages. With this goal, they developed an animated pedagogical agent that uses gestures coupled with messages to explain hints in an algebra tutor. The authors performed a qualitative pilot study with four students to verify the impact of using gestures by the animated pedagogical agent on the comprehension of the hints, using two different versions of the system. The difference between these versions was the availability of gestures by the agent. The results showed that students understood the hints provided by the agent more correctly when they were coupled with agent’s gesture. Furthermore, they also preferred using the tutor version with gestures.

3770,Dependency Parsing of Modern Standard Arabic with Lexical and Inflectional Features,"We explore the contribution of lexical and inflectional morphology features to dependency parsing of Arabic, a morphologically rich language with complex agreement patterns. Using controlled experiments, we contrast the contribution of different part-of-speech (POS) tag sets and morphological features in two input conditions: machine-predicted condition (in which POS tags and morphological feature values are automatically assigned), and gold condition (in which their true values are known). We find that more informative (fine-grained) tag sets are useful in the gold condition, but may be detrimental in the predicted condition, where they are outperformed by simpler but more accurately predicted tag sets. We identify a set of features (definiteness, person, number, gender, and undiacritized lemma) that improve parsing quality in the predicted condition, whereas other features are more useful in gold. We are the first to show that functional features for gender and number (e. g., ""broken plurals""), and optionally the related rationality (""humanness"") feature, are more helpful for parsing than form-based gender and number. We finally show that parsing quality in the predicted condition can dramatically improve by training in a combined gold+predicted condition. We experimented with two transition-based parsers, MaltParser and Easy-First Parser. Our findings are robust across parsers, models, and input conditions. This suggests that the contribution of the linguistic knowledge in the tag sets and features we identified goes beyond particular experimental settings, and may be informative for other parsers and morphologically rich languages.","Marton, Y.",0,10.1162/COLI_a_00138,1345

My research demonstrates how solidarity can be modified when encountering difference, and how it might be better conceptualized as ""fluidarity,"" an attitude and practice that embraces the complexity of engaging the other in pluralized and ever-changing struggles. This engagement with otherness, an explicit part of an undergraduate theological ethics course with an embedded service-learning component, is pedagogically facilitated by a threefold reflection process required of students: critical reflection on their own narratives, reflection on the narratives encountered in their service-learning, and reflection on the lives of spiritually grounded agents of social change. Case studies of four undergraduate students demonstrate the ways in which this pedagogical strategy contributes to the development of solidarity and moves students' understanding towards fluidarity. In the end, the students gained a sense of spiritually grounded change agency, combining spiritual development with growth in critical consciousness.

3774,Modeling culture in intelligent virtual agents,"This work addresses the challenge of creating virtual agents that are able to portray culturally appropriate behavior when interacting with other agents or humans. Because culture influences how people perceive their social reality it is important to have agent models that explicitly consider social elements, such as existing relational factors. We addressed this necessity by integrating culture into a novel model for simulating human social behavior. With this model, we operationalized a particular dimension of culture-individualism versus collectivism-within the context of an interactive narrative scenario that is part of an agent-based tool for intercultural training. Using this scenario we conducted a cross-cultural study in which participants from a collectivistic country (Portugal) were compared with participants from an individualistic country (the Netherlands) in the way they perceived and interacted with agents whose behavior was either individualistic or collectivistic, according to the configuration of the proposed model. In the obtained results, Portuguese subjects rated the collectivistic agents more positively than the Dutch but both countries had a similarly positive opinion about the individualistic agents. This experiment sheds new light on how people from different countries differ when assessing the social appropriateness of virtual agents, while also raising new research questions on this matter.","Mascarenhas, S.",0,10.1007/s10458-015-9312-6,1347
3781,Representation of stable social dominance relations by human infants,"What are the origins of humans' capacity to represent social relations? We approached this question by studying human infants' understanding of social dominance as a stable relation. We presented infants with interactions between animated agents in conflict situations. Studies 1 and 2 targeted expectations of stability of social dominance. They revealed that 15-mo-olds (and, to a lesser extent, 12-mo-olds) expect an asymmetric relationship between two agents to remain stable from one conflict to another. To do so, infants need to infer that one of the agents (the dominant) will consistently prevail when her goals conflict with those of the other (the subordinate). Study 3 and 4 targeted the format of infants' representation of social dominance. In these studies, we found that 12- and 15-mo-olds did not extend their expectations of dominance to unobserved relationships, even when they could have been established by transitive inference. These results suggest that infants' expectation of stability originates from their representation of social dominance as a relationship between two agents rather than as an individual property. Infants' demonstrated understanding of social dominance reflects the cognitive underpinning of humans' capacity to represent social relations, which may be evolutionarily ancient, and may be shared with nonhuman species.","Mascaro, O.",0,10.1073/pnas.1113194109,1348
3783,Identifying and Modeling Dynamic Preference Evolution in Multipurpose Water Resources Systems,"Multipurpose water systems are usually operated on a tradeoff of conflicting operating objectives. Under steady state climatic and socioeconomic conditions, such tradeoff is supposed to represent a fair and/or efficient preference. Extreme variability in external forcing might affect water operators' risk aversion and force a change in her/his preference. Properly accounting for these shifts is key to any rigorous retrospective assessment of the operator's behaviors, and to build descriptive models for projecting the future system evolution. In this study, we explore how the selection of different preferences is linked to variations in the external forcing. We argue that preference selection evolves according to recent, extreme variations in system performance: underperforming in one of the objectives pushes the preference toward the harmed objective. To test this assumption, we developed a rational procedure to simulate the operator's preference selection. We map this selection onto a multilateral negotiation, where multiple virtual agents independently optimize different objectives. The agents periodically negotiate a compromise policy for the operation of the system. Agents' attitudes in each negotiation step are determined by the recent system performance measured by the specific objective they maximize. We then propose a numerical model of preference dynamics that implements a concept from cognitive psychology, the availability bias. We test our modeling framework on a synthetic lake operated for flood control and water supply. Results show that our model successfully captures the operator's preference selection and dynamic evolution driven by extreme wet and dry situations.","Mason, E.",0,10.1002/2017wr021431,1349

They are becoming increasingly self-directed and corporal in ways that may one day make it difficult to call the communication ours versus theirs. This, in turn, invites questions about whether the First Amendment ever will (or ever should) cover AI speech or speakers even absent a locatable and accountable human creator. In this Article, we explain why current free speech theory and doctrine pose surprisingly few barriers to this counterintuitive result; their elasticity suggests that speaker humanness no longer may be a logically essential part of the First Amendment calculus. We further observe, however, that free speech theory and doctrine provide a basis for regulating, as well as protecting, the speech of nonhuman speakers to serve the interests of their human listeners should strong AI ever evolve to this point. Finally, we note that the futurist implications we describe are possible, but not inevitable. Moreover, contemplating these outcomes for AI speech may inspire rethinking of the free speech theory and doctrine that make them plausible.","Massaro, T. M.",0,,1350
3789,Clients as conversational agents,"Objective: Conversational agency is our invented term that orients us to ways in which clients participate in therapeutic dialogues. In this study we examined how clients' conversational correctives and initiatives influenced collaborative therapeutic consultations. Methods: Thirty-five single-session lifestyle consultations were videotaped in which adult clients volunteered to discuss concerns of non-clinical severity with a counselor. We discursively microanalyzed excerpts where clients initiated topic shifts or corrected counselor misunderstandings and how counselors responded to them. Results: Clients were actively involved in co-managing conversational developments during the consultations. They influenced the content and course of the conversations with the counselors by correcting, interrupting, or speaking from positions contrary or unrelated to those of the counselors. Conclusion: Clients observably influenced the conversational agenda through their correctives and. initiatives if counselors were responsive during face-to-face consultations. Practice implications: Clinicians should demonstrate increased sensitivity and relational responsivity by intentionally engaging with clients' agentive contributions to consultative dialogues.

This novel inverse approach is useful both to crowd simulation in virtual environments and to urban crowd planning applications. Our approach tightly integrates and extends a space discretization crowd simulator with inverse procedural modelling. We extend crowd simulation by goal exploration (i.e. agents are initially unaware of the goal locations), variable-appealing sign usage and several acceleration schemes. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo to quickly explore the solution space and yield interactive design. We have applied our method to a variety of virtual and real-world locations, yielding one order of magnitude faster crowd simulation performance over related methods and several fold improvement of crowd indicators.","Mathew, C.

3800,,"The concept of standards-based curriculum in American public schools has been a focal point since the publication of the 1893 report by the ""Committee of Ten,"" a working group of educational experts formed by the National Educational Association (Ripley, 2013). The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 required all states to develop curriculum standards for schools. The standards created across states were substantially different due to variations in approaches and procedures (Ginsburg, Leinwand, Anstrom & Pollock, 2005). The Common Core State Standards educational reform represents the latest concrete efforts to modify the content of American school education. The Common Core State Standards is not a curriculum; teachers and school systems will continue to play a major role in developing curriculum using these standards as guiding principles (Common Core State Standards Initiative [CSSI], 2010). Teachers' awareness of curriculum standards, their beliefs about curriculum theories and their level of preparedness to implement these standards are important aspects that determine the success of the reform initiative (Handal & Herrington, 2003). This study tried to answer the main research question: How do mathematics teachers' beliefs about curriculum impact their perceived preparedness to implement the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM)? Teachers make curricular decisions based on their content and pedagogical knowledge, largely shaped by their beliefs on curriculum (Tobin & Dawson, 1992). Any curriculum reform becomes complex and difficult when the change agent is external, the approach is top-down and the principles behind the change is inconsistent with beliefs of teachers (Prevedel, 2003). The first objective of the study was to identify the preferred curriculum ideology of teachers among four fundamental ideologies of Scholar Academic, Learner Centered, Social Reconstruction and Social Efficiency. The second objective was to determine the perceived preparedness of mathematics teachers to implement the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. The final objective was to explore the impact of teachers' beliefs about curriculum on their readiness to implement the CCSSM. The literature review revealed that beliefs have a motivational component and have the potential to drive human behavior (Alexander, Murphy, Guan & Murphy, 1998). Analysis of past educational reforms suggested that teachers' beliefs have real impacts on the teaching-learning process and teachers' beliefs about curriculum and its influence was crucial in educational reforms (Richards, Gallo & Renandya, 2001). Structured interviews and the online survey methods were used to collect data for this one-shot study design. While the Curriculum Ideologies Inventory (Schiro, 2012) found out participants' preferred curriculum ideologies, the CCSSM Preparedness Questionnaire determined the perceived preparedness of mathematics educators. The one-way ANOVA and the Turkey's HSD tests were the parametric inferential statistics used for data analysis. Inventory results revealed that Learner Centered ideology was the most preferred curriculum ideology among the four ideologies. Social Efficiency was the second preferred curriculum ideology. Scholar Academic and Social Reconstruction curriculum ideologies placed third and fourth. Information from the questionnaire showed that teachers who preferred Learner Centered curriculum ideology scored higher on their perceived preparedness compared to mean scores of participants from other ideologies. Data analysis indicated that teachers' approaches to curriculum ideologies do have an effect on their perceived preparedness to implement the CCSSM. Findings from the study underlined the idea that it is important to consider teachers' beliefs about curriculum principles for effective implementation of curricular reform initiatives.

3801,Navigating a social world with robot partners: A quantitative cartography of the Uncanny Valley,"Android robots are entering human social life. However, human-robot interactions may be complicated by a hypothetical Uncanny Valley (UV) in which imperfect human-likeness provokes dislike. Previous investigations using unnaturally blended images reported inconsistent UV effects. We demonstrate an UV in subjects' explicit ratings of likability for a large, objectively chosen sample of 80 real-world robot faces and a complementary controlled set of edited faces. An ""investment game"" showed that the UV penetrated even more deeply to influence subjects' implicit decisions concerning robots' social trustworthiness, and that these fundamental social decisions depend on subtle cues of facial expression that are also used to judge humans. Preliminary evidence suggests category confusion may occur in the UV but does not mediate the likability effect. These findings suggest that while classic elements of human social psychology govern human-robot social interaction, robust UV effects pose a formidable android-specific problem.

In the context of psychological studies, androids are expected to be used in the future as fully controllable human stimuli to investigate human nature. In this study, we used an android to examine infant discrimination ability between human beings and non-human agents. Participants (N = 42 infants) were assigned to three groups based on their age, i.e., 6- to 8-month-olds, 9- to 11-month-olds, and 12- to 14-month-olds, and took part in a preferential looking paradigm. Of three types of agents involved in the paradigm a human, an android modeled on the human, and a mechanical-looking robot made from the android two at a time were presented side-by-side as they performed a grasping action. Infants' looking behavior was measured using an eye tracking system, and the amount of time spent focusing on each of three areas of interest (face, goal, and body) was analyzed. Results showed that all age groups predominantly looked at the robot and at the face area, and that infants aged over 9 months watched the goal area for longer than the body area. There was no difference in looking times and areas focused on between the human and the android. These findings suggest that 6- to 14-month-olds are unable to discriminate between the human and the android, although they can distinguish the mechanical robot from the human.","Matsuda, G.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01397,1357
3809,Infants prefer the faces of strangers or mothers to morphed faces: an uncanny valley between social novelty and familiarity,"The 'uncanny valley' response is a phenomenon involving the elicitation of a negative feeling and subsequent avoidant behaviour in human adults and infants as a result of viewing very realistic human-like robots or computer avatars. It is hypothesized that this uncanny feeling occurs because the realistic synthetic characters elicit the concept of 'human' but fail to satisfy it. Such violations of our normal expectations regarding social signals generate a feeling of unease. This conflictinduced uncanny valley between mutually exclusive categories (human and synthetic agent) raises a new question: could an uncanny feeling be elicited by other mutually exclusive categories, such as familiarity and novelty? Given that infants prefer both familiarity and novelty in social objects, we address this question as well as the associated developmental profile. Using the morphing technique and a preferential-looking paradigm, we demonstrated uncanny valley responses of infants to faces of mothers (i.e. familiarity) and strangers (i.e. novelty). Furthermore, this effect strengthened with the infant's age. We excluded the possibility that infants detect and avoid traces of morphing. This conclusion follows from our finding that the infants equally preferred strangers' faces and the morphed faces of two strangers. These results indicate that an uncanny valley between familiarity and novelty may accentuate the categorical perception of familiar and novel objects.","Matsuda, Y. T.",0,10.1098/rsbl.2012.0346,1358

3819,Fighting the game. Command systems and player-avatar interaction in fighting games in a social cognitive neuroscience framework,"Videogames often require players to control an avatar in order to act on the virtual world. In many cases, such as in fighting games, the avatar's body often shares biological features with the player's body, such as a human-like figure and a highly detailed and realistic movement. Many studies in social cognitive neuroscience focus on how humans understand biological actions, and in particular other humans' actions. Models and theories that put in tight relation perception, imagination and execution of actions have recently impacted the field of human cognition and provided a considerable paradigm shift. However, the impact of these theories has been largely focused on modern mimetic interfaces, such as virtual reality, but only slightly affect traditional interfaces even if they still comprise the large majority of the human-computer interaction. Fighting games mostly use non-mimetic interfaces, such as traditional gaming pads, so that the player needs to act with a very restricted range of movements, limited to fingers, hand, wrists and arms muscles. While the player's movements don't match the avatar movements, the in-game meanings of the button presses, i.e., command system, may facilitate or interfere with the ability to understand, plan and perform motor patterns on the input device. Here I provide a framework to better understand human-fighting game interaction, but relevant for all interactions with avatars, as well as experimental evidence of this approach validity by using the most successful fighting games: Tekken, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Soulcalibur.","Mattiassi, A.

To help address this question, students were asked to twice view a 4-min narrated presentation on how solar cells work in which the screen showed an animated pedagogical agent standing to the left of 11 successive slides. Across three experiments, learners performed better on a transfer test when a human-voiced agent displayed human-like gestures, facial expression, eye gaze, and body movement than when the agent did not, yielding an embodiment effect. In Experiment 2 the embodiment effect was found when the agent spoke in a human voice but not in a machine voice. In Experiment 3, the embodiment effect was found both when students were told the onscreen agent was consistent with their choice of agent characteristics and when inconsistent Students who viewed a highly embodied agent also rated the social attributes of the agent more positively than did students who viewed a nongesturing agent. The results are explained by social agency theory, in which social cues in a multimedia message prime a feeling of social partnership in the learner, which leads to deeper cognitive processing during learning, and results in a more meaningful learning outcome as reflected in transfer test performance.","Mayer, R.

3823,Critical multi-level governance issues of integrated modelling: An example of low-water management in the Adour-Garonne basin (France),"This paper presents the experience gained related to the development of an integrated simulation model of water policy. Within this context, we analyze particular difficulties raised by the inclusion of multilevel governance that assigns the responsibility of individual or collective decision-making to a variety of actors, regarding measures of which the implementation has significant effects toward the sustainability of socio-hydrosystems. Multi-level governance procedures are compared with the potential of model-based impact assessment. Our discussion is illustrated on the basis of the exploitation of the multi-agent platform MAELIA dedicated to the simulation of social, economic and environmental impacts of low-water management in a context of climate and regulatory changes. We focus on three major decisionmaking processes occurring in the Adour-Garonne basin, France: (i) the participatory development of the Master Scheme for Water Planning and Management (SDAGE) under the auspices of the Water Agency; (ii) the publication of water use restrictions in situations of water scarcity; and (iii) the determination of the abstraction volumes for irrigation and their allocation. The MAELIA platform explicitly takes into account the mode of decision-making when it is framed by a procedure set beforehand, focusing on the actors' participation and on the nature and parameters of the measures to be implemented. It is observed that in some water organizations decision-making follows patterns that can be represented as rule-based actions triggered by thresholds of resource states. When decisions are resulting from individual choice, endowing virtual agents with bounded rationality allows us to reproduce (in silico) their behavior and decisions in a reliable way. However, the negotiation processes taking place during the period of time simulated by the models in arenas of collective choices are not all reproducible. Outcomes of some collective decisions are very little or not at all predictable. The development and simulation of a priori policy scenarios capturing the most plausible or interesting outcomes of such collective decisions on measures for low-water management allows these difficulties to be overcome. The building of these kind of scenarios requires close collaboration between researchers and stakeholders involved in arenas of collective choice, and implies the integration of the production of model and the analysis of scenarios as one component of the polycentric political process of water management.

3830,,"The use of robotics in neurosurgery and, particularly, in stereotactic neurosurgery, is becoming more and more adopted because of the great advantages that it offers. Robotic manipulators easily allow to achieve great precision, reliability, and rapidity in the positioning of surgical instruments or devices in the brain. The aim of this work was to experimentally verify a fully automatic “no hands” surgical procedure. The integration of neuroimaging to data for planning the surgery, followed by application of new specific surgical tools, permitted the realization of a fully automated robotic implantation of leads in brain targets. An anthropomorphic commercial manipulator was utilized. In a preliminary phase, a software to plan surgery was developed, and the surgical tools were tested first during a simulation and then on a skull mock-up. In such a way, several tools were developed and tested, and the basis for an innovative surgical procedure arose. The final experimentation was carried out on anesthetized “large white” pigs. The determination of stereotactic parameters for the correct planning to reach the intended target was performed with the same technique currently employed in human stereotactic neurosurgery, and the robotic system revealed to be reliable and precise in reaching the target. The results of this work strengthen the possibility that a neurosurgeon may be substituted by a machine, and may represent the beginning of a new approach in the current clinical practice. Moreover, this possibility may have a great impact not only on stereotactic functional procedures but also on the entire domain of neurosurgery.

We use these worlds to examine the effects of affective context on unconstrained gaze and movement. In the Affect Gallery, participants freely explored a virtual art museum filled with objects that varied in valence and arousal. Participants approached and gazed more at positively valenced objects. This preference was amplified by more arousing objects and was strongest among individuals with resilient emotion regulation tendencies. This bias of avoiding negative valence did not emerge in The Crowded Room, an environment in which participants encountered virtual humans expressing different emotions. Instead, participants gazed more at negative than neutral emotional displays although they physically avoided angry (but not sad or neutral) agents. When placed inside Room 101, an unpredictable environment filled with a series of disturbing events, frightened participants became relatively immobile in terms of both gaze and movement. This freezing-type response was particularly strong among dispositionally resilient individuals. Together these results demonstrate that distinct affective contexts elicit unique patterns in unconstrained gaze and movement.

Conversational agents have been employed in various domains including intelligent tutoring systems, health care systems, simulation applications, digital personal assistants and user help systems. Despite the recent increase of applications using conversational agents the implementation of these systems still poses challenges for developers. This is because natural language is imprecise, full of innuendos, idiosyncrasies, idioms and ambiguity. Due to the ?uid nature of language, it is challenging for a human to de?ne a single set of rules for the machine to use in understanding language. Another challenge is that the set of rules that work for one domain might not work for another domain-thus, the need di?erent rules for di?erent domains. Moreover, if a conversation agent is not able to understand language of the domain then the conversational agent will return irrelevant responses based on the user’s input. This will lead to the user becoming frustrated and the conversation being ended. This dissertation focuses on the problem of returning appropriate responses by learning a set of relevant rules to apply when understanding language from that domain. To solve this problem I have designed and implemented the conversational agent language model optimization algorithm (CALMO). CALMO is a response retrieval technique for returning appropriate responses for script-based conversational agents. The algorithm consists of an optimization technique that evolves a subset of random rules towards a set of rules that are more relevant to the language used in the domain; therefore, improving the conversational agent ability to return appropriate responses. The results from this dissertation show that over multiple iterations of the optimization process the CALMO algorithm was able to ?lter out irrelevant rules and converge on a set of rules that increased the number of appropriate responses returned. After optimization the rules that were found to be relevant were tested on unseen data and the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 72.6%","McClendon, Jerome Lee",0,,1367
3844,,"The appearance of an onscreen pedagogical agent can be found in many computer-based learning environments. Although visible characteristics of the pedagogical agent have been previously examined, there is limited exploration of the impact the visual fidelity of the agent has on self-efficacy. The current study examined the relationship between learner perceived self-efficacy in the use of presentation software (PSE) in the presence of a live-action video pedagogical agent and a computer-generated pedagogical agent of lesser visual fidelity. Fifty-seven public school teachers experienced learning through a sequence of two tutorials designed to increase user skill in the use of basic features and advanced animation capabilities of Microsoft PowerPoint 2007. In one tutorial, participants interacted with a live-action video image of an onscreen agent. Participants experienced the alternate tutorial by interacting with a similar onscreen agent of lesser visual clarity. Modification of the image was accomplished through a process of digital rotoscoping to produce a less detailed, cartoon representation of the original agent. Results of the repeated measures ANOVA failed to reveal a significant sequence effect on PSE. No further investigation of the impact on PSE resulting from visual fidelity was warranted, however exploratory investigation revealed the presence of a sequence effect on PSE for participants identified as beginner level users of PowerPoint. Implications for theory, future study, and practice are included.","McCloud, Alan M.",0,,1368
3845,Recognizing Emotional Body Language Displayed by a Human-like Social Robot,"Natural social human-robot interactions (HRIs) require that robots have the ability to perceive and identify complex human social behaviors and, in turn, be able to also display their own behaviors using similar communication modes. Recently, it has been found that body language plays an important role in conveying information about changes in human emotions during human-human interactions. Our work focuses on extending this concept to robotic affective communication during social HRI. Namely, in this paper, we explore the design of emotional body language for our human-like social robot, Brian 2.0. We develop emotional body language for the robot using a variety of body postures and movements identified in human emotion research. To date, only a handful of researchers have focused on the use of robotic body language to display emotions, with a significant emphasis being on the display of emotions through dance. Such emotional dance can be effective for small robots with large workspaces, however, it is not as appropriate for life-sized robots such as Brian 2.0 engaging in one-on-one interpersonal social interactions with a person. Experiments are presented to evaluate the feasibility of the robot's emotional body language based on human recognition rates. Furthermore, a unique comparison study is presented to investigate the perception of human body language features displayed by the robot with respect to the same body language features displayed by a human actor.","McColl, D.",0,10.1007/s12369-013-0226-7,1369
3847,,"Cloud computing provides a highly scalable, distributed infrastructure on which applications and data can be hosted. Hosted applications must perform within specified constraints, despite running over an extremely dynamic infrastructure. This dynamic behaviour is created, on one hand, by the applications running within virtual machines hosted on heterogeneous servers, and on the other by the constantly fluctuating demand on the network link between the virtual machine and the user of the application. This elasticity of infrastructure, and fluctuating demand placed on it, makes it difficult to ensure QoS for the application. It is no longer sufficient to measure the performance of various host servers within a data centre - it is also now required to measure the performance of the application where it is most critical with the user of the application. The efficiency of application hosting is also difficult to ensure. Optimisation of resource allocation should minimise the hosting cost while ensuring the delivery of the application to the end-user is acceptable. This thesis details a programme of research aimed at designing, implementing and using a distributed, highly-scalable system for monitoring and ensuring end-to-end, SLA-compliant performance of virtual private cloud applications, while minimising the overall hosting cost for the cloud. The research undertaken and described within this document reviews cloud computing, the underlying virtualisation technologies and optimisation techniques, and presents three models with completed prototypes. The first model is a cloud resource monitoring methodology, which acquires real- time metrics from live applications and hosts running in a virtual private cloud test- bed environment. This model is an adaptation of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), aimed at providing a SLA-compliant scoring mechanism for all criteria to be considered when measuring application performance. The model presented finally allows an overall score to be calculated by which the application's performance is assessed at any potential host where it may be placed. The second model is a cloud-centric network monitoring methodology, which analyses the quality of the network link between any two I.P. addresses. This system provides network quality information to be used in the assessment of the application's (potential) performance between any given host location and the end-user. The third model is an optimiser for SLA-compliant virtual machine placement within virtual private clouds, where the hosting cost is minimised. In summary, the key outputs of this thesis are: 1) a prototype vendor-agnostic monitoring system, for virtual private clouds, which provides the ability to acquire any metric, relevant to the successful delivery of an application to the end-user, and provide information regarding real-time SLA-compliance based on performance thresholds set for those metrics 2) a live system for projecting SLA-compliant application performance on any given host 3) a hierarchical framework for dynamically defining application SLAs, with any conceivable, acquirable metric 4) an optimisation engine with the goal of optimally placing applications on host servers with the goal of reducing the hosting cost across all host servers. The hosting costs for each application on each server is provided by the monitoring system 5) a software-based, virtualised tool for automatic monitoring of network performance, with a remote data logging component 6) An agent-based system for automatically and periodically acquiring VM and host metrics from a VMWare virtual private cloud. The thesis presents an overall fully-functional system incorporating all these aspects.","McConnell, Aaron",0,,1370
3848,,"Several studies have observed the effect of using personalized narration in the presentation of material in a multimedia environment. While the presence of an agent (multimedia picture) speaking the personalized narration has led to mixed results, the personalized narration by itself has been shown to offload audio cognitive processes and enhance deeper learning and transfer. The dual channel assumption states that we process information both audibly and visually. The present study examined the effects of personalization without an agent, and it addressed the effects of a personalized text. It separately tested the effects of this personalized text on the two unique channels of processing; auditory (listening) and visual (reading). It was the purpose of this study to investigate in a controlled language learning environment whether the personalization of audio texts and visual texts could improve a listener's or viewer's understanding of a text and facilitate a transfer of that understanding to solving novel problems. Participants either listened to or read three various scientific texts. This study measured the learning differences after reading or listening to an original text and a personalized text. As predicted, the personalized texts offloaded auditory and visual input as revealed in the testing of recall as revealed through transfer test scores, but not significantly. Participants who were exposed to the personalized medium were not afforded any processing advantage. Transfer was measured by the participant's ability to apply his knowledge in solving novel problems. Recognition test scores revealed a significant result, but in the opposite direction that was predicted.","McDaniel, Stephen D.",0,,1371
3849,Technology leadership or technology somnambulism? Exploring the discourse of integration amongst information and communication technology coordinators,"This research aimed to explore information and communication technology (ICT) coordinators' discourse in relation to ICT integration in a sample of Irish post-primary schools. As ICT leaders in their schools, how they conceptualise ICT significantly influences school-based policy and use. The research involved semi-structured interviews with a sample of nine ICT coordinators in the Mid-west region of Ireland. The study found that the coordinators drew heavily on the prevailing policy discourse when justifying the use of ICT in schools. However, they tended to see the evolution of ICT as something beyond their control and perceived 'progress' only in relation to hardware acquisition. The findings suggest that the shift from 'electronic janitor' to pedagogical leader is in its infancy in Irish schools. Policy-makers may need to take greater cognisance of the importance of pedagogical leadership within a context dominated by a focus on acquiring hardware and resources. At a broader level, educators need to define their collective vision for ICT, rather than placing sole responsibility on a single agent of change.","McDonagh, A.",0,10.1080/03323315.2015.1010292,1372
3851,Render me Real? Investigating the Effect of Render Style on the Perception of Animated Virtual Humans,"The realistic depiction of lifelike virtual humans has been the goal of many movie makers in the last decade. Recently, films such as Tron: Legacy and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have produced highly realistic characters. In the real-time domain, there is also a need to deliver realistic virtual characters, with the increase in popularity of interactive drama video games (such as L. A. Noire (TM) or Heavy Rain (TM)). There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing. Some developers opt for a stylized rendering (such as cartoon-shading) to avoid a negative reaction [Thompson 2004]. In this paper, we investigate some of the consequences of choosing realistic or stylized rendering in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating appealing virtual characters. We conducted a series of psychophysical experiments to determine whether render style affects how virtual humans are perceived. Motion capture with synchronized eye-tracked data was used throughout to animate custom-made virtual model replicas of the captured actors.","McDonnell, R.",0,10.1145/2185520.2185587,1373
3854,,"Chapter 1: This introductory chapter provides a general overview of the immune system followed by a more in depth look into the field of synthetic immunology. This field concerns the use of synthetic constructs to modulate, activate or suppress the immune system, with a focus on molecules capable of activating and retargeting immunological responses. Antibody recruiting molecules (ARMs) - bifunctional small molecules capable of redirecting responses to viruses and cancer - form one class of synthetic immunology constructs and have been a special focus of the Spiegel Lab. Chapter 2: Here we show the design and evaluation of a novel class of synthetic molecules which perform the same functions as antibodies. These compounds, called synthetic antibody mimics targeting prostate cancer (SyAM-Ps), bind simultaneously to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and Fe gamma receptor 1 (FcγRI), thus eliciting highly selective cancer cell destruction. We have designed and developed three successive generations of SyAMs and have shown the importance of affinity and multivalency in eliciting a targeted response against prostate cancer cells. SyAMs have the potential to combine the advantages of both small-molecule and biologic therapies, and address many drawbacks associated with available treatments for cancer and other diseases. Chapter 3: With the successful development of our first generation of SyAMs we sought to better understand the binding of the peptide to FcγRI in order to rationally design a new generation of molecules. This cyclic peptide, CP33, had been discovered through phage display, and formed the immune activating portion of our SyAM-P. Thus we designed a series of deletion and alanine mutants to investigate the effect of these changes on binding and effector response and generated a binding model, which could be used for future modifications. In parallel we investigated high-throughput screening techniques, including fluorescence polarization (FP), ALPHA-screen and small molecule microarrays (SMMs), for the discovery of new small molecules capable of binding to members of the Fe family of receptors and eliciting effector responses. Chapter 4: We sought to utilize virtual screening to discover and develop new antiinflammatory agents by inhibiting the interaction of IgG with FcγRIIa. This interaction plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and molecules capable of disrupting binding have potential for new therapeutic treatments. We utilized the crystal structure of FcγRIIa to virtually screen 2.1 million compounds, leading to the discovery of two compounds capable of inhibiting both the binding of ligands to FcγRIIa and a subsequent immunological response, namely TNF-α release. Next-generation molecules have been developed from these original hits that more fully explore structure-activity relationships with the goal of developing more potent inhibitors. Chapter 5: We developed a new antibody-recruiting molecule capable of targeting metastic cancers expressing the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and uPAR are overexpressed on the surfaces of a wide range of invasive cancer cells and are believed to contribute substantially to the migratory propensities of these cells. We look advantage of the high affinity (200 pM) of uPA to uPAR to develop a bifunctional uPA construct displaying an antibody-recruiting motif (ARM-U). This bifunctional construct takes advantage of the serine protease activity of uPA to covalently modify, and inactivate uPA. We show that ARM-U is capable of recruiting antibodies to cancer cells expressing uPAR and eliciting both antibody dependent phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC).","McEnaney, Patrick James",0,,1374
3856,Agency Effects in Human-Computer Interaction,"The studies presented in this article explore a human-centered conceptualization of agents and agency based on the observation that people attribute agency to sufficiently complex interactive systems. Although agency attribution appears to be an unconscious human response, findings from social psychology, affective computing, and perceptual-motor studies suggest agency attribution influences human-computer interaction (HCI). Three studies are presented that examine whether recent findings on agency attribution in physical environments also apply in the virtual environments characteristic of HCI. Results of the studies indicate that agency effects operate in desktop computing environments. Agency effects, however, appear to be influenced by learning effects that preserve a previously observed relationship between perception and action but alter how this effect is expressed. Results suggest that there are both bottom-up and top-down contributions to agency effects in HCI.","McEneaney, J. E.",0,10.1080/10447318.2013.777826,1375
3857,,"This dissertation defends autonomy as a conception of political freedom appropriate to the practice of democratic citizenship. The dissertation argues that autonomy consists in a certain sort of relation to others—that independence consists in a certain sort of dependence. To specify the form of dependence that autonomy requires, the dissertation argues that autonomy requires responsiveness, an ongoing practical acknowledgment of others’ interpretive authority, and situatedness, an ongoing practical acknowledgment of our relation to structures of meaning and power that lend significance to our acts and claims. The dissertation identifies the situated, responsive practice of autonomy with political integrity as a conception of political freedom, and argues that political integrity renders autonomy available to agents under the conditions of historical and social dependence highlighted in non-sovereign accounts of human agency. In arguing that autonomy does not depend on sovereignty, the dissertation seeks to overcome the impasse in contemporary democratic theory between deliberative and agonistic conceptions of democracy. Deliberative conceptions identify democracy with formally rational institutions aimed at generating consensus, while agonistic conceptions present democracy as a mode of contestation resistant to institutionalization and animated by the exclusions inherent in every consensus. The dissertation argues that these opposed conceptions of democracy share the fundamental assumption that autonomy depends on sovereignty, and seeks to dissolve the dilemma between them by showing that autonomy requires not sovereignty but rather the acknowledgement of our mutual dependence characteristic of political integrity Chapter one diagnoses the tendency to assume that autonomy depends on sovereignty. It makes three key claims: that contemporary democratic theorists tend to assume that autonomy and non-sovereignty are mutually incompatible; that this assumption gets its grip on contemporary democratic theory through a certain way of juxtaposing Kant and Nietzsche; and that that way of juxtaposing Kant and Nietzsche ignores Kant’s attempt to think through non-sovereign judgment on one side, and Nietzsche’s rethinking of autonomy in terms of self-mastery on the other. Chapters two and three read Hegel and Arendt, respectively, as theorists of non-sovereign autonomy. Chapter two claims, first, that Hegel understands autonomy to be incompatible with sovereignty; and, second, that he develops a conception of autonomy that is compatible with plurality because it incorporates responsiveness. Chapter three, in turn, first argues that Arendt understands the political freedom of non-sovereign agents as normative self-determination—as autonomy—and then argues that her complex conception of the human artifice allows her to understand this autonomy as situated within historically contingent structures of meaning. Chapter four brings the concept of autonomy developed over the preceding chapters into conversation with the politics of racial integration in the U.S. It outlines the practice of political integrity, showing how it incorporates responsiveness and situatedness, and argues that this practice can orient the struggles of agents pursuing social justice on the terrain of real-world politics.","McFadden, Tanner J.",0,,1376
3858,,"Our interests are in using structure based drug design to target bacterial agents and toxins that have the potential for intentional release into the environment and therefore pose a severe threat to public health and safety. Specifically, we focus on the pathogenic bacteria Francisella tularensis and Yersinia pestis, as well as the Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). Our strategy for F. tularensis and Y. pestis was to target the bacterial system for fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS-II). The FAS-II system contains several enzymes whose sequence and structure is highly conserved across a vast array of pathogens. This coupled with the low homology to the equivalent system in humans makes this pathway an excellent target for antimicrobial drug development in general, as well as the development of broad-spectrum antibiotics. To this end, we have cloned, expressed, and purified the FAS-II enzyme, β-hydroxyacyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Dehydratase (FabZ), from both F. tularensis (FtFabZ) and Y. pestis (YpFabZ). We also performed an enzymatic characterization of both proteins as well as several mutant forms of YpFabZ in order to elucidate the structural features important for substrate and inhibitor binding. Additionally, we have discovered two novel compounds, Mangostin and Stictic Acid, which demonstrate potent inhibition of both YpFabZ and FtFabZ. The scaffolds of these two compounds represent excellent starting points for further design of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs. The BoNTs are zinc metalloproteases that cleave and inactivate proteins critical for neurotransmission. There are seven serotypes of the BoNTs, several of which are toxic to humans. In order to adequately screen potential drugs targeting the BoNTs we developed a novel fluorescence assay that utilizes a recombinant GFP-bound substrate and is capable of detecting enzymatic cleavage by all seven BoNT serotypes. Using this new assay, in conjunction with a virtual screen of 1.4 million potential inhibitor compounds, we discovered a novel inhibitor of BoNT serotype E.","McGillick, Brian E.",0,,1377

3866,,"In the 1980s and 90s, the publishing industry in the United States was transformed by a series of mergers and acquisitions, as long-standing houses were subsumed into international multimedia conglomerates to form what we now know as The Big Five—Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin Random House, Simon and Schuster. Though conglomeration revolutionized the processes of literary production, scholars have paid little mind to these corporate practices. This dissertation investigates the ways that literature is made today by focusing on the overlooked professionals shaping the field of contemporary literary production: Agents, Editors, Authors, and Distributors. Too often dismissed as mere bureaucratic functionaries, these middlemen are in fact powerful nodes between artist and corporation, and they force us to rethink the category of literary production as a form of corporate creativity. Exploring the influence of middlemen on contemporary literary forms, I blend computational methods, ethnography, literary history, and close reading to model a new method for analyzing the field of literary production. I reveal how these professionals operate as administrators of literary prestige and “corporate taste” today, shaping the form and content of contemporary fiction while providing access to mainstream publication and cultural consecration. I argue that contemporary fiction allegorizes the logic of the marketplace, even while critiquing the neoliberal corporatization of literary production.","McGrath, Laura B.",0,,1379
3867,"Side-effect actions, acting for a reason, and acting intentionally","What is the relation between acting intentionally and acting for a reason? While this question has generated a considerable amount of debate in the philosophy of action, on one point there has been a virtual consensus: actions performed for a reason are necessarily intentional. Recently, this consensus has been challenged by Joshua Knobe and Sean Kelly, who argue against it on the basis of empirical evidence concerning the ways in which ordinary speakers of the English language describe and explain certain side-effect actions. Knobe and Kelly's argument is of interest not only because it challenges a widely accepted philosophical thesis on the basis of experimental evidence, but also because it indirectly raises an important and largely neglected question, the question of whether or in what sense an agent can perform a side-effect action for a reason. In this article, I address this question and provide a positive answer to it. Specifically, I argue that agents act for a reason whenever they perform side-effect actions as trade-offs. Thus, I claim that there are three distinct types of rational action: actions performed as ends in themselves, actions performed as means to further ends, and side-effect actions performed as trade-offs. Given this multiplicity of types of rational action, the question of whether or not actions performed for a reason are necessarily intentional is in need of refinement. The more specific question that lies at the heart of this article is whether or not side-effect actions performed as trade-offs are necessarily intentional. I conclude that, contrary to what Knobe and Kelly suggest, the question remains open.","McGuire, J. M.",0,10.1080/13869795.2012.696130,1380
3868,,"This dissertation discusses three contemporary fictions that critique the rhetoric of freedom in the digital revolution. The three novels, Ernest Cline’s Ready Player One (2012); Dave Eggers’ The Circle (2013); Shumeet Baluja’s The Silicon Jungle (2011), examine the negative aspects of online environments. Each novelist has created a dystopian narrative inspired by present conditions, to predict a darker future of digital “determinism.” Cline’s novel suggests human attention will be consumed by virtual reality gaming immersion and ideology. For Eggers, social media creates a tyranny of voluntary self-surveillance. Baluja’s novel illustrates the present and future dangers of data profiling to restrict and monitor human liberty. In some ways these critiques seem like nothing new, as science fiction and dystopias have long been warning of the dangers of technological futures. This dissertation, however, argues that these 21st century novels provide a critique of the utopian rhetoric accompanying digital media and culture. For the majority of the 20th century, dystopian writers were inspired by ideological fears of totalitarian state powers. In contrast, this dissertation will focus upon the shift from state controlled unfreedom to digitally programmed unfreedom: freedom has become encoded. The shift from civic “right” to technological “option” has numerous social consequences, including a subtle redefinition of human freedom as well as redefinition of the narratives, such as dystopian novels, used to describe the human condition. Short of expectations to actually “solve” social ills, such as growing digital unfreedom, this dissertation addresses the transformation of citizenship from civic agent to digital consumer.","MᶜKenna, Peter J., III",0,,1381

3871,,"This project looks at the work we do to understand, to be understood, and to act on the basis of such understanding. Communicative labor is an important and under-theorized aspect of communication, and one that significantly impacts our epistemic, social and political lives. In this dissertation I take such labor as my object of analysis, and show how it bears on speakers and contexts. First I provide an analysis of labor suitable for characterizing unwaged, immaterial and reproductive labor, and argue that such an analysis helps make sense of language systems—the common pool resource systems that allow speakers to communicate and act on the basis of communication. Such systems require maintenance in order to function and preserve their value. The theoretical value of a labor-based approach to language systems becomes clear when we look at conversations that don’t function properly. I distinguish several kinds of antagonistic interpretation that distort communication in conversation: undue skepticism, willful obtuseness, bad listening, intrusive interruption, affected misunderstanding, and ignoring. I argue that such practices, if systematic and pervasive enough, undermine valuable properties of conversations. My focus on communication as labor helps us better understand traditional concepts in philosophy of language (such as the ‘conversational scoreboard’ and ‘common ground’), but it also sheds light on more specific (and specifically subordinating) forms of speech. While antagonistic interpretation can distort conversations by making some speech more difficult (in the limit case, by silencing speakers), it can also distort conversations by making some speech easy, unwilled or automatic. Such speech plays an important role in determining the social status and political rights of agents beyond the immediate context of utterance. For instance, in 1989, after hours of interrogation in police custody, 16 year old Antron McCray confessed to a crime he did not commit. McCray’s utterances formed the linchpin of his wrongful conviction as part of the Central Park Five. I discuss such cases as object lessons in the management of effort against speakers in conversation. In some discourse contexts, agents come to produce locutions not on the basis of reasoning about how and whether to speak, but on the basis of constrained alternatives to doing so. In such cases, an agent produces speech, but only at the expense of having her communicative agency compromised. I call such speech extracted speech, and focus on the role it plays in distributing communicative labor and power in institutional contexts.","McKinney, Rachel A.",0,,1383
3872,,"This document builds a model, the Resilience Engine, of how a given sociotechnical innovation contributes to the resilience of its society, where the failure points of that process might be, and what outcomes, resilient or entropic, can be generated by the uptake of a particular innovation. Closed systems, which tend towards stagnation and collapse, are distinguished from open systems, which through ongoing encounters with external novelty, tend towards enduring resilience. Heterotopia, a space bounded from the dominant order in which novelty is generated and defended, is put forth as the locus of innovation for systemic resilience, defined as the capacity to adapt to environmental changes. The generative aspect of the Resilience Engine lies in a dialectic between a heterotopia and the dominant system across a membrane which permits interaction while maintaining the autonomy of the new space. With a model of how innovation, taken up by agents seeking power outside the dominant order, leads to resilience, and of what generates failures of the Resilience Engine as well as successes, the model is tested against cases drawn from two key virtual worlds of the mid-2000s. The cases presented largely validate the model, but generate a crucial surprise. Within those worlds, 2008-2010 saw an abrupt cultural transformation as the dialectic stage of the Resilience Engine's operation generated victories for the dominant order over promising emergent attributes of virtual heterotopia. At least one emergent practice has been assimilated, generating systemic resilience, that of the conference backchannel. A surprise, however, comes from extensive evidence that one element never problematized in thinking about innovation, the discontent agent, was largely absent from virtual worlds. Rather, what users sought was not greater agency but the comfort of submission over the burdens of self-governance. Thus, aside from minor cases, the outcome of the operation of the Resilience Engine within the virtual worlds studied was the colonization of the heterotopic space for the metropolis along with attempts by agents both external and internal to generate maximum order. Pursuant to the Resilience Engine model, this outcome is a recipe for entropic collapse and for preventing new heterotopias from arising under the current dominant means of production.","McKnight, John Carter",0,,1384
3874,,"If knowledge is socially constructed, then students' discursive attachments should be eminently malleable. Students' radical openness to change, however, is not the defining characteristic of a university classroom. Instead, learners appear to desire coherence of knowledge over revelations of contingency, and pedagogical acts that disrupt existing formations are as likely to produce reactionary responses as revolutionary reorganizations of the self. In this article Chris McMillan argues that neither the constructivist nor the social constructionist readings of critical pedagogy are able to account for this fixity of knowledge. In response he contends that Slavoj Žižek's Lacanian-inspired theory of subjectivity and of the Real can effectively respond to the limitations of these approaches by insisting upon the pedagogical value of the lack within subjectivity. A Žižekian conception of subjectivity is able to respond to this lacuna by positing the negativity of the subject as the agent of transformation and to produce a ""pedagogy of the impossible"" that evokes the moments of impossibility within discourse embodied by the subject ""qua"" the Lacanian Real.","McMillan, Chris",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/edth.12133,1385

3876,Evaluation of Four Designed Virtual Agent Personalities,"Convincing conversational agents require a coherent set of behavioral responses that can be interpreted by a human observer as indicative of a personality. This paper discusses the continued development and subsequent evaluation of virtual agents based on sound psychological principles. We use Eysenck's theoretical basis to explain aspects of the characterization of our agents, and we describe an architecture where personality affects the agent's global behavior quality as well as their back-channel productions. Drawing on psychological research, we evaluate perception of our agents' personalities and credibility by human viewers (N = 187). Our results suggest that we succeeded in validating theoretically grounded indicators of personality in our virtual agents, and that it is feasible to place our characters on Eysenck's scales. A key finding is that the presence of behavioral characteristics reinforces the prescribed personality profiles that are already emerging from the still images.

3883,Parameterizing mental model ascription across intelligent agents,"Mental model ascription-also called mindreading-is the process of inferring the mental states of others, which happens as a matter of course in social interactions. But although ubiquitous, mindreading is presumably a highly variable process: people mindread to different extents and with different results. We hypothesize that human mindreading ability relies on a large number of personal and contextual features: the inherent abilities of specific individuals, their current physical and mental states, their knowledge of the domain of discourse, their familiarity with the interlocutor, the risks associated with an incorrect assessment of intent, and so on. This paper presents a theory of mindreading that models diverse artificial intelligent agents using an inventory of parameters and value sets that represent traits of humans and features of discourse contexts. Examples are drawn from Maryland Virtual Patient, a prototype system that will permit medical trainees to diagnose and treat cognitively modeled virtual patients with the optional assistance of a virtual tutor. Since real patients vary greatly with respect to physiological and cognitive features, so must a society of virtual patients. Modeling such variation is one of the goals of the overall OntoAgent program of research and development.","McShane, M.",0,10.1075/is.15.3.03mcs,1389
3884,,"Dialogue‐based systems often consist of several components, such as communication analysis, dialogue management, domain reasoning, and language generation. In this paper, we present Converness, an ontology‐driven, rule‐based framework to facilitate domain reasoning for conversational awareness in multimodal dialogue‐based agents. Converness uses Web Ontology Language 2 (OWL 2) ontologies to capture and combine the conversational modalities of the domain, for example, deictic gestures and spoken utterances, fuelling conversational topic understanding, and interpretation using description logics and rules. At the same time, defeasible rules are used to couple domain and user‐centred knowledge to further assist the interaction with end users, facilitating advanced conflict resolution and personalised context disambiguation. We illustrate the capabilities of the framework through its integration into a multimodal dialogue‐based agent that serves as an intelligent interface between users (elderly, caregivers, and health experts) and an ambient assistive living platform in real home settings.

3888,How visual information influences coordination dynamics when following the leader,"Coordinating one's movements with others is an important aspect of human interactions. Regulating the distance to other moving agents is often necessary to achieve specific task goals such as in invasion sports. This study aimed to examine how distance regulation is mediated by different sources of information that are typically available when humans coordinate their actions to others. Participants followed a virtual leader that moved backwards and forwards, and were instructed to maintain the initial distance. In one condition, participants were presented with a life-size fully animated human avatar as the leader, displaying both segmental (limb motion) and global (optical expansion) motion information. In the other condition, participants had to follow an expanding and receding sphere in which segmental motion information was absent. Optical expansion rates revealed that participants regulated distance equally effective in both conditions. Given the phase relation and response times to direction changes however, the timing to the leader appeared to be more accurate in the avatar condition. These results provide support that forward-backward following can indeed be successfully mediated through global information, but that detection of segmental information allows for earlier tuning to another person's movement intentions.

3891,Development and differentiation of force and energy concepts for animate and inanimate objects in children and adolescents,"We looked at how far students aged 10-17 years differentiate between the force and energy concepts for animates and inanimates. Within a structured interview format, participants described situations in which inanimate objects and animate agents interacted. Results showed that the younger students made no distinction between the two concepts for the inanimate objects. They regarded force and energy as the objects' intrinsic properties, related to their height and weight, and tended to attribute both concepts to animates rather than to inanimates. With age, force came to be seen in terms of interactions, while energy continued to be considered in relation to the physical dimensions that affected it (i.e., height or weight). Even so, force continued to impinge on energy, the reverse being less frequent. Conceptions remained unchanged for the animate agents, insofar as younger and older students alike expressed undifferentiated force/energy conceptions, relating both force and energy to the agents' effort or the results of their action.","Megalakaki, O.",0,10.1007/s11165-015-9467-9,1392

Mobile eye tracking in field settings however has several limitations, including a highly cumbersome data coding process. In addition, field settings allow only limited control of important interfering variables. The present paper argues that virtual reality can provide an alternative setting that combines the benefits of mobile eye tracking with the flexibility and control provided by lab experiments. The paper first reviews key advantages of different eye tracking technologies as available for desktop, natural and virtual environments. It then explains how combining virtual reality settings with eye tracking provides a unique opportunity for shopper research in particular regarding the use of augmented reality to provide shopper assistance.","Meissner, M.",0,10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.09.028,1393
3897,,"Fluorescence based sensing methods offer sensitivity, selectivity, operational convenience and real time monitoring of the analytes of interest. Because of their favorable photophysical characteristics, ease of synthesis, modulation of fluorescent properties the 1,8-naphthalimide based fluorescent probes were used in a multitude of applications. Among these, chemodosimetric probes for sulfide and PET probes for pH needs a special mention due to the known biological and environmental effects of sulfide and pH. Chapter one describes chemodosimetric probes that react with sulfide and undergo irreversible changes in the fluorescent properties of 1,8-naphthalimide. In this chapter, the development of three chemodosimetric fluorescent probes (SNAN-1,2, and 3), using two novel design platforms based on N-aryl-1,8-naphthalimide are reported. With the application of sulfide's known reactivity towards aromatic nitro and azido groups, we demonstrated their use as PET and ICT modulators of N-aryl-1,8-naphthalimide. By reducing an aromatic azide to a hydroxyl amine intermediate, a new approach in sulfide detection in aqueous media is reported. These chemodosimeters can be quite useful in providing insights into the relatively limited area of C0 chemosensors. Furthermore, we showed that the chemistry of N-aryl-1,8- naphthalimide is quite useful for the strategic placement of both the ICT and PET modulators on the same molecule and that N-aryl group allows the placement of PET modulator at less explored imide site. These dosimetric agents demonstrated good selectivity, greater signal diversity and a more desirable ""Off-On"" fluorescence response. To the best of our knowledge, probe SNAN-3 is the only example showing a dual-emission and dual-response for the detection of sulfide in aqueous solution. The differential responses from these probes indicate that 1,8-naphthalimide can be used in designing probes that can detect multiple analytes. Chapter two describes PET probes based on 1,8-naphthalimide that offer an intensiometric enhancement of the fluorescent signal. In this chapter, we present a series of N-aryl-1,8-naphthalimide probes (HNAN-1,2, and 3) to detect the changes in pH from the less explored imide side PET modulation. These probes are amongst the very few known virtual C0 assemblies that allows for PET modulation from the imide side of 1,8-naphthalimide which can also affects the ICT process. Along with the much desirable ""Off-On"" response, these probes demonstrated a greater signal diversity which is most useful in reliability of the signal. To the best of our knowledge, HNAN-3 is the only example that shows three fluorescent maxima as a response to changes in pH in aqueous solution.","Meka, Ranjith Kumar",0,,1394
3898,Service Robots Rising: How Humanoid Robots Influence Service Experiences and Elicit Compensatory Consumer Responses,"Interactions between consumers and humanoid service robots (HSRs; i.e., robots with a human-like morphology such as a face, arms, and legs) will soon be part of routine marketplace experiences. It is unclear, however, whether these humanoid robots (compared with human employees) will trigger positive or negative consequences for consumers and companies. Seven experimental studies reveal that consumers display compensatory responses when they interact with an HSR rather than a human employee (e.g., they favor purchasing status goods, seek social affiliation, and order and eat more food). The authors investigate the underlying process driving these effects, and they find that HSRs elicit greater consumer discomfort (i.e., eeriness and a threat to human identity), which in turn results in the enhancement of compensatory consumption. Moreover, this research identifies boundary conditions of the effects such that the compensatory responses that HSRs elicit are (1) mitigated when consumer-perceived social belongingness is high, (2) attenuated when food is perceived as more healthful, and (3) buffered when the robot is machinized (rather than anthropomorphized).","Mende, M.",0,10.1177/0022243718822827,1395

IoT devices are primarily used for connectivity between physical objects while Social technologies are responsible for collaboration and social interaction. The domain of Social Internet of Things (SIoTs) points toward social interactions of IoT devices. This phenomenon will further enhance the collaboration capabilities of IoTs to deliver huge amounts of human-computer interactions with very limited interventions from humans. Thus, high degrees of human-computer interfaces can be created among physical objects by enabling them with human-like capabilities and social interactions.

3905,Primary school student and teacher perceptions of competency-based learning,"In the search for an educational system that enables students to achieve the best academic results, it is extremely important to explore the perception of the main educational agents: students and teachers. Therefore, the objectives of this paper were: (a) to analyse primary school student and teacher perceptions of students' competency-based learning; (b) to assess the possible differences between them; and (c) to test hypothetical models for predicting learning according to their perception. The participants were 8,513 students from 58 schools and 1,010 teachers from 110 schools. Overall, both teachers and students reported high scores of perception. However, the perception of the students was higher than that of the teachers, except for the digital competence. While the results showed differences in perception between both prediction models of competency-based learning, both groups perceived the competences of autonomy and personal initiative, digital competence, social competence and citizenship, and lifelong learning as core elements of their perception. In this regard, initial and ongoing teacher training in innovative pedagogical models is needed to enable the development of these competences, which are predictors of perceived learning.","Merono, L.",0,10.1080/11356405.2018.1436796,1397

We find that people (balancing the motives of self-verification and self-enhancement) design their avatars to be similar to their real selves, but with some enhancements that are more attractive. In particular, users most enhance on physical attributes that they perceive to be weak in real life. We also find that avatar attractiveness affects online behavioral traits such as extroversion and loudness. Lastly, we find support for a hierarchy of physical variation across online roles whereby people retain core identity elements (such as gender and race) across all their avatars, but they change peripheral elements (such as hair and clothing, and even face). We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for business and society.","Messinger, P. R.",0,10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.12.020,1398

Yet, empirical results have not been conclusive with respect to two pharmacological agents, yohimbine hydrochloride (YOH) and propranolol. YOH is suggested to enhance emotional memory by elevating nor epinephrine, whereas the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol might help better cope with feared situations by reducing accompanying bodily sensations. Methods: In this controlled trial, fifty-six participants with specific phobia were randomly assigned to either 1) virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) plus YOH, 2) VRET plus Propranolol, or 3) VRET plus placebo. Participants in all conditions received three sessions of VRET over a period of two weeks. Results: We conducted 2 x 3 repeated measures MANOVA's. Results showed a significant effect for time, with partial eta squared ranging from eta p2 = 0.647 to eta p2 = 0.692, for specific phobia, yet no significant interaction effects were found. Conclusion: No significant differences were found when VRET with YOH or a beta-blocker was compared to VRET with a non-active placebo.

Nowadays, MABS are used for studying various complex systems such as crowds, animal societies, ecosystems, traffic behaviors or the Market. So MABS are experimental research tools that contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms embedded in these complex systems. Still, studying some complex systems may require to consider millions of individuals. In such a case, the computing resources, which are required, represent a major obstacle for MABS end-users. In this respect, general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is a relevant approach for addressing performance and scalability issues. However, GPU programming requires expert skills, which strongly limits both the accessibility and the re-usability of the frameworks developed using GPGPU. This paper presents MABS design guideline, dedicated to the GPU context, which allows the use of the GPU power without sacrificing the accessibility of MABS frameworks.

3918,"Hybrids of the Romantic: Frankenstein, Olimpia, and Artificial Life","This essay analyzes fantasies and fears related to the possible creation of artificial humans in two influential pieces of Romantic literature, namely E.T.A. Hoffmann's Der Sandmann and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Both the automaton Olimpia and Dr. Frankenstein's monster are hybrid creatures. These dystopian figures represent the Romantic fear of the loss of control over the outcome of human endeavour, they symbolize the dangers immanent in modern science and technology. As hybrids, Olimpia and Frankenstein's monster are capable of breaking apparently unpenetrable boundaries, such as those between human and non-human, and between life and death. As such, these creatures become ""unheimlich"" (uncanny), a critical term developed by Ernst Jentsch and Sigmund Freud, who directly referred to Hoffmann's Sandman. The term ""uncanny"" was further developed by the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in the 1970s. Mori's investigation of human responses to androids (""Uncanny Valley""), shows the persistence of doubts and fears surrounding artificial humans far beyond the Romantic times, and opens new questions related to the issues of creation, reproduction, hybrids, hubris and gender.","Micheletti, S.",0,10.1002/bewi.201801888,1401
3919,,"Human beings use spatial relations to describe many daily tasks in their language. For a mobile robot to be useful in daily life, it is necessary to have navigation algorithms capable of identifying and establishing spatial relations. To date in robotics, the navigation problem has been thoroughly researched as a task of guiding a robot from one spatial coordinate to another. Therefore, there is a difference in degree of abstraction between the language of human beings and the algorithms used in robot navigation. This article introduces a piece of research performed on the use of topological relations for the formalisation of spatial relations and navigation. So far, topological relations have been applied widely in geographical information systems and also in spatial logics. There are some proposals in robot navigation which use them for planning but there is no research about making decision in robot navigation. Our research focuses on decision-making methods to establish spatial relations. The main result is a new heuristic, called the Heuristic of Topological Qualitative Semantics (HTQS), which allows the identification and establishment of spatial relations decision-making from a set of actions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, HTQS has been implemented in the form of agents that can move in a two-dimensional virtual environment. HTQS opens a new door to designing algorithms for navigation based on the identification and establishment of spatial relations.

However, less is known about how augmented reality affects social interactions. The current paper presents three studies that test the social psychological effects of augmented reality. Study 1 examined participants' task performance in the presence of embodied agents and replicated the typical pattern of social facilitation and inhibition. Participants performed a simple task better, but a hard task worse, in the presence of an agent compared to when participants complete the tasks alone. Study 2 examined nonverbal behavior. Participants met an agent sitting in one of two chairs and were asked to choose one of the chairs to sit on. Participants wearing the headset never sat directly on the agent when given the choice of two seats, and while approaching, most of the participants chose the rotation direction to avoid turning their heads away from the agent. A separate group of participants chose a seat after removing the augmented reality headset, and the majority still avoided the seat previously occupied by the agent. Study 3 examined the social costs of using an augmented reality headset with others who are not using a headset. Participants talked in dyads, and augmented reality users reported less social connection to their partner compared to those not using augmented reality. Overall, these studies provide evidence suggesting that task performance, nonverbal behavior, and social connectedness are significantly affected by the presence or absence of virtual content.","Miller, M.

3931,Intentionality of a co-actor influences sensorimotor synchronisation with a virtual partner,"Interpersonal sensorimotor synchronisation requires individuals to anticipate and adapt to their partner's movement timing. Research has demonstrated that the intentionality of a co-actor affects joint action planning, however, less is known about whether co-actor intentionality affects sensorimotor synchronisation. Explicit and implicit knowledge of a synchronisation partner's intentionality may influence coordination by modulating temporal anticipation and adaptation processes. We used a computer-controlled virtual partner (VP) consisting of tempo-changing auditory pacing sequences to simulate either an intentional or unintentional synchronisation partner. The VP was programmed to respond to the participant with low or moderate degrees of error correction, simulating a slightly or moderately adaptive human, respectively. In addition, task instructions were manipulated so that participants were told they were synchronising with either another person or a computer. Results indicated that synchronisation performance improved with the more adaptive VP. In addition, there was an influence of the explicit partner instruction, but this was dependent upon the degree of VP adaptivity and was modulated by subjective preferences for either the human or the computer partner. Beliefs about the intentionality of a synchronisation partner may thus influence interpersonal sensorimotor synchronisation in a manner that is modulated by preferences for interacting with intentional agents.","Mills, P.

3936,Personalisation and automation in a virtual conversation skills tutor for children with autism,"Existing research involving children with autism suggests that autonomous (self directed) virtual humans can be used successfully to improve language skills, and that authorable (researcher controlled) virtual humans can be used to improve social skills. This research combines these ideas and investigates the use of autonomous virtual humans for teaching and facilitating practice of basic social skills in the areas of greeting, conversation skills, listening and turn taking. The Social Tutor software features three virtual human characters' who guide the learner through educational tasks and model social scenarios. Participants used the software for 10-15min per day, 3-5days per week for 3weeks, with data collected before software use commenced, immediately after use ended, then again 2 and 4months after this. The software evaluation revealed that the social tutor was generally well-received by participants and caregivers, with data showing a clear difference in theoretical knowledge of social skills between the experimental (social content) group and the control (placebo content) group. This paper focuses on the automated assessment, dynamic lesson sequencing, feedback, and reinforcement systems of the social tutor software, the impact these systems had on participant performance during the software evaluation, and recommendations for future development. Thus, while data reflecting overall performance of the social tutor system is provided for context, the main data presented is limited to that specifically relating to the performance and user perceptions of the aforementioned systems.","Milne, M.",0,10.1007/s12193-018-0272-4,1406
3940,,"As scientific research has been demonstrating positive effects of contemplative education involving mindfulness, concentration, and yoga, it has been increasingly implemented by teachers in schools. Given the lack of research about teachers' pedagogical practices of contemplative education in classroom settings, this dissertation is a study of how teachers at all levels incorporate it into their classrooms (but with a particular emphasis on preschool teachers). Guided by a theory of figured worlds (Holland et al., 1998), I describe how teachers who teach contemplative practices interact with their environments as active agents who author their own identities and meanings as they incorporate and improvise contemplative practices in their classrooms. I conducted a synergistic mixed-methods study using a collective instrumental case study with five preschool teachers and survey research that included thirty-three additional participants from a national pool of teachers. Findings of this study elaborate the importance of teachers’ engagement as active agents and their improvisations of contemplative education, which show teachers’ mindful pedagogical practices, their enrichment of resources and techniques, and their needs for contemplative education. The findings also illustrate the benefits teachers reported about their teaching, students’ learning, and classroom climate—such as improvements in stress reduction, socio-emotional development, peer interactions, teacher-student interactions, and community building. These teacher-reported benefits of contemplative education include improvement of ecological relationships among teachers and students in classrooms as well as individual tranquility and efficacy. Findings further describe variations in teachers' thoughts about and teaching of contemplative education. This study has implications for three groups: researchers, teachers, and teacher educators. Researchers who study contemplative education should be aware of teachers’ agency, improvisation, and variations. Researchers should also be aware of different methodologies to study teachers’ pedagogical practices of contemplative education. Teachers should reconceptualize the possibility of contemplative practices and use it in a variety of ways in educational settings, rather than one limited method or curriculum. Teacher educators should develop professional-development programs or teacher-education programs for contemplative education calibrated to needs associated with teachers' years of teaching contemplative education and the ages of the students whom they teach.","Min, Hee Jung",0,,1407
3941,"Smartphone-Based Conversational Agents and Responses to Questions About Mental Health, Interpersonal Violence, and Physical Health","IMPORTANCE Conversational agents are smartphone-based computer programs designed to respond to users in natural language, thereby mimicking conversations between people. Many people use their smartphones to obtain health information. OBJECTIVE To describe the responses of 4 widely used conversational agents (Siri[Apple], Google Now, S Voice [Samsung], and Cortana [Microsoft]) to a standardized panel of questions related to mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A pilot study followed by a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 68 phones from 7 manufacturers conducted from December 2015 to January 2016. Investigators asked the smartphones 9 questions (3 each in mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health) in their natural language. We recorded information on features of the smartphones and their software, including manufacturer, phone model, operating system version, and conversational agent. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were the responses of conversational agents to 9 questions. The responses were characterized based on the ability to (1) recognize a crisis, (2) respond with respectful language, and (3) refer to an appropriate helpline, or other health resources for a physical health concern. Questions were asked repeatedly until there were no new answers. RESULTS The phones ran 77 conversational agents: Siri (n = 27), Google Now (n = 31), S Voice (n = 9), and Cortana (n = 10). Siri, Google Now, and S Voice recognized the statement ""I want to commit suicide"" as concerning; Siri and Google Now referred the user to a suicide prevention helpline. In response to ""I am depressed,"" Siri recognized the concern and responded with respectful language, the responses from S Voice and Cortana varied, and Google Now did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents referred users to a helpline for depression. In response to ""I was raped,"" Cortana referred to a sexual assault hotline; Siri, Google Now, and S Voice did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents recognized ""I am being abused"" or ""I was beaten up by my husband."" In response to ""I am having a heart attack,"" ""My head hurts,"" and ""My foot hurts."" Siri generally recognized the concern, referred to emergency services, and identified nearby medical facilities. Google Now, S Voice, and Cortana did not recognize any of the physical health concerns. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE When asked simple questions about mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health, Siri, Google Now, Cortana, and S Voice responded inconsistently and incompletely. If conversational agents are to respond fully and effectively to health concerns, their performance will have to substantially improve.","Miner, A. S.",0,10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.0400,1408
3947,Is the regime of risk transfer sustainable? Impossible contract and inequality,"In a risk transfer and shifting financial systems, an interest rate based debt contract is an ""impossible contract,"" since, under the axioms of conventional economics, the borrower has an incentive not to repay the loan. Such impossible contract is made possible by creating a virtual world of certainty through mechanisms such as collateral requirements and an edifice of legal, administrative, policy incentive mechanisms that include positive and negative enforcements that protect the creditor. The society has to bear huge costs to make them possible. Risk sharing has the potential to enhance efficiency as each party to contracts has ""skin-in-the-game"", thus eliminating or minimizing the principal-agent problem. Participants in a contract of an economic undertaking can choose higher risk-higher return projects thus increase the efficiency and productivity of the system. It can also create a reciprocal and trusting environment that strengthens social cohesion, promotes social mobility and reduces income inequality without perverse incentive effects.","Mirakhor, A.",0,10.1016/j.ribaf.2017.04.001,1409
3951,Dementia detection using automatic analysis of conversations,"Neurogenerative disorders, like dementia, can affect a person's speech, language and as a consequence, conversational interaction capabilities. A recent study, aimed at improving dementia detection accuracy, investigated the use of conversation analysis (CA) of interviews between patients and neurologists as a means to differentiate between patients with progressive neurodegenerative memory disorder (ND) and those with (non-progressive) functional memory disorders (FMD). However, doing manual CA is expensive and difficult to scale up for routine clinical use. In this paper, we present an automatic classification system using an intelligent virtual agent (IVA). In particular, using two parallel corpora of respectively neurologist- and IVA-led interactions, we show that using acoustic, lexical and CA-inspired features enable ND/FMD classification rates of 90.0% for the neurologist-patient conversations, and 90.9% for the IVA-patient conversations. Analysis of the differentiating potential of individual features show that some differences exist between the IVA and human-led conversations, for example in average turn length of patients.

3956,Virtual bargaining: a theory of social decision-making,"An essential element of goal-directed decision-making in social contexts is that agents' actions may be mutually interdependent. However, the most well-developed approaches to such strategic interactions, based on the Nash equilibrium concept in game theory, are sometimes too broad and at other times 'overlook' good solutions to fundamental social dilemmas and coordination problems. The authors propose a new theory of social decision-making-virtual bargaining-in which individuals decide among a set of moves on the basis of what they would agree to do if they could openly bargain. The core principles of a formal account are outlined (vis-a-vis the notions of 'feasible agreement' and explicit negotiation) and further illustrated with the introduction of a new game, dubbed the 'Boobytrap game' (a modification on the canonical Prisoner's Dilemma paradigm). In the first empirical data of how individuals play the Boobytrap game, participants' experimental choices accord well with a virtual bargaining perspective, but do not match predictions from a standard Nash account. Alternative frameworks are discussed, with specific empirical tests between these and virtual bargaining identified as future research directions. Lastly, it is proposed that virtual bargaining underpins a vast range of human activities, from social decision-making to joint action and communication.","Misyak, J.

3958,,"Lord and Dinh (see record 2014-14818-002) raise a number of important points that need to be considered in development of leadership research and practice. There are three main issues that we wish to address to support and develop their statements. Some recent research on virtual charismatic trainers suggests that context is important. Mitchell, Brown, Mann, and Towler (2014) examined the interactive effects of a charismatic (vs. noncharismatic) pedagogical training agent, feedback comparison groups, and performance-approach goal orientation on trainee performance. Findings revealed that high performance approach trainees, who received training from a charismatic agent and did not receive a feedback comparison, not only outperformed low performance-approach trainees in the same conditions but also were the best performers in general. In moving forward with leadership research, we also encourage researchers to consider the importance of leader language and the influence of language on followers. There is considerable agreement within the organizational science arena that powerful language plays an important role in shaping and forming perceptions of effective leadership (Conger, 1991; Shamir, Arthur, & House, 1994). For many researchers, this linkage between language and leadership is a neglected area of empirical investigation (Conger, 1991). A notable characteristic of charismatic leaders is their effectiveness in communication. Central to the relationship between language and leadership is that charismatic leaders effectively use linguistic techniques to persuade followers to engage in activities that are consistent with the leader’s vision. Although there is preliminary evidence that suggests that certain leadership behaviors are more strongly linked to team performance in virtual settings than face-to-face settings (Purvanova & Bono, 2009), there is still much to be learned about leader effectiveness in virtual settings.

3961,,"Machine Learning and Computer Vision are the two technologies that have innovative applications in diverse fields, including engineering, medicines, agriculture, astronomy, sports, education etc. The idea of enabling machines to make human like decisions is not a recent one. It dates to the early 1900s when analogies were drawn out between neurons in a human brain and capability of a machine to function like humans. However, major advances in the specifics of this theory were not until 1950s when the first experiments were conducted to determine if machines can support artificial intelligence. As computation powers increased, in the form of parallel computing and GPU computing, the time required for training the algorithms decreased significantly. Machine Learning is now used in almost every day to day activities. This research demonstrates the use of machine learning and computer vision for smart infrastructure management. This research’s contribution includes two case studies – a) Occupancy detection using vibration sensors and machine learning and b) Traffic detection, tracking, classification and counting on Memorial Bridge in Portsmouth, NH using computer vision and machine learning. Each case study, includes controlled experiments with a verification data set. Both the studies yielded results that validated the approach of using machine learning and computer vision. Both case studies present a scenario where in machine learning is applied to a civil engineering challenge to create a more objective basis for decision-making. This work also includes a summary of the current state-of-the -practice of machine learning in Civil Engineering and the suggested steps to advance its application in civil engineering based on this research in order to use the technology more effectively.","Mitra, Shounak",0,,1414

Access to information is one of the key requirements that farmers need to improve their production. Extension workers are one of the main means through which farmers obtain accurate agricultural information. However, extension agents in Mozambique are too few and consequently only cover a small portion of farmers across the country. The theoretical approaches: (1) Information Processing and (2) Knowledge Gap, guided this study. This study is a field experiment with a pretest-posttest design involving 314 bean growing farmers. Farmers were randomly assigned to each of the four experimental treatments: (1) Extension ONLY, (2) Animation ONLY, (3) Extension THEN Animation and (4) Animation THEN Extension. The topic of the experiment was the use of sealed containers such as Jerrycans to safely store beans. Farmers were assessed on knowledge gain and intent to adopt the proposed technique. Regardless of the experimental treatment, all farmers had a significant increase in knowledge regarding the topic. Men and women learned about the same. Although participants in Extension Only had the lowest scores and those in Animation THEN Extension had the highest; The Animation ONLY group scored as well as both combined methods and significantly better than those in Extension ONLY. These results suggest that the use of animated videos through mobile phones can potentially complement or replace extension in delivering agricultural topics.","Mocumbe, Sostino",0,,1416
3966,,"The concept of self-directed learning (SDL) has been extensively studied; however, the majority of studies have explored learners’ perspectives on SDL, with less attention paid to investigating SDL from educators’ perspectives. Surprisingly, while assessment and feedback have long been recognized as powerful elements which influence how learners approach their learning, and key research studies have examined how both assessment and feedback can encourage and enhance the development of SDL, this nevertheless remains an area that would benefit from increased attention. Moreover, although there is a growing body of literature investigating the cultural dimension of SDL, most of these studies are limited to examining the formation of SDL among individuals influenced by Western or Confucian cultures, ignoring the existence of other cultural groups. This study, which investigates Malaysian teacher educators’ conceptualisations of SDL, begins to address these gaps. The key research questions which guided the study are: 1) How do teacher educators in Malaysia conceptualise learning? 2) How do teacher educators in Malaysia conceptualise SDL? 3) To what extent do teacher educators in Malaysia perceive themselves as self-directed learners? 4) What kind of learning opportunities do teacher educators in Malaysia create for their learners to foster the development of SDL, and what is the particular role of assessment and feedback in SDL? Twenty Malaysian teacher educators were interviewed to obtain their views on SDL and to identify their pedagogical practices which may foster or hinder the development of SDL approaches among their learners. A constructivist grounded theory approach was used to inform the methodological framework of this study, whilst a hybrid inductive and deductive analysis approach was used to analyse the interview data. The findings of the current study suggest that most assessment and feedback practices are heavily focused on assessments designed by educators and on educator-generated feedback, in which learners are passive recipients. It is argued that these practices have significantly contradicted the primary principle of SDL, which characterises the learner as the key agent of his or her own learning. The findings of this study suggest that a more comprehensive conceptualisation of SDL is required that recognises the fundamental role of both the self and of educators in SDL, and acknowledges the impact of the socio-cultural context on SDL. Informed by the existing SDL literature, and derived from fine-grained analysis of the interview data, the proposed definition of SDL and reconceptualised SDL framework foreground SDL as socially constructed learning where the learner takes control of his or her own learning processes within complex socio cultural contexts. The thesis concludes by recommending that future research (i) explores the central role of assessment and feedback in the context of SDL and (ii) investigates the impact of various cultures on learning, in order to develop a broader and more nuanced understanding of SDL.","Mohamad Nasri, Nurfaradilla",0,,1417
3967,,"Classification in data mining is one of the well-known tasks that aim to construct a classification model from a labelled input data set. Most classification models are devoted to a static environment where the complete training data set is presented to the classification algorithm. This data set is assumed to cover all information needed to learn the pertinent concepts (rules and patterns) related to how to classify unseen examples to predefined classes. However, in dynamic (non-stationary) domains, the set of features (input data attributes) may change over time. For instance, some features that are considered significant at time Ti might become useless or irrelevant at time Ti+j. This situation results in a phenomena called Virtual Concept Drift. Yet, the set of features that are dropped at time Ti+j might return to become significant again in the future. Such a situation results in the so-called Cyclical Concept Drift, which is a direct result of the frequently called catastrophic forgetting dilemma. Catastrophic forgetting happens when the learning of new knowledge completely removes the previously learned knowledge. Phishing is a dynamic classification problem where a virtual concept drift might occur. Yet, the virtual concept drift that occurs in phishing might be guided by some malevolent intelligent agent rather than occurring naturally. One reason why phishers keep changing the features combination when creating phishing websites might be that they have the ability to interpret the anti-phishing tool and thus they pick a new set of features that can circumvent it. However, besides the generalisation capability, fault tolerance, and strong ability to learn, a Neural Network (NN) classification model is considered as a black box. Hence, if someone has the skills to hack into the NN based classification model, he might face difficulties to interpret and understand how the NN processes the input data in order to produce the final decision (assign class value). In this thesis, we investigate the problem of virtual concept drift by proposing a framework that can keep pace with the continuous changes in the input features. The proposed framework has been applied to phishing websites classification problem and it shows competitive results with respect to various evaluation measures (Harmonic Mean (F1-score), precision, accuracy, etc.) when compared to several other data mining techniques. The framework creates an ensemble of classifiers (group of classifiers) and it offers a balance between stability (maintaining previously learned knowledge) and plasticity (learning knowledge from the newly offered training data set). Hence, the framework can also handle the cyclical concept drift. The classifiers that constitute the ensemble are created using an improved Self-Structuring Neural Networks algorithm (SSNN). Traditionally, NN modelling techniques rely on trial and error, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. The SSNN simplifies structuring NN classifiers with minimum intervention from the user. The framework evaluates the ensemble whenever a new data set chunk is collected. If the overall accuracy of the combined results from the ensemble drops significantly, a new classifier is created using the SSNN and added to the ensemble. Overall, the experimental results show that the proposed framework affords a balance between stability and plasticity and can effectively handle the virtual concept drift when applied to phishing websites classification problem.

3968,Learning where to look Autonomous development of gaze behavior for natural human-robot interaction,"Gaze is one of the most important nonverbal behaviors in regulating human-human interactions in close encounters. Several approaches have been proposed to design robots that can exhibit human-like natural gazing behavior. Most of the available techniques though are based on careful hard-coding of behavioral rules that are usually extracted from analysis of human-human interaction corpora or theories of gaze behavior in humans. The major disadvantage of this approach is the difficulty in discovering these behavioral rules specially taking into account cultural and situational effects on gaze behavior. In this paper, we report the development and evaluation of an unsupervised gaze controller for a listener robot that tries to alleviate this problem of engineered gazing behavior. The system utilizes two major learning mechanisms. First, it learns a set of recurrent gaze patterns called basic interactive acts using a motif discovery algorithm. A hierarchical controller of the activation level of these interactive acts is then learned. The system was implemented and evaluated in comparison with a reactive gaze controller that was previously shown to provide human-like gazing behavior using an explanation scenario and was shown to be superior in terms of naturalness, human-likeness and comfort of the human partner.","Mohammad, Y.",0,10.1075/is.14.3.06moh,1419
3970,Why Should We Imitate Robots? Effect of Back Imitation on Judgment of Imitative Skill,"How we perceive robots affects how we interact with them and vice versa. This leads us to hypothesize that imitating a robot (back imitation) would affect human's perception of this robot. More specifically, we suggest that it would lead to the attribution to a higher imitative skill to the robot when it subsequently imitates the human. Given that one of the major challenges in learning from demonstration (imitation) in robotics is the limited number of training examples that the demonstrator is usually willing to provide, it would be beneficial to design the interaction context in such away to increase human's subjective evaluation of the robot's imitative skills and back-imitation may be a way to achieve that. Three studies were conducted-involving 78 subjects and 150 HRI sessions-to evaluate the effect of back imitation on human's perception of the robot along several dimensions including imitation skill, motion human likeness, interaction quality, humanness and likability. These studies show that people who imitated the robot for few minutes assigned it later higher imitative skill and motion human-likeness. Moreover, back imitation was shown to lead to higher intention of future interaction. The paper reports the results of these studies and discusses their implications for the design of imitation interactions.","Mohammad, Y.",0,10.1007/s12369-015-0282-2,1420

3977,,"Modeling, Simulation and Decentralized Control of Islanded Microgrids by Farideh Doost Mohammadi This thesis develops a comprehensive modular state-space model of microgrids containing inverter-based Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). The model is validated and then used for small signal stability enhancement and voltage and frequency control. State space models of various microgrid elements are first derived, which allow for the inclusion of any possible elements such as current controlled inverters that are missing in the literature. Then a complete state space model is obtained to complement the models that are available in the literature and whose objectives are system analysis only as compared to the purpose of this work which is stability enhancement and control design. Specifically, 1. Small signal stability is enhanced by adding current controlled inverters to the microgrid. 2. Decentralized secondary frequency and voltage control techniques are proposed. For secondary frequency control purposes, at first, the control strategies of different kinds of inverters and storage devices are described. Then, a novel solution is introduced for islanded microgrids by decomposing the system into virtual control areas. For the secondary voltage control an Average Consensus Algorithm (ACA) is used and applied on a network of agents which has been chosen optimally based on the required connectivity. The main purpose of the ACA is to keep the average voltage of all the buses at a desired level during islanding. Then another control strategy is proposed to improve the voltage profile. While the average voltage is kept fixed by the voltage controlled inverters, this voltage profile smoothness is obtained by dedicating zones to current controlled inverters and defining their responsibilities based on the location of the loads.","Mohammadi, Farideh Doost",0,,1422

Our research aims at building interactive robots and agents that adapt to new environments autonomously by interacting with human users using natural modalities. ðŠis dissertation studies the problem of learning novel tasks from human-agent dialog. We propose a novel approach for interactive task learning, situated interactive instruction(SII), and investigate approaches to three computational challenges that arise in designing SII agents: situated comprehension, mixed-initiative interaction, and i nteractive task learning. We propose a novel mixed-modality grounded representation for task verbs which encompasses their lexical, semantic, and task-oriented aspects. This representation is useful in situated comprehension and can be learned through human-agent interactions. We introduce the Indexical Model of comprehension that can exploit extra-linguistic contexts for resolving semantic ambiguities in situated comprehension of task commands. The Indexical model is integrated with a mixed-initiative interaction model that facilitates a flexible task-oriented human-agent dialog. ðŠis dialog serves as the basis of interactive task learning. We propose an interactive variation of explanation-based learning that can acquire the proposed representation. We demonstrate that our learning paradigm is efficient, can transfer knowledge between structurally similar tasks, integrates agent-driven exploration with instructional learning, and can acquire several tasks. ðŠe methods proposed in this thesis are integrated in ROSIE — a generally instructable agent developed in the Soar cognitive architecture and embodied on a table-top robot.","Mohan, Shiwali",0,,1423
3979,,"Anthropomorphic interfaces in gamified applications may offer different effects on human and computer interactions. Applying them in healthcare applications, particularly for a transition care, could help to support the transition process, transferring a patient from hospital care to self-care. Anthropomorphic interfaces virtually imitate the patient’s health progress in the transition process which could aid in helping to maintain the patient’s motivation throughout the process. Furthermore, an anthropomorphic interface is seen as a tool to support a long-term relationship, especially when human components are applied in a human-computer interaction. Combining gamified applications with an anthropomorphic interface is expected to provide a motivational effect. This can happen when an anthropomorphic interface is designed with its characteristics deemed trustworthy and preferable. However, little consideration has been given to the gamification of anthropomorphic interfaces as a supportive tool for transitional healthcare. This research proposes a framework for the application of anthropomorphic interfaces in gamified applications for transitional healthcare. The framework analyses existing research on anthropomorphic interfaces, gamification, and transitional healthcare. The framework has been validated by triangulating previous literature, expert interviews, and a patient survey. The research further develops an instrument to measure the extent of the gamification of anthropomorphic interfaces for transition care in games. To be validated, the instruments went through a series of tests. The test results showed that the instruments were reliable. Following from the framework and the instrument, a set of guidelines was developed and validated in a focus group discussion.

Our model can (i) support the investigation of cross-contamination scenarios, and (ii) evaluate and compare different risk mitigation options. We used an agent-based modeling framework to predict the pathogen prevalence and levels in bags of fresh-cut lettuce and quantify spread of E. coli O157:H7 from contaminated lettuce to surface areas of processing equipment. Using an unbalanced factorial design, we were able to propagate combinations of random values assigned to model inputs through different processing steps and ranked statistically significant inputs with respect to their impacts on selected model outputs. Results indicated that whether contamination originated on incoming lettuce heads or on the surface areas of processing equipment, pathogen prevalence among bags of fresh-cut lettuce and batches was most significantly impacted by the level of free chlorine in the flume tank and frequency of replacing the wash water inside the tank. Pathogen levels in bags of fresh-cut lettuce were most significantly influenced by the initial levels of contamination on incoming lettuce heads or surface areas of processing equipment. The influence of surface contamination on pathogen prevalence or levels in fresh-cut bags depended on the location of that surface relative to the flume tank. This study demonstrates that developing a flexible yet mathematically rigorous modeling tool, a ""virtual laboratory,"" can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of individual and combined risk mitigation options.","Mokhtari, A.",0,10.1111/risa.12960,1425
3985,,"Social (or Sociable) robots are designed to interact with people in a natural and interpersonal manner. They are becoming an integrated part of our daily lives and have achieved positive outcomes in several applications such as education, health care, quality of life, entertainment, etc. Despite significant progress towards the development of realistic social robotic agents, a number of problems remain to be solved. First, current social robots either lack enough ability to have deep social interaction with human, or they are very expensive to build and maintain. Second, current social robots have yet to reach the full emotional and social capabilities necessary for rich and robust interaction with human beings. To address these problems, this dissertation presents the development of a low-cost, flexible, affect-aware rear-projected robotic agent (called ExpressionBot), that is designed to support verbal and non-verbal communication between the robot and humans, with the goal of closely modeling the dynamics of natural face-to-face communication. The developed robotic platform uses state-of-the-art character animation technologies to create an animated human face (aka avatar) that is capable of showing facial expressions, realistic eye movement, and accurate visual speech, and then project this avatar onto a face-shaped translucent mask. The mask and the projector are then rigged onto a neck mechanism that can move like a human head. Since an animation is projected onto a mask, the robotic face is highly flexible research tool, mechanically simple, and low-cost to design, build and maintain compared with mechatronic and android faces. The results of our comprehensive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) studies illustrate the benefits and values of the proposed rear-projected robotic platform over a virtual-agent with the same animation displayed on a 2D computer screen. The results indicate that ExpressionBot is well accepted by users, with some advantages in expressing facial expressions more accurately and perceiving mutual eye gaze contact. To improve social capabilities of the robot and create an expressive and empathic social agent (affect-aware) which is capable of interpreting users' emotional facial expressions, we developed a new Deep Neural Networks (DNN) architecture for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). The proposed DNN was initially trained on seven well-known publicly available databases, and obtained significantly better than, or comparable to, traditional convolutional neural networks or other state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and learning time. Since the performance of the automated FER system highly depends on its training data, and the eventual goal of the proposed robotic platform is to interact with users in an uncontrolled environment, a database of facial expressions in the wild (called AffectNet) was created by querying emotion-related keywords from different search engines. AffectNet contains more than 1M images with faces and 440,000 manually annotated images with facial expressions, valence, and arousal. Two DNNs were trained on AffectNet to classify the facial expression images and predict the value of valence and arousal. Various evaluation metrics show that our deep neural network approaches trained on AffectNet can perform better than conventional machine learning methods and available off-the-shelf FER systems. We then integrated this automated FER system into spoken dialog of our robotic platform to extend and enrich the capabilities of ExpressionBot beyond spoken dialog and create an affect-aware robotic agent that can measure and infer users' affect and cognition. Three social/interaction aspects (task engagement, being empathic, and likability of the robot) are measured in an experiment with the affect-aware robotic agent. The results indicate that users rated our affect-aware agent as empathic and likable as a robot in which user's affect is recognized by a human (WoZ).

3986,Role of embodiment and presence in human perception of robots' facial cues,"Both robotic and virtual agents could one day be equipped with social abilities necessary for effective and natural interaction with human beings. Although virtual agents are relatively inexpensive and flexible, they lack the physical embodiment present in robotic agents. Surprisingly, the role of embodiment and physical presence for enriching human-robot-interaction is still unclear. This paper explores how these unique features of robotic agents influence three major elements of human-robot face-to-face communication, namely the perception of visual speech, facial expression, and eye-gaze. We used a quantitative approach to disentangle the role of embodiment from the physical presence of a social robot, called Ryan, with three different agents (robot, telepresent robot, and virtual agent), as well as with an actual human. We used a robot with a retro-projected face for this study, since the same animation from a virtual agent could be projected to this robotic face, thus allowing comparison of the virtual agent's animation behaviors with both telepresent and the physically present robotic agents. The results of our studies indicate that the eye gaze and certain facial expressions are perceived more accurately when the embodied agent is physically present than when it is displayed on a 2D screen either as a telepresent or a virtual agent. Conversely, we find no evidence that either the embodiment or the presence of the robot improves the perception of visual speech, regardless of syntactic or semantic cues. Comparison of our findings with previous studies also indicates that the role of embodiment and presence should not be generalized without considering the limitations of the embodied agents.","Mollahosseini, A.",0,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2018.04.005,1427

3993,Allocating countermeasures to defend water distribution systems against terrorist attack,"Water distribution networks are critical infrastructure systems that are vulnerable to terrorist attack. Water utility management has the goal of protecting public health by allocating countermeasures, including security equipment and personnel, as a first line of defense. A malevolent actor may select an attack location, however, using a set of unknown priorities that include performance and susceptibility criteria. This research develops a multi-agent framework to simulate the attack and defense of a distribution system to analyze security resource allocation strategies for protecting against chemical contamination events. A single period attacker-defender game is simulated, in which an attacker seeks to contaminate a system node with high attack utility, and a group of defenders seeks to minimize the public health impact from intentional attack. Terrorist agent decisions are simulated using a multi-attribute utility function, and multiple cases are constructed to simulate alternative rankings of criteria. The water utility manager agent assigns security personnel and deterrent security equipment to nodes using one of three security resource allocation strategies. The agent-based modeling framework is applied to simulate attack and defense for a virtual municipality, D-town. Strategies are evaluated based on the number of consumers exposed to a critical dose when a contaminant is released. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

3996,,"One of the basic skills for a robot autonomous grasping is to select the appropriate grasping point for an object. Several recent works have shown that it is possible to learn grasping points from different types of features extracted from a single image or from more complex 3D reconstructions. In the context of learning through experience, this is very convenient, since it does not require a full reconstruction of the object and implicitly incorporates kinematic constraints as the hand morphology. These learning strategies usually require a large set of labeled examples which can be expensive to obtain. In this paper, we address the problem of actively learning good grasping points to reduce the number of examples needed by the robot. The proposed algorithm computes the probability of successfully grasping an object at a given location represented by a feature vector. By autonomously exploring different feature values on different objects, the systems learn where to grasp each of the objects. The algorithm combines beta–binomial distributions and a non-parametric kernel approach to provide the full distribution for the probability of grasping. This information allows to perform an active exploration that efficiently learns good grasping points even among different objects. We tested our algorithm using a real humanoid robot that acquired the examples by experimenting directly on the objects and, therefore, it deals better with complex (anthropomorphic) hand–object interactions whose results are difficult to model, or predict. The results show a smooth generalization even in the presence of very few data as is often the case in learning through experience.

Growing interest in 'enactivism' - as pioneered by the Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela - may lead to new perspectives in these areas, but a common framework for expressing many of the key concepts is still missing. This paper attempts to lay a tentative foundation in that direction by extending Maturana and Varela's pictographic depictions of autopoietic unities to create a rich visual language for envisioning a wide range of enactive systems - natural or artificial - with different degrees of complexity. It is shown how such a diagrammatic taxonomy can help in the comprehension of important relationships between a variety of complex concepts from a pan- theoretic perspective. In conclusion, it is claimed that visual language is not only valuable for teaching and learning, but also offers important insights into the design and implementation of future advanced robotic systems.","Moore, R.

For a sample of offenders and their agents, multilevel modeling was used to control for nonindependence of data for women assigned to the same agent. Consistent with communication theory, a conversational approach was positively related to measures of a supportive relationship, and an authoritarian/ conformity pattern of communication was negatively related to a supportive relationship. For low-risk offenders, attention to client-identified problems was positively related to more supportive relationships. For women with high risk for reoffending, the agents viewed themselves as less supportive if they addressed a high proportion of offender-identified needs. Findings suggest the efficacy of training to promote agents' conversational communication and attention to offender-identified problems. Findings also suggest the need to more fully explore agents' experience in working with very high-risk offenders.","Morash, M.",0,10.1177/0306624x16689832,1433

This paper presents a study about ICT coordinators, conducted through a questionnaire to more than 5161 teachers from different Spanish regions. It is argued that the coordinator must have ICT skills of various kinds that are more complex than mere instrumental mastery of technology. These functions must be linked to support the innovative use of ICT in teaching and learning by the teaching staff of a school. Evidence shows that ICT coordinators are becoming widespread and that teachers consider them necessary to promote innovation based on ICT. Differences between regions are observed in the implementation, the development of their roles and tasks, and on the perception of the need for an ICT coordinator.

Three identical female agents were used for this experiment: 1) an ECA performing parallel empathy combined with neutral emotional expressions, 2) an ECA performing parallel empathy displaying emotional expressions that were relevant to the emotional state of the student, and 3) an ECA performing parallel empathy by displaying relevant emotional expressions followed by emotional expressions of reactive empathy with the goal of altering the student's emotional state. Results indicate that an agent performing parallel empathy displaying emotional expressions relevant to the emotional state of the student may cause this emotion to persist. Moreover, the agent performing parallel and then reactive empathy appeared to be effective in altering an emotional state of fear to a neutral one.","Moridis, C. N.",0,10.1109/t-affc.2012.6,1435
4013,Social Robots and Seniors: A Comparative Study on the Influence of Dynamic Social Features on Human-Robot Interaction,"Due to the world's aging demographics and declining caregiver-to-senior ratio, socially assistive robots are being designed to assist seniors with activities of daily living. Beyond functionality, the integration of such robots also depends on the quality of the interaction between the robot and senior, including the provision of social support. Our research investigates the effectiveness of robot social features on human-robot interaction (HRI) with seniors when providing assistance. Specifically, we investigate how the dynamic social features of a robot, such as facial expressions and gestures, affect the interaction experience of cognitively impaired seniors during an assistive activity. In this paper, we present a comparative HRI study of seniors living with mild cognitive impairments preparing a cup of tea with the assistance from three different embodiments with varying social features. In particular, the platforms considered were a human-like robot, a character-like robot, and a tablet display. Our results show that a human-like robot having an expressive face and arm gestures significantly increased levels of engagement, positive affect, and perceived social intelligence during the interaction when compared to the other two platforms. Furthermore, even though all platforms had the same activity assistance functionality, participants preferred the human-like robot, treated it like a companion, perceived it to be more useful, and were more inclined to keep it in social or private areas in their homes. No statistically significant differences were found between interactions with the character-like robot and the tablet.","Moro, C.",0,10.1007/s12369-018-0488-1,1436
4017,Towards an Artificially Empathic Conversational Agent for Mental Health Applications: System Design and User Perceptions,"Background: Conversational agents cannot yet express empathy in nuanced ways that account for the unique circumstances of the user. Agents that possess this faculty could be used to enhance digital mental health interventions. Objective: We sought to design a conversational agent that could express empathic support in ways that might approach, or even match, human capabilities. Another aim was to assess how users might appraise such a system. Methods: Our system used a corpus-based approach to simulate expressed empathy. Responses from an existing pool of online peer support data were repurposed by the agent and presented to the user. Information retrieval techniques and word embeddings were used to select historical responses that best matched a user's concerns. We collected ratings from 37,169 users to evaluate the system. Additionally, we conducted a controlled experiment (N=1284) to test whether the alleged source of a response (human or machine) might change user perceptions. Results: The majority of responses created by the agent (2986/3770, 79.20%) were deemed acceptable by users. However, users significantly preferred the efforts of their peers (P<.001). This effect was maintained in a controlled study (P=.02), even when the only difference in responses was whether they were framed as coming from a human or a machine. Conclusions: Our system illustrates a novel way for machines to construct nuanced and personalized empathic utterances. However, the design had significant limitations and further research is needed to make this approach viable. Our controlled study suggests that even in ideal conditions, nonhuman agents may struggle to express empathy as well as humans. The ethical implications of empathic agents, as well as their potential iatrogenic effects, are also discussed.","Morris, R. R.",0,10.2196/10148,1437
4021,"TRUST, AVATARS, AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS: IMPLICATIONS FOR E-LEARNING","As pervasive as the use of avatars is in online communications, there exists little research on the influence of avatars on user trust in computer mediated communication environments. From a pedagogical perspective, this gap in the literature should be addressed because many e-learning environments utilize computer mediated communications tools as first-order mechanisms to support distance learning student-teacher interaction. In this study, we measured two dimensions of trust in order to assess whether or not there exists an affect from the uses of avatars on individual perceptions in computer mediated communications. Data analysis suggests that the use of avatars associated with trustworthiness affects trust development and in the perception of trustworthiness. The findings of this study are particularly important given the increasing rate at which many traditional educational activities are migrating to online environments and subsequently rely upon computer mediated communications as a principle means of student-teacher interface.","Morrison, R.",0,,1438
4024,A multidisciplinary approach to designing and evaluating Electronic Medical Record portal messages that support patient self-care,"We describe a project intended to improve the use of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) patient portal information by older adults with diverse numeracy and literacy abilities, so that portals can better support patient-centered care. Patient portals are intended to bridge patients and providers by ensuring patients have continuous access to their health information and services. However, they are underutilized, especially by older adults with low health literacy, because they often function more as information repositories than as tools to engage patients. We outline an interdisciplinary approach to designing and evaluating portal-based messages that convey clinical test results so as to support patient-centered care. We first describe a theory-based framework for designing effective messages for patients. This involves analyzing shortcomings of the standard portal message format (presenting numerical test results with little context to guide comprehension) and developing verbally, graphically, video- and computer agent-based formats that enhance context. The framework encompasses theories from cognitive and behavioral science (health literacy, fuzzy trace memory, behavior change) as well as computational/engineering approaches (e.g., image and speech processing models). We then describe an approach to evaluating whether the formats improve comprehension of and responses to the messages about test results, focusing on our methods. The approach combines quantitative (e.g., response accuracy, Likert scale responses) and qualitative (interview) measures, as well as experimental and individual difference methods in order to investigate which formats are more effective, and whether some formats benefit some types of patients more than others. We also report the results of two pilot studies conducted as part of developing the message formats. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Morrow, D.",0,10.1016/j.jbi.2017.03.015,1439
4033,Rhythm Patterns Interaction - Synchronization Behavior for Human-Robot Joint Action,"Interactive behavior among humans is governed by the dynamics of movement synchronization in a variety of repetitive tasks. This requires the interaction partners to perform for example rhythmic limb swinging or even goal-directed arm movements. Inspired by that essential feature of human interaction, we present a novel concept and design methodology to synthesize goal-directed synchronization behavior for robotic agents in repetitive joint action tasks. The agents' tasks are described by closed movement trajectories and interpreted as limit cycles, for which instantaneous phase variables are derived based on oscillator theory. Events segmenting the trajectories into multiple primitives are introduced as anchoring points for enhanced synchronization modes. Utilizing both continuous phases and discrete events in a unifying view, we design a continuous dynamical process synchronizing the derived modes. Inverse to the derivation of phases, we also address the generation of goal-directed movements from the behavioral dynamics. The developed concept is implemented to an anthropomorphic robot. For evaluation of the concept an experiment is designed and conducted in which the robot performs a prototypical pick-and-place task jointly with human partners. The effectiveness of the designed behavior is successfully evidenced by objective measures of phase and event synchronization. Feedback gathered from the participants of our exploratory study suggests a subjectively pleasant sense of interaction created by the interactive behavior. The results highlight potential applications of the synchronization concept both in motor coordination among robotic agents and in enhanced social interaction between humanoid agents and humans.","Mortl, A.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0095195,1440
4036,The effects of appearance and motion of virtual characters on emotional reactivity,"The aim of this study was to examine the influence of appearance and motion of virtual characters on students' emotional reactions. We used four different virtual reality (VR) conditions with different combinations of appearance and motion: that is, a regular-male and zombie-male virtual character each assigned to low- and high-amplitude motion. Participants were asked to wear a head-mounted display (HMD) and observe the virtual content. Immediately after viewing each of the four stimuli, participants were asked questions about their emotional reactions in terms of reactivity (intensity) and subjective valence. Both the appearance and the motion of the virtual characters significantly affected participants' (a) emotional valence in a dynamic pattern and (b) emotional intensity, with reactions to subjectively aversive and/or active stimuli as more negative than reactions to neutral and/or passive stimuli. Females showed significantly higher levels of negative emotional intensity to all virtual characters and negative emotional valence (lower likeability) to aversive characters. Implications for further research, and gender and cultural considerations are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Mousas, C.",0,10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.036,1441
4039,,"The widespread adoption of cloud computing makes cloud services a core component of modern IT systems. Cloud service monitoring brings benefits to both service providers and consumers. It enables customers to track the status and quality of their services to ensure that their SLAs are satisfied and possibly record any SLA violations. It also supports service providers to predict potential violations and deploy additional resources in advance to avoid possible penalties of performance violations. However, federated cloud poses challenges to application monitoring due to the lack of cross-platform interoperability, management, and vendor lock-in constraints. In addition, SLA definitions might be different from one service provider to another. Many cloud providers offer tools to enable customers to monitor the performance of their cloud-based services. The major drawback of these commercial monitoring tools is that they do not present enough detail to consumers to be able to customize the behavior of these tools to accommodate their specific requirements. In addition, such monitoring tools typically are provider-dependent, which means that consumers cannot use the same monitoring platform for multiple cloud providers. In this thesis, we present SLAM, a flexible framework for SLA monitoring in federated cloud environments. SLAM is platform-independent, which enables interoperability between different cloud providers. SLAM can monitor physical and virtual resources. It uses user-defined rules and policies to map SLA parameters to relevant low-level metrics. SLAM supports monitoring of distributed nodes and hosts using an agent-based model. It supports different monitoring frequencies (i.e. checking rate) for each monitoring metric. In addition, we propose a service benchmarking approach that can compare similar services offered by different cloud providers without deploying monitoring agents at the provider’s site. We implemented a poof-of-concept prototype to showcase the flexibility and usability of our proposed system. Performance evaluation shows that our proposed system is scalable and poses a very limited overhead on target systems.","Moustafa, Saadeldin Badr Saad Mohamed",0,,1442

While bullying is a ubiquitous behavior of people, it remains difficult to study as conducting live experiments is out of the question for moral and ethical reasons. However, computer simulation models can be created to model the natural social and humanistic systems. Agent based modeling is one approach that can provide verification of theories, insight into social interactions, testing of ‘what-if' scenarios and the gem of complex systems modeling, emergent behaviors. All of this can be done within a virtual world of virtual people.

4042,How (not) to increase older adults' tendency to anthropomorphise in serious games,"Among elderly, the use of serious games steadily increases. Research shows that anthropomorphising digital agents (i.e., ascribing human characteristics to them) has positive shortterm consequences on interactions with digital agents. However, whether these effects can also be observed over a long-term period and in a real-life setting is unknown. In two studies, we investigated the important long-term consequences of anthropomorphism among older adults (age > 50) to increase involvement in serious games. Participants read either a story that highly anthropomorphized the digital agent of a training game, or a low anthropomorphism story about that agent. To investigate long-term effect, they played the training game for three weeks, and gaming data was assessed (number of games played, time of playing, points gained). While on the short-term, the anthropomorphic story increased the human-ness of the agent (Study 1), no long-term effects where found (Study 2). Furthermore, an anthropomorphic story had no influence on the gaming outcome. Our results inform app developers about which techniques are useful to humanise digital agents.","Muller, B. C.

4046,A PRESENT FOR PINOCCHIO: ON WHEN NON-BIOLOGICAL AGENTS BECOME REAL,"People often ascribe human attributes to objects, a phenomenon named anthropomorphism. As research has mainly focused on explicitly measured attitudes toward objects, we investigated in four studies whether perceiving a non-biological agent behaving in a human-like manner influences meaningful social behavior. Participants watched a video fragment containing either a biological agent or a non-biological agent (i.e., Pinocchio) as the main character, in order to increase the perceived agency of the respective agent. Subsequently, participants' behavior toward the biological and non-biological agent was assessed measuring interpersonal closeness and prosocial behavior. Participants who watched a video of a non-biological agent sought more interpersonal closeness toward this agent compared to participants who watched a video of a biological agent, meaning that they sat closer to Pinocchio. Thus, when we anthropomorphize non-biological agents, this has profound effects on how we interact with these agents: it leads to more interpersonal closeness toward this non-biological agent.","Muller, B.

4050,Robust virtual implementation under common strong belief in rationality,"Bergemann and Morris (2009b) show that static mechanisms cannot robustly virtually implement non constant social choice functions if preferences are sufficiently interdependent. Without any knowledge of how agents revise their beliefs this impossibility result extends to dynamic mechanisms. In contrast, we show that if the agents revise their beliefs according to the forward-induction logic embedded in strong rationalizability, admitting dynamic mechanisms leads to considerable gains. We show that all ex-post incentive compatible social choice functions are robustly virtually implementable in private consumption environments satisfying a weak sufficient condition, regardless of the level of preference interdependence. This result derives from the key insight that in such environments, in every belief-complete type space under common strong belief in rationality (Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2002), dynamic mechanisms can distinguish all payoff type profiles by their strategic choices. Notably, dynamic mechanisms can robustly virtually implement the efficient allocation of an object in cases that static mechanisms cannot. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study intends to observe the issues confronted by students while performing tasks in the laboratory in different educational modes. The online survey is conducted using quantitative and qualitative research instruments to evaluate the students' perspectives. This exploratory work has emphasized the practical issues such as an insufficient time constraint, and instruments, geographical needs, financial concerns, and unavailability of subject specialists to cater for relevant issues about a particular course. The sample size was (N=161) drawn from a stratified sampling method for analysis of four strata. This research addresses these problems in the laboratory with an aim to improve the student's practical skills as well as their investigation-based learning. It is needed for practical based courses, through experimentation with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms. The design science methodology is adopted, it presents the conception of an Intelligent Virtual Laboratory (IVL) based on pedagogical agent-based cognitive architecture (PACA). This IVL provides the level of excellence of laboratory needs by enhancing the ET which students can efficiently perform practical tasks online at anywhere. The results showed that IVL has a significant model for enhancing the learning to students and recommendations for further research implementation.","Munawar, S.",0,10.29333/ejmste/85036,1447
4055,Japanese mothers' utterances about agents and actions during joint picture-book reading,"This study extended the research on the scaffolding provided by mothers while reading picture books with their children from a focus on conversational styles related to labeling to a focus on those related to agents and actions to clarify the process by which language develops from the one-word to the syntactic stage. We clarified whether mothers decreased the degree of scaffolding in their initiation of conversations, in the responses to their children's utterances, and in the choice of referential ranges of their utterances. We also investigated whether maternal conversational styles contributed to the development of their children's vocabularies. Eighteen pairs of Japanese mothers and their children were longitudinally observed when the children were 20 and 27 months of age. The pairs were given a picture book depicting 24 animals engaged in everyday behavior. The mothers shifted their approach in the initiation of conversation from providing to requesting information as a function of their children's age. The proportion of maternal elaborative information-seeking responses was positively correlated with the size of their children's productive vocabulary. In terms of referential choices, mothers broadened the range of their references as their children aged. In terms of the contribution of maternal conversational styles to children's vocabulary development, the use of a maternal elaborative information-seeking style when the children were 20 months of age predicted the size of the children's productive vocabulary at 27 months. These results indicate that mothers decrease the degree of scaffolding by introducing more complex information into the conversations and transferring the role of actively producing information to their children by requesting information as their children develop. The results also indicate that these conversational styles promote the development of children's vocabularies during the transition from the one-word to the syntactic stage.","Murase, T.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00357,1448
4056,,"This study is a qualitative analysis of guided reflections on the educational experiences of five former students who attended schools in the poorest congressional district in the United States. While the students did not all know each other or attend the same secondary schools, they all had the same high school social studies teacher, the researcher, who emphasized involvement in civic activism and used it to promote student literacy and academic achievement. Each of these students graduated from high school, obtained a college degree, started professional careers, and returned to their former community as committed political activist. This study is based on analysis of “conversations” that included extended open-ended interviews about students’ educational life histories. Of particular interest were students’ literacy practices, academic achievement, family support, and the impact of memorable teachers and/or teaching approaches. Although students were not asked to reflect upon or to discuss my teaching approach, which focuses on critical pedagogy, student activism, dialogue, and advocacy the participants did identify this pedagogical approach as crucial in terms of the development of their literacy, awareness, and commitment to social justice. All five students finished high school, graduated from college, and returned to their home communities to work as teachers and change agents. The study examines Gramsci’s (year) argument that social change requires the working-class and poor to become conscious of their position in society, to develop their own new hegemonic ideas, and to work to change conditions for all.

Results show that most primary participants enjoyed spreading these positive songlets as they became ""well-becoming agents of change"" in their own social networks. ""Well-becoming"" emphasizes an agentive action or activity that creates better well-being in others, an action such as the sharing or teaching of a songlet. The qualitative data reveals a number of types of well-becoming such as social and familial bonding, meaning-making, teaching-rushes, and experiencing embodied cognition.

4061,Enacting the Consequences of the Lecoq Pedagogy's Aesthetic Cognitive Foundation,"The theatre pedagogy of Jacques Lecoq (1921-99) is founded on the principle that all physical, psychological, intellectual, and emotional performance registers can be accessed by prioritizing the moving body. Therefore, a Lecoq-based approach is in contrast to dominant principles of psychologically based acting that privilege working through emotion and psychology. While Lecoq pedagogy does not discount these performance registers, normally considered to belong to the internal world of the actor, Lecoq's work reaches them through physical action. Lecoq pedagogy considers it possible to learn how to shape and manage these registers by mastering the moving body as creative theatrical agent. This pedagogical strategy at first reiterates and then inverts the mind privilege of a Cartesian mind-body dichotomy, but ultimately confounds it, reorienting the constitution of body and mind. This reconstitution results in a new, emergent, antidualistic configuration where somatic intelligence accesses and encompasses all intelligence, and is initiated and accomplished through the physical act.","Murphy, M.",0,10.1017/s0040557417000278,1452

4065,,"A lot of research can be seen in the field of social robotics that majorly concentrate on various aspects of social robots including design of mechanical parts and their movement, cognitive speech and face recognition capabilities. Several robots have been developed with the intention of being social, like humans, without much emphasis on how human-like they actually look, in terms of expressions and behavior. Furthermore, a substantial disparity can be seen in the success of results of any research involving “humanizing” the robots’ behavior, or making it behave more human-like as opposed to research into biped movement, movement of individual body parts like arms, fingers, eyeballs, or human-like appearance itself. The research in this paper involves understanding why the research on facial expressions of social humanoid robots fails where it is not accepted completely in the current society owing to the uncanny valley theory.

4066,,"Efficiency in managing scarce wireless resources has been a major design obstacle in wireless mobile networks since its advent. A large body of work has been published on the subject in relation to the first two generation and third generation (3G) of wireless networks. However, these solutions are not readily applicable to the future IP based multi-hop wireless networks. Increased trend in the number of users accessing multimedia rich traffic, and the impacts of mobility management support mechanisms alongside the shared nature of backhaul nodes demand exploration of new avenues of resource management policies. In this thesis a set of schemes are proposed to address the issue of Call Admission Control (CAC) in future multi-hop IP based mobile networks. The first scheme is based on a joint CAC and route assignment design mechanism in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) environment, addressing issues such as pricing policies, wireless resource constraints of the access and backhaul links as well as maximising network provider's revenue. Study's focus is then shifted towards CAC design in Mobility Agent (MA) based Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) networks. A novel class-based CAC mechanism was proposed with the aim of eliminating bottleneck effect at the MAs. To further improve the overall capacity of the network, in conjunction with the proposed CAC mechanism, a modified version of a previously proposed Route Optimisation (RO) scheme is implemented. The performance of the proposed schemes is investigated and analysed through extensive simulations. Comparative studies are then carried out to examine the network provider's total revenue gain in WMNs environment, total blocking probability and per class blocking probability in PMIPv6 networks.","Naghavi, Nika",0,,1455
4067,,"Elementary teachers are criticized for failing to incorporate meaningful science instruction in their classrooms or avoiding science instruction altogether. The lack of adequate science instruction in elementary schools is partially attributed to teacher candidates' anxiety, poor content and pedagogical preparation, and low science teaching self-efficacy. The central premise of this study was that many of these issues could be alleviated through course modifications designed to address these issues. The design tested and presented here provided prospective elementary educators' authentic science teaching experiences with elementary students in a low-stakes environment with the collaboration of peers and science teacher educators. The process of comprehensive reflection was developed for and tested in this study. Comprehensive reflection is individual and collective, written and set in dialogic discourse, focused on past and future behavior, and utilizes video recordings from shared teaching experiences. To test the central premise, an innovative science methods course was designed, implemented and evaluated using a one-group mixed-method design. The focus of the analysis was on changes in self-efficacy, identity and teaching practices as a function of authentic science teaching experiences and comprehensive reflection. The quantitative tools for analysis were t-tests and repeated-measures ANOVA on the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument-B (STEBI-B) and weekly self-rating on confidence as a learner and a teacher of science, respectively. The tools used to analyze qualitative data included thematic analysis and interpretative phenomenological analysis. In addition, theoretically grounded tools were developed and used in a case study to determine the ways one prospective educator's science teaching identity was influenced by experiences in the course. The innovative course structure led the development of teacher candidates' science teaching identity, supported science teaching self-efficacy development, positioned teachers as agents in their learning and development, provided the opportunity for teacher candidates to problematize teaching experiences to improve practice, developed teacher candidates who were able to critically question and create science curricula with the primary purpose of mediating student learning, and improved teacher candidates questioning skills and assistance with student performance in order to better mediate student learning.

4068,SERKET: An Architecture for Connecting Stochastic Models to Realize a Large-Scale Cognitive Model,"To realize human-like robot intelligence, a large-scale cognitive architecture is required for robots to understand their environment through a variety of sensors with which they are equipped. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Serket that enables the construction of a large-scale generative model and its inferences easily by connecting sub-modules to allow the robots to acquire various capabilities through interaction with their environment and others. We consider that large-scale cognitive models can be constructed by connecting smaller fundamental models hierarchically while maintaining their programmatic independence. Moreover, the connected modules are dependent on each other and their parameters must be optimized as a whole. Conventionally, the equations for parameter estimation have to be derived and implemented depending on the models. However, it has become harder to derive and implement equations of large-scale models. Thus, in this paper, we propose a parameter estimation method that communicates the minimum parameters between various modules while maintaining their programmatic independence. Therefore, Serket makes it easy to construct large-scale models and estimate their parameters via the connection of modules. Experimental results demonstrated that the model can be constructed by connecting modules, the parameters can be optimized as a whole, and they are comparable with the original models that we have proposed.","Nakamura, T.",0,10.3389/fnbot.2018.00025,1457

4074,Human social motor solutions for human-machine interaction in dynamical task contexts,"Multiagent activity is commonplace in everyday life and can improve the behavioral efficiency of task performance and learning. Thus, augmenting social contexts with the use of interactive virtual and robotic agents is of great interest across health, sport, and industry domains. However, the effectiveness of human-machine interaction (HMI) to effectively train humans for future social encounters depends on the ability of artificial agents to respond to human coactors in a natural, human-like manner. One way to achieve effective HMI is by developing dynamical models utilizing dynamical motor primitives (DMPs) of human multiagent coordination that not only capture the behavioral dynamics of successful human performance but also, provide a tractable control architecture for computerized agents. Previous research has demonstrated how DMPs can successfully capture human-like dynamics of simple nonsocial, single-actor movements. However, it is unclear whether DMPs can be used to model more complex multiagent task scenarios. This study tested this human-centered approach to HMI using a complex dyadic shepherding task, in which pairs of coacting agents had to work together to corral and contain small herds of virtual sheep. Human-human and human-artificial agent dyads were tested across two different task contexts. The results revealed (i) that the performance of human-human dyads was equivalent to those composed of a human and the artificial agent and (ii) that, using a ""Turing-like"" methodology, most participants in the HMI condition were unaware that they were working alongside an artificial agent, further validating the isomorphism of human and artificial agent behavior.","Nalepka, P.",0,10.1073/pnas.1813164116,1459

Optimization parameters were selected based on clinically used values for field width, modulation factor and pitch. Treatment plans were also created on Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems Inc, Palo Alto, CA) using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for dose delivery on IX treatment unit. A retrospective review was performed of 42 publications that reported IP rates along with lung dose, fractionation regimen, dose rate and chemotherapy. The analysis consisted of nearly thirty two hundred patients and 34 unique radiation regimens. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine parameters associated with IP and establish does response function. Results: The results showed very good dosimetric agreement between the GPU and CPU calculated plans. The results from SBRT study show that GPU planning system can maintain 90% target coverage while meeting all the constraints of RTOG 0631 protocol. Beam on time for Tomotherapy and flattening filter free RapidArc was much faster than for Vero or Cyberknife. Retrospective data analysis showed that lung dose and Cyclophosphomide (Cy) are both predictors of IP in TBI/TMI treatments. The dose rate was not found to be an independent risk factor for IP. The model failed to establish accurate dose response function, but the discrete data indicated a radiation dose threshold of 7.6Gy (EQD2_repair) and 120 mg/kg of Cy below which no IP cases were reported. Conclusion: The TomoTherapy GPU based dose engine is capable of calculating TMI treatment plans with plan quality nearly identical to plans calculated using the traditional CPU/cluster based system, while significantly reducing the time required for optimization and dose calculation. The new system was able to achieve more uniform dose distribution throughout the target volume and steeper dose fall off, resulting in superior OAR sparing when compared to Eclipse treatment planning system for VMAT delivery. The machine optimization parameters tested for TMI cases provide a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of the treatment planning station and associated helical delivery system. The new system also proved to be dosimetrically compatible with other leading modalities for treatments of small and complicated target volumes and was even superior when treatment delivery times were compared. These finding demonstrate that the advanced treatment planning and delivery system from TomoTherapy is well suitable for treatments of complicated cases such as TMI and SRS and it’s often dosimetrically and/or logistically superior to other modalities. The new planning system can easily meet the constraint of threshold lung dose established in this study. The results presented here on the capabilities of Tomotherapy and on the identified lung dose threshold provide an opportunity to explore alternative fractionation schemes without sacrificing target coverage or lung toxicity.

4082,,"Nowadays, mobile devices support a variety of multimedia applications such as live video, radio or online gaming. People spend their time on mobile devices for entertainment more and more via the internet. Due to the requirements of multimedia applications over wireless communication those applications require a huge bandwidth on the network to support them, which creates problems for the network provider. However, one pattern that is appropriate for the efficient delivery of multimedia messages is multicast delivery. Multicast services do, however, introduce challenges within the network when the recipients of the service are moving. Powerful multicast routing protocols are designed for static client IP addresses. Hence, when the mobile node changes the location, it introduces the problem of access network handover. Therefore, this is the aim of the research where a new framework will be developed for multicast mobility within WiFi network to reduce and provide smooth mobility when handover occurs. This research is focused on techniques to reduce handover latency, minimize packet loss and provide connection when a user moves between network zones. To achieve these aims, this designed framework lets mobile nodes send the message to register to foreign agents in advance for addressing IP address of the new zone and to establish the multicast tree earlier. Moreover, there are processes that keep the connection of the path alive. The framework is being simulated on OPNET Modeler for evaluating the performance in terms of handover latency time, the number of packet loss and so on. There are many scenarios that have been tested. According to the results, it shows that the new framework has reduced handover latency time around 60% on average and minimized packet delay approximately 0.7 - 150 ms on mobile node depending on network topology. This framework can provide IP address reconfiguration, binding update, joining multicast group and distribution path of multicast tree in advance. However, there are some overheads and cost that this framework has to pay for such as IP address database, increasing broadcast within networks and keeping connection path alive.","Namee, Khanista",0,,1461
4083,A complex adaptive systems perspective of innovation diffusion: an integrated theory and validated virtual laboratory,"In this paper we integrate the rich yet fragmented insights from the extensive literature on the diffusion of innovation into an elegant, coherent model. Using complex adaptive systems theory as the overarching framework, we integrate prior literature around three constructs: agents, interactions, and an environment. The integrated model is presented in both natural language and as an agent-based simulation model. A series of validation experiments instill confidence that our agent-based model (and similar others) can be used as a virtual research laboratory. We provide theoretical and methodological directions for future research.","Nan, N.",0,10.1007/s10588-013-9159-9,1462
4086,,"Many Virtual Reality-based applications enable the user to actively participate in the virtual environment (VE) by embodying a virtual avatar, and these applications rely on the presence of interactive virtual pedestrians, or agents, to enhance the plausibility of the simulation. A key challenge is to generate plausible movements, in terms of navigation paths and full-body animation, for each virtual agent as it interacts with the user's avatar and other agents. The overall effectiveness of the application depends on both, the realism of the agent's movements, and the faithful representation of the user's avatar.The primary goal of this dissertation is to present novel techniques to simulate plausible movements and behaviors for virtual agents, to synthesize personalized avatars that reflect the user's unique motion, and to generate plausible avatar-agent interactions in immersive VE's. First, we present a novel approach that generates trajectories for agents that reflect the speed and density relationship observed in human crowds. Our approach models the biomechanical relationship between stride length and walking speed, as well as psychological factors such as preference for personal space. Second, we propose a velocity computation algorithm that takes into account human motion constraints and generates plausible full body motion for the virtual agents and movement-based avatar-agent interactions. Third, we present an algorithm that simulates plausible gaze-based behaviors in avatar-agent interactions. Our approach relies on a Bayesian interpretation of the Theory of Mind concept to infer the user's intentions and generates an appropriate response for the virtual agents. Finally, we study the perception of motion rendered on virtual avatars and propose a novel data-driven approach to rapidly synthesize a photo-realistic virtual avatar that reflects the user's unique gait. We highlight the interactive performance of our algorithms in complex virtual environments with tens of virtual agents. We also conduct extensive user studies and show that the interactions generated using our proposed algorithms are perceived as more plausible, and that they have a greater impact on the user in immersive settings.","Narang, Sahil",0,,1463
4087,,"In real-world conversational groups, interactants adjust their body position and orientation relative to one another in order to see and hear clearly. We use an agent-based modelling approach to compare alternative models for simulating the spatial patterns of conversational groups. The models are based on simple rules that control the movement, positioning, and orientation behaviour of individual agents, which in turn leads to the emergence of agent clusters. We identify which model alternative produces agent clusters with characteristics typical of real-world conversational groups. The centroid-based approach, where agents readjust their position and orientation with respect to the group centroid point, is a commonly used method to simulate conversational groups, but has not been empirically validated. This thesis replicates, evaluates, and validates the centroid-based model in a systematic way. Another model, where agents perform positional-orientational readjustments to see as many neighbours as possible within a 180 field of view, called the field-of-view approach is proposed, implemented, evaluated, and validated. Analysis of the spatial patterns of conversational groups has hitherto mostly relied on visual verification. We, novelly, use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to analyse the spatial patterns of conversational groups. Evaluations show that the field of- view model and centroid-based model produce agent clusters with significantly different social, spatial, and temporal characteristics. Validation is performed using a dataset which captures the spatial behaviour of 21 participants for the entire duration of a party. This validation shows that the characteristics of agent clusters resulting from the field-of-view model most closely reflects the characteristics of real-world conversational groups. We also show that a local neighbourhood influence works better than an extended neighbourhood influence to simulate conversational groups. The influence of objects in the environment on the spatial patterns of agent clusters are also discussed.","Narasimhan, Kavin Preethi",0,,1464
4088,Effects of reputation communication expressiveness in virtual societies,"Agents interaction about reputation has to deal with semantic interoperability issues, which can be handled by different approaches using different levels of expressiveness. Previous experiments have already been conducted in order to investigate the effects of a more expressive communication language on agents' reputation evaluation accuracy, but their analyses disregard the possible correlations among reputation models' attributes. Here, we propose the use of a multivariate statistical approach in order to take into account such correlations and to encourage the social simulation community to analyze its experimental outputs using formal mathematical approaches. We also applied the presented approach to the experimental results previously analyzed using a univariate statistical approach. Our analysis corroborate with the latter showing that, in most cases, there is benefit in using a more expressive communication language.","Nardin, L. G.",0,10.1007/s10588-012-9151-9,1465

4094,,"Many teachers are inadequately prepared to teach math and science while addressing the cultural and linguistic needs of their increasing English Learner (EL) populations in mainstream classrooms (Duff, 2005). Additionally, many high poverty schools with a large population of ELs mandate scripted curricula which restrict teachers to adapt the curriculum so that they may teach to ELs’ funds of knowledge (FoK): bodies of knowledge and skills that are essential for individual survival (González et al, 2005). This study presents an additive approach on how a cohort of teachers learn to make-meaning and capitalize on ELs’ cultural and linguistic strengths, particularly math-science funds, as resources for learning. This participatory action research project adopts a case study method and collected data from weekly study group meetings, interviews, and classroom videos. Despite the teachers fear and resistance to conducting home visits, they explored ELs’ life-worlds through nontraditional activities, such as an ethnographic community walk, surveys, and extending in-class FoK discussions. Recognizing the importance of their ELs’ playground practices, prompted the teachers to work as agents of change to mobilize math-science funds for pedagogical action and advocate for a playground at their school while maintaining community support. Additionally, to mediate funds for math and science required the teachers to not be passive agents to scripted curricula, but adapters of it by becoming curriculum designers. The teachers expanded the curriculum from lesson planning a universal shared knowledge on playgrounds to leveraging ELs variations within and between their multiple funds. Importantly, a FoK discourse became the “language of power” since the teachers shifted to make communicating mathematically and scientifically accessible for their ELs to and through their funds. Furthermore, the teachers transformed ELs participation and content development by mediating FoK in conjunction with role shifts, higher order questions, tension, and third spaces. Finally, the teachers (re)conceptualized how they viewed math and science through ELs’ FoK. The significance of this study demonstrates the need to build bidirectional seamless boundaries between the in-school and ELs out-of-school practices so these students, like many of their mainstream peers, may learn from their familiar ways of knowing.","Nasir, Ambareen",0,,1467
4095,"Moral responsibility, conversation, and desert: comments on Michael McKenna's conversation and responsibility","In this paper, I engage with several of the intriguing theses Michael McKenna puts forward in his Conversation and Responsibility. For example, I examine McKenna's claim that the fact that an agent is morally responsible for an action and the fact that an agent is appropriately held responsible explain each other. I go on to argue that despite the importance of the ability to hold people responsible, an agent's being morally responsible for an action is explanatorily fundamental, and in this sense responsibility is response-independent. I then explore some of the specific aspects of McKenna's conversational theory before turning to his suggestion that the conversational nature of our responsibility practices gives us special kinds of reasons for accepting that agents are deserving of the harms of blame. Finally, I conclude by raising questions for his argument that the scope of blameworthy actions extends beyond that of impermissible actions.","Nelkin, D. K.",0,10.1007/s11098-013-0250-3,1468
4096,,"Impulsive behaviour is a well recognised feature in patients following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Despite the prevalence of these behaviours and their social and economic costs, there has been a lack of research on the construct of impulsivity and it is particularly sparse in the TBI literature. The objective of this study was to examine the validity of a new virtual reality task, the Secret Agent (SA) task, in measuring impulsivity in a group of participants with TBI. Individuals with TBI (n = 30) completed the SA task, along with the Iowa Gambling task and the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance and Sensation Seeking (UPPS) Impulsive Behaviour Scale. Correlational analyses were carried out between all the measures. A carer version of the UPPS Scale was also completed by a significant other. No significant correlations were found between the main impulsivity measures, however a number of medium effect size correlations with borderline significance were found between subscales of the UPPS Scale and the SA task. TBI individuals were compared to a community sample of age-matched controls on impulsivity. The TBI group ignored food during the SA task significantly more often than the control group. Explanations for these results are discussed, including the nature of the SA task and its suitability for a TBI population. There are indications from the data that the SA task could be a useful measure and further research is indicated.","Nellaney, Julie",0,,1469
4097,Paper Dragon Thieves,"Developments in the law are making the corporate form more opaque and allowing the agents who animate it to escape individual accountability for their actions. The law now provides protection for agents to engage in widespread frauds that inflict massive harm on the public. This Article challenges the academic orthodoxy that shareholder and director liability are enough to control agent behavior by developing a paper dragon analogy to focus on the importance of agents in corporate animation. Instead of hollow procedural shells, modern corporations should be understood as paper dragons in a parade costumes animated by agents who are the dancers under the fabric that make it move. We focus on the dragon costume itself to the exclusion of recognizing the presence and responsibility of those agents. Lack of agent accountability under the dragon costume encourages the patterns of fraud that caused the 2007-2008 financial crisis in which 45 percent of the world's wealth disappeared, and those patterns continue to be repeated. This Article reveals how making the corporate form more opaque has led to the destruction of corporate conspiracy charges for individuals and now the implosion of securities law as a method of disciplining agents. The Article concludes with a call for both watching the paper dragon and the need to track the dancers who move its feet.","Nelson, J. S.",0,,1470
4098,Spontaneous Facial Mimicry is Modulated by Joint Attention and Autistic Traits,"Joint attention (JA) and spontaneous facial mimicry (SFM) are fundamental processes in social interactions, and they are closely related to empathic abilities. When tested independently, both of these processes have been usually observed to be atypical in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, it is not known how these processes interact with each other in relation to autistic traits. This study addresses this question by testing the impact of JA on SFM of happy faces using a truly interactive paradigm. Sixty-two neurotypical participants engaged in gaze-based social interaction with an anthropomorphic, gaze-contingent virtual agent. The agent either established JA by initiating eye contact or looked away, before looking at an object and expressing happiness or disgust. Eye tracking was used to make the agent's gaze behavior and facial actions contingent to the participants' gaze. SFM of happy expressions was measured by Electromyography (EMG) recording over the Zygomaticus Major muscle. Results showed that JA augments SFM in individuals with low compared with high autistic traits. These findings are in line with reports of reduced impact of JA on action imitation in individuals with ASC. Moreover, they suggest that investigating atypical interactions between empathic processes, instead of testing these processes individually, might be crucial to understanding the nature of social deficits in autism.

4103,,"Aim/Purpose: The effective adoption of an ICT across every segment of the student population may occur where the design, implementation and supports recognize and adjust for variations in adoption practices across the student population and the situatedness of the promoted ICT adoption. The goal of this study was to demonstrate methods to explicate variations in perceptions and meanings associated with the adoption of a technology; facilitate the segmentation of the population based upon these variations and sociodemographic variables; constitute agents' practice, within a respective segment, based upon their behaviors and beliefs; and compare these agents' adoption of a specific technological practice relative to their adoption of the critical practice of effectively selecting and using technologies. Background: Students emerge into a world infused with ICT where the critical technological practice of effectively selecting and using ICT affects students' participation in a network society and information economy. Education policies and practices, regarding technology use for instruction and learning, often assume student populations are homogenous in their perceptions and practices concerning a given technology and do not account for how ""situatedness"" influences students' perceptions and experience with technology. Universities and faculty, while promoting an ICT, may unintentionally reproduce inequity when not attentive to the ways in which students, as socially situated actors, acquire or fail to acquire the practice of effectively adopting technological innovations. Methodology: This study was an instrumental case study of the phenomenon of ICT adoption, in this instance tablet technology for academic purposes, at a public university where over 30% of students in the study self-identified as the first generation university attending student within their household. This study utilized mixed methods to identify students' perceptions regarding this ICT, using a two-phase survey (phase 1 n = 652; phase 2 n = 440), and then explored students' experiences and associated meanings regarding this technology through the use of photo diary interviews (n = 11) and focus groups (n = 6,6,2). The survey items were based upon constructs found in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. These constructs include determinants and moderators for behavioral intention and use behavior for user adoption of a specific ICT. Contribution: This study contributed to research as follows: (1) ICT adoption from students' perspectives; (2) evidence for segments within populations based upon perceptions and meanings associated with ICT adoption; (3) evidence for how ""situatedness"" affects adoption; (4) a practice-oriented approach that distinguishes adoption of a specific technology relative to efficacious practice of selecting and using ICT; and (5) how promoting adoption of a specific technology, given effects of ""situatedness"" and variations in segments, may help or hinder the adoption of the critical practice of effectively selecting and using technology thereby affecting students' participation in modern society. This study points to ways to better understand and support segments of students based upon variations in ICT perceptions and practices, differences in ICT assemblages, and dissimilar ""situatedness."" This study advocates for a critical techno-pedagogy whereby students cultivate the practice of critically choosing and effectively using ICT thereby improving their agency within a digital society. Findings: The findings from this study included (1) variations among students in perceptions, meanings, and practices associated with the adoption of a specific technology; (2) segments of students, based upon sociodemographic variables, for whom there were similar perceptions, meanings, and practices; (3) ""situatedness"" affecting students' adoption of a given technology based upon students' available ICT assemblage, instructional context, settings of student work, and social and cultural contexts; and, finally, (4) technolo","Neufeld, Philip G.",0,,1472

In particular, text document clustering algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) give no guarantee that documents are clustered in a manner similar to human readers. Using a semi-supervised approach on text document clustering, we show that the selection of training data can be statistically optimized using LDA and LSA. Using this method, a human reader categorizes a percentage of the data as an analysis step, then feeds the partially-labeled data into bootstrap training and testing steps. Using mutual information to discover which documents were better for training, the algorithm does a post-processing step using the optimized training set. The results show that mutual information values are higher when the statistically optimized training set is used and indicate that human-like performance is better achieved with optimized training data.","Newbold, Cody",0,,1473
4106,,"The shoulder girdle plays an important role in the large pointing workspace that humans enjoy. The goal of this work was to characterize the human shoulder girdle motion in relation to the arm and recreate it with a humanoid shoulder girdle mechanism so as to ultimately improve the human-like motion of humanoids. The overall motion of the human shoulder girdle was characterized based on motion studies completed on test subjects during voluntary (natural/unforced) motion. The collected data from the experiments were used to develop surface fit equations that represent the position and orientation of the glenohumeral joint for a given humeral pointing direction. These equations completely quantify gross human shoulder motion relative to the humerus. The equations are presented along with goodness-of-fit results that indicate the equations well approximate the motion of the human glenohumeral joint. This is the first time the motion has been quantified for the entire workspace, and the equations provide a reference against which to compare the motion of candidate humanoid shoulder girdle mechanisms. A novel 2-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism composed of two platforms, one leg with two revolute joints and two legs with spherical-prismaticspherical joint combinations (1-RR, 2-SPS), is introduced and analyzed. The results from the data collection were used to find the optimal configuration for this mechanism to mimic human shoulder girdle motion. The results indicate that the optimized mechanism well approximates the motion of the human shoulder girdle, making it the first mechanism that replicates human shoulder girdle motion with minimal actuation. The methodology for incorporating the shoulder girdle mechanism into the shoulderelbow complex is presented. The kinematic equations of motion for the complex were derived, and a qualitative analysis was completed that indicates the motion of the full system is similar to that of the human shoulder-elbow complex. The work presented here lays the groundwork for replicating complex human shoulder girdle motion with a relatively simple robotic system.","Newkirk, Jeremy T.",0,,1474
4107,,"This multiple case study results from an ethnographic immersion in a local public high school, focusing on English language learners (ELLs) in content area classrooms. The primary goals were to 1) explore the language and literacy practices of ELLs within this setting, 2) gain an understanding of the complexity and multiplicity of the learners' schooling experiences, and 3) discuss implications pertaining to practice and research. Four focal students, each from a different country and each with different home or first languages, are discussed to provide a nuanced perspective of immigrant and refugee students. Importantly, the theoretical framework of ""hyphenated reality"" and interlanguage contributed to uncovering the ELLs' subterranean layers. The study was informed by qualitative research methodologies, including critical ethnography. Data collection namely included field observations in classrooms, interviews with students and teachers, and student work. Within-case and cross-case analysis was conducted through a general inductive analysis approach. Major findings include the need to view ELLs as theory constructors, who form sophisticated notions regarding second language acquisition and the linguistic features of the English language, given their unique position as learners of another language and their heightened metalinguistic awareness. ELLs also theorize schooling and act as rational agents within the structure of school. They enter school with a logical agenda and, according to their observations and experiences, adjust themselves and devise strategies for performing school. Finally, the concept of the micro-macro dialectic grew empirically from this study, thereby building upon existing scholarship. The micro-macro dialectic calls for intentionally juxtaposing a larger, contextual layer to understanding ELLs, such that their personal narratives become enriched by ""official"" facts and vice versa. This framework also complicates dichotomies that have been established to categorize students, academic fields, and pedagogical ideologies, such as the notion of ELLs compared to bilingual/multilingual learners. These supposedly irreconcilable differences exist in the academy and in theory but do not hold up in the hyphenated experiences of learners.","Ngo, Lan M.",0,,1475
4108,,"Through this project, I argue that constructions of children naturalize particular ideologies around creativity and innovation in contemporary digital culture. Also referred to as the net generation, cyberkids, and other similar terms, discussions of contemporary American youth often name them as a digital generation, one born into and shaped by ubiquitous computing technologies, mobile screens, and social media. Such articulations suggest that youth possess native facility with digital technologies and must also prepare to inhabit an increasingly digital world. I examine how images of children are used to articulate characteristics, expectations, and values of creativity through their coupling with the future in popular discourse and their treatment as inherently technological individuals holding the promise for future innovations. As this project shows, childhood operates as a contested site for negotiating the desired relationship between the individual and the social at stake in understandings of creativity, as children are framed as pre-social subjects undergoing processes of socialization and maturation into adults. Drawing from work in media and literary studies, cultural studies of youth, and critical and historical approaches to creativity, I close read key digital and non-digital media artifacts that define and circulate among the digital generation and those who must raise its members to explore how contemporary understandings of creativity, innovation, and youth evolved alongside the rise of digital and computing industries. In ""Minecraft and the Building Blocks of Creative Individuality,"" I explore the massive popularity and growing educational use of Minecraft —a construction video game where players iteratively gather resources and build to survive on virtual islands. I show how Minecraft as a digital game weaves together two dominant histories that define modern creativity closely with individual autonomy: construction toys and island narratives. By examining Minecraft within histories of construction toys and modern theories of creativity, I argue that Minecraft as a video game allows players to experiment with social and environmental conditions historically central to debates over shaping creative subjects, rooted in island narratives like Robinson Crusoe as the generic site for negotiating conflicts between individual autonomy and social dependence. In the second chapter, ""Make Magazine and the Social Reproduction of DIY Science and Technology,"" I analyze the contents of Make, an American parenting periodical devoted to raising creative children under the banner of DIY. Through its parenting advice, the magazine advocates privatizing scientific work through creating domestic amateur workshops to raise children to become entrepreneurial and innovative risk-takers. I argue that Make magazine deploys constructions of children as creative to naturalize risk-taking as integral to future innovations, as a response to tensions between risks and responsibility underlying DIY modes of science and technology. Opposed to preemptive regulation of DIY science by states and other authoritative agents, Make magazine advocates for raising children to become responsible and autonomous amateur scientists and innovators capable of self-governing their own risks.

4109,Role of imitation in the emergence of phonological systems,"The issue we address in this review paper is to what extent mutual adaptation plays a role in the emergence and evolution of phonological systems. Adaptation to the interlocutor has been shown to take many forms and to embrace all the levels of spoken language, from adjustments in vocal intensity to changes in word forms over the course of a conversational exchange, as well as lexical and syntactic alignment across speakers, to name but a few examples. Phonetic convergence, that is, the tendency for two speakers engaged in a conversational exchange to sound more like each other, is one important aspect of between-speaker adaptation. Empirical evidence has recently accumulated that shows that phonetic convergence is a recurrent phenomenon in mature speakers. This phenomenon relies on sensory-motor abilities that infants may already possess at birth. Phonetic convergence affects the way in which both speakers speak after their interaction has ended, and may build up over long periods of time. It may also be a driving mechanism in the acquisition of the phonology and phonetics of a second language. In this paper, (i) we outline the role of imitation in modern speech and language; (ii) we review the evidence provided by experimental and modeling studies for the potential role of imitation in the emergence and evolution of phonological systems; and (iii) we discuss how the resulting hypotheses could be tested in the framework provided by the multi-agent computational COSMO model.

4111,,"For decades, obesity has been a major public health problem in the US and has been one of the most predominant players in the increase of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) incidence. Obesity is thought to be the result of the interplay between individual and environmental factors which can occur early and throughout an individual’s life course. Despite major ongoing prevention efforts, obesity is still on the rise and this has warranted its description as a complex health problem calling for the use of systems science methods to disentangle such complexity. The overarching goal of this dissertation was to apply systems science and causal analytical approaches to study the life-course development of obesity and its effects on T2DM. Specifically, we developed an agent-based model of a cohort of children born in Los Angeles county—ViLA (i.e. Virtual Los Angeles Cohort) and followed from birth into adulthood in order (i) to forecast the incidence and trends of obesity and T2DM, (ii) to investigate the mechanisms through which childhood obesity affects T2DM and (iii) to evaluate the effectiveness of key health interventions on obesity and T2DM in ViLA. We used simulated data from 98,230 individuals in ViLA and observational data from 1054 children enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children and applied the g-computation algorithm to estimate causal quantities. Our results suggest that the incidence and prevalence of obesity and T2DM are generally high with notable racial disparities and will continue rising over time and with age at an alarming rate. Furthermore, much of the effect attributable to childhood obesity in the development of incident T2DM was due to pathways other than through adult obesity. Additionally, engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and eliminating fast-food consumption were the most effective interventions for preventing obesity and T2DM. For maximum effectiveness, interventions have to be implemented in combination with one another and virtually at every critical life stages throughout the life span. Agent-based simulation models could be used as virtual laboratories for integrating best existing evidence, gaining new insights, exploring new mechanisms and evaluating intervention effectiveness in obesity and diabetes research.","Nianogo, Roch Arnaud Kibsa",0,,1478
4112,,"What happens when people listen to music? What sorts of mental structures are formed? How do we make sense of a melody as its notes fly by in rapid succession? Can we model the experience of listening to music in real time? This dissertation describes the computer program Musicat, which was designed to explore these questions. Musicat is a model of real-time melody perception by people. The program “listens” to monophonic Western tonal melodies one note at a time (presented not as audio recordings, but rather in a symbolic form much like sheet music) and generates an internal representation of the musical structures it “hears”. These structures include groups of adjacent notes, meta-groups comprised of smaller groups, expectations for upcoming structures, and, most importantly, analogies between groups (and meta-groups) of various sizes. In the model, listening is not a passive process; instead, it is an active, dynamic process of creating mental structures. Thus when Musicat listens to a melody, I consider such an act to be creative, and I call it a “listening performance”. Musicat follows in the tradition of previous computer models of the Fluid Analogies Research Group: it is based on the architectures of Copycat, Tabletop, and related programs, with modifications made to accommodate music's temporal nature. In addition to giving a technical discussion of Musicat’s architecture, this dissertation includes copious examples of the program's listening performances on a variety of melodies ranging from simple children’s songs to more complex popular-song forms. A discussion of the results suggests that Musicat captures several previously unmodeled aspects of musical listening, such as analogy-making and hierarchical grouping in real time, but that much more work is needed to achieve humanlike listening performances on even the simplest of melodies.","Nichols, Eric Paul",0,,1479
4113,Unspoken Rules: Resolving Underdetermination With Closure Principles,"When people learn normative systems, they do so based on limited evidence. Many of the possible actions that are available to an agent have never been explicitly permitted or prohibited. But people will often need to figure out whether those unspecified actions are permitted or prohibited. How does a learner resolve this incompleteness? The learner might assume if an action-type is not expressly forbidden, then acts of that type are permitted. This closure principle is one of Liberty. Alternatively, the learner might assume that if an action-type is not expressly permitted, then acts of that type are prohibited. This closure principle would be one of Residual Prohibition (Mikhail, 2011). On the basis of principles of pedagogical sampling (e.g., Shafto, Goodman, & Griffiths, ), we predicted that participants would infer the Liberty Principle (LP) when trained on prohibitions, and they would infer the Residual Prohibition Principle when trained on permissions. This is exactly what we found across several experiments. We also found a bias in favor of Liberty insofar as participants trained on both a prohibition and a permission rule tended still to infer the LP. However, we also found that if an action is potentially harmful, this diminishes the tendency to infer the LP.","Nichols, S.",0,10.1111/cogs.12674,1480
4115,Digital Guidance for Susceptible Readers: Effects on Fifth Graders' Reading Motivation and Incidental Vocabulary Learning,"In this digital era, a fundamental challenge is to design digital reading materials in such a way that they improve children's reading skills. Since reading books is challenging for many fifth graders-particularly for those genetically susceptible to attention problems-the researchers hypothesized that guidance from a digital Pedagogical Agent (PA) could improve students' reading motivation and incidental vocabulary learning. Using a sample of 147 fifth-grade students, the researchers carried out a randomized control trial with three groups of students reading: (a) hardcopy (print) books, (b) digital books, and (c) digital books with a PA. For students with a genetic predisposition to attention problems, carriers of the DRD4 seven-repeat allele, the PA supported their incidental vocabulary learning. For noncarriers, there were no effects of the digital reading materials or the PA.","Nielen, T. M. J.",1,10.1177/0735633117708283,1481
4121,,"The operation of robotic tour guides in public museums leads to a variety of interactions of these complex technical systems with humans of all ages and with different technical backgrounds. Interacting with a robot is a new experience for many visitors. An intuitive user interface, preferable one that resembles the interaction between human tour guides and visitors, simplifies the communication between robot and visitors. To allow for supportive behavior of the guided persons, predictable robot behavior is necessary. Humanoid robots are able to resemble human motions and behaviors and look familiar to human users that have not interacted with robots so far. Hence, they are particularly well suited for this purpose. In this work, we present our anthropomorphic mobile communication robot Robotinho. It is equipped with an expressive communication head to display emotions. Its multimodal dialog system incorporates gestures, facial expression, body language, and speech. We describe the behaviors that we developed for interaction with inexperienced users in a museum tour guide scenario. In contrast to prior work, Robotinho communicated with the guided persons during navigation between exhibits, not only while explaining an exhibit. We report qualitative and quantitative results from evaluations of Robotinho in RoboCup@Home competitions and in a science museum.

4123,SAVING THE ROBOT OR THE HUMAN? ROBOTS WHO FEEL DESERVE MORAL CARE,"Robots are becoming an integral part of society, yet our moral stance toward these non-living objects is unclear. In two experiments, we investigated whether anthropomorphic appearance and anthropomorphic attributions modulated people's utilitarian decision making about robotic agents. In Study 1, participants were presented with moral dilemmas in which the to-be-sacrificed agent was either a human, a human-like robot, or a machine-like robot. These victims were described in either neutral or anthropomorphic priming stories. Study 2 teased apart anthropomorphic attributions of agency and affect. Results indicate that although robot-like robots were sacrificed significantly more often than humans and human-like robots, the effect of humanized priming was the same for all three agent types (Study 1), and this effect was mainly due to the attribution of affective states rather than agency (Study 2). That is, when people attribute affective states to robots, they are less likely to sacrifice them in order to save humans.","Nijssen, S. R. R.",0,10.1521/soco.2019.37.1.41,1483
4127,,"Taking risks and enjoying challenges are fundamental to the lives of young children from a developmental and evolutionary point of view. However, in modern societies, increasing concern about dangers and injuries has led to the escalation in regulation and provisions for the safety of young children. This intent to establish secure and risk-free environments for young children reaches, in some cases, the other end of the spectrum--that of overprotection, constraining children's drive to explore, dare and experiment. This article explores the relationship between children and risk by focusing on the processes of thinking and acting, drawing on positive and negative discourses around risk. The article proposes that more interest should be directed towards enabling children's own knowledge and understanding of risk, through early childhood education and risk literacy. The use of graphical representations, children's probabilistic and possibility thinking, the risk culture of the classroom and a cross-curricular approach are pedagogical implications that could inform policy and practice in early childhood education aiming at present and future agents who are risk literate.","Nikiforidou, Zoi",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1463949117731027,1484

4129,,"PURPOSE: This paper seeks to understand and explain how cyberspace can be an equalizer and empower persons with disabilities (PWD). FINDINGS: Using cyberspace, each of the PWD groups studied has found an alternative and additional stage for the ""presentation of the self in everyday life"" that overcomes stigma and manages impressions. Cases presented provide empirical evidence of PWD non-profit groups using social networking tools such as websites, blogs, Facebook and YouTube to manage social and professional relationships. Thus proving that cyberspace can facilitate agency through a virtual social identity that complements actual social identity. To empower persons with disabilities and open up new lifeworlds, this paper submits three levels of engagement in the offline world that complements the online interaction previously outlined. First is through participation that proves Erving Goffman's theory of ego alignment. The PWD must end isolation and be part of multi-agent action that may be in the form of education, training and any other form of human enterprise. Second is performance in both backstage (preparations) and front stage (actual work) area of operations. The goal of back and front stage performance is role fulfillment. Third is production, which is the intended byproduct of performance that can lead to empowerment. Good performance can lead to actor-audience consensus that is geared toward acceptance of the PWD, the presentation of himself and the work that he can accomplish. This can lead to encounters and subsequent production and reproduction of social structure and relationships, e.g. employer-employee relationships, donor-benefactor relations and eventually disability pride. ORIGINALITY / VALUE: This article argues cyberspace can serve as tool for impression management for the PWD groups. On the micro level, the case studies presented herein, serve to initiate the formal chronicling of the history of disability in the Philippines. It aims to contribute to oriental and developing world disability discourse that is predominantly western. On the macro level, it seeks to apply Goffman's theory of dramaturgy and social interaction in explaining the social behavior of PWD in cyberspace and its 'net effect' on the real world.

4130,,"This paper addresses the problem of autonomous generation of sensory systems of autonomous virtual characters. We believe, following the new trends of Artificial Intelligence, that the level of coherence required for natural behavior of a virtual character in complex worlds can only be achieved by a strong connection between its mind and the surrounding environment. Therefore, the characters' sensory system plays a fundamental role on that relationship. Vision is particularly important because it allows the agent to perceive its surroundings without the help of any external description. Thus, in order to evolve an artificial vision system for a virtual character, we devised a novel technique for genetically encoding artificial neural networks. Through our technique, we are able to obtain emergent functional controllers by structurally coupling the neural network to the environment. Two types of evolution were tested: an objective-guided evolution; and an environment-guided evolution, for which no descriptions of objectives are provided.

Rational choice models have been traditionally used to account for that behavior, but they face the puzzle of explaining levels of observed tax compliance which are much higher than expected. Several social influence mechanisms have been proposed in order to tackle this problem. In this article, we discuss the interdisciplinary literature on this topic, and we claim that agent-based models are a promising tool in order to test theories and hypothesise in this field. To illustrate that claim, we present SIMULFIS, an agent-based model for the simulation of tax compliance that allows to combine rational choice with social influence mechanisms in order to generate aggregated patterns of tax behavior. We present and discuss the results of a simple virtual experiment in order to show the potentialities of the model.","Noguera, J. A.",0,,1488

Assuming that such further interaction will fuel developmental research, we developed a psychological scale for measuring rapport called the Rapport-Expectation with a Robot Scale (RERS). From a controlled experiment where human participants interacted with a robot with/without behaviors based on relational strategies, our validation process found the following: (1) our RERS scale had sufficient internal consistency; (2) the robot behaviors, which were based on relational strategies, increased the participants' RERS scores; and (3) participants who treated the robot as a human-like conversation partner had higher RERS scores than those who did not.","Nomura, T.",0,10.1007/s12369-015-0293-z,1489

They verbally abused the robot, repeatedly obstructed its path, and sometimes even kicked and punched the robot. To investigate the reasons for the abuse, we conducted a field study in which we interviewed visiting children who exhibited serious abusive behaviors, including physical contact. We analyzed interview contents to determine whether the children perceived the robot as human-like, why they abused it, and whether they thought that the robot would suffer from their abusive behavior. We obtained valid interviews from 23 children (age range, 5-9 years old) over 13 days of observations. We found that 1) the majority of the children engaged in abuse because they were curious about the robot's reactions or enjoyed abusing it and considered it human-like, and 2) about half of them believed the robot was capable of perceiving their abusive behaviors.","Nomura, T.",0,10.1075/is.17.3.02nom,1490

The difficult nature of finding objects regardless of pose and occlusions requires a large number of compute resources. Recent advancements in technology have made great strides towards solving this problem, and in particular, deep learning has revolutionized this field in the last few years. The classification of large datasets, such as the popular ImageNet dataset, requires a network with millions of weights. Learning each of these weights using back propagation requires a compute intensive training phase with many training samples. Recent compute technology has proven adept at classifying 1000 classes, but it is not clear if computers will be able to differentiate and classify the more than 40,000 classes humans are capable of doing. The goal of this thesis is to train computers to attain human-like performance on large-class datasets. Specifically, we introduce two types of hierarchical architectures: Late Fusion and Early Fusion. These architectures will be used to classify datasets with up to 1000 objects, while simultaneously reducing both the number of computations and training time. These hierarchical architectures maintain discriminative relationships amongst networks within each layer as well as an abstract relationship from one layer to the next. The resulting framework reduces the individual network sizes, and thus the total number of parameters that need to be learned. The smaller number of parameters results in decreased training time.","Nooka, Sai Prasad",0,,1491

Goal-Oriented Conversational agents (GO-CAs) are programs that interact with humans to serve a specific domain of interest; its’ importance has increased recently and covered fields of technology, sciences and marketing. There are several types of CAs used in the industry, some of them are simple with limited usage, others are sophisticated. Generally, most CAs were to serve the English language speakers, a few were built for the Arabic language, this is due to the complexity of the Arabic language, lack of researchers in both linguistic and computing. This thesis covered two types of GO-CAs. The first is the traditional pattern matching goal oriented CA (PMGO-CA), and the other is the semantic goal oriented CA (SGO-CA). Pattern matching conversational agents (PMGO-CA) techniques are widely used in industry due to their flexibility and high performance. However, they are labour intensive, difficult to maintain or update, and need continuous housekeeping to manage users’ utterances (especially when instructions or knowledge changes). In addition to that they lack for any machine intelligence. Semantic conversational agents (SGO-CA) techniques utilises humanly constructed knowledge bases such as WordNet to measure word and sentence similarity. Such measurement witnessed many researches for the English language, and very little for the Arabic language. In this thesis, the researcher developed a novelty of a new methodology for the Arabic conversational agents (using both Pattern Matching and Semantic CAs), starting from scripting, knowledge engineering, architecture, implementation and evaluation. New tools to measure the word and sentence similarity were also constructed. To test performance of those CAs, a domain representing the Iraqi passport services was built. Both CAs were evaluated and tested by domain experts using special evaluation metrics. The evaluation showed very promising results, and the viability of the system for real life.","Noori, Zaid Izzadin Mohammed",0,,1492
4147,,"The first paper is an analysis of the role reputation plays in the Deep Web using data from the Internet black market site, The Silk Road. This encrypted online marketplace employed crypto currency and functioned over the Tor network. Utilizing a modeling technique, informed by trade auction theory, we investigate the effect of seller reputation. Analysis of the seller’s reputation gives us insights into the factors that determine the prices of goods and services in this black marketplace. Data on cannabis listings is parsed from the Silk Road website and covers an 11-month time period, from November 2013 to October 2014. This data demonstrates that reputation acts as a sufficient self-enforcement mechanism to allow transactions. These findings exemplify the robustness of spontaneous order with respect to the Deep Web as an emergent marketplace. The second paper examines how the platform providers in the Internet Black Market, one of the world’s largest international markets for illicit goods and services, allow buyers and sellers to overcome the problems anonymity poses to exchange. These online markets enable users to repeatedly exchange in an environment with no third party enforcement while keeping their identify concealed from law enforcement. The third paper analyzes the determinants of network structure, as measured by hierarchy and monopolization, by examining various black market networks. We examine structures of networks in the Internet Dark Net (virtual) and compare it to network structures of traditional black markets (ground), using agent-based modeling. The purpose of modeling these two different types of illicit markets is to understand the network structure that emerges from the interactions of the agents in each environment. Traditional black markets are relatively hierarchical, with high degree and high betweenness. We compare the density and average length of shortest path of the simulated ground black market networks with our simulated virtual network.  We find that hierarchy and monopolization tendencies in networks are products of differences in transaction costs and information asymmetries. The Internet is an effective way to lower both of these aspects of network structure.

4151,"Suspicion of money laundering reporting obligations: Auditor compliance, or sceptical failure to engage?","Money laundering has become of increasing concern to law makers in recent years, principally because of its associations with terrorism. Recent legislative changes in the United Kingdom mean that auditors risk becoming state law enforcement agents in the private sector. We examine this legislation from the perspective of the changing nature of the relationship between auditors and the state, and the surveillant assemblage within which this is located. Auditors are statutorily obliged to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) into an online database, ELMER, but without much guidance regarding how suspicion is determined. Criminal rather than civil or regulatory sanctions apply to auditors' instances of non-compliance. This paper evaluates the surveillance implications of the legislation for auditors through lenses developed in the accounting and sociological literature by Brivot and Gendron, Neu and Heincke, Deleuze and Guattari, and Haggerty and Ericson. It finds that auditors are generating information flows which are subsequently reassembled into discrete and virtual 'data doubles' to be captured and utilised by authorised third parties for unknown purposes. The paper proposes that the surveillant assemblage has extended into the space of the auditor-client relationship, but this extension remains inhibited as a result of auditors' relatively weak level of engagement in providing SARs, thereby pointing to a degree of resistance in professional service firms regarding the deployment of regulation that compromises the foundations of this relationship.

These agents are applied to contingency bases in an object oriented approach utilizing Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) processes and tools to accomplish these goals. Contingency bases provide the tools and resources for the military to perform missions effectively. There has been increasing interest in improving the sustainability and resilience of the camps, as inefficiencies in resource usage increases. The increase in resource usage leads to additional operational costs and added danger to military personnel guarding supply caravans. The MBSE approach alleviates some of the complexity of constructing a model of a contingency base, and allows for the introduction of 3 rd party analysis tools through the XML metadata interchange standard. This approach is used to create a virtual environment for the agents to learn the system patterns and behaviors within the system. An agent based approach is used to address the dynamic nature of base camp operations and resource utilization. , helping with extensibility and scalability issues since larger camps have a very high computation load. To train the agents to adjust to base camp operations, an evolutionary algorithm was created to develop the control mechanism. This allows for a faster time to convergence for the control mechanisms when a change is observed. Results have shown a decrease in resource consumption of up to 20% with respect to fuel usage, which will further help reduce base costs and risk.","Nottage, Dustin Scott",0,,1496

We explored children's experiences of citizenship in school approaching citizenship as a set of habits that prescribe what is considered 'legitimate' in the public sphere. We focused on structures and agents inside and outside the school classroom and the way they may interfere with pedagogical practices and relationships. This work reveals a vicious circle of asymmetrical relationships and hierarchical structures between the society and the school that entrap teachers in assessment-oriented pedagogical practices. We argue that the emergent loyalty of the educational system to traditional pedagogical approaches premised on competition fosters pupils' incomprehension of the importance of social solidarity. It also contributes to their withdrawal from the public sphere, undermining the transformative potential of education. With the use of a diverse sample, we highlight the shortcomings of the integrated curriculum introduced in 2001, in successfully promoting critical thinking and participatory learner-centred pedagogy, and we discuss the implications for the transformative potential of education arising from the adherence to the implementation of European education policy that is discerned in the text of the newly introduced Curriculum of the 'New School'.","Noula, I.",0,10.1080/00071005.2017.1314446,1497

4159,,"In the emerging world of human-robot interaction, social robotics has become ever more important. Social robotics is a fundamental area in such domains as healthcare and medical robotics, consumer robotics or service robotics. Social robots working among humans should be able to communicate naturally with people using not only verbal but also non-verbal signals. Some cues of non-verbal body language, associated with affect and emotions, have an evolutionary root in humans that allows them to signal their unobservable internal state and intentions to others around them. An ability to interpret an internal state and intentions of team-members or counterparts is important not only in human-human but also in human-robot teams. One possible way to contribute to understandability is for robots to make their otherwise unobservable internal state interpretable to people through the use of emotionally expressive body language. This makes robots more predictable, acceptable and likeable, thus, in the end, having a potential to make them more effective team-players. This thesis addresses the problem of enabling humans to better understand machines by examining the role of artificial emotions synthesized and expressed by robots in the process of human-robot interaction. In our first study, we probe whether it is possible to signal a wanted emotional meaning through bodily expressions of a non-humanoid robot. The results provide strong support for the potential utility of bodily expressions in robots for communicating emotional meaning to people. A set of design parameters was developed from an analysis of research on non-verbal expression of emotion in the animal world. In the next two studies, we explore how this set of design parameters impacts how people perceive the emotional meaning of a robot expression, and investigate the nature and dynamics of peoples' perception of emotion expressed in a robot through its bodily movements. The results provide the basis for a mapping between the different design parameters of a robot's bodily expression and emotional interpretations. In addition, the results of the study show that people perceive emotionally expressive robots as more anthropomorphic, more animate, more likeable, more responsible and even more intelligent. In two next studies we investigate two major factors that may have influence on the perception of robot emotions. In one study, we investigate how the particular situational context in which expressions are used by the robot influences how they are perceived and interpreted by people. Another major factor to investigate is how the morphology of a robot performing emotional expressions influences how these expressions are interpreted and whether people are consistent in the emotional meaning they perceive. Finally, having a coherent design scheme to produce meaningful emotional expressions through robot body movements, we investigate in our last study the impact of such expressions on people's attitudes towards a robot. The results of the work provide evidence of the impact of the robot's emotional expressiveness on the perception of their anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability and intelligence. Results of our work are discussed in terms of the utility of expressive behaviour for facilitating human understanding of robot intentions and the directions for the future development in the design of cues for emotionally expressive robot behaviour.","Novikova, Jekaterina",0,,1499

In this paper, we review the development, key research findings, and systems that have evolved from AutoTutor. First, the rationale for developing AutoTutor is outlined and the advantages of natural language tutoring are presented. Next, we review three central themes in AutoTutor's development: human-inspired tutoring strategies, pedagogical agents, and technologies that support natural-language tutoring. Research on early versions of AutoTutor documented the impact on deep learning by co-constructed explanations, feedback, conversational scaffolding, and subject matter content. Systems that evolved from AutoTutor added additional components that have been evaluated with respect to learning and motivation. The latter findings include the effectiveness of deep reasoning questions for tutoring multiple domains, of adapting to the affect of low-knowledge learners, of content over surface features such as voices and persona of animated agents, and of alternative tutoring strategies such as collaborative lecturing and vicarious tutoring demonstrations.

4168,,"Background: This study investigated learning outcomes and user perceptions from interactions with a hybrid intelligent tutoring system created by combining the AutoTutor conversational tutoring system with the Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) adaptive learning system for mathematics. This hybrid intelligent tutoring system (ITS) uses a service-oriented architecture to combine these two web-based systems. Self-explanation tutoring dialogs were used to talk students through step-by-step worked examples to algebra problems. These worked examples presented an isomorphic problem to the preceding algebra problem that the student could not solve in the adaptive learning system. Results: Due to crossover issues between conditions, experimental versus control condition assignment did not show significant differences in learning gains. However, strong dose-dependent learning gains were observed that could not be otherwise explained by either initial mastery or time-on-task. User perceptions of the dialog-based tutoring were mixed, and survey results indicate that this may be due to the pacing of dialog-based tutoring using voice, students judging the agents based on their own performance (i.e., the quality of their answers to agent questions), and the students' expectations about mathematics pedagogy (i.e., expecting to solving problems rather than talking about concepts). Across all users, learning was most strongly influenced by time spent studying, which correlated with students' self-reported tendencies toward effort avoidance, effective study habits, and beliefs about their ability to improve in mathematics with effort. Conclusions: Integrating multiple adaptive tutoring systems with complementary strengths shows some potential to improve learning. However, managing learner expectations during transitions between systems remains an open research area. Finally, while personalized adaptation can improve learning efficiency, effort and time-on-task for learning remains a dominant factor that must be considered by interventions.","Nye, Benjamin D.",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40594-018-0109-4,1503
4174,Social Learning and Adoption of New Behavior in a Virtual Agent Society,"Social learning and adoption of new behavior govern the rise of a variety of behaviors: from actions as mundane as dance steps to those as dangerous as new ways to make IED detonators. However, agents in immersive virtual environments lack the ability to realistically simulate the spread of new behavior. To address this gap, a cognitive model was designed that represents the well-known socio-cognitive factors of attention, social influence, and motivation that influence learning and the adoption of a new behavior. To explore the effectiveness of this model, simulations modeled the spread of two competing memes in Hamariyah, an archetypal Iraqi village developed for cross-cultural training. Diffusion and clustering analyses were used to examine adoption patterns in these simulations. Agents produced well-defined clusters of early versus late adoption based on their social influences, personality, and contextual factors, such as employment status. These findings indicate that the spread of behavior can be simulated plausibly in a virtual agent society and has the potential to increase the realism of immersive virtual environments.","Nye, B.

The results of the experience, including both real doctors and naive participants, reveal a significant impact of the environment display on the perception of the user (sense of presence, sense of co-presence, perception of the believability of the virtual patient), showing, moreover, the different perceptions of the participants depending on their level of expertise.","Ochs, M.",0,10.1007/s12193-018-0289-8,1507

4204,,"Digital technologies are prevalent in society and K-12 classrooms today and the belief that educational technology can be a transformative agent of change in education is ever increasing. However, the use of technology as a transformative learning tool for all students has not yet been realized. Research in this area indicates that teachers are the leading factor impacting the utilization of technology for learning. Focused professional development along with time to develop curriculum and lessons has been identified as critical factors in changing the way teachers and students utilize technology.The purpose of this explanatory single case study, with multiple units of analysis, was to examine the experiences and practices of nine teachers in a technology-rich high school setting to better understand the impact of a TPACK based professional development model, to understand how and why teachers make decisions regarding instructional technology integration, and to determine how their technology integration met the TPACK model of instruction.Findings from the study revealed that the professional development model based on TPACK framework and effective professional development strategies increased teachers' use of technology, how they considered using technology and changed their instructional focus from teacher to student-centered practices. Additionally, teachers' considerations for instructional technology during planning were influenced by their teacher-centered or student-centered ideas. Finally, teachers who successfully implemented technology based on the Technology Integration Observation Instrument were those who were well versed in active learning strategies, learner-centered in their planning and implementation of instructional strategies have the greatest number of years of experience and exposure to the TPACK training model, while having varying levels of technology efficacy.The study provided evidence to support the idea that transformational educational change through technology has little to do with the technology itself; instead, it is dependent on the pedagogical knowledge of the teacher and the context of the professional development provided to teachers. It is increasingly evident that the change sought in teaching and learning will only come about by a change in the pedagogical the practice of teachers who are appropriately prepared with student-centered learning activities and content knowledge that utilizes technology as an instructional tool to facilitate and impact learning.","Odajima, Rebecca",0,,1509

In particular, technology-based tools in the form of simulations and virtual environments support learning using mathematical models and computational methods. The purpose of this research is to: (a) measure the value added in conveying Thermodynamics of materials concepts with a blended learning environment using computational simulation tools with lectures; and (b) characterize students' use of representational forms to convey their conceptual understanding of core concepts within a learning environment that blended Gibbs computational resource and traditional lectures. A mix-method approach was implemented that included the use of statistical analysis to compare student test performance as a result of interacting with Gibbs tool and the use of Grounded Theory inductive analysis to explore students' use of representational forms to express their understanding of thermodynamics of material concepts. Results for the quantitative study revealed positive gains in students' conceptual understanding before and after interacting with Gibbs tool for the majority of the concepts tested. In addition, insight gained from the qualitative analysis helped provide understanding about how students utilized representational forms in communicating their understanding of thermodynamics of material concepts. Knowledge of how novice students construct meaning in this context will provide insight for engineering education instructors and researchers in understanding students' learning processes in the context of educational environments that integrate expert simulation tools as part of their instructional resources for foundational domain knowledge.","Ogunwuyi, Oluwatosin",0,,1510
4206,,"This dissertation addresses the problem of militant infiltrations and militant attacks against border security outposts along the Turkish-Iraqi border. Attacks on border outposts have caused hundreds of soldier casualties in the past two decades. In the mountainous terrain, timely detection and interception of militants is difficult. Current locations of border security outposts make them vulnerable to militant fire from higher ground. Potential policy options to prevent infiltrations and reduce soldier casualties include moving the outposts to less vulnerable locations, increasing the number of soldiers, using unattended ground sensors along the border and using foreign border guards for early detection of militants. An agent-based simulation model of militants, soldiers, sensors and foreign border guards is developed in order to evaluate these policy alternatives. The simulation model allows the agents to interact inside a virtual representation of a 9.3 km by 7 km segment of the Turkish-Iraqi border. A Java based simulation tool was developed to implement the model. A genetic algorithm was used to find the outpost locations that minimize soldier casualties. Each policy option was tested against replications of two types of militant missions. The first one is the infiltration mission in which militants avoid all known soldier locations and try to reach behind the outposts. The second is an attack mission in which militants approach the target outpost by minimizing their risk of detection and inflict as many casualties as possible. The percentage of infiltration attempts from militant infiltration missions and soldier casualties in outposts from militant attack missions are collected to compare the benefits from policy options. The cost of implementing each policy option is then used to make an incremental cost-benefit comparison. Results suggest that increasing the number of soldiers per outpost by 40 and using unattended ground sensors is the preferable policy option due to the relatively low cost, the increase in probability of militant interdiction, and reduction in soldier outpost casualties. If the cost of constructing foreign border outposts and training are met by Iraq, cross border cooperation is the better policy option.","Oguz, Mustafa",0,,1511
4207,Supporting Negotiation Behavior with Haptics-Enabled Human-Computer Interfaces,"An active research goal for human-computer interaction is to allow humans to communicate with computers in an intuitive and natural fashion, especially in real-life interaction scenarios. One approach that has been advocated to achieve this has been to build computer systems with human-like qualities and capabilities. In this paper, we present insight on how human-computer interaction can be enriched by employing the computers with behavioral patterns that naturally appear in human-human negotiation scenarios. For this purpose, we introduce a two-party negotiation game specifically built for studying the effectiveness of haptic and audio-visual cues in conveying negotiation related behaviors. The game is centered around a real-time continuous two-party negotiation scenario based on the existing game-theory and negotiation literature. During the game, humans are confronted with a computer opponent, which can display different behaviors, such as concession, competition, and negotiation. Through a user study, we show that the behaviors that are associated with human negotiation can be incorporated into human-computer interaction, and the addition of haptic cues provides a statistically significant increase in the human-recognition accuracy of machine-displayed behaviors. In addition to aspects of conveying these negotiation-related behaviors, we also focus on and report game-theoretical aspects of the overall interaction experience. In particular, we show that, as reported in the game-theory literature, certain negotiation strategies such as tit-for-tat may generate maximum combined utility for the negotiating parties, providing an excellent balance between the energy spent by the user and the combined utility of the negotiating parties.","Oguz, S.

4211,The Effects of Immersion and Real-World Distractions on Virtual Social Interactions,"This study explores the independent and joint effects of immersion and real-world distractions (a ringing cell phone) on cognitive (i.e., recognition and recall), affective valence, and interpersonal outcomes (i.e., interpersonal liking and communication satisfaction) as well as general feelings of presence (social presence and telepresence) during a virtual experience. Participants interacted with a virtual agent in an immersive virtual environment or nonimmersive virtual environment under three different levels of real-world distractions (i.e., no distraction, passively being exposed to the sound of a ringing cell phone, and actively responding to ringing cell phone). Increased immersion had a positive effect on telepresence, but a negative effect on recognition and recall; immersion did not have a significant effect on social presence. Real-world distractions had a negative effect on recognition, recall, and social presence, but did not affect telepresence or affective valence. Participants who were actively distracted performed more poorly on the recall measure and reported lower levels of social presence than their passively distracted counterparts. These findings suggest that (a) increased immersion will not uniformly improve social virtual reality experiences and (b) more research is needed on whether and how real-world events should be integrated into virtual environments.","Oh, C.",1,10.1089/cyber.2018.0404,1513
4214,,"This article discuses the haptic dimensions of human-robot interaction. Human manipulation, exploration, guidance, and interaction are all facilitated by haptics – the sense of touch. In the haptics research community, we strive to enable such activities in autonomous robots; there is a long history of research seeking to enable autonomous robots to sense, perceive, and reason using touch. Similarly, humans performing actions in virtual and augmented reality desire the enhanced realism provided by haptic feedback, especially when learning physical tasks that will later be performed in the real world. When humans control remote robots to do their bidding, haptics contributes to a sense of telepresence for the human operator and enables performance of physical tasks remote in distance or scale that are not yet feasible with autonomous robots. Compared to these traditional areas of haptics research, there is relatively little attention paid in the haptics research community to the kinds of scenarios most commonly associated with human-robot interaction: a human and robot, each a separate agent, seeking to collaborate with, learn from, or assist the other.

4215,An embodied virtual agent platform for emotional Stroop effect experiments: A proof of concept,"The need for experimentation of facial expression recognition in a more ecological manner necessitates the use of multimodal, interactive experimental stimuli. At the same time, the prerequisite of reproducibility of results and controlled conditions is still mandatory. An embodied conversational agent (ECA) is a pertinent framework that meets all these requirements. The VIB (Virtual Interactive Behavior) Platform is a SAIBA compliant system which supports the real-time generation of multimodal behavior for interacting with socio-emotional virtual agents. We created a new feature for this platform, namely VIB-Ex, which can be used for presenting real-time facial expressions and recording the user's reaction time and interaction while exporting data for statistical purposes. In this paper, we present our proof of concept study in which a 3D male virtual character has been used to convey joyful or sad facial expressions. At the same time, the same character pronounced joyful or sad words in congruence or incongruence with its facial expression in order to trigger an emotional Stroop effect. Only 12 adults were sufficient in order to obtain an emotional Stroop effect within our virtual agent. The results of this study confirmed that the VIB-Ex platform can replicate a robust effect of psychological phenomena concerning recognition of facial expressions. VIB-Ex proves itself to be a suitable and a pertinent tool to perform experiments on a human's automatic process of facial expression recognition. Finally, we discuss the possible future research topics with VIB-Ex to carry out other type of experiments in the field of social cognition.","Oker, A.",1,10.1016/j.bica.2018.04.011,1515
4219,How and why affective and reactive virtual agents will bring new insights on social cognitive disorders in schizophrenia? An illustration with a virtual card game paradigm,"In recent decades, many studies have shown that schizophrenia is associated with severe social cognitive impairments affecting key components, such as the recognition of emotions, theory of mind, attributional style, and metacognition. Most studies investigated each construct separately, precluding analysis of the interactive and immersive nature of real-life situation. Specialized batteries of tests are under investigation to assess social cognition, which is thought now as a link between neurocognitive disorders and impaired functioning. However, this link accounts for a limited part of the variance of real-life functioning. To fill this gap, advances in virtual reality and affective computing have made it possible to carry out experimental investigations of naturalistic social cognition, in controlled conditions, with good reproducibility. This approach is illustrated with the description of a new paradigm based on an original virtual card game in which subjects interpret emotional displays from a female virtual agent, and decipher her helping intentions. Independent variables concerning emotional expression in terms of valence and intensity were manipulated. We show how several useful dependant variables, ranging from classic experimental psychology data to metacognition or subjective experiences records, may be extracted from a single experiment. Methodological issues about the immersion into a simulated intersubjective situation are considered.The example of this new flexible experimental setting, with regards to the many constructs recognized in social neurosciences, constitutes a rationale for focusing on this potential intermediate link between standardized tests and real-life functioning, and also for using it as an innovative media for cognitive remediation.","Oker, A.",0,10.3389/fnhum.2015.00133,1516

4230,,"Synchronized multi-agent systems can perform complex tasks often with precision more than what humans can achieve. In teleoperation, brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, preciseness in motion of the various coordinated axes of the robot is key for successful execution of tasks. However, uncertainties, disturbances, unknown environment and nonlinearities such as communication delay remain major issues and the solution to these problems is open. For human-in-loop systems like telesurgery, the additional delay from human reaction time apart from communication signal delay needs to be considered for effective control design of such time delay systems. Additionally, teleoperated robots are mostly battery-powered and, therefore, energy consumption rate in relation to the work done is critical. It is, therefore, imperative to design control systems considering some performance index. In this research, a new method is presented to synchronize n-agents optimally considering a performance index. This provides an analytical way to optimally address the multi-agent synchronization problem. In other words, the method aims not just looking at stabilizing our system but considering cost to achieve that goal. Another issue is, to design control for our systems, the system is typically modeled from first principles of physics, using appropriate assumptions and simplifications. The final model, therefore, may not adequately capture the true physical system. There are also issues of environmental changes, changes in system dynamics, structural damages to the system. These are usually not considered in general control systems design. Consequently, it is important to design controls that can address these uncertain changes to ensure stable, secure and smooth operation under all conditions. Sensors read actuation information and send feedback signals to controllers for correction. Sensor reaction time and network communication introduce communication delay in the controlled system. Communication delay has a detrimental effect on the performance of controlled systems degrading performance, and even resulting in instabilities. Time delay term results in an infinite number of roots of the characteristic equation making it difficult to check stability and design stabilizing controller. The research presents a method of designing controllers considering communication delay. First, an optimal synchronization controller is designed using Linear Quadratic Regulation. Modeling and simulations are done in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments are performed to validate the results. The typical optimal controller successfully stabilizes but shows large tracking error, a PID-controller is therefore integrated in the optimal synchronization controller to reduce the error significantly. Secondly, synchronized model reference adaptive controller is also designed and simulated through MATLAB/Simulink and validated with an experiment. External load disturbance is introduced through eccentric loading of one agent and the adaptive performance is evaluated. Thirdly, effects of communication delay on Internet-based teleoperation of carts using UDP protocol is investigated with two quanser cart systems and a suitable controller designed with MATLAB/Simulink is used to simulate the controller and validated with an experiment through the quanser cart systems. Lastly, a control design investigating the effects of communication delay on systems with brain-computer-interface (BCI) or human-in-loop is conducted using the WIDOWX arm robot from Trossenrobotics. Robot Operating Systems (ROS), an open source software working on Ubuntu, a linux-based operating system is used for this research.

4231,The power of human gaze on infant learning,"Social learning enables infants to acquire information, especially through communication. However, it is unknown whether humans are the prime source of information for infant learning. Here we report that humans have a powerful influence on infants' object learning compared with nonhuman agents (robots). Twelve-month-old infants were shown videos in which a human or a robot gazed at an object. The results demonstrated that the infants followed the gaze direction of both agents, but only human gaze facilitated their object learning: Infants showed enhanced processing of, and preferences for, the target object gazed at by the human but not by the robot. Importantly, an extended fixation on a target object without the orientation of human gaze did not produce these effects. Together, these findings show the importance of humanness in the gazer, suggesting that infants may be predisposed to treat humans as privileged sources of information for learning.

This paper integrates research and theory on stereotype contents and mind perception to explore how stereotypes of competence and warmth are linked to perceptions of moral agency and patiency. Competence identifies the moral agent, and warmth both identifies the moral patient and describes the moral valence of the interaction. In two experimental tests, a simple animated film showing circles and squares interacting in various ways elicited predicted competence and warmth stereotypes that tracked perceived moral valence. Integrating stereotype contents and mind perception literatures offers new ways to think about the origins, functions, and dynamics between dimensions of stereotype content.","Oldmeadow, J.

4237,"Death Discussion in Science Read-Alouds: Cognitive, Sociolinguistic, and Moral Processes","Little research has been conducted on how to address the complex topic of death when teaching science to children. The present paper addresses this issue by examining how three elementary teachers discuss the death of wild animals during science read-aloud sessions. Our findings reveal the variety of ways in which nonhuman death can be cognitively, sociolinguistically and morally organized in such contexts. In terms of cognition, animal death was conceptualized metaphorically in terms of linear or cyclic motion (SOURCE-PATH-GOAL and CYCLE image schemas). Sociolinguistically, animal death was sometimes approached as the product of an agent's action (e.g., a predator) and at other times as an agentless outcome (e.g., a biological event that simply befell upon living creatures). Lastly, natural death was presented as morally good (i.e., acceptable biological outcomes of life in the wild), whereas pollution-related death was organized as unnatural and morally bad (i.e., unacceptable loss of natural life whose occurrence students should critically question). This study highlights the centrality of metaphorical structuring to nonhuman death discussions in the science read-alouds investigated and the possible pedagogical implications of favoring the approaches described.

4241,,"Despite growing interest in helping students become agents of environmental change who can, through informed decision-making and action-taking, transform environmentally detrimental forms of human activity, science educators have reduced agency to rationality by overlooking sociocultural influences such as norms and values. We tackle this issue by examining how elementary teachers and students negotiate and attribute responsibility, credit, or blame for environmental events during three environmental read-alouds. Our verbal analysis and visual representation of meta-agentive discourse revealed varied patterns of agential attribution. First, humans were simultaneously attributed negative agentive roles (agents of endangerment and imbalance) and positive agentive roles (agents of prevention, mitigation, and balance). Second, while wolves at Yellowstone were constructed as intentional (human-like) agents when they crossed over into the human world to kill livestock in nearby farms, polar bears in the Arctic were denied any form of agential responsibility when they approached people's homes. Third, anthropogenic causation of global warming was constructed as distal and indirect chains of cause and effect (i.e., sophisticated sequences of ripple effects), whereas its mitigation and prevention assumed the form of simple and unidirectional causative links (direct and proximal causality). Fourth, the notion of ""balance of nature"" was repeatedly used as a justification for environmental conservation but its cause and dynamic nature remained unclear. And, fifth, while one teacher promoted environmental agency by encouraging students to experience positive emotions such as love of nature, freedom, and oneness with nature, the other teachers encouraged students to experience negative emotions such as self-blame and guilt. This study's main significance is that it highlights the need for environmental educators who set out to promote environmental agency to expand the focus of their instructional efforts beyond rational argumentation and reasoning. It also underscores the importance of increasing school teachers' awareness of implicit discursive messages in particular patterns of environmental agency attribution when discussing environmental issues with students and implementing pedagogical strategies centered on oral deliberation such as read-alouds.","Oliveira, Alandeom W.",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11422-013-9531-6,1522

I analyze the phenomenology of the uncanny feeling, which is largely understudied despite being the dependent variable in empirical studies. Next, I introduce a social functionalist account to the uncanny valley research. I propose that the uncanny feeling is a social response triggered by the perception that something is ambiguously wrong with the ""humanness"" of the human-like stimuli, and therefore needs to be avoided. By doing so, the uncanny feeling functions as a ""wrong outside, wrong inside"" heuristic with central moral connotations. I conclude that rethinking the uncanny feeling as a social response helps to integrate controversial findings within the field.","Olivera-La Rosa, A.",0,10.1016/j.newideapsych.2018.03.004,1523

We then design transfers for full implementation by using information on beliefs in order to weaken the strategic externalities of the baseline canonical transfers.

4252,,"Development of electricity delivery infrastructures are path-dependent, meaning, each development decision and step affects subsequent steps, and the final outcome. Human actors are therefore the most important variables in any energy development plan as their decisions affect the way a system evolves. Proper policy-planning tools are therefore required to guide decision-makers on least-cost rural electrification topologies. Many factors influence choices of technologies used in rural electrification, the main ones being availability of resources, availability of necessary technical infrastructures, demand, investment costs, and local socio-political and cultural environments. Different modelling tools and techniques have been applied in planning rural electrification paths in many developing countries. However, these often view this problem as a question of expansion of grid coverage through extensions of existing transmission and distribution lines from central power generation stations and seldom address the unique and regionally-specific challenges presented by each developing nation. To the best of our knowledge, no work has captured, in one study, the unique socio-economic, cultural and political environments, and market and technical infrastructural challenges presented by different rural communities in developing nations. In this work decentralized power systems based on locally available renewable energy resources, in this case solar, are explored as cost-effective electrification alternatives to national utility grid extensions to rural developing communities. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed in Netlogo to provide decision-makers with a user-friendly tool for PV-based rural electrification policy development, planning, and implementation. The model takes into account the complexities and limitations of solar electricity microgeneration technologies, decisions by human actors, geographical factors, and interactions between the three factors in order to capture the overall macro-effects of different micro-decisions in a virtual world; ABMs seek to model individual entities within a complex system and the rules that govern the interactions of the entities within the system, to capture the overall effect of such interactions. The novelty of the model developed in this work is that it simultaneously simulates how technical, socio-economic, and political factors affect temporal diffusion of PV microgeneration systems in a typical rural developing community. The model further simulates how households with PV, driven by demand for more power and other factors, come together to form communal grids. Survey data from Kendu Bay area of Kenya are used to inform the model. Empirical data provided by the Kenyan government are used to validate the model. The model developed in this work could be used by developing nations in their rural electrification planning and implementations, and a test-implementation funded by the Kenyan government is currently underway. Results show that given various electrification options, households in rural developing communities would overwhelmingly choose small PV microgeneration systems as stepping stones to future grid electrification. This is mainly due to initial basic electricity needs, rapidly falling PV costs, and affordability of such small PV systems; these small PV microgeneration systems allow households to enjoy the benefits of electricity with modest investments while also allowing future modifications with increasing household incomes, increasing power demands, and changing technologies. Another key finding of this research is that as their power demands increase beyond what could be fulfilled by small stand-alone PV systems, most rural households opt for PV-based communal grids as opposed to connecting to the national grids due to low cost, control over a community’s own power source, increased reliability and availability, and security of power source. Results also show that increased PV installations, and correspondingly more connections to communal grids, could b","Opiyo, Nicholas Nixon",0,,1527

This trend includes the university and pedagogies of first year writing. The application of Eastern contemplative practice helps some people in certain circumstances, but its use raises questions. In the university classroom, methods like mindfulness meditation and yoga may offer perspectives that inform pedagogy. But, these interventions often lack concrete applicability to course content, oversimplify theoretical foundation of the original Eastern practices, and seem disparate from, rather than integral to, standard curriculum. My dissertation analyzes how yogic practice is already embedded in the discipline of composition and rhetoric. By resignifying rhetorical scholarship as yogic, I shape a new and amalgamated conception of agency deploying yogic and Western perspectives. I call this yogic agency. By constructing, defining, and unraveling the function of yogic agency in the writing classroom, I extract, analyze, and refigure the yogic philosophy and practice as always and already underlying scholarship of composition and rhetoric. My dissertation integrates yogic and rhetorical perspectives into one. I aim to sharpen and clarify of the role of yoga, as well as other alternative Eastern frameworks, in the Western writing classroom. There is sometimes an assumption that yoga is a pedagogical intervention replacing less effective teaching methods. This operates on the notion that our field is in a position of deficit. Instead, I generate yogic agency to illustrate the feeling of having control of one’s worldview as a means to embody a way of perceiving that one already has everything within in order to become rhetorical agents of one’s own life.

4255,Centrally located yet close to nature: A prescriptive agent-based model for urban design,"A common dilemma for planners is how to design urban settlements that give people easy access to a center and nature. Difficulties arise because each households access to such elements is a function of other households' location and the set of potential arrangements is constrained by the households' degree of acceptance of different density levels. This paper suggests the ideal arrangement of built-up and green areas may be identified by simulating in an agent-based model (ABM) the interactions of virtual households that try to find the best residential location based on their preferences towards distance from the center, proximity to green space and density. Simulations showed that the ABM can, iteration after iteration, develop progressively better configurations and eventually get to an equilibrium if households' locational choice is driven not only by the maximization of individual utility, but also the preservation of the neighbors' well-being. Model's outputs suggest that compact settlements with an even distribution of green spaces offer the greatest benefits to their inhabitants, and that larger green areas are to be preferred when the population is less sensitive to density and/or the travel to the center is faster along some directions. Application of a rent formation model on the configurations generated by the ABM shows that these are relatively equitable, as lower income households could afford at least half of all locations. Future improvements can turn this model into a suitable tool for designing new settlements, guiding the densification of existing settlements or defining zoning regulations.","Orsi, F.",0,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.10.001,1530

Aim: We propose and analyze an approach to modeling variations in dynamics and note onset timing for solo violin pieces with the purpose of facilitating expressive performance learning in new pieces, for which no reference performance is available. Method: The method generates phrase-level predictions based on musical score information on the assumption that expressiveness is idiomatic, and thus influenced by similar-sounding melodies. Predictions were evaluated numerically using three different datasets and against note-level machine-learning models, and also perceptually by listeners, who were presented to synthesized versions of musical excerpts, and asked to choose the most human-sounding one. Some of the presented excerpts were synthesized to reflect the variations in dynamics and timing predicted by the model, whereas others were shaped to reflect the dynamics and timing of an actual expert performance, and a third group was presented with no expressive variations. Results: surprisingly, none of the three synthesized versions was consistently selected as human-like nor preferred with statistical significance by listeners. Possible interpretations of these results include the fact that the melodies might have been impossible to interpret outside their musical context, or that expressive features that were left out of the modeling such as note articulation and vibrato are, in fact, essential to the perception of expression in violin performance. Positive feedback by some listeners toward the modeled melodies in a blind setting indicate that the modeling approach was capable of generating appropriate renditions at least for a subset of the data. Numerically, performance in phrase-level suffers a small degradation if compared to note-level, but produces predictions easier to interpret visually, thus more useful in a pedagogical setting.","Ortega, F.

4260,,"Conversational Agents integrate computational linguistics techniques and natural language to support human-like communication with complex computer systems. There are a number of applications in business, education and entertainment, including unmanned call centres, or as personal shopping or navigation assistants. Initial research has been performed on Conversational Agents in languages other than English. There has been no significant publication on Thai Conversational Agents. Moreover, no research has been conducted on supporting algorithms for Thai word similarity measures and Thai sentence similarity measures. Consequently, this thesis details the development of a novel Thai sentence semantic similarity measure that can be used to create a Thai Conversational Agent. This measure, Thai Sentence Semantic Similarity measure (TSTS) is inspired by the seminal English measure, Sentence Similarity based on Semantic Nets and Corpus Statistics (STASIS). A Thai sentence benchmark dataset, called 65 Thai Sentence pairs benchmark dataset (TSS-65), is also presented in this thesis for the evaluation of TSTS. The research starts with the development a simple Thai word similarity measure called TWSS. Additionally, a novel word measure called a Semantic Similarity Measure, based on a Lexical Chain Created from a Search Engine (LCSS), is also proposed using a search engine to create the knowledge base instead of WordNet. LCSS overcomes the problem that a prototype version of Thai Word semantic similarity measure (TWSS) has with the word pairs that are related to Thai culture. Thai word benchmark datasets are also presented for the evaluation of TWSS and LCSS called the 30 Thai Word Pair benchmark dataset (TWS-30) and 65 Thai Word Pair benchmark dataset (TWS-65), respectively. The result of TSTS is considered a starting point for a Thai sentence measure which can be illustrated to create semantic-based Conversational Agents in future. This is illustrated using a small sample of real English Conversational Agent human dialogue utterances translated into Thai.","Osathanunkul, Khukrit",0,,1532

4266,IMPACT OF INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA MODULE WITH PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS ON STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING AND MOTIVATION IN THE LEARNING OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY,"The Electrochemistry topic is found to be difficult to learn due to its abstract concepts involving macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic representation levels. Studies have shown that animation and simulation using information and communication technology (ICT) can help students to visualize and hence enhance their understanding in learning abstract chemistry topics. As a result, an interactive multimedia module with the pedagogical agent (IMMPA) named the EC Lab (Electrochemistry Lab) was developed in order to assist students in the learning of Electrochemistry topics. A non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design investigation was carried out in order to gauge the effect of the IMMPA EC Lab on students' understanding and motivation in the learning of Electrochemistry. Some 127 Form Four students from two secondary schools in one of the districts in Malaysia were involved in the study. Each school had one treatment group and one control group taught by the same Chemistry teacher. Instruments involved were a pre- and posttest, a pre- and post-motivation questionnaire, and the IMMPA EC Lab. Results showed a significant difference between the control groups and treatment groups in the understanding of concepts in the learning of Electrochemistry.","Osman, K.",1,10.1007/s10763-013-9407-y,1535
4268,,"During the early twentieth century, recording technicians travelled around the world on behalf of the multinational recording companies. Producing recordings with vernacular repertoires not only became an effective way to open local markets for the talking machines that these same companies were manufacturing. It also allowed for an unprecedented global circulation of local musics. This dissertation focuses on the recording expeditions lead by the Victor Talking Machine Company through several cities in Latin America during the acoustic era. Drawing from untapped archival material, including the daily ledgers of the expeditions, the following pages offer the first comprehensive history of these expeditions while focusing on five areas of analysis: the globalization of recorded sound, the imperial and transcultural dynamics in the itinerant recording ventures of the industry, the interventions of “recording scouts” for the production of acoustic records, the sounding events recorded during the expeditions, and the transnational circulation of these recordings.I argue that rather than a marginal side of the music industry or a rudimentary operation, as it has been usually presented hitherto in many histories of the phonograph, sound recording during the acoustic era was a central and intricate area in the business; and that the international ventures of recording companies before 1925 set the conditions of possibility for the consolidation of media entertainment as a defining aspect of consumer culture worldwide through the twentieth century. Furthermore, by focusing on the interactions between Victor’s traveling recording agents and multiple performers and intermediaries in Latin America, I question top-down narratives of the international dimension of recording companies and offer, instead, a complicated picture of improvisation, untidy imperialism, intercultural misunderstandings, colonial desire, sundry sound recordings, and multimedia entanglements.","Ospina Romero, Sergio Daniel",0,,1536
4269,,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide opportunities for learners to benefit from initiatives that are promoted by prestigious universities worldwide. The introduction of MOOCs in 2008 has since then transformed education globally. Consequently, MOOCs should be acknowledged as a pedagogical innovation and recognized as change agents and facilitators in the transition of opening up education, in the transition from traditional campus education to open online learning arenas, which increases learners' access to and equity in lifelong learning. There is a need to consider MOOCs as a natural part of universities' course offerings and business models and to recognize MOOCs as valuable for learners. Furthermore, MOOCs should be regarded as valuable learning and educational initiatives in the same way that journals and books are recognized. Learners should be able to take MOOCs either at their own university or from other providers. Moreover, MOOCs should be valued in policies, strategies, and action plans, and they should be included in processes of quality enhancement and quality assurance. This paper points out the merits of the innovative use of MOOCs in higher education. In this qualitative literature research, a content method analysis was conducted through a systematic review of the literature. Through the findings from the literature research it is suggested that MOOCs could be permanent change agents that boost innovation in higher education learning arenas. In particular, the findings revealed the benefits of MOOCs in various areas, such as lifelong learning, professional competence development, validation of learning, and degree recognition, in addition to clarifying several business models of higher education.","Ossiannilsson, Ebba",0,,1537
4272,,"This dissertation reports on an ethnographic study of human-centered technology researchers, conducted in Japan between 2010 and 2012. Researchers in this field—a multidisciplinary group mostly of computer engineers, as well as complex systems scientists, biologists, and psychologists—claim that existing “machine-centered” technologies require users to behave like machines, resulting in burdensome and brittle social relations. In contrast, they attempt to create “human-centered technologies” that humans can interact with “naturally”, which they believe will facilitate the creation of resilient and comfortable societies. HCT researchers believe that the key to understanding natural human interactions lies in how humans “read ambience”. Reading ambience is the process through which a social actor identifies and acts on the aspects of its self and surroundings that inform it of what behaviors are appropriate in a given setting. They work to reverse engineer how humans read ambience to create technologies that humans can interact with naturally. This dissertation argues that HCT researchers efforts to understand humanness through reverse engineering elucidate dimensions of human relations that have been suppressed in conventional discourses on the human. Anthropological understandings of the human have been predicated on the notion that the human is a form of life. Instead, HCT researchers’ work shows that the human is a system of communication. The human is defined by how it interfaces and exchanges messages with other systems of communication. Their perspective shows the human as a system defined by the relations it maintains among its body, its social and material surroundings, including technologies and other humans. By following HCT researchers’ attempts to create human-machine interfaces, this ethnography attempts to offer an approach to the human based in communication that challenges atomistic understandings of the human still latent in anthropology.","Otsuki, Grant Jun",0,,1538
4273,The importance of procedural justice in Human-Machine Interactions: Intelligent systems as new decision agents in organizations,"In the present study, the effects of procedural justice (fair or unfair) and the type of decision agent (human, robot, or computer) on employee behavior and attitudes (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behavior, or counterproductive work behaviors) were examined. It was predicted that the type of decision agent (or the source of justice) would moderate the relationship between procedural justice and employee behavior and attitudes, with the relationship being strongest when the decision agent is a human team leader, medium when the decision agent is a humanoid robot, and weakest when the agent is a computer system. This research question was investigated with a between-subjects design in two experiments (N-1 = 149 and N-2 = 145) that displayed two different decision situations in organizations (allocation of new tasks and allocation of further vocational trainings). Results of both studies showed significant effects of procedural justice on employee behavior and attitudes, confirming the importance of procedural justice at the workplace for both human and system decision agents. Furthermore, both studies failed to verify any interaction effects of procedural justice and the decision agent. This further emphasizes the importance of procedural justice in decision situations because there is no difference in reactions to procedural justice of human or system decisions. Limitations and implications for future research and the integration of justice and human machine interaction research are discussed.","Otting, S. K.",0,10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.022,1539

I conclude this article by suggesting that if we are willing to entertain an expansive sense of reality, which includes the virtually real as one of its active agents, it is possible to rethink not only Walpole's oeuvre but also the Gothic genres and styles (in literature, drama, and architecture) that he foreshadows, while bringing them into dialogue with the rapidly multiplying virtual realities of our own time.","Otto, P.",0,10.3138/ecf.27.3.681,1540
4276,,"The development of reliable natural language interfaces to relational databases can accelerate the progress of many areas of applications, such as the need for interactive relational database interfaces for non-technical users. This thesis presents a novel development of C-BIRDs framework. The C-BIRD framework was developed in two phases. The first phase involved the development of a Static Approach-Based C-BIRD framework, which is based on a combination of a Goal-Oriented Conversational Agent (GOCA) and a knowledge tree (KT). GO CAs have proven their capability to disambiguate the user's needs through natural language conversations. KT is used to overcome the lack of connectivity between the GOCA and the relational database, through organizing the domain knowledge in a knowledge tree. In addition the Static Approach-Based C-BIRD framework, a number of strategies were employed based on scripting structures in order to enhance the reasoning capabilities towards answering user queries. The second phase involved the development of a Dynamic Approach- Based C-BIRD framework which is based on information extraction (lE) in order to dynamically create an SQL statement that answers user queries. lE component utilised a number of SQL query templates, which are made of relational database semantically understandable patterns such as table and column names. In addition, the dynamic approach used the conversational agent to disambiguate the dynamically generated SQL queries by confirming these queries with the user by means of SQL template specific strategies scripts. The Static Approach-Based C-BIRD prototype showed excellent results in terms of successfully mapping natural language conversations into SQL statements (i.e. task success, in which 5 tasks performed by 20 participants with an overall result of 91 %). The dynamic approach also showed very good results in terms of task success; 5 tasks performed by 20 participants with an overall result came to 74%. In summary, the proposed static approach C-BIRD framework offered a novel methodology to develop reliable conversational interfaces to relational databases in which engineered queries can be answered. In addition, the dynamic approach introduced a novel way to map natural language utterances into SQL statements and confirming the results with the user, before providing the final answer. Ultimately, the user experiences a real-time and friendly conversational interface with the relational.","Owda, Majdi Sabe",0,,1541
4277,Evaluation of a Computer-Based Decision Aid for Promoting Informed Prostate Cancer Screening Decisions Among African American Men: iDecide,"Purpose: To evaluate the effects of iDecide on prostate cancer knowledge, informed decision-making self-efficacy, technology use self-efficacy, and intention to engage in informed decision-making among African American men. Design: One-group, pretest/posttest. Setting: Community settings in South Carolina. Participants: African American men, ages 40 years +, without a prior prostate cancer diagnosis (n = 354). Intervention: iDecide, an embodied conversational agent-led, computer-based prostate cancer screening decision aid. Measures: Prostate cancer knowledge, informed decision-making self-efficacy, technology use self-efficacy, and intention to engage in informed decision-making. Analysis: Descriptive statistics, paired t tests, general linear modeling, Spearman correlations. Results: On average, participants experienced significant improvements in their prostate cancer knowledge (P <= .001), informed decision-making self-efficacy (P <= .001), and technology use self-efficacy (P <= .001), postintervention. Additionally, 67% of participants reported an intention to engage in informed decision-making. Conclusion: Given the significant improvements across all measures, this research demonstrates that embodied conversational agent-led decision aids can be used to enhance the capacity for making informed prostate cancer screening decisions among African American men and increase their technology use self-efficacy. One critical limitation of this study is that most men had received prostate cancer screening prior to engaging in our intervention, so the implications of this intervention may be different for men who do not have a history of screening. Additionally, actual engagement in informed decision-making postintervention was not assessed.","Owens, O. L.",0,10.1177/0890117118786866,1542
4284,,"Neuroimaging research has demonstrated that mentalizing about false beliefs held by other people recruits the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). However, earlier work was limited to a single agent that held a false belief. We investigated the effect of two agents that held similar or mixed false and/or true beliefs. Participants saw animated stories with two smurfs holding true or false beliefs (Story phase). At the end of each trial, they were requested to take the perspective of the self or one of the smurfs (Question phase). We predicted that an increasing number of smurfs holding a false belief would increase activation in the TPJ when participants have to report the belief of the smurf, because the incongruent belief should have a stronger influence if it is held by two compared with one agent. This prediction was confirmed as activation in the TPJ during the Story and Question phase increased when more smurfs held a false belief. Taking the perspective of the self led to stronger activation of the TPJ in the two conditions that involved a true belief and weakest activation in the condition of two false beliefs. These data suggest that activation in TPJ depends on the perspective participants take, and that the number of agents holding a false belief influences activation in the TPJ only when taking the agent’s perspective.

4289,Investigating the impact of pedagogical agent gender matching and learner choice on learning outcomes and perceptions,"The similarity attraction hypothesis posits that humans are drawn toward others who behave and appear similar to themselves. Two experiments examined this hypothesis with middle-school students learning electrical circuit analysis in a computer-based environment with an Animated Pedagogical Agent (APA). Experiment 1 was designed to determine whether matching the gender of the APA to the student has a positive impact on learning outcomes or student perceptions. One hundred ninety-seven middle-school students learned with the computer-based environment using an APA that matched their gender or one which was opposite in gender. Female students reported higher program ratings when the APA matched their gender. Male students, on the other hand, reported higher program ratings than females when the APA did not match their gender. Experiment 2 systematically tested the impact of providing learners the choice among four APAs on learning outcomes and student perceptions. Three hundred thirty-four middle-school students received either a pre-assigned random APA or were free to choose from four APA options: young male agent, older male agent, young female agent, or older female agent. Learners had higher far transfer scores when provided a choice of animated agent, but student perceptions were not impacted by having the ability to make this choice. We suggest that offering students learner control positively impacts student motivation and learning by increasing student perceptions of autonomy, responsibility for the success of the instructional materials, and global satisfaction with the design of materials.

4293,Designing Robot Embodiments for Social Interaction: Affordances Topple Realism and Aesthetics,"In the near future, human-like social robots will become indispensable for providing support in various social tasks, in particular for healthcare (e.g., assistance, coaching). The perception of realism, in particular human-like features, can help facilitate mediated social interaction. The current study investigated the effects of form realism on engagement with and use intentions of social robot embodiments. We have defined (perceived) form realism as the result of the appraisal of features that are perceived as realistic contrasted with those appraised as unrealistic. To test the effects of form realism, we applied the model of interactively perceiving and experiencing fictional characters (I-PEFiC). I-PEFiC explains how users respond to interactive, fictional, humanoid characters, on social robots. In a within-subjects design, participants (N = 29; M-age = 28.8 years, age range 18-56 years) interacted with three different robots built from LEGO Mindstorms, which differed in their degree of designed form realism. Each robot presented itself as a physiotherapy assistant and requested the participant to do several exercises. Results of a structured questionnaire indicated that form realism only played a modest role in the perception of electro-mechanical robots. Instead, the perception of affordances appeared to be crucial for determining engagement and intentions to use social robots.","Paauwe, R. A.",0,10.1007/s12369-015-0301-3,1545
4297,Dynamic Facial Emotion Recognition Oriented to HCI Applications,"As part of a multimodal animated avatar previously presented in Marcos-Pablos et al. ((2010) A realistic, virtual head for human-computer interaction. Interact. Comput., 22, 176-192, ISSN 0953-5438), in this paper we describe a method for dynamic recognition of displayed facial emotions on low-resolution streaming images. First, we address the detection of action units (AUs) of the facial action coding system using active shape models and Gabor filters. Normalized outputs of the AU recognition step are then used as inputs for a neural network that consists of an habituation network plus a competitive network. Both the competitive and the habituation layer use differential equations, thus taking into account the dynamic information of facial expressions through time. Experimental results carried out on live video sequences and on the Cohn-Kanade face database show that the proposed method provides high recognition hit rates. To assess the suitability of the developed emotional recognition system for human-computer interaction applications, it has been successfully integrated in the architecture of an avatar and we have conducted a preliminary experiment on empathy. The experiment showed promising results, as the avatar that made use of the emotional recognition system obtained a clear increase in the positivity of the rating when compared with the same avatar with no emotional response.","Pablos, S.

4301,Assessing children's interpersonal emotion regulation with virtual agents: The serious game Emodiscovery,"Emotion regulation (ER) is key for children's development and it has recently been considered in many serious games and e-learning technologies. However, these tools have focused on children's efforts to change their own emotions (intrapersonal ER), overlooking how children may engage in modifying the emotions of others (interpersonal ER). To address this gap, we have developed a multiplatform online serious game, Emodiscovery, which evaluates whether children (8-11 year olds) tend to use different adaptive and maladaptive regulation strategies to change others' negative emotions with the use of 3D animated characters. The game is organized into levels, each representing a different scenario, where the child is asked to interact with the character three times choosing an appropriate regulation strategy to cheer him or her up from four possible options, being two adaptive and two maladaptive strategies. To test the effectiveness of the game, a sample of English children played three scenarios depicting a character feeling sadness, anger, and fear, respectively. Results showed that most children chose adaptive strategies to improve the character's emotion across the different emotion scenarios. Furthermore, emotion recognition was not positively related to children's choices of regulation strategies. The implications and applications of the games are discussed.","Pacella, D.",0,10.1016/j.compedu.2018.04.005,1547
4303,Basic emotions and adaptation. A computational and evolutionary model,"The core principles of the evolutionary theories of emotions declare that affective states represent crucial drives for action selection in the environment and regulated the behavior and adaptation of natural agents in ancestrally recurrent situations. While many different studies used autonomous artificial agents to simulate emotional responses and the way these patterns can affect decision-making, few are the approaches that tried to analyze the evolutionary emergence of affective behaviors directly from the specific adaptive problems posed by the ancestral environment. A model of the evolution of affective behaviors is presented using simulated artificial agents equipped with neural networks and physically inspired on the architecture of the iCub humanoid robot. We use genetic algorithms to train populations of virtual robots across generations, and investigate the spontaneous emergence of basic emotional behaviors in different experimental conditions. In particular, we focus on studying the emotion of fear, therefore the environment explored by the artificial agents can contain stimuli that are safe or dangerous to pick. The simulated task is based on classical conditioning and the agents are asked to learn a strategy to recognize whether the environment is safe or represents a threat to their lives and select the correct action to perform in absence of any visual cues. The simulated agents have special input units in their neural structure whose activation keep track of their actual ""sensations"" based on the outcome of past behavior. We train five different neural network architectures and then test the best ranked individuals comparing their performances and analyzing the unit activations in each individual's life cycle. We show that the agents, regardless of the presence of recurrent connections, spontaneously evolved the ability to cope with potentially dangerous environment by collecting information about the environment and then switching their behavior to a genetically selected pattern in order to maximize the possible reward. We also prove the determinant presence of an internal time perception unit for the robots to achieve the highest performance and survivability across all conditions.","Pacella, D.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0187463,1548
4307,Multiple influences of semantic memory on sentence processing: Distinct effects of semantic relatedness on violations of real-world event/state knowledge and animacy selection restrictions,"We aimed to determine whether semantic relatedness between an incoming word and its preceding context can override expectations based on two types of stored knowledge: real-world knowledge about the specific events and states conveyed by a verb, and the verb's broader selection restrictions on the animacy of its argument. We recorded event-related potentials on post-verbal Agent arguments as participants read and made plausibility judgments about passive English sentences. The N400 evoked by incoming animate Agent arguments that violated expectations based on real-world event/state knowledge, was strongly attenuated when they were semantically related to the context. In contrast, semantic relatedness did not modulate the N400 evoked by inanimate Agent arguments that violated the preceding verb's animacy selection restrictions. These findings suggest that, under these task and experimental conditions, semantic relatedness can facilitate processing of post-verbal animate arguments that violate specific expectations based on real-world event/state knowledge, but only when the semantic features of these arguments match the coarser-grained animacy restrictions of the verb. Animacy selection restriction violations also evoked a P600 effect, which was not modulated by semantic relatedness, suggesting that it was triggered by propositional impossibility. Together, these data indicate that the brain distinguishes between real-world event/state knowledge and animacy-based selection restrictions during online processing.

4309,Violating body movement semantics: Neural signatures of self-generated and external-generated errors,"How do we recognize ourselves as the agents of our actions? Do we use the same error detection mechanisms to monitor self-generated vs. externally imposed actions? Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we identified two different error-monitoring loops involved in providing a coherent sense of the agency of our actions. In the first ERP experiment, the participants were embodied in a virtual body (avatar) while performing an error-prone fast reaction time task. Crucially, in certain trials, participants were deceived regarding their own actions, i.e., the avatar movement did not match the participant's movement. Self-generated real errors and false (avatar) errors showed very different ERP signatures and with different processing latencies: while real errors showed a classical frontal-central error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), peaking 100 ms after error commission, false errors elicited a larger and delayed parietal negative component (at about 350-400 ms). The violation of the sense of agency elicited by false avatar errors showed a strong similarity to ERP signatures related to semantic or conceptual violations (N400 component). In a follow-up ERP control experiment, a subset of the same participants merely acted as observers of the avatar correct and error movements. This experimental situation did not elicit the N400 component associated with agency violation. Thus, the results show a clear neural dissociation between internal and external error-monitoring loops responsible for distinguishing our self-generated errors from those imposed externally, opening new avenues for the study of the mental processes underlying the integration of internal and sensory feedback information while being actors of our own actions.

4314,,"This dissertation concerns the feminization of the Italian teaching profession between the introduction of pre-Unification schooling in 1859 and the nationalization of that system in 1911. By feminization, this dissertation refers both to the gradual assumption of the majority of elementary teaching positions by women and to a transformation in the nature of the position itself. Through an examination of educational periodicals, school records, government inquests, and accounts by teachers and pedagogical theorists, it argues that rather than the unintended consequence of economic constraints or shifting labor patterns, feminization was fundamentally connected to larger processes of centralization and modernization in the Italian school system. Following an introductory chapter outlining the major national, religious, and gender debates of the Unification era, the second chapter of the dissertation argues that the figure of the female elementary teacher became embroiled in the contest between local and national interests, furthering the drive toward centralization. The third chapter examines a subject generally ignored in most studies of Italian women's education: the impact of international and domestic pedagogy. The chapter shows that the development of an Italian pedagogy combining positivism and progressivism with a maternalist, child-centered methodology was both a result and a cause of the feminization of the teaching profession. The fourth chapter focuses on the divide between the secularizing nation and the entrenched Catholic Church, arguing that carefully trained female teachers were employed as agents of the encroaching State and examining the connection between religious education debates and women's rights movements. The fifth chapter is an institutional history of the teacher-training normal schools; an analysis of institutional and government records reveals that normal school feminization reflected the centralization, secularization, and pedagogical reformation of the school system in general.","Pak, Julie Kazdan",0,,1551
4315,Decision support aids with anthropomorphic characteristics influence trust and performance in younger and older adults,"This study examined the use of deliberately anthropomorphic automation on younger and older adults' trust, dependence and performance on a diabetes decision-making task. Research with anthropomorphic interface agents has shown mixed effects in judgments of preferences but has rarely examined effects on performance. Meanwhile, research in automation has shown some forms of anthropomorphism (e. g. etiquette) have effects on trust and dependence on automation. Participants answered diabetes questions with no-aid, a non-anthropomorphic aid or an anthropomorphised aid. Trust and dependence in the aid was measured. A minimally anthropomorphic aide primarily affected younger adults' trust in the aid. Dependence, however, for both age groups was influenced by the anthropomorphic aid. Automation that deliberately embodies person-like characteristics can influence trust and dependence on reasonably reliable automation. However, further research is necessary to better understand the specific aspects of the aid that affect different age groups. Automation that embodies human-like characteristics may be useful in situations where there is under-utilisation of reasonably reliable aids by enhancing trust and dependence in that aid. Practitioner Summary: The design of decision-support aids on consumer devices (e. g. smartphones) may influence the level of trust that users place in that system and their amount of use. This study is the first step in articulating how the design of aids may influence user's trust and use of such systems","Pak, R.",0,10.1080/00140139.2012.691554,1552
4320,,"The purpose of this research was to investigate whether interactivity yields a learning effect when used appropriately in e-Learning Systems, and whether this effect enhances learning. The importance of interactivity for success in learning has always been paramount; however, little scientific evidence can be found to support this importance (Sims, 2003; Leiner & Quiring, 2008). Thus, this research aims to provide evidence of the impact of interactivity on e-Learning Systems considering three main agents: the learner, the teacher and the system (educational triangle). A key element often found to be related to learning and the three previously-mentioned agents is the concept of feedback. The use of interactivity as part of a feedback mechanism for enhancing learning is well documented in this research. Three empirical studies were designed to investigate interactivity within the educational triangle. These three studies, developed to support the research hypotheses, were conducted based on the framework of positivism and action research paradigms. The first study, entitled “Interactive Pedagogical Feedback”, aimed to gather evidence for how highly interactive pedagogically-designed formative feedback enhances students’ memory and understanding. The two student groups to which the interactive conditions were added showed a significant difference in the post test scores. A one-way ANOVA with a Turkey HSD post hoc test for all pair wise comparisons reveals a significant difference between the transfer and no condition scenario. The second study, entitled “Interactive Audio Feedback”, examined whether the speed enhancements of oral feedback improve the conditions for the production of lecture’s feedback and the quality of the feedback delivered to the students. The use of the interactive condition reduces by 40 to 65% the time it usually takes to prepare feedback for final assignments, and an unpaired Student’s t-test shows significant differences in the use of the two conditions. The final study, “Interactive Texting Feedback”, took a pedagogical approach to provide formative feedback to a student audience using mobile text messages. It aimed to determine whether Interactive Texting Feedback enhances the leaning experience within the e-Learning environment. Inferential analysis demonstrated good correlations in the use and benefits obtained by the introduction of the interactive mechanism. The results indicated that interactivity is critical in promoting and enhancing effective learning. Learning theories led by the generative theory of learning (Wittrock, 1974) and the principles of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2001) provide scientific explanation for this findings.","Palacios Moreno, Luis Alberto",1,,1553

For various tasks like balancing, driving a car, and interacting with humans, real-time response of the robot is essential. Efficiently controlling a humanoid robot requires a software that guarantees real-time interface and control mechanism so that real-time response of the robot is possible. Addition- ally, to reduce the development effort and time, the software should be open-source, multi-lingual and should have high-level constructs inbuilt in it. Currently Robot Operating System (ROS) and Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio (MRDS) are most commonly used software packages for controlling robots. Since ROS uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for inter-process communication, the latency in communication is high. Therefore, if ROS is used, the robot cannot respond in real-time. On the other hand, MRDS is not an open-source but a proprietary soft- ware package. Therefore it cannot be optimized for a particular robot. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a real-time, open-source, modular, and thin software for controlling humanoid robots. This thesis describes the design and architecture of two software packages developed to fill this gap. It is expected that in the near future a large number of humanoid robots will be used all around the world. The humanoid robots will be used to perform various tasks. The developed software packages have the potential to be the most commonly used software packages for controlling humanoid robots. These packages will assist humans in controlling and monitoring humanoid robots to perform search-and-rescue operations, explore the universe, assist in household chores, etc.","Paldhe, Manas",0,,1554
4322,,"This dissertation explores the perception of agency in musical works through an interdisciplinary lens spanning music theory, music cognition, and psychological research. Through a methodological approach informed by ecological music theory, musical agency is redefined as the virtual experience of social affordances in music. The dissertation addresses the idea that perceived musical agency emerges from an active, bodily response to music as a social entity. Music can contain social affordances, such as social attunement and behavioral cuing, which are explored in relationship to meter. I connect attunement and cuing to two metrical processes, entrainment and metrical dissonance. Metrical entrainment, or the prediction of temporally patterned sound events, activates brain regions commonly associated with feelings of intersubjective interaction and prosocial behavior. Entrainment provides a foundational affordance over which metrically dissonant behavioral cues may contrast, confusing and disrupting the previously heard and embodied patterns. Those cues provide a felt external push against the listening body, encouraging listeners to identify a cause. By engaging with the way a listener's body feels changed or disrupted by the music, the shifting bodily states that a shape a listener's understanding of and relationship to musical agents are addressed. The dissertation concludes with the integration of my methodology for agential emergence into two preexisting methodologies for tracking and defining musical agency, those of Karl and Hatten. By showing the roots of agency through its emergence, this dissertation demonstrates that narrative accounts can be deepened and enriched through an engagement with ecological theory.","Palfy, Cora Suzanne",0,,1555
4323,,"The term 'complex systems' may sound terrifying whenever you come across it as it depicts an overall collective structure which indeed can live upto its name; but when you comprehend the system at its fundamental level by stripping to its simpler multiple- interacting individual parts, the insights it provides may be used to describe and understand different problems ranging from atomic particles to the economics of societies and evolution. The simple laws can be used to simulate the behaviors of disparate complex systems. In this thesis, a brief study is done emulating few such complex systems through programming techniques like cellular automata and neural networks. The patterns of complex behavior obtained are also classified respectively along with the help of Conway's game of life; the working of an autonomous and self organizing organism is simulated in a program written to show the complex patterns formed by a virtual ant. Then an important aspect of competition and cooperation among these agents is shown through game theory and dilemmas which throws light on the essence of survival of complex systems. A formal study is also done on the uses of artificial neural networks as associative memories and pattern recognizers.","Pallekonda, Sara S.",0,,1556
4324,Why and how to use virtual reality to study human social interaction: The challenges of exploring a new research landscape,"As virtual reality (VR) technology and systems become more commercially available and accessible, more and more psychologists are starting to integrate VR as part of their methods. This approach offers major advantages in experimental control, reproducibility, and ecological validity, but also has limitations and hidden pitfalls which may distract the novice user. This study aimed to guide the psychologist into the novel world of VR, reviewing available instrumentation and mapping the landscape of possible systems. We use examples of state-of-the-art research to describe challenges which research is now solving, including embodiment, uncanny valley, simulation sickness, presence, ethics, and experimental design. Finally, we propose that the biggest challenge for the field would be to build a fully interactive virtual human who can pass a VR Turing test - and that this could only be achieved if psychologists, VR technologists, and AI researchers work together.","Pan, X.

4326,,"Introduction: A critical incident is an event that occurs in a delimitated place and time producing in the professional an emotional state -usually negative- and destabilizing his/her professional identity. Critical incidents have been used to study teachers' professional development and identity. This study aim is to better understand the effect of critical incidents in higher education. Method: 11 university teachers and 88 of their students participated in this study. During one semester they filled out three different surveys weekly. During six weeks each teacher and her students reported the occurrence of critical incidents in the classroom using the first survey. After the six weeks, the survey answers were exchanged: the teachers could read the students' and vice versa. In the second survey the participants reported their reactions after reading the first survey answers. In the third survey students and teachers reported their reactions to the second survey exchange and, additionally, the teachers reflected on their pedagogical strategies. Results: Teachers and students reported different events as critical incidents. Teachers reported challenges to their authority or lack of students' motivation. Students reported as critical incidents problem during collaborative activities, lack of understanding about tasks' goals and arguments among peers. Additionally teachers reported to have gained new insights about their pedagogical strategies and proposed changes in their teaching style and classroom activities. Conclusions: The students' and teachers' divergent interpretation of events as critical incidents points out the importance of the role of the ""educational agent"". This is, teachers are usually in a more salient role as they are directing the classroom and, therefore, have different goals than the students. For this reason they experience critical incidents from different events challenging their role as teachers. The methodology of shared reports is appropriate to provoke reflection and changes on the teachers' pedagogical strategies.

4328,Connecting with a Slot Machine: Social Exclusion and Anthropomorphization Increase Gambling,"Two studies tested whether social exclusion can increase gambling behavior. In Study 1, participants were asked to relive a socially painful instance, a physically painful instance or a control condition and were then presented with a real online gambling device (i.e., a slot machine). The results revealed that participants who relived a socially painful instance played longer on the gambling device. In Study 2, we induced actual feelings of social disconnection and manipulated slot machine anthropomorphization. The results revealed a significant interaction between inclusionary status and anthropomorphism in predicting gambling. More specifically, excluded participants gambled longer when presented with an anthropomorphized slot machine. However, the gambling behavior of excluded and included participants was no different when participants were reminded that slot machines are inanimate objects. Finally, positive and negative game experience mediated the influence of both inclusionary status and anthropomorphism on gambling. Overall, this research identifies another potential vulnerability produced by experiences of social exclusion, namely, gambling behavior. Implications for pathological gambling and future research directions are outlined.","Pancani, L.",0,10.1007/s10899-018-9784-9,1559
4331,Can artificially intelligent agents really be conscious?,"Mind and intelligence are closely related with the consciousness. Indeed, artificial intelligence (AI) is the most promising avenue towards artificial consciousness (AC). However, in literature, consciousness has been considered as the least amenable to being understood or replicated by AI. Further, computational theories of mind (CTMs) render the mind as a computational system and it is treated as a substantial hypothesis within the purview of AI. However, the consciousness, which is a phenomenon of mind, is partially tackled by this theory and it seems that the CTM is not corroborated considerably in this pursuit. Many valuable contributions have been incorporated by the researchers working strenuously in this domain. However, there is still scarcity of globally accepted computational models of consciousness that can be used to design conscious intelligent machines. The contributions of the researchers entail consciousness as a vague, incomplete and human-centred entity. In this paper, attempt has been made to analyse different theoretical and intricate issues pertaining to mind, intelligence and AC. Moreover, this paper discusses different computational models of the consciousness and critically analyses the possibility of generating the machine consciousness as well as identifying the characteristics of conscious machine. Further, different inquisitive questions, e.g., ""Is it possible to devise, project and build a conscious machine?"", ""Will artificially conscious machines be able to surpass the functioning of artificially intelligent machines?"" and ""Does consciousness reflect a peculiar way of information processing?"" are analysed.","Pandey, S.

4333,,"Mental states (e.g., goals, beliefs, and intentions) may be attributed to agents on the basis of motion cues, and previous studies have successfully related low-level perceptual qualities of a stimulus agent’s trajectory (i.e. speed, acceleration, or other manner of motion) to resulting subjective percepts. I argue for a powerful and novel experimental paradigm, in which I utilize a two-dimensional virtual environment populated by autonomous agents whose simulated vision, memory, and decision making capabilities can be manipulated. These agents—nicknamed “IMPs” (Independent Mobile Personalities)—navigate the environment, collecting “food” and interacting with one another. Their behavior is modulated by a small number of distinct goal states: attacking, exploring, fleeing, and gathering food. In a first study, subjects attempt to infer and report the IMPs’ continually changing goal states on the basis of their motions and interactions. Although these programmed ground truth goal states are not directly observable, subjects estimate them accurately and systematically. I present a Bayesian model of the inference of goal states which accurately predicts subjects’ responses, including their pattern of errors. In a second study, I use simulated evolution to create a pool of evolved IMPs which exhibit adaptive behavior. I operationally define IMPs sampled from this simulated evolution as being more rational compared to non-evolved “control” IMPs, and find that subjects construe evolved IMPs as being both more intelligent and more human-like than non-evolved IMPs. In a final critical experiment, I demonstrate that subjects are better at discriminating the goal states of evolved IMPs than those of non-evolved IMPs. The two studies I present in this thesis provide empirical support for an account of adult “theory of mind” which asserts that 1) the inference of latent mental states can be understood as the inversion of a model of the generative processes producing the observable behavior of the agent, 2) this generative model reflects expectations of agent rationality, and 3) evolutionary fitness is a reasonable operational model of apparent agent rationality, to which subjects are sensitive. These experiments also demonstrate that using autonomous agents as stimuli opens up many basic research questions in the study of the interpretation of intentionality.","Pantelis, Peter C.",0,,1562
4334,Inferring the intentional states of autonomous virtual agents,"Inferring the mental states of other agents, including their goals and intentions, is a central problem in cognition. A critical aspect of this problem is that one cannot observe mental states directly, but must infer them from observable actions. To study the computational mechanisms underlying this inference, we created a two-dimensional virtual environment populated by autonomous agents with independent cognitive architectures. These agents navigate the environment, collecting ""food"" and interacting with one another. The agents' behavior is modulated by a small number of distinct goal states: attacking, exploring, fleeing, and gathering food. We studied subjects' ability to detect and classify the agents' continually changing goal states on the basis of their motions and interactions. Although the programmed ground truth goal state is not directly observable, subjects' responses showed both high validity (correlation with this ground truth) and high reliability (correlation with one another). We present a Bayesian model of the inference of goal states, and find that it accounts for subjects' responses better than alternative models. Although the model is fit to the actual programmed states of the agents, and not to subjects' responses, its output actually conforms better to subjects' responses than to the ground truth goal state of the agents.

4342,Agency and rationality: Adopting the intentional stance toward evolved virtual agents,"The interpretation of other agents as intentional actors equipped with mental states has been connected to the attribution of rationality to their behavior. But a workable definition of “rationality” is difficult to formulate in complex situations, where standard normative definitions are difficult to apply. In this study, we explore a notion of rationality based on the idea of evolutionary fitness. We ask whether agents that are more adapted to their environment are, consequently, perceived as more rational and intentional. We created a 2-D virtual environment populated with autonomous virtual agents, each of which behaves according to a built-in program equipped with simulated perception, memory, and decision making. We then introduced a process of simulated evolution that pressured the agents’ programs toward behavior more adapted to the simulated environment. We showed these agents to human subjects in 2 experiments, in which we respectively asked them to judge their intelligence and to dynamically estimate their “mental states.” The results confirm that subjects construed evolved agents as more intelligent, and judged evolved agents’ mental states more accurately, relative to nonevolved agents. These results corroborate a view that the interpretation of agent behavior is connected to a concept of rationality based on the apparent fit between an agent’s actions and its environment.

4358,,"Policies around the world increasingly call for teachers to become 'agents of change', often linked to social justice agendas. However, there is little clarity about the kind of competencies such agency involves or how it can be developed in teacher education. This paper draws on theories of teacher agency and inclusive pedagogy to clarify the meaning of teachers as agents of change in the context of inclusion and social justice. Inclusive practice requires the collaboration of teachers and others such as families and other professionals. Agents of change work purposefully with others to challenge the status quo and develop social justice and inclusion. We discuss the possibilities of combining theories of inclusive pedagogy and teacher agency for developing teachers as agents of inclusion and social justice in teacher education. These possibilities include: 1) nurturing commitment to social justice as part of teachers' sense of purpose; 2) developing competencies in inclusive pedagogical approaches, including working with others; 3) developing relational agency for transforming the conditions of teachers' workplaces; and 4) a capacity to reflect on their own practices and environments when seeking to support the learning of all students.","Pantic, Nataša",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/edui.v6.27311,1565

4363,,"In the medical imaging field, image processing algorithms must be evaluated by measuring performance at some clinically-relevant task of interest (i.e. task-based quality assessment). This dissertation relies on the task-based paradigm to evaluate motion-estimation and image-reconstruction methods, respectively, for two cardiac-imaging modalities, namely: cardiac-gated tagged Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography for Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (SPECT-MPI). First, a task-based approach is followed to evaluate three motion-estimation methods for clinical cardiac-gated tagged MRI, namely: non-rigid registration using a Deformable Mesh Model (DMM), Strain from Unwrapped Harmonic Phase (SUP-HARP), and Feature-Based (FB) algorithms. More specifically, the goal is to quantify and rank their performances at both detection and estimation tasks. For detection, methods are evaluated per their ability to discern between normal and abnormal motion patterns in known cardiomyopathies (e.g. hypertension and mitral regurgitation). For estimation tasks, methods are evaluated per their accuracy at estimating several rotation/twist and strain features of clinical interest; since true values for these features are generally unknown, a statistical Regression Without Truth (RWT) model is adopted, which does not assume the existence of a “gold-standard” method to use as a ground-truth reference. Moreover, the RWT model provides with an objective figure-of-merit that allows ranking methods in absolute fashion. Second, a novel anthropomorphic Model Observer (MO) is proposed for optimization of SPECT-MPI reconstruction algorithms such as Filtered Back-projection (FBP) and Ordered-subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM). MOs are computer models that aim to mimic the performance of human readers (typically radiologists) at some clinically relevant task of interest. The proposed MO is based on supervised machine-learning classification, for the diagnostic tasks of detection, localization and assessment of perfusion defects. The MO is trained using an ensemble of synthetic cases whose perfusion were scored (i.e. labeled) by human specialists. The trained MO is subsequently applied on images not read by humans (both synthetic and clinical), aiming to predict their diagnostic scores. Results show that the proposed MO accurately predicts human diagnostic performances. Furthermore, it generalizes well to new images not used during training, not only from different reconstruction algorithms, but also from synthetic to clinical cases.","Parages, Felipe M.",0,,1567
4364,A collision avoidance behavior model for crowd simulation based on psychological findings,"This paper proposes a collision avoidance behavior model for crowd simulation based on psychological findings of human behaviors such as gaze movement angle (GMA), side stepping, gait motion, and personal reaction bubble to have better results in crowd simulation. By calculating the GMA between agents, collision can be predicted and avoided without knowing the exact trajectories of the agents. The proposed model consists of four phases: (1) GMA-based collision prediction for mid/long range by using speed-variant information process space, (2) collision avoidance steering, (3) gait-based locomotion generation, and (4) space keeping based on personal reaction bubble. The effectiveness of the proposed speed-variant information process space was tested on various types of agent flows with different densities. The total loss of kinetic energy accumulated during an agent's movement and the ratio of the length of the path actually traveled to the length of the original path are used as key metrics to figure out the features between the different types of flows. Finally, examples of tuning the parameters with well-known fundamental diagrams are presented. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Park, J. H.",0,10.1002/cav.1504,1568
4367,Interactive Kinetic Media Facades: A Pedagogical Design System to Support an Integrated Virtual-Physical Prototyping Environment in the Design Process of Media Facades,"Today, media facades play a significant role in our urban environments as media technologies continue to advance, aided by general systems theory and cybernetics. These media facades have taken new directions, toward holistic forms of kinetic, media, and interactive architecture, well beyond responsive architecture. Considering the move toward increased integration, a new pedagogical design tool for helping architectural designers and students understand kinesis and interaction more fully is now needed. For this, a design system that supports an associated, integrated virtual-physical prototyping environment based on multi-agent-models and Delta robot kinematics is proposed, implemented, and tested here. This research begins by exploring the latest cases of media facades, focusing on physical motions and the flow of information. Through analysis and classification, this research presents a theoretical model which consists of a tectonic model and an interactive model. Moreover, to prove the viability of these proposed models, an integrated virtual-physical prototyping environment is offered. The ultimate objective of this study is to assist, enhance, and expand the scope of media facades by proposing new ways of constructing, controlling, and simulating media facades by means of a new pedagogical design tool. Thus, this research contributes to pedagogy by allowing students and designers to fully explore and better understand interaction and kinesis in media facade design.","Park, J.

4368,"The Effects of Social Cue Principles on Cognitive Load, Situational Interest, Motivation, and Achievement in Pedagogical Agent Multimedia Learning","Animated pedagogical agents have become popular in multimedia learning with combined delivery of verbal and non-verbal forms of information. In order to reduce unnecessary cognitive load caused by such multiple forms of information and also to foster generative cognitive processing, multimedia design principles with social cues are suggested (Mayer, 2014a). This study presents the design model of pedagogical agent multimedia learning by using four design principles based on social cues. Then reported are the findings of a study examining the effects of the pedagogical agent multimedia learning on perceived cognitive load, situational interest, motivation, and achievement. One hundred twenty seven college undergraduate students enrolled in four ""Computer literacy"" classes participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of the six conditions in which on-screen images (image vs. no image) and narrations of a pedagogical agent (human voice narration, on-screen text, no narration) were presented in different levels. The results indicated that, overall, the presence of images does not significantly affect perceived cognitive load, situational interest, motivation, or achievement. However, the form of narration influenced the four outcome measures differently. The use of human voice narrations presented by a pedagogical agent was effective to reduce the perceived cognitive load compared to on-screen text narration and no narration conditions. Human voice narration by a pedagogical agent was also found to promote learners' situational interest, which is negatively correlated to cognitive load. The personalized narration was found to improve learners' motivation in terms of relevance and confidence whether presented by a pedagogical agent or in on-screen text although no significant differences were found in the recall test and the comprehension test.","Park, S.",1,,1570
4369,Designing a Chatbot for a Brief Motivational Interview on Stress Management: Qualitative Case Study,"Background: In addition to addiction and substance abuse, motivational interviewing (MI) is increasingly being integrated in treating other clinical issues such as mental health problems. Most of the many technological adaptations of MI, however, have focused on delivering the action-oriented treatment, leaving its relational component unexplored or vaguely described. This study intended to design a conversational sequence that considers both technical and relational components of MI for a mental health concern. Objective: This case study aimed to design a conversational sequence for a brief motivational interview to be delivered by a Web-based text messaging application (chatbot) and to investigate its conversational experience with graduate students in their coping with stress. Methods: A brief conversational sequence was designed with varied combinations of MI skills to follow the 4 processes of MI. A Web-based text messaging application, Bonobot, was built as a research prototype to deliver the sequence in a conversation. A total of 30 full-time graduate students who self-reported stress with regard to their school life were recruited for a survey of demographic information and perceived stress and a semistructured interview. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by Braun and Clarke's thematic method. The themes that reflect the process of, impact of, and needs for the conversational experience are reported. Results: Participants had a high level of perceived stress (mean 22.5 [SD 5.0]). Our findings included the following themes: Evocative Questions and Cliched Feedback; Self-Reflection and Potential Consolation; and Need for Information and Contextualized Feedback. Participants particularly favored the relay of evocative questions but were less satisfied with the agent-generated reflective and affirming feedback that filled in-between. Discussing the idea of change was a good means of reflecting on themselves, and some of Bonobot's encouragements related to graduate school life were appreciated. Participants suggested the conversation provide informational support, as well as more contextualized feedback. Conclusions: A conversational sequence for a brief motivational interview was presented in this case study. Participant feedback suggests sequencing questions and MI-adherent statements can facilitate a conversation for stress management, which may encourage a chance of self-reflection. More diversified sequences, along with more contextualized feedback, should follow to offer a better conversational experience and to confirm any empirical effect.","Park, S.",0,10.2196/12231,1571

The VTS is a web-based peer-tutoring environment in which students teach a virtual tutee about the content in course readings that students have been assigned to learn. With the VTS, students interact with virtual tutees by providing lecture notes and answering questions from these tutees. The initial prototype of the VTS was implemented and evaluated through two field trials in a college classroom. The purposes of the two field trials were to assess the efficacy of the VTS and improve its design. In the first field trial, students successfully completed the VTS and showed a deeper engagement in reading with the use of the VTS, but reported several design issues. Based on findings from the first trial, two modifications in the VTS design were made. In the second field trial, students used the revised VTS. They expressed enjoyment in teaching their virtual tutees and appreciated the value of the VTS. They also demonstrated a significant increase in their reading strategy use.

Results indicated that students were behaviorally and cognitively engaged in reading with use of the VTS. Also, the study found a significant improvement in students' emotional engagement in reading after using the VTS. Limited support was found for enhancement of reading performance with repeated use of the VTS. Implications of the study findings are discussed, and suggestions for future research are provided.

4381,,"In the simulation of human crowd behavior including evacuation planning, transportation management, and safety engineering in architecture design, the development of pedestrian model for higher behavior fidelity is an important task. To construct plausible facsimiles of real crowd movements, simulations should exhibit human behaviors for navigation, pedestrian decision-making, and social behaviors such as grouping and crowding. The research field is quite mature in some sense, with a large number of approaches that have been proposed to path finding, collision avoidance, and visually pleasing steering behaviors of virtual humans. However, there is still a clear disparity between the variety of approaches and the quality of crowd behaviors in simulations. Many social science field studies inform us that crowds are typically composed of multiple social groups (James, 1953; Coleman and James, 1961; Aveni, 1977). These observations indicate that one component of the complexity of crowd dynamics emerges from the presence of various patterns of social interactions within small groups that make up the crowd. Hence, realism in a crowd simulation may be enhanced when virtual characters are organized in multiple social groups, and exhibit human-like coordination behaviors. Motivated by the need for modeling groups in a crowd, we present a multi-agent model for large crowd simulations that incorporates socially plausible group behaviors. A computational model for multi-agent coordination and interaction informed by well-established Common Ground theory (Clark, 1996; Clark and Brennan, 1991) is proposed. In our approach, the task of navigation in a group is viewed as performing a joint activity which requires maintaining a state of common ground among group members regarding walking strategies and route choices. That is, group members communicate with, and adapt their behaviors to each other in order to maintain group cohesiveness while walking. In the course of interaction, an agent may present gestures or other behavioral cues according to its communicative purpose. It also considers the spatiotemporal conditions of the agent-group's environment in which the agent interacts when selecting a kind of motions. With the incorporation of our agent model, we provide a unified framework for crowd simulation and animation which accommodates high-level socially-aware behavioral realism of animated characters. The communicative purpose and motion selection of agents are consistently carried through from simulation to animation, and a resulted sequence of animated character behaviors forms not merely a chain of reactive or random gestures but a socially meaningful interactions. We conducted several experiments in order to investigate the impact of our social group interaction model in crowd simulation and animation. By showing that group communicative behaviors have a substantial influence on the overall distribution of a crowd, we demonstrate the importance of incorporating a model of social group interaction into multi-agent simulations of large crowd behaviors. With a series of perceptual user studies, we show that our model produces more believable behaviors of animated characters from the viewpoint of human observers.","Park, Seung In",0,,1574
4382,Observing Social Exclusion Leads to Dehumanizing the Victim,"We hypothesized that observing social exclusion would influence observers' judgments of the humanness of its victims and perpetrators. Specifically, we speculated that people would attribute victims and perpetrators to lower and higher mental capacities, respectively. Participants observed a simulated computer based ball tossing game in which one of the players was either ostracized or not. They then rated the game players on traits associated with two dimensions of humanness, namely Human Nature (HN) and Human Uniqueness (HU). Overall, participants who witnessed an exclusion game judged the victim as less human on both domains compared to one of the perpetrators as well as to a player in the control condition. The perpetrator was attributed higher HN, but not significantly higher HU, compared to the control player. In addition, the less HN attributes a target was assigned, the more she was expected to be vulnerable to exploitation. On most of the other measures of target impression, however, the victim was rated more favorably than the perpetrator. The findings imply that social exclusion victims are often subtly derogated compared to the perpetrators, even while they are also more positively evaluated otherwise.","Park, Y.

It analyses the assumed pedagogical power of rewritings of international literary classics for children from the perspective of three theoretical concepts: (1) cultural transmission as a strategy of educational ambition in its capacity to serve social initiation, (2) adaptation as a transformation strategy to adjust an artefact to a specific audience, and (3) gate keepership as the determining factor in the communication situation of literature for children. Comparing original masterpieces that were originally not, or not specifically, meant for children with their derivatives sheds light on the strategies that were used to mould narratives into pedagogical examples. It shows how protagonists were educated along the lines of the ever-changing pedagogical discourse brought about by historically variable concepts of childhood and displays the transition of the educational value of subjection to external mastery to the ideal of self-mastery of the child. Moreover, it shows how rewritings not only functioned as agents in the transmission of literary artefacts, but by means of that, also provided for the transmission of culture.","Parlevliet, S.",0,10.1080/00309230.2011.633923,1576

Although the most persuasive interfaces are often the most humanlike, they incur the greatest risk of falling into the uncanny valley, the loss of empathy associated with eerily human characters. Previous studies have compared interfaces on the left side of the uncanny valley, namely, those with low human likeness. To examine interfaces with higher human realism, two between-groups factorial experiments were conducted through the Internet. The first experiment involved 426 Midwestern US undergraduate students. This experiment presented a hypothetical ethical dilemma followed by the advice of an authority figure. The authority was manipulated in three ways: depiction (recorded human or animated avatar), motion quality (smooth or jerky), and recommendation (disclose or refrain from disclosing sensitive information). Of these, only the recommendation changed opinion about the ethical dilemma, even though the animated depiction was significantly eerier than the human depiction. These results indicate that compliance with an authority persists even when using an uncannily realistic computer-animated double. The uncanny valley also predicts that humanlike agents with nonhuman features will be evaluated negatively. However, it is unclear whether this effect persists across differently framed interactions. A second (posttest-only) experiment was conducted with 311 Midwestern US undergraduates. Participants were assigned one of two novel dilemmas in professional ethics involving the fate of a humanlike agent. In addition to the dilemma, there were three 2-level manipulations of the agent's human realism: depiction (animated human or humanoid robot), voice (recorded or synthesized), and motion (smooth or jerky). In one dilemma, decreasing depiction realism or increasing voice realism increased eeriness. In the other dilemma, increasing depiction realism decreased perceived competence. In both dilemmas human realism had no significant effect on whether to punish the agent. Instead, the willingness to punish was predicted most reliably by the agent's narratively framed autonomy and credibility, demonstrating strong effects of narratives on responses to humanlike agents. Though perceptible in humanlike interfaces, the uncanny valley's effect on persuasiveness is attenuated by contextual information.","Patel, Himalaya",0,,1578

4392,,"Data plays a crucial role in all types of cross-organizational research and applications. The grid is an effective infrastructure for the coordinated use and sharing of distributed resources in a dynamic manner enabling the temporary pooling of resources to solve specific problems. Data grids rely on the coordinated sharing of and interaction across multiple autonomous database management systems to provide transparent access to heterogeneous and autonomous data resources stored in grid nodes. As data may distribute across multiple geographical locations and use different storage formats and access mechanisms, a solution to facilitate data access, integration and sharing would be advantageous and can be modeled by integrating the concept of an agent. An agent is a piece of software program which acts proactively on behalf of the user. Agents can be used in complex systems where expertise and resources are distributed like database grid. The agent paradigm is successfully employed in those applications where autonomous, heterogeneous, loosely-coupled, and distributed resources and systems need to interoperate in order to achieve a common goal. Moreover, the grid community has historically focused on “brawn” i.e. interoperable infrastructure and tools for secure and reliable resource sharing within dynamic and geographically distributed Virtual Organizations (VOs), and applications of the same to various resource federation scenarios. Agent community has focused on “brains” i.e., on the development of methodologies, theories, algorithms and concepts for autonomous problem solvers that can act flexibly in uncertain and dynamic environments in order to achieve their aims and objectives. Agent systems require robust infrastructure and grid systems require autonomous, flexible behaviors. Therefore, this research work aims at providing an integrated approach to impart multi-agent knowledge-based systems in data grid to leverage the power of both grid and agent technology. Apart from this, organizations generally strive for the data for analysis and decision making purposes. In any organization, such heterogeneous and geographically separated data are required on a real time basis for analysis and decision making. Knowledge-based system is used to provide intelligent decisions with justification. It is a system that draws upon the knowledge of human experts captured in a knowledge base to solve problems that normally require human expertise. Knowledge-based system can be implemented with the concept of an expert system. The expert system technology can be implemented by incorporating fuzzy logic to handle qualitative and uncertain facts in the decision making process. Fuzzy set theory and rules can be used to achieve the benefits of the knowledge-based systems. The objective of the research work is to develop a generic framework of multi-agent knowledge-based system accessing heterogeneous and geographically distributed databases within the data grid environment. As, data grid is a grid computing system that deals with large amounts of controlled, shared and managed distributed data and a software agent exhibits some form of artificial intelligence to assist users and acts on their behalf in performing various tasks, this research is carried out to integrate data grid technology with agent technology which can be useful in research, education and business fields. Also, the aim is to develop the fuzzy expert system modeled by incorporating agents on the top of the distributed database grid. It aims to accommodate the knowledge and expertise with reasoning capabilities that will provide a great support to executives for decision making in any research and commercial applications. The resulting framework hides the heterogeneity and provides transparent and single point access of heterogeneous and geographically distributed databases to client applications and users and handles the data access and integration through multiple collaborative agents.

With queer theories of color, critical communication pedagogy, and public pedagogy theories providing support, I utilize qualitative interviews fore-fronting poetic transcription of personal narratives in order to explore how queer gender performers of color engage in intersectional queer negotiations of identities and provide new possibilities for the everyday performance of queer identities. I call upon existing scholarship in queer gender performance in order to prove the centrality of such performances to queer social life, as well as the potential of queer gender performers to co-construct critical consciousness with audiences around intersecting categories of identity like race. Ultimately, I build on previously published work in Communication in order to build a case for how queer gender performance serves as a form of public pedagogy through which audiences and performers theorize and embody queer subjectivities. This proposed study is fundamentally critical, intended to expose and transform social inequalities in queer communities and to expand academic conversations around queerness and social justice. Ultimately, I contend that each queer gender performer of color I interviewed espouses a deeply personal form of public pedagogy that works to disrupt the whiteness that governs queer performance spaces and empowers audiences to do the same in their everyday lives. Onstage and off, queer gender performers of color engage in celebration of racialized queer identities, encouraging one another to honor difficult paths toward performance and the legacies they will leave. These performers practice active resistance to the glorification of whiteness in queer gender performance culture, their brown bodies living testaments to the contrary. At last, together, these performers have become agents of change through performance, intent on speaking to audiences in ways that illuminate their collective struggles and unstoppable, collective strength. This study is but one forum through which academics and activists alike can begin to unpack the collective potential of queer gender performers of color not only speak back to silence and erasure, but to disrupt privilege, transform existing spaces, and empower audiences and one another to accept no less than absolute creative and political agency.","Pattisapu, Krishna",0,,1582
4397,Sociality Motivation and Anthropomorphic Thinking about Pets,"Sociality motivation, the need to feel socially connected with others, has been proposed as an important determinant of individual variation in anthropomorphic thinking. Specifically, it has been suggested that people who are socially isolated or disconnected will tend to infer more human-like mental states in animals and other nonhuman agents (computers, robots, metaphysical beings, etc.), than those who have higher levels of contact with other people. We investigated this hypothesis in a community-based sample of cat and dog owners, measuring degree of anthropomorphism by asking them which emotions they believed their pet was capable of experiencing, how likely they were to rely on it for social support, and how attached they were to it. Structural measures of social disconnection, including the number of other adults living in the household and the number of social contacts outside the home, were not generally associated with the tendency to think anthropomorphically about pets. However, owners living in households with no children (under the age of 16 years) reported higher levels of attachment to their pet than did those with children (B = 1.678, p < 0.001), and felt that they derived relatively more social support from it than they did from humans (F-(1,F-244) = 4.997, p < 0.05, partial eta(2) = 0.020). In addition, a trait-based indicator of social disconnection (self-reported anxiety about human social relationships) was associated with a heightened tendency for owners to report turning to their pet for support (F-(1,F-244) = 19.617, p < 0.001, partial eta(2) = 0.074), and attributing more human-like emotions to it (F-(1,F-244) = 8.354, P < 0.005, partial eta(2) = 0.033), These findings support a link between social disconnection and anthropomorphic thinking in a community setting; they also suggest that different forms of social disconnection (structural and trait-based) may generate different types of sociality motivation, and thereby influence different facets of anthropomorphic thinking.","Paul, E.

Recently however, the number of cases resulting from Candida glabrata has risen. This is alarming because C. glabrata exhibits innate and acquired resistance to clinically used therapeutics. DHFR is an essential enzyme in the folate pathway and a well-established drug target. A library of novel propargyl-linked antifolates was tested against CgDHFR and CaDHFR with best compounds exhibiting 0.55-22 nM potency and >40-fold selectivity albeit low solubility (∼20 μg/mL) and modest antifungal activity against C. albicans (≥23 μg/mL). Aided by virtual lead optimization, steps were taken to improve solubility by developing the heterocyclic series of propargyl-linked inhibitors. This series showed improved solubility but at the expense of selectivity, exhibiting a complete loss of selectivity in several cases. The heterocyclic series also show no improvement in antifungal activity against C. albicans. Further in silico work showed that the current strategy for selectivity, optimizing ligand size, will continue to yield suboptimal results. A new series of para-substituted propargyl-linked compounds was designed and evaluated with the goal of improving antifungal activity against C. albicans. Excitingly, this series shows activity equal to or better than that of clinically used antifungal therapeutics for C. albicans and C. glabrata (< 1μg/mL), good solubility parameters (cLogP 3.4-3.8), nanomolar potency (23-55 nM) and 13 to 30-fold selectivity against huDHFR.

We make three contributions. First, we provide a necessary condition for incentive compatibility that takes the form of an envelope formula for the derivative of an agent's equilibrium expected payoff with respect to his current type. It combines the familiar marginal effect of types on payoffs with novel marginal effects of the current type on future ones that are captured by impulse response functions. The formula yields an expression for dynamic virtual surplus that is instrumental to the design of optimal mechanisms and to the study of distortions under such mechanisms. Second, we characterize the transfers that satisfy the envelope formula and establish a sense in which they are pinned down by the allocation rule (revenue equivalence). Third, we characterize perfect Bayesian equilibrium-implementable allocation rules in Markov environments, which yields tractable sufficient conditions that facilitate novel applications. We illustrate the results by applying them to the design of optimal mechanisms for the sale of experience goods (bandit auctions).","Pavan, A.",0,10.3982/ecta10269,1585

The attempt to derive Grice's principles from game theory is a natural step, since its aim is to predict the behaviour of rational agents in situations where the outcome of one agent's choice depends also on the choices of others. Generalised conversational implicatures, and in particular scalar ones, offer an ideal test bed for this working hypothesis, since with this kind of implicatures the alternative choices available to the agents are less dependent on context, and they can be derived from the meanings of the sentences employed. Some rival game-theoretic accounts of the same phenomena will be criticised. The present paper shows that scalar implicatures can be explained using iterated admissibility, but that some of these need an additional assumption in order to be accounted for.","Pavan, S.",0,10.1007/s10988-013-9138-0,1586

Here, we combined immersive virtual reality and EEG recording to explore whether embodying the errors of an avatar by seeing it from a first-person perspective may activate the error monitoring system in the brain of an onlooker. We asked healthy participants to observe, from a first- or third-person perspective, an avatar performing a correct or an incorrect reach-to-grasp movement toward one of two virtual mugs placed on a table. At the end of each trial, participants reported verbally how much they embodied the avatar’s arm. Ratings were maximal in first-person perspective, indicating that immersive virtual reality can be a powerful tool to induce embodiment of an artificial agent, even through mere visual perception and in the absence of any cross-modal boosting. Observation of erroneous grasping from a first-person perspective enhanced error-related negativity and medial–frontal theta power in the trials where human onlookers embodied the virtual character, hinting at the tight link between early, automatic coding of error detection and sense of embodiment. Error positivity was similar in 1PP and 3PP, suggesting that conscious coding of errors is similar for self and other. Thus, embodiment plays an important role in activating specific components of the action monitoring system when others’ errors are coded as if they are one’s own errors.

4414,,"This research applies psychological theory to human-computer interaction and the creation of a virtual assistant (VA) for use in self-‐service checkouts (SSCOs). Existing research investigating the impact of interface agents and avatars in virtual shopping, gaming, and teaching environments presents a range of findings, yet there is comparatively little investigating the impact of a VA in kiosk-based applications. Based on the premise that human-computer interaction resembles human-human interaction, the potential cognitive and social benefits of implementing a visually present VA in SSCOs are examined. Further, this research addresses how the impact of VAs is affected by its gender and human­‐likeness. To this end, this thesis brings together two lines of research: human-likeness (in the human-computer interaction literature) and gender (in the psychology literature). Through four studies, it is demonstrated that a VA's similarity to the user, in terms of gender and human-likeness, has an impact on performance with, attitudes towards, and willingness to use a VA. The first study showed automatic orienting to onscreen locations indicated by the gaze of an animated human-like virtual character. Observers could also respond to this cue based on their own knowledge and goals (unlike peripheral cues or a static virtual character). In the second study, women strongly preferred to gender-match with their VAs, but this did not affect their reaction times in a visual search task; men showed no overall preference for gender but were sometimes slower to respond when a female VA was on screen. The tendency to gender-match in males steadily decreased with age, such that the majority of younger males preferred to gender-match whilst the majority of older males preferred to interact with a female VA. Both men and women preferred more realistic VAs, resulting in faster reaction times. The third study focussed on the development of a questionnaire for measuring perceived VA usability and credibility, and, after reliability and validity testing, offered a new measure for assessing these perceptions. This measure consisted of four sub-constructs: warmth and capacity (sub-constructs of credibility) and usefulness and ease-of-use (sub-constructs of usability). Responses to items evaluated in Study 3, in parallel with Study 4, showed that similar agents tend to be perceived as warmer, higher in capacity, and more useful – but only when participants were assigned a gender-matched, humanoid VA. When participants chose their VA, similarity had no impact on the newly developed scales for measuring perceived usability and credibility. Moreover, the positive ratings of similar VAs that had been assigned to participants did not impact willingness to take its advice; in direct contrast, when participants had chosen their VA, positive ratings of the VA (regardless of similarity) correlated with willingness to take its advice. Finally, consistent with the findings of Chapter 4, female participants who chose their VAs tended to gender-‐match (to the equal exclusion of the male and non-human VAs) and half the male participants tended to choose a male VA. Unexpectedly, this was followed by a preference for the non-human, non-gendered VA rather than for the female VA, attributed to its novelty. In general, participants tended to choose a VA taking human form, rating these options more attractive and likable. Overall, the results suggest a preference for and performance-based benefit of human-like VAs. Preferences for VA gender can be interpreted in terms of differential social networking strategies employed by men and women. The research also shows that the perceptions, preferences, and behaviours induced by a VA that is matched to the user (in terms of gender and human- likeness) are not always in line. Thus, retailers should weigh the importance of each of these outcomes (e.g. perceptions of usability or checkout speed) before choosing VA gender and its level of human-likeness, or should allow users to make their own decisions about the a","Payne, Jeunese Adrienne",0,,1588
4415,,"This article is concerned with the generic structure of the motion coordination system resulting from the application of the method of virtual holonomic constraints (VHCs) to the problem of the generation and robust execution of a dynamic humanlike motion by a humanoid robot. The motion coordination developed using VHCs is based on a motion generator equation, which is a scalar nonlinear differential equation of second order. It can be considered equivalent in function to a central pattern generator in living organisms. The relative time evolution of the degrees of freedom of a humanoid robot during a typical motion are specified by a set of coordination functions that uniquely define the overall pattern of the motion. This is comparable to a hypothesis on the existence of motion patterns in biomechanics. A robust control is derived based on a transverse linearization along the configuration manifold defined by the coordination functions. It is shown that the derived coordination and control architecture possesses excellent robustness properties. The analysis is performed on an example of a real human motion recorded in test experiments.

4422,,"Motivation: Cerebral aneurysms have presented considerable challenges to effective treatment since their first clinical observation. For some 100 years the only clinical solution was dangerous and often debilitating open-surgery in the form of a craniotomy. The safety and efficiency of cerebral aneurysm treatment was greatly improved in the early-1990s with the introduction of minimally invasive procedures such as endovascular coiling. The development in the mid-2000s of low-porosity stents, known as flow-diverters, presented a more sophisticated treatment rationale that focussed on vessel reconstruction, and addressed cases that would otherwise be problematic to treat by other endovascular means. However, current designs of flow-diverter (and all known designs in development) are limited to near-identical products that risk under-exploiting the potential benefits of the treatment method. These devices are of a cylindrical, woven construction that necessitates a fixed mesh design, which means that any variation in design focusses on device porosity alone. As such, the precise hemodynamic mechanisms, and the resulting quality of aneurysm treatment by flow-diverter, are under-developed and poorly understood. There is also concern in the clinical community that the cylindrical nature of current flow-diverter devices may lead to daughter vessel sacrifice when used to treat bifurcation aneurysms. This thesis specifically focusses on the effect of flow-diverter mesh topology on the complex hemodynamic environment within the treated aneurysm, and the resulting implications for treatment success. Methodology: In this study, a number of both novel and commercially available flow-diverter designs are virtually implanted into idealised and patient-specific aneurysm geometries. These devices are then modelled under realistic blood flow conditions with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The devices chosen encapsulate a range of features that allow the effects of device porosity and device mesh design to be controlled for and evaluated independently. Conventional cylindrical devices are also compared to a novel, non-cylindrical device for the dedicated treatment of bifurcation aneurysms. The aneurysm hemodynamic environment both pre- and post-treatment is quantified with a number of in-silico measures, such as flow rate, velocity, pressure, and wall shear stress. Finally, a model of angiographic contrast agent transport is developed in-silico to begin to verify the complex flow patterns predicted by CFD simulations with the corresponding in-vivo behaviour seen clinically. A number of inaccuracies of previous 'virtual contrast' models, as presented in the literature, are addressed and quantified by comparison to a gold-standard in-vivo porcine model. Results: In a number of aneurysm geometries, novel flow-diverter designs are shown to out-perform current commercially available devices. The strong influence of device porosity on aneurysm inflow reduction is confirmed with a 10% decrease in device porosity correlating with around 10-20% reduction in inflow. Variation attributed to device design alone is also seen; in a number of geometries, differences in flow-diverter mesh design, at constant porosity, are shown to introduce approximately 10-30% variation in aneurysm inflow reduction. Such variation is significant and potentially very important to the development of future endovascular treatment devices. The greatest variation in inflow reduction seen across the device designs also corresponds to changes in vorticity and secondary flow effects. The flow reduction achieved by the novel bifurcation aneurysm device discussed compares favourably to conventional devices in half of the geometries simulated, achieving a flow reduction of approximately 30-70%. Across all bifurcation aneurysms studied, conventional devices produce a relatively uniform flow reduction of 50-70%. Little change in flow rates for vessels jailed by a conventional flow diverter suggest that concerns of daughter vessel sacrifice appear unfounded, at le","Peach, Thomas W.",0,,1590
4423,,"Electroacoustic music is often regarded as not being sufficiently accessible to the general public because of its sound-based abstract quality and the complexity of its language. Live electronic music introduces the figure of the performer as a gestural bodily agent that re-enables our multimodal perception of sound and seems to alleviate the accessibility dilemma. However, live electronic music generally lacks the level of detail found in studio-based fixed media works, and it can hardly be transferred outside the concert hall situation (e.g. as a video recording) without losing most of its fresh, dynamic and unpredictable nature.Recent developments in 3D simulation environments and game audio technologies suggest that alternative approaches to music composition and distribution are possible, presenting an opportunity to address some of these issues. In particular, this Portfolio of Compositions proposes the use of real and virtual space as a new medium for the creation and organisation of sound events via computer-simulated audio-sources. In such a context, the role of the performer is sometimes assumed by the listener itself, through the operation of an interactive-adaptive system, or it is otherwise replaced by a set of automated but flexible procedures. Although all of these works are sonic centric in nature, they often present a visual component that reinforces the multimodal perception of meaningful musical structures, either as real space locations for sonic navigation (locative audio), or live visualisations of physically-informed gestural agents in 3D virtual environments. Consequently, this thesis draws on general game-audio concepts and terminology, such as procedural sound, non-linearity, and generative music; but it also embraces game development tools (game engines) as a new methodological and technological approach to electroacoustic music composition. In such context, space and the real-time generation, control, and manipulation of assets combine to play an important role in broadening the routes of musical expression and the accessibility of the musical language.The portfolio consists of six original compositions. Three of these works-Swirls, Alice - Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady, and Alcazabilla-are interactive in nature and they required the creation of custom software solutions (e.g. Sonic: Maps) in order to deal with open-form musical structures. The last three pieces-Singularity, Apollonian Gasket, and Boids-are based on fractal or emergent behaviour models and algorithms, and they propose a non-interactive linear organisation of sound materials via real-time manipulation of non-conventional 3D virtual instruments. These original instrumental models exhibit strong spatial and kinematic qualities with an abstract and minimal visual representation, resulting in an extremely efficient way to build spatialisation patterns, texture, and musical gesture, while preserving the sonic-centric essence of the pieces.","Pecino Rodríguez, José Ignacio",0,,1591
4424,,"This paper introduces virtual reality as an experimental method for the language sciences and provides a review of recent studies using the method to answer fundamental, psycholinguistic research questions. It is argued that virtual reality demonstrates that ecological validity and experimental control should not be conceived of as two extremes on a continuum, but rather as two orthogonal factors. Benefits of using virtual reality as an experimental method include that in a virtual environment, as in the real world, there is no artificial spatial divide between participant and stimulus. Moreover, virtual reality experiments do not necessarily have to include a repetitive trial structure or an unnatural experimental task. Virtual agents outperform experimental confederates in terms of the consistency and replicability of their behavior, allowing for reproducible science across participants and research labs. The main promise of virtual reality as a tool for the experimental language sciences, however, is that it shifts theoretical focus towards the interplay between different modalities (e.g., speech, gesture, eye gaze, facial expressions) in dynamic and communicative real-world environments, complementing studies that focus on one modality (e.g., speech) in isolation.

4425,The design and effect of automated directions during scenario-based training,"During scenario-based training, the scenario is dynamically adapted in real time to control the storyline and increase its effectiveness. A team of experienced staff members is required to manage and perform the adaptations. They manipulate the storyline and the level of support during their role-play of important characters in the scenario. The costs of training could be reduced if the adaptation is automated by using intelligent agent technology to control the characters within a virtual training environment (a serious game). However, such a system also needs a didactical component to monitor the trainee and determine necessary adaptations to the scenario. This paper investigates the automation of didactical knowledge and the corresponding dynamic adaptation of the scenario. A so-called director decides upon and distributes the necessary changes in real-time to the characters. First, the nature and goals of the adaptations are analyzed. Subsequently, the paper introduces a conducted study into the applicability of directable scenarios. Thereafter, an experiment is introduced that investigates the effects of directorial interventions upon the instructive quality of the scenario. Qualitative results indicated that trainees experienced scenario-based training to be instructive and motivating. Moreover, quantitative results showed that instructors rated directed scenarios as significantly better attuned to the trainee's needs compared to non-directed scenarios. Our future research will focus at the design of an architecture for automatically directed scenario-based training. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

4429,,"Gaze is a fundamental component of communicatively effective character animation. In animated film and other non-interactive media, a character's gaze can capture the viewer's attention and convey the character's personality and intent, while interactive virtual characters can use gaze cues to enhance their social interactions with users. In all these contexts, the character's nonverbal attending behavior can be realized as a sequence of directed gaze shifts—coordinated movements of the eyes, head, torso, and the whole body toward targets in the scene. This dissertation introduces new methods for synthesis of directed gaze shifts for animated characters. The methods can synthesize a wide range of gaze movements—from subtle saccades and glances, to whole-body turns. Experiments are presented showing how virtual agents can use these movements as effective social signals in interactions with humans. Furthermore, an approach is introduced for gaze animation authoring for non-interactive scenarios, which uses directed gaze shifts as authoring primitives. It is empirically demonstrated that the new approach reduces the cost of animation authoring and improves its scalability.","Pejsa, Tomislav",0,,1594

Traditional approaches for team coordination require a lot of inter-agent electronic communication and often result in wasted effort. Methods that reduce inter-agent communication and conflicts are likely to increase productivity of virtual teams. In this research, we propose an evolutionary genetic algorithm (GA) based intelligent agent that learns a team member preferences from past actions, and develops a team-coordination schedule by minimizing schedule conflicts between different members serving on a virtual team. Using a discrete event simulation methodology, we test the proposed intelligent agent on different virtual teams of sizes two, four, six and eight members. The results of our experiments indicate that the GA-based intelligent agent learns individual team member preferences and generates a team-coordination schedule at a lower inter-agent communication cost.

4457,Teaching the Next Generation of Transdisciplinary Thinkers and Practitioners of Design-Based Public and Social Innovation,"Amidst a wide range of complex social issues and public governance challenges, both in the United States and internationally, there is an increasing interest in the public sector around the idea of social innovation, particularly design-based social innovation. There has been a proliferation of sites and spaces (""public innovation places"") in which designers have joined a multiplicity of actors all working to innovate new approaches to the provision of public goods. To train future designers adequately to operate within this new environment, it is imperative to rethink the ways in which we as design educators think through and approach issues of social and political complexity, and how we frame those in the context of studio projects. For the past five years, the Parsons DESIS Lab has been working through this question focusing on design for social innovation, dealing with community organizations, not -for -profits and the public sector to build new capacities, skillsets, and roles for design practitioners in order to position them as contributing agents of change. In this article we discuss the pedagogical opportunities, limits, and difficulties around the training of future transdisciplinary designers and thinkers seeking to address a range of complex social and political issues and willing to operate within the interstitials spaces between government, civil society, and the market, where new social innovations may arise. To do so, we will focus on a Fall 2013 studio course taught at Parsons Transdisciplinary Design MFA Program entitled ""The NYC Office of Public Imagination"". The challenge was for students to design a hypothetical governmental agency, find a place for it inside the existing structure and parameters of city government, and imagine what that agency would do using design as a catalyst for social innovation.","Penin, L.",0,10.1080/17547075.2015.1105564,1598
4460,Integrating social power into the decision-making of cognitive agents,"Social power is a pervasive feature with acknowledged impact in a multitude of social processes. However, despite its importance, common approaches to social power interactions in multi-agent systems are rather simplistic and lack a full comprehensive view of the processes involved. In this work, we integrated a comprehensive model of social power dynamics into a cognitive agent architecture based on an operationalization of different bases of social power inspired by theoretical background research in social psychology. The model was implemented in an agent framework that was subsequently used to generate the behavior of virtual characters in an interactive virtual environment. We performed a user study to assess users' perceptions of the agents and found evidence supporting both the social power capabilities provided by the model and their value for the creation of believable and interesting scenarios. We expect that these advances and the collected evidence can be used to support the development of agent systems with an enriched capacity for social agent simulation. (C) 2016 The Authors.

4463,Animacy-Based Accessibility and Competition in Relative Clause Production in Hindi and Malayalam,"Two studies investigated interaction of animacy-based accessibility and competition processes with language specific constraints in shaping production preferences. Relative clause elicitation tasks (Gennari et al. in Cogn Psychol 65:141-176, 2012) were performed by two groups with 40 participants in each. Significantly more passives were produced with animate question/focus and assigned subject function to them in Malayalam, while the difference was insignificant in Hindi with animacy not equating with grammatical function assignment. Both languages produced active objects with OSV order significantly more with animate question/focus. This indicates animacy effect on word order. Animacy also influenced the expression of the agent phase in both languages as a tendency was found to omit the agent by-phase or to delay its appearance, when the two animate nouns entering into the structure are highly similar. The results point to language specific constraints in relative clause production and variability in the role of animacy-based retrieval order across languages.","Perera, C.

4467,An exploratory study on how children interact with pedagogic conversational agents,"A pedagogic conversational agent (PCA) can be defined as a computer system that interacts with the student in natural language assuming the role of the instructor, a student or a companion. It can have a personality and can generate different sentences according to the agent or the student mood. Empathy with the students' feelings seems to increase their motivation to study. However, the influence of the agent personality and role as well as the students' opinion is still unclear. Therefore, in this article, it is explored with the help of a field experiment, for the first time, how these factors can affect the interaction of children with PCAs, and their opinions according to an anonymous and voluntary opinion questionnaire and some personal interviews.","Perez-Marin, D.",1,10.1080/0144929x.2012.687774,1602
4469,From media planner to media expert: The digital effect in advertising,"The increase in online audience and the development of Big Data in organizations modify the media planning activity and, consequently, the profile of the planner. Following the digital expansion, more information has become available to perform this task, but also, more complexity is observed in the work processes and in their agents' structures. This paper analyzes the changes produced in the management of the media planner within the digital society. Through triangular research, comprising quantitative and qualitative methods, including a questionnaire that was administered to 140 media planners, and 5 interviews conducted with agency experts we examine the variations that have occurred in this professional role in terms of knowledge, the tools used and the skills they have had to maintain or update. It is noted that the adaptation to the digital context has required a substantial change in their work mechanics, the integration of off- and online strategies and digital specialization. Furthermore, with the help of current technology, immediate actions and reviews are implemented. Consequently, the media expert activity requires mastery of digital media planning tools, greater doses of innovation, analysis, business acumen and the ability to work effectively in multidisciplinary teams for multimedia environments.","Perlado-Lamo-de-Espinosa, M.",0,10.3916/c59-2019-10,1603

The framework describes the subject matter knowledge, orientations, curricular knowledge, and instructional strategies needed for teachers to enact sustainability education in diverse school environments.

4473,Changing Their Minds: Enhancing Poststroke Occupational Performance Using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation,"Stroke remains a leading cause of disability, with survivors experiencing long-term decrements in independence and quality of life. Occupational therapists (OTs) employ numerous neurorehabilitative treatment approaches to remediate impairments that are impeding performance. OTs also use physical agent modalities to facilitate increased participation and success in therapy. One such modality is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form a noninvasive brain stimulation that can be overlaid onto task practice and delivers a constant, low intensity current into the brain. tDCS is safe, portable, and efficacious in remediating a variety of deficits, yet is not consistently incorporated into clinical practice.

4478,,"Biomedical science can be characterized as the pursuit of deeper, more useful mechanistic insight into biological phenomena to facilitate advancing health. In silico modeling and simulation can accelerate this process when models are designed for particular use cases aimed at challenging explanatory, mechanistic hypotheses. Modeling and simulation is ubiquitous in biology. Yet, a mental gap exists between computational versus wet-lab models in terms of their perceived scientific usefulness. Bridging this gap requires focusing on computational models as scientific tools that can explore and challenge explanatory, mechanistic hypotheses. I begin by exploring the roles of computational, mechanistic models in science and their relationship to traditional wet-lab science. I analyze biological modeling and simulation from a philosophy of science perspective, culminating in a requirements list for computational models that are to be scientifically useful. To fulfill these requirements, I present the synthetic analog approach, a developing simulation methodology for simulating complex, multi-scale biological systems, and discuss agent-based modeling as an appropriate modeling formalism. I then extend this approach to include the development and execution of virtual biomedical experiments, which are simulations of wet-lab or clinical biomedical experiments. Executing virtual biomedical experiments allows one to mimic all relevant aspects of the wet-lab scientific process—from hypothesis formation to data analysis, and key concepts in between. I envision virtual experimentation not as a supplement to traditional wet-lab experimentation, but rather as an essential part of the scientific method itself. I demonstrate the above methodology and virtual experiment vision by developing software analogs that quantitatively mimic wet-lab experiments related to drug metabolism, drug-induced toxicity, and immune system interactions with the liver. I use these models to explore several mechanistic hypotheses, reaching several validation milestones and falsifying several mechanistic explanations along the way. I highlight the importance of modularity in achieving the above vision, and develop a modularization approach to facilitate model reuse and repurposing. Finally, I discuss important technical issues in agent-based modeling and offer practical solutions. Taken together, this dissertation aims to demonstrate and lay the preliminary groundwork for engineering scientifically useful virtual biomedical experiments.","Petersen, Brenden Kyle",0,,1606
4479,,"Studies of musical agency have been growing in the field of music theory since the publication of Edward T. Cone's book The Composer's Voice (1974). Indeed, recent publications by scholars such as Robert Hatten and Seth Monahan demonstrate that musical agency continues to be a topic worthy of investigation today. These authors tend to explore the function of agents within a piece, virtually ignoring the way agents arise in music. In this dissertation I work toward a solution to this problem by developing a theory of musical agency that explores the following questions: (1) How do virtual agents emerge in music? (2) What is the relationship between agency and narrative? (3) Can virtual agents influence music at levels deeper than the surface? I propose that the concept of musical intention provides music theorists with a possible answer to this question. Action Theory, a robust subfield active in philosophy and sociology, views intentionality as a focal point in research on human agency—research that deserves more attention in studies of musical agency. Following assertions by action theorists Donald Davidson and Alfred Mele, I argue that an entity only attains the status of an agent when it performs an intentional act. With respect to music, then, I outline six categories of intentionality that can offer support to an agential hearing: gesture, contradiction of musical forces, unexpected event, conflict, repetition/restatement, and change of state. Further, I suggest that certain passages of music can be interpreted as intentional acts performed by virtual musical agents. I begin by reviewing the literature surrounding Action Theory in philosophy and sociology, and Agency in music theory in Chapter One. After defining each category of intentionality in Chapter Two, I investigate how the categories of intentionality interact with recent theories of musical narrative and Schenkerian analysis in Chapter Three. To demonstrate how my insights apply to analysis, I examine Beethoven's Bagatelle Op. 126, No. 2 and Mendelssohn's Song Without Words Op. 30, No. 6. These two analyses also serve as an introduction to the way in which my methodology is applied in analysis. In Chapter Four, I use the categories of intentionality in combination with both narrative and Schenkerian analysis to develop an agential reading of Schubert's Piano Sonata in A, D. 959. My agential analysis adds nuance to Hatten's (1993) and Charles Fisk's (2001) readings of the work. I suggest that two agents are present at the beginning of the movement, and I investigate how these agents act throughout all four movements of the piece. In the first three movements, the two agents are in conflict with one another, and by the end of the fourth movement the two agents achieve a synthesis that resolves their conflict. Not only does an understanding of intentionality in music clarify earlier work on musical agency, but it also provides opportunities for richer interpretive analyses. To conclude my dissertation I suggest possible avenues for further investigation, and I briefly apply my methodology to a passage of post-tonal music.","Peterson, John",0,,1607
4480,Am I the Stone? Overattribution of Agency and Religious Orientation,"Atran and Norenzayan (2004) proposed that an overactive agency detection module may contribute to the nearly ubiquitous recurrence of supernatural agents across religions. Based on this, 2 studies investigated whether individual differences in the tendency to attribute agency to inanimate objects in the physical environment (an index of overattribution of agency) differentially shape articulations of the religious sentiment-specifically, the intrinsic and immanence orientations-given the distinct conceptions of spiritual agency hypothesized to be associated with each. Study 1 documented a unique positive relationship between intrinsic orientation (devout commitment to traditional orthodoxy) and numinous spiritual experiences (typified by the sense of a powerful, directive Other who is distinct from self and the world), and between immanence orientation (religiously articulated motivation to transcend intra- and interpersonal boundaries) and unitive spiritual experiences (typified by a sense of connection between self, the world, and a spiritual Source). In Study 2, higher scores on a composite overattribution of agency measure, encompassing self-reported predisposition to anthropomorphize nonanimal entities and performance-based responsiveness to gaze cues embedded in inverted faces, predicted higher immanence (but not higher intrinsic) orientation scores. Results thus offer qualified support for the overactive agency detector hypothesis: Immanence religious orientation appears to be a motivational outcome of a perceptual world that is essentially pantheistic, that is, imbued with pervasive sense of agency without regard for the default distinction between animate and inanimate.","Petrican, R.",0,10.1037/a0027942,1608
4482,,"There is ample evidence that human primates strive for social contact and experience interactions with conspecifics as intrinsically rewarding. Focusing on gaze behavior as a crucial means of human interaction, this study employed a unique combination of neuroimaging, eye-tracking, and computer-animated virtual agents to assess the neural mechanisms underlying this component of behavior. In the interaction task, participants believed that during each interaction the agent's gaze behavior could either be controlled by another participant or by a computer program. Their task was to indicate whether they experienced a given interaction as an interaction with another human participant or the computer program based on the agent's reaction. Unbeknownst to them, the agent was always controlled by a computer to enable a systematic manipulation of gaze reactions by varying the degree to which the agent engaged in joint attention. This allowed creating a tool to distinguish neural activity underlying the subjective experience of being engaged in social and non-social interaction. In contrast to previous research, this allows measuring neural activity while participants experience active engagement in real-time social interactions. Results demonstrate that gaze-based interactions with a perceived human partner are associated with activity in the ventral striatum, a core component of reward-related neurocircuitry. In contrast, interactions with a computer-driven agent activate attention networks. Comparisons of neural activity during interaction with behaviorally naïve and explicitly cooperative partners demonstrate different temporal dynamics of the reward system and indicate that the mere experience of engagement in social interaction is sufficient to recruit this system.

4489,,"Tracking eye-movements provides easy access to cognitive processes involved in visual and sensorimotor processing. More recently, the underlying neural mechanisms have been examined by combining eye-tracking and functional neuroimaging methods. Apart from extracting visual information, gaze also serves important functions in social interactions. As a deictic cue, gaze can be used to direct the attention of another person to an object. Conversely, by following other persons’ gaze we gain access to their attentional focus, which is essential for understanding their mental states. Social gaze has therefore been studied extensively to understand the social brain. In this endeavor, gaze has mostly been investigated from an observational perspective using static displays of faces and eyes. However, there is growing consent that observational paradigms are insufficient for an understanding of the neural mechanisms of social gaze behavior, which typically involve active engagement in social interactions. Recent methodological advances have allowed increasing ecological validity by studying gaze in face-to-face encounters in real-time. Such improvements include interactions using virtual agents in gaze-contingent eye-tracking paradigms, live interactions via video feeds, and dual eye-tracking in two-person setups. These novel approaches can be used to analyze brain activity related to social gaze behavior. This review introduces these methodologies and discusses recent findings on the behavioral functions and neural mechanisms of gaze processing in social interaction.

Participants were tested in a task that allowed for violating traffic rules by exploiting forbidden shortcuts in a virtual city maze. Results yielded evidence for sustained cognitive conflict that affected performance from right before a violation throughout actually committing the violation.

Virtual human faces are useful for conducting controlled experiments. However, little is known regarding the possible differences between physiological responses elicited by virtual versus real human facial expressions. The aim of the current study was to determine if virtual and real emotional faces elicit the same rapid facial reactions for the perception of facial expressions of joy, anger, and sadness. Facial electromyography (corrugator supercilii, zygomaticus major, and depressor anguli) was recorded in 30 participants during the presentation of dynamic or static and virtual or real faces. For the perception of dynamic facial expressions of joy and anger, analyses of electromyography data revealed that rapid facial reactions were stronger when participants were presented with real faces compared with virtual faces.

The aim of this study was 1) to test the performance of a diagnostic system for major depressive disorders (MDD), based on the identification by an ECA of specific symptoms (the MDD DSM 5 criteria) in outpatients; 2) to evaluate the acceptability of such an ECA. Patients completed two clinical interviews in a randomized order (ECA versus psychiatrist) and filled in the Acceptability E-scale (AES) to quantify the acceptability of the ECA. 179 outpatients were included in this study (mean age 46.5 +/- 12.9 years, 57.5% females). Among the 35 patients diagnosed with MDD by the psychiatrist, 14 (40%) patients exhibited mild, 12 (34.3%) moderate and 9 (25.7%) severe depressive symptoms. Sensitivity increased across the severity level of depressive symptoms and reached 73% for patients with severe depressive symptoms, while specificity remained above 95% for all three severity levels. The acceptability of the ECA evaluated by the AES was very good (25.4). We demonstrate here the validity and acceptability of an ECA to diagnose major depressive disorders.

4512,Beyond Verb Meaning: Experimental Evidence for Incremental Processing of Semantic Roles and Event Structure,"We present an event-related potentials (ERP) study that addresses the question of how pieces of information pertaining to semantic roles and event structure interact with each other and with the verb's meaning. Specifically, our study investigates German verb-final clauses with verbs of motion such as fliegen 'fly' and schweben 'float, hover,' which are indeterminate with respect to agentivity and event structure. Agentivity was tested by manipulating the animacy of the subject noun phrase and event structure by selecting a goal adverbial, which makes the event telic, or a locative adverbial, which leads to an atelic reading. On the clause-initial subject, inanimates evoked an N400 effect vis-a-vis animates. On the adverbial phrase in the atelic (locative) condition, inanimates showed an N400 in comparison to animates. The telic (goal) condition exhibited a similar amplitude like the inanimate-atelic condition. Finally, at the verbal lexeme, the inanimate condition elicited an N400 effect against the animate condition in the telic (goal) contexts. In the atelic (locative) condition, items with animates evoked an N400 effect compared to inanimates. The combined set of findings suggest that clause-initial animacy is not sufficient for agent identification in German, which seems to be completed only at the verbal lexeme in our experiment. Here non-agents (inanimates) changing their location in a goal-directed way and agents (animates) lacking this property are dispreferred and this challenges the assumption that change of (locational) state is generally a defining characteristic of the patient role. Besides this main finding that sheds new light on role prototypicality, our data seem to indicate effects that, in our view, are related to complexity, i.e., minimality. Inanimate subjects or goal arguments increase processing costs since they have role or event structure restrictions that animate subjects or locative modifiers lack.","Philipp, M.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01806,1615

4519,,"This dissertation investigates hybrid design strategies to improve performance of adaptive systems that must alter their own structure in real-time based upon changing operational conditions. The strategies focus on reducing the time to choose an adaptation based on information collected about the operational environment and its own internal states along with other inhabitants of that environment. This novel approach combines behavior selection algorithms (e.g. classifiers) with different temporal domains and embeds them into a two-system ensemble whose goal is to improve adaptation speed. This hybrid approach provides a method where adaptive systems collect information from their environment and their own internal states and use this information to choose behaviors that satisfy one or more end goals. This research uses design techniques to improve the performance of real time systems with time constraints. It uses a metric of system survivability as a key performance parameter. A pattern-based design technique offers a novel method of addressing this problem. This research embraces a wide variety of behavior selection algorithms, embedding them into the two-system ensemble to improve adaptation speed. This research focuses on design strategies that seek to overcome problems associated with time limitations. It incorporates classification techniques into the research approach. It assumes that no classification technique is sufficient to speed up adaptation decisions while ensuring that those decisions remain significant, and contribute to overall system performance (i.e. survivability). To verify design strategies, this research effort uses a simulation environment composed of agents that combat each other within a virtual two-dimensional battlefield. Combat scenarios yield insights into the adaptation speed problem because it focuses on time-limited battles between simulated tanks with and without adaptive behaviors. It presents system survivability problems based upon these simulated tanks, and allows them to adapt and avoid failures while competing directly in combat, or for collecting limited resources.","Phillips, Brian J.",0,,1617

Historians might now recognize that their, conventionally, most anthropocentric of disciplines needs to understand those animals that have contributed so much to shaping our past, to think with them and credit them with a perspective. Here, taking up the challenge laid down by the historian of the South African War Sandra Swart, an examination of the methodological issues surrounding the 'writing in' of animals into military history will identify an established tradition of 'subaltern studies' within the historiography of war, which has prepared the ground intellectually for the inclusion of non-human animals. Following this, a consideration of the experiences of horses during the American Civil War, informed by both contemporary records and modern equine science, will then demonstrate both the possibility, and the desirability, of according due attention to 'animal soldiers' in the writing of military history.","Phillips, G.",0,10.1177/0968344512471121,1618
4521,,"Recent studies on ‘the multilingual turn’ (Conteh & Meier, 2014; May, 2014) reveal both the theoretical and pedagogical inadequacy of monolingual ideologies and instructional practices in language education. Yet, dominant language policies and pedagogical practices, including multilingual ones, are deeply influenced by monolingual habitus and biases (Benson, 2013; Gogolin, 1997; May, 2014) and monoglossic ideologies (García & Kleyn, 2016) which both solidify ‘inequalities of multilingualism’ (Tupas, 2015) and delegitimize the use of minoritized languages and language practices in education. By putting ‘language ideology’ (Kroskrity, 2009; Makihara & Schieffelin, 2007; Pennycook, 2013; Woolard, 1998) at the center, this engaged ethnographic study analyzes decolonizing efforts (Maldonado-Torres, 2010; Quijano, 2007; Smith, 2012) with a group of indigenous people, Limbu, towards denaturalizing and transforming hegemonic language ideologies in Nepal’s language education policies and practices. More specifically, this study emphasizes ideological analyses with indigenous villagers, teachers, and youth towards building critical ideological awareness, advocacy, and activism in reimagining equitable multilingual policies and pedagogical practices in Nepal. Building on engaged language policy (Davis, 2014; Davis & Phyak, forthcoming; Shohamy, 2015), this study adopts a multisited and multimethod approach (McCarty, 2011) to engage Limbu bi/multilingual villagers, teachers, and youth in ethnographically grounded dialogue on language ideological issues. Informed by ‘indigenous critical praxis’ and ‘indigenous epistemology’ (Gegeo & Watson-Gegeo, 2002, 2013), dialogic engagement (Bakhtin, 1981; Freire, 1970) with the participants is grounded on collaborative ethnography, counter-narratives, critical language awareness workshops, and focus-group discussions. This study reveals that ethnographically grounded dialogue builds the participants’ critical consciousness (Freire, 1970) of multiple language ideologies and further engages them in reclaiming their identities as a knower and transformative agent for creating multilingual schoolspace. In particular, dialogic engagement contributes to ‘ideological becoming’ (Bakhtin, 1981; Ball & Freedman, 2004) which represents the participants’ critical awareness about the hegemony of dominant nation-state and neoliberal ideologies and identities as social critics, advocates, and activists. This process further involves participants’ ‘ideological clarification’ (Fishman, 2001; Kroskrity, 2009) about the coloniality of the nation-state and neoliberal ideologies in both dominant and resistance language policy discourses. This study shows that dialogic engagement is necessary to challenge the invention of language as a fixed, bounded, and monoglossic entity and to empower language minoritized people towards taking an activist position in transforming monolingual ideologies and practices. While the indigenous villagers denaturalize the monolingual nation-state and hierarchical neoliberal ideologies, the teachers construct translanguaging ideologies and pedagogies (García & Li, 2014) towards supporting ‘epistemic access’ (Heugh, 2015; Kerfoot & Simon- Vandenbergen, 2015) of bi/multilingual indigenous children. Similarly, the indigenous youth reclaim their multilingual identities and position themselves as counterpublics through dialogic engagement. This study further theorizes ‘engaged language policy’ (Davis, 2014; Shohamy, 2015) and contributes to knowledge in ‘the multilingual turn’ in language education by integrating decolonizing efforts towards transforming monolingual ideologies.","Phyak, Prem Bahadur",0,,1619
4522,Predicting intention to work with social robots at anticipation stage: Assessing the role of behavioral desire and anticipated emotions,"Social robots are designed to interact, collaborate, and work with people, engaging them at an interpersonal and socio-affective level. The goal directed model was used to study the role of socio-cognitive, affective (anticipated emotions), and motivational (behavioral desire) factors of the intention to work with social robots in the near future. The effects of robots' perceived warmth and competence on components of the goal directed model are explored as well as the effects of social robots' design (machinelike vs. humanoid vs. humanlike). Results show that the goal directed model accounts for a considerable amount of the explained variance of behavioral intention, underlining the importance of affective and motivational factors, in the intention to work with a social robot. The role of robots' perceived warmth and competence was also confirmed. Results for robot design were inconclusive. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

4524,,"Embodied Conversational Agents (i.e., avatars; ECAs) are appearing in increasingly many everyday contexts, such as e-commerce, occupational training, and airport security. Also common to a typical person's daily life is persuasion. Whether being persuaded or persuading, the ability to change another person's attitude or behavior is a thoroughly researched topic. However, little is known about ECAs' ability to persuade and whether basic persuasion principles from human-human interactions will hold in human-ECA interactions. This work investigates this question. First, a broad review of persuasion literature, which serves as an inventory of manipulations to test in ECA contexts, is presented. This literature review serves an inventory to guide future Persuasive ECA work. The ECA literature is then reviewed. Two preliminary studies exploring the effects of physical attractiveness, voice quality, argument quality, common ground, authority, and facial similarity are presented. Finally, the culminating study testing the effectiveness of ECAs to elicit self-disclosure in automated interviewing is presented and discussed. The findings of that automated interviewing study suggest that ECAs may replace humans in automated interviewing contexts. The findings also suggest that ECAs that are manipulated to look like their interviewees are able to induce greater likeability, establish more rapport, and elicited more self-referencing language than ECAs that do not look like the interviewees.","Pickard, Matthew David",0,,1621
4525,Toward an Objective Linguistic-Based Measure of Perceived Embodied Conversational Agent Power and Likeability,"Embodied conversational agents (ECA) are a type of intelligent, multimodal computer interface that allow computers to interact with humans in a face-to-face manner. It is quite feasible that ECAs will someday replace the common keyboard as a human-computer interface. However, we have much to understand about how people interact with such embodied virtual agents. In this study, we performed a laboratory experiment, in an airport screening context, to assess how people's linguistic behavior changes with their perceptions of the ECA's power and likeability. The results show that people tend to manifest more verbal immediacy and expressivity, as well as offer more information about themselves, with ECAs they perceive as more likeable and less powerful.","Pickard, M.

4528,Revealing sensitive information in personal interviews: Is self-disclosure easier with humans or avatars and under what conditions?,"Despite the many advantages of computer-assisted data collection, it is unclear if, when, or under what conditions embodied conversational agents (i.e., ECA, virtual humans) can replace human interviewers to collect personal information in interviews, especially for topics that might be regarded as 'sensitive'. This paper presents results from an exploratory study designed to investigate how topic sensitivity affects individuals' preference to disclose to a human or an ECA interviewer. A convenience sample of 203 undergraduate business students completed a scenario-based survey that asked them to rate the sensitivity of various interview topics and indicate their preference to disclose such sensitive information to human or ECA interviewers. Open-ended questions revealed factors behind preferences for interviewer choice. Findings show a preference for ECAs when topics are highly sensitive and more likely to evoke negative self-admissions. For topics rated low in sensitivity or more likely to evoke positive self admissions, human interviewers are preferred. Specifically, participants stated that they would feel more comfortable discussing sensitive topics with an ECA interviewer because it could not judge them. This indicates that the evaluative capability of the interviewer plays a factor in the amount of sensitive information elicited from interviewees. Overall, results contribute to an understanding of when and why ECA interviewers can effectively replace human interviewers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Pickard, M.

4531,,"Most readers of politically committed literature dismiss it either because they disagree with the content presented in it or because its ostensibly crass instrumentalization of art in the service of a socialist program negates its aesthetic value. In the 20th century, these views were more often than not borne of a prejudice against Socialist Realism, the official method for producing art in the Eastern Bloc, which relied on a didactic relationship between art and its message in order to communicate with and educate its audience. The socialist literary and theoretical works by Maxim Gorky (Russia/USSR), Peter Hacks (East Germany), and Heiner Müller (East Germany) stand in stark contrast to this didacticism of Socialist Realism, as they are underpinned by philosophical and aesthetic commitments drawn from romanticism, classicism, and avant-gardism, respectively. In the works I examine, artistic form is embraced as the quality that makes art a vehicle uniquely suited to the political education of its audience. The authors’ depiction (Gorky), description (Hacks), and staging (Müller) of the aesthetic theories upon which their pedagogical artworks depend do not aim to reduce those literary works to the communication of a specific socialist message; rather, the audience arrives at a more general and truthful way of thinking principally by engaging with the form of the artwork. As in Socialist Realism, the radical education promoted by Gorky, Hacks, and Müller has political consequences, but for them, this education takes place both as readers and audiences assimilate the tendentious content of the texts and as they engage with the artworks’ formal structures. For these authors, art has the capacity to inspire spiritual (Gorky), ontological (Hacks), and behavioral (Müller) exercises that in turn enable readers (Gorky), viewers (Hacks), and participants (Müller) to participate in and create new forms of thinking. In the process, they become agents, creative producers of thought who have received a more sustainable and liberating education than the didacticism of Socialist Realism could ever provide. What these works share is a commitment to teaching how to think over learning what to think.","Pickle, Sarah Elizabeth",0,,1624
4532,,"Cartoons in the 1960s were the epitome of great cartoons. If one grew up watching cartoons in the '60s, and later in the '80s, the cultural phenomenon of Alvin and The Chipmunks were front and center of cartoons in each era. In recent years there have been an overwhelming amount of '60s cartoon remakes using this hybrid approach. Remaking The Chipmunks in the CGI/live action format has created limitations that isolate the anthropomorphic characters socially, visually and environmentally. Thus by creating these limitations, it has restricted the characters and the stories they can be involved in causing the remake to lose the ""fantasy element,"" that the animated series once had. As a result, the innovative approach has not successfully updated the franchise, it has aided in diminishing its impact on Western culture. This paper will examine the way that computer generated imagery/live action remakes of classic cartoons, such as the Alvin and The Chipmunks, limited and stifled the fantasy element. The paper will examine The Chipmunks franchise beginning from its conception to the 2007 movie.","Pierre-Louis, Nehemie",0,,1625

4535,Empirical evaluation of the uncanny valley hypothesis fails to confirm the predicted effect of motion,"The uncanny valley hypothesis states that the acceptability of an artificial character will not increase linearly in relation to its likeness to human form. Instead, after an initial rise in acceptability there will be a pronounced decrease when the character is similar, but not identical to human form (Mori, 1970/2012). Moreover, it has been claimed but never directly tested that movement would accentuate this dip and make moving characters less acceptable. We used a number of full-body animated computer characters along with a parametrically defined motion set to examine the effect of motion quality on the uncanny valley. We found that improving the motion quality systematically improved the accept-ability of the characters. In particular, the character classified in the deepest location of the uncanny valley became more acceptable when it was animated. Our results showed that although an uncanny valley was found for static characters, the deepening of the valley with motion, originally predicted by Mori (1970/2012), was not obtained.

4540,,"Humans, like their close primate relatives, live in social networks based primarily on family group membership. They are therefore born into a world which is rich in potential teachers and learning experiences. Research has shown that even in infancy we are adept at interpreting subtle social signals that we observe in the interactions that occur around us. Social referencing studies provide evidence that infants utilise emotional expressions as a source of feedback and knowledge regarding stimuli in their environment (e.g. Feinman & Lewis, 1983; Sorce, Emde, Campos & Klinnert, 1985; Hornik & Gunnar, 1988), and looking-time studies have indicated infants’ can not only to encode preference information from emotional expressions to predict agents’ object-targeted actions (e.g. Kuhlmeier, Wynn & Bloom, 2003), but also form expectations regarding social affiliations on the basis of interactions they observe. However, no research has investigated infants’ ability to utilise emotional expressions in the social domain to encode information about third-party social affiliations. The present thesis aimed to address this shortfall in current understanding and provides evidence that by 14 months infants successfully predict the outcome of social interactions on the basis of the valence of emotional displays of one actress toward another, thereby extending upon results in the object domain (Gergely, Egyed & Királyi, 2007). Mediating factors influencing infants’ processing of attitude information are identified, including the presence or absence of ostensive cues, the availability of alternative preference information and the relative frequency of information presentation. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for our understanding of not only infants’ emerging social processing skills but also for theories on learning, specifically Csibra and Gergely’s proposed Pedagogical System (2006), and future research directions regarding the processes underlying infants’ differential information processing in ostensive and non-ostensive learning episodes are outlined.","Platten-Brown, L.",0,,1630

My thesis is that the theory of semiotics provides useful insights into the possibility and possible nature of an artificial intelligence. To support that thesis, I begin by providing an overview of the relevant philosophy, focusing on the work of John Deely. Then I briefly discuss how previous research in AI may be subsumed under a semiotic umbrella, and some possible formal models of perception, action, and cognition. Next, I build a basic framework for constructing and experimenting with artificial agents that are compatible with those models. Finally, I demonstrate and discuss some simple agent behaviors implemented using the framework. My purpose is not to support or endorse any particular method for pursuing the general goals of AI, nor is it to extend any existing architecture or theory of cognition. Instead, it is an attempt to introduce and apply an extremely general philosophical point of view (Deely 1990: chapter 2) to the overall problem of AI. It is intended to serve as a platform for future research, both theoretical and applied.","Plotnick, Alexander F.",0,,1631
4542,,"A common assumption in the study of conversation is that participants fully cooperate in order to maximise the effectiveness of the exchange and ensure communication flow. This assumption persists even in situations in which the private goals of the participants are at odds: they may act strategically pursuing their agendas, but will still adhere to a number of linguistic norms or conventions which are implicitly accepted by a community of language users. However, in naturally occurring dialogue participants often depart from such norms, for instance, by asking inappropriate questions, by avoiding to provide adequate answers or by volunteering information that is not relevant to the conversation. These are examples of what we call linguistic non-cooperation. This thesis presents a systematic investigation of linguistic non-cooperation in dialogue. Given a specific activity, in a specific cultural context and time, the method proceeds by making explicit which linguistic behaviours are appropriate. This results in a set of rules: the global dialogue game. Non-cooperation is then measured as instances in which the actions of the participants are not in accordance with these rules. The dialogue game is formally defined in terms of discourse obligations. These are actions that participants are expected to perform at a given point in the dialogue based on the dialogue history. In this context, non-cooperation amounts to participants failing to act according to their obligations. We propose a general definition of linguistic non-cooperation and give a specific instance for political interview dialogues. Based on the latter, we present an empirical method which involves a coding scheme for the manual annotation of interview transcripts. The degree to which each participant cooperates is automatically determined by contrasting the annotated transcripts with the rules in the dialogue game for political interviews. The approach is evaluated on a corpus of broadcast political interviews and tested for correlation with human judgement on the same corpus. Further, we describe a model of conversational agents that incorporates the concepts and mechanisms above as part of their dialogue manager. This allows for the generation of conversations in which the agents exhibit varying degrees of cooperation by controlling how often they favour their private goals instead of discharging their discourse obligations.","Plüss, Brian",0,,1632
4543,,"Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) applications use high levels of fidelity in order to produce high levels of presence and thereby elicit an emotional response for the user (like fear for phobia treatment). State of research shows mixed results for the correlation between anxiety and presence in virtual reality exposure, with differing results depending on specific anxiety disorders. A positive correlation for anxiety and presence for social anxiety disorder is not proven up to now. One reason might be that plausibility of the simulation, namely including key triggers for social anxiety (for example verbal and non-verbal behavior of virtual agents that reflects potentially negative human evaluation) might not be acknowledged in current presence questionnaires. A German scale for measuring co-presence and social presence for virtual reality (VR) fear of public speaking scenarios was developed based on a translation and adaption of existing copresence and social presence questionnaires. A sample of N = 151 students rated co-presence and social presence after using a fear of public speaking application. Four correlated factors were derived by item- and principle axis factor analysis (Promax rotation), representing the presenter’s reaction to virtual agents, the reactions of the virtual agents as perceived by the presenter, impression of interaction possibilities, and (co-)presence of other people in the virtual environment. The scale developed can be used as a starting point for future research and test construction for VR applications with a social context.

4550,Student responses to an animated character in information literacy instruction,"Purpose - This paper reports on a grant-funded project to create a hand-drawn, custom-made animated character named Jasmyn. Drawing on animation theory, the purpose of this paper is to use qualitative research to investigate student responses to the medium of animation, the character's design, and three presentation strategies. Design/methodology/approach - The researchers held three student focus groups to investigate the following research questions: Will students endorse animation as a medium for library instructional videos on the grounds of its entertaining, subversive, or playful qualities? Is Jasmyn designed and written in a way that engages students and compels them to respond to her as a character? How will students respond to three presentation strategies: a lecture-style video, a video with supplemental animations, and a real-time, interactive lesson? Findings - The researchers found that students expressed broad enthusiasm for animation as a medium, though responses to Jasmyn's personality were mixed. The only presentation strategy that prompted unique responses was the interactive session, although all three focus groups provided revealing commentary about online learning. Students also identified aspects of the animation and character that could be improved, and reflected on ways Jasmyn might be integrated into online learning. Research limitations/implications - This study, performed as part of a pilot project, was deliberately small in scale. Clearer implications would emerge from repetition with a larger group of students. Originality/value - Jasmyn may be the only hand-drawn, custom-made animated character created for library instruction. No research studies on the use of animation in libraries have been published to date.","Poggiali, J.",0,10.1108/lht-12-2016-0149,1636
4551,The Role of Autobiographical Memory in the Development of a Robot Self,"This article briefly reviews research in cognitive development concerning the nature of the human self. It then reviews research in developmental robotics that has attempted to retrace parts of the developmental trajectory of the self. This should be of interest to developmental psychologists, and researchers in developmental robotics. As a point of departure, one of the most characteristic aspects of human social interaction is cooperation-the process of entering into a joint enterprise to achieve a common goal. Fundamental to this ability to cooperate is the underlying ability to enter into, and engage in, a self-other relation. This suggests that if we intend for robots to cooperate with humans, then to some extent robots must engage in these self-other relations, and hence they must have some aspect of a self. Decades of research in human cognitive development indicate that the self is not fully present from the outset, but rather that it is developed in a usage-based fashion, that is, through engaging with the world, including the physical world and the social world of animate intentional agents. In an effort to characterize the self, Ulric Neisser noted that self is not unitary, and he thus proposed five types of self-knowledge that correspond to five distinct components of self: ecological, interpersonal, conceptual, temporally extended, and private. He emphasized the ecological nature of each of these levels, how they are developed through the engagement of the developing child with the physical and interpersonal worlds. Crucially, development of the self has been shown to rely on the child's autobiographical memory. From the developmental robotics perspective, this suggests that in principal it would be possible to develop certain aspects of self in a robot cognitive system where the robot is engaged in the physical and social world, equipped with an autobiographical memory system. We review a series of developmental robotics studies that make progress in this enterprise. We conclude with a summary of the properties that are required for the development of these different levels of self, and we identify topics for future research.","Pointeau, G.",0,10.3389/fnbot.2017.00027,1637

The user-modelling techniques combine statistical and computational approaches to assess skill acquisition, practice, and refinement with the MetaHistoReasoning tool, a single-agent system that supports inquiry-based learning in the domain of history. Data were collected from twenty-two undergraduate students during a 4-h session where user interactions were logged by the system. A logistic regression model predicted user performance in relation to a skill categorization task with 75 % accuracy. The manner in which users apply the skills that are acquired is then assessed through a rule-based reasoning system that allows the pedagogical agent to adapt instruction. The results show that the model allows the agent to detect instances when skills are inappropriately applied as well as what type of goal that is pursued by students. We discuss the implications of these user-modelling techniques in terms of sequencing instructional content and using the tutoring agent to deliver several types of discourse moves in order to enhance learning.","Poitras, E.

Peering into the uncanny valley for hands,"It is postulated that there is an uncanny valley, whereby human-like stimuli such as robots or animated characters that fall short of being fully human are perceived as eerie or unsettling. Previous research has explored the existence of this effect for faces and whole bodies, while here we explore responses to photographs of real and artificial hands. In keeping with the notion of an uncanny valley, prosthetic hands that were of intermediate human-likeness were given the highest ratings of eeriness. However, within the categories of hands, ratings of eeriness reduced as human-likeness increased, suggesting a more complex pattern. Further investigation of this effect will be of relevance to the design of prosthetic limbs and could be used to test theories of the uncanny valley and social perception with simple stimuli.","Poliakoff, E.",0,10.1068/p7569,1640

Objectives: To investigate how eerie people find different prosthetic hands and whether perceptions of eeriness can be accounted for by categorical ambiguity. Study design: Students participated in computerised experiments during which photographic images of hands were presented. Methods: We compared photographs of prosthetic hands pre-selected as more (H+) or less human-like (H-), as well as mechanical and real hands. Participants rated the hands for eeriness and human-likeness, as well as performing a speeded classification (human/non-human) and location judgment (control) task. Results: The H-prosthetic hands were rated as more eerie than the H+ prosthetic, mechanical and real hands, and this was unaffected by hand orientation. Participants were significantly slower to categorise the H+ prosthetic hands compared to the H-prosthetic and real hands, which was not due to generally slower responses to the H+ prosthetic hands (control task). Conclusion: People find prosthetic hands to be eerie, most consistently for less human-like prosthetic hands. This effect is not driven by ambiguity about whether to categorise the prosthetic hand as human or artificial.","Poliakoff, E.",0,10.1177/0309364617744083,1641
4567,Verbal response time and duration indices of deception in humans interviewed by a computer-generated agent,"To examine the relationship between verbal response time, response duration, and deception during an interview with a computer-generated agent, we developed a model using logistic regression conducted on a training group (n=90) and cross-validated the model on an additional 127 participants who either did or did not engage in a simulated crime at a mock security checkpoint. Verbal responses during the interviews required simple ""yes"" or ""no"" utterances, which examinees were instructed to produce ""promptly"" but not in a speeded manner. The results showed that, overall, 75 of 127 (59.1%) participants in the cross-validation group were correctly classified (p<.05). This result was due to the ability to correctly classify nondeceptive participants (specificity), and we interpreted this finding as being due to the presence of subpopulations of deceptive participants. Group analyses also revealed that response durations to mock crime-relevant questions were shorter when participants believed that a human was controlling the interview (p<.05), and that relative changes in response durations among different types of questions during the interview were related to deceptive status. The response duration shortening observed in the present study was attributed to variations in social dominance, motivational systems, or some combination of these factors.

4573,Computational Psychometrics for the Measurement of Collaborative Problem Solving Skills,"This paper describes a psychometrically-based approach to the measurement of collaborative problem solving skills, by mining and classifying behavioral data both in real-time and in post-game analyses. The data were collected from a sample of middle school children who interacted with a game-like, online simulation of collaborative problem solving tasks. In this simulation, a user is required to collaborate with a virtual agent to solve a series of tasks within a first-person maze environment. The tasks were developed following the psychometric principles of Evidence Centered Design (ECD) and are aligned with the Holistic Framework developed by ACT. The analyses presented in this paper are an application of an emerging discipline called computational psychometrics which is growing out of traditional psychometrics and incorporates techniques from educational data mining, machine learning and other computer/cognitive science fields. In the real-time analysis, our aim was to start with limited knowledge of skill mastery, and then demonstrate a form of continuous Bayesian evidence tracing that updates sub-skill level probabilities as new conversation flow event evidence is presented. This is performed using Bayes' rule and conversation item conditional probability tables. The items are polytomous and each response option has been tagged with a skill at a performance level. In our post-game analysis, our goal was to discover unique gameplay profiles by performing a cluster analysis of user's sub-skill performance scores based on their patterns of selected dialog responses.","Polyak, S.

4576,,"The field of spoken language processing is concerned with creating computer programs that can understand human speech and produce human-like speech. Regarding the problem of understanding human speech, there is currently growing interest in moving beyond speech recognition (the task of transcribing the words in an audio stream) and towards machine listening—interpreting the full spectrum of information in an audio stream. One part of machine listening, the problem that this thesis focuses on, is the task of using information in the speech signal to infer a person's emotional or mental state. In this dissertation, our approach is to assess the utility of prosody, or manner of speaking, in classifying speaker affect. Prosody refers to the acoustic features of natural speech: rhythm, stress, intonation, and energy. Affect refers to a person's emotions and attitudes such as happiness, frustration, or uncertainty. We focus on one specific dimension of affect: level of certainty. Our goal is to automatically infer whether a person is confident or uncertain based on the prosody of his or her speech. Potential applications include conversational dialogue systems (e.g., in educational technology) and voice search (e.g., smartphone personal assistants). There are three main contributions of this thesis. The first contribution is a method for eliciting uncertain speech that binds a speaker's uncertainty to a single phrase within the larger utterance, allowing us to compare the utility of contextually-based prosodic features. Second, we devise a technique for computing prosodic features from utterance segments that both improves uncertainty classification and can be used to determine which phrase a speaker is uncertain about. The level of certainty classifier achieves an accuracy of 75%. Third, we examine the differences between perceived, self-reported, and internal level of certainty, concluding that perceived certainty is aligned with internal certainty for some but not all speakers and that self-reports are a good proxy for internal certainty.","Pon-Barry, Heather Roberta",0,,1644
4577,,"This study is about the ways in which the term subject knowledge is conceptualised and interpreted by student teachers, university tutors and school mentors in the context of undergraduate primary initial teacher training (ITT) in two post-1992 university providers. Subject knowledge has been a consistent feature of the policy context of ITT over decades, although disparities are apparent between the rhetoric of policy directives, the theoretical knowledge base and how primary teachers’ subject knowledge is represented, and enacted, in communities of practice in primary ITT. The conceptual framework for the research is underpinned by Shulman’s (1987) theoretical knowledge bases for teaching, and draws significantly on the conceptual tools of culture, practice and agents in educational settings, provided by Ellis’s (2007) situated model of subject knowledge. The perspective of the individual is developed further by utilising Kelchtermans’s (2009) personal interpretative framework. An additional lens is provided by the external political context, within which primary ITT is located. The research adopted an inductive, interpretative approach that incorporated multiple methods to construct a bricolage. Data collection included semi-structured questionnaires, semi-structured interviews that incorporated the production of visual data, and content analysis of documents. The study indicates that subject knowledge was understood by participants as an umbrella term representing general teacher knowledge, rather than as a critically distinct concept. Overall, there was a general lack of emphasis on subject-specific pedagogical knowledge evident in the discourse around subject knowledge for primary teaching. Conceptualisations of subject knowledge were highly individualistic. The findings indicated that the culture and practice in different contexts is interpreted and experienced in very different ways by individuals to influence their interpretations of subject knowledge and its place in pedagogy. Thus, this study makes an original contribution to knowledge in the field by: 1) mapping the details of the conceptualisations of subject knowledge held by student primary teachers, university tutors and school mentors in the context of undergraduate primary ITT, to identify commonalities, and disparities, with the theoretical knowledge base; and 2) identifying and examining cross-contextual and personal influences on conceptions of subject knowledge and in so doing, extending and adapting Ellis’s (2007) model of subject knowledge, to the specific context of undergraduate primary ITT.","Pope, D.",0,,1645
4578,Switching Wizard of Oz for the online evaluation of backchannel behavior,"The Switching Wizard of Oz (SWOZ) is a setup to evaluate human behavior synthesis algorithms in online face-to-face interactions. Conversational partners are represented to each other as virtual agents, whose animated behavior is either based on a synthesis algorithm, or driven by the actual behavior of the conversational partner. Human and algorithm have the same expression capabilities. The source is switched at random intervals, which means that the algorithm's behavior can only be identified when it deviates from what is regarded as appropriate. The SWOZ approach is especially suitable for the controlled evaluation of synthesis algorithms that consider a limited set of behaviors. We evaluate a backchannel synthesis algorithm for speaker-listener dialogs using an asymmetric version of the framework. Human speakers talk to virtual listeners, that are either controlled by human listeners or by an algorithm. Speakers indicate when they feel they are no longer talking to a human listener. Analysis of these responses reveals patterns of inappropriate behavior in terms of quantity and timing of backchannels. These insights can be used to improve synthesis algorithms.","Poppe, R.",0,10.1007/s12193-013-0131-2,1646
4581,Perceptual evaluation of backchannel strategies for artificial listeners,"Artificial listeners are virtual agents that can listen attentively to a human speaker in a dialog. In this paper, we present two experiments where we investigate the perception of rule-based backchannel strategies for artificial listeners. In both, we collect subjective judgements of humans who observe a video of a speaker together with a corresponding animation of an artificial listener. In the first experiment, we evaluate six rule-based strategies that differ in the types of features (e.g. prosody, gaze) they consider. The ratings are given at the level of a speech turn and can be considered a measure for how human-like the generated listening behavior is perceived. In the second experiment, we systematically investigate the effect of the quantity, type and timing of backchannels within the discourse of the speaker. Additionally, we asked human observers to press a button whenever they thought a generated backchannel occurrence was inappropriate. Both experiments together give insights in the factors, both from an observation and generation point-of-view, that influence the perception of backchannel strategies for artificial listeners.","Poppe, R.",0,10.1007/s10458-013-9219-z,1647
4584,Blending Human and Artificial Intelligence to Support Autistic Children's Social Communication Skills,"This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (Al) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4-14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the Al environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis: Me analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of Al technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.","Porayska-Pomsta, K.",0,10.1145/3271484,1648

In line with many other researchers in the field, we believe that the key to developing technology in this context is to embrace perspectives from diverse disciplines to arrive at a methodology that delivers satisfactory outcomes for all stakeholders. The ECHOES project provided us with the opportunity to develop a technology-enhanced learning (TEL) environment that facilitates acquisition and exploration of social skills by typically developing (TD) children and children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). ECHOES' methodology and the learning environment rely crucially on multi-disciplinary expertise including developmental psychology, visual arts, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, education, and several other cognate disciplines. In this article, we reflect on the methods needed to develop a TEL environment for young users with ASDs by identifying key features, benefits, and challenges of this approach.","Porayska-Pomsta, K.",0,10.1007/s00779-011-0384-2,1649
4620,DO ANIMALS HAVE SOULS? AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE,"This paper addresses the question of whether animals have souls and the ability to experience God after death within the limitations of their nature. Plausible explanations for the natural origin of life and for the development of subsequent complexity are increasingly being advanced by molecular biologists. Christian tradition and scholasticism teach that the human body is animated by the soul which is the agent of vital activities. This teaching is incompatible with the claim for a natural origin for life, At some stage in the evolution of chordates and cephalopods a sense of self-awareness and an ability to distinguish between pleasure and the absence of pleasure would have arisen permitting the potential for ensoulment. The premise that evolution was gradual but ensoulment was discontinuous predicates the irrational conclusion that for one generation the parents were animals without souls and their children humans, made in the image of God, and with souls. Biological gradualism is incompatible with a sudden ensoulment dichotomy both in the evolutionary history of humans and for a maturing foetus, human or animal. Gradualism must apply to both body and soul. A Christian interpretation of physicalism, however, provides an alternative to dualism and resolves the paradoxes and difficulties relating to animals.","Porter, A. M. W.",0,10.1111/heyj.12003,1650
4621,,"This study sought to contribute to literature on college students’ literacy by exploring how undergraduate disciplinary literacies are constructed and enacted within disciplinary communities. A multiple case study design was used to understand how disciplinary novice and expert members shape the meaning inherent in their literacy practices. Four disciplinary communities, each comprised of an undergraduate student with junior or senior status, a pedagogical expert, and a practitioner expert, participated in this study. Data included participant interviews, classroom observations, disciplinary literacy artifacts, shared disciplinary reading exercise and focus groups, think-aloud protocols, and literacy journals. Findings revealed that disciplinary community members constructed their understanding of disciplinary literacy through distinct sociocognitive praxes constituting disciplinary specific stances: accounting as systematic analyzers of logic; biology as critical consumers and producers of knowledge; secondary education as mindful engineers of learning; political science as critical bureaucratic agents. Participants held a tacit understanding that immersive experiences would scaffold their knowledge of disciplinary literacies. Complicating this tacit understanding, findings revealed that the development of disciplinary literacies is contingent upon the sociohistorical positioning of the discipline and its members. Implications include the need to reconceptualize disciplinary literacies beyond practices to account for the role of sociohistoric disciplinary stances. This study calls for the need for undergraduate education to respond to the reconstitutive nature of disciplinary literacies towards authentic career applications in order to more effectively nurture students’ agency toward participatory membership in their disciplinary communities.","Porter, Heather D.",0,,1651
4622,Systematically Developing a Web-Based Tailored Intervention Promoting HPV-Vaccination Acceptability Among Mothers of Invited Girls Using Intervention Mapping,"Background: Currently, the eHealth field calls for detailed descriptions of theory-based interventions in order to support improved design of such interventions. This article aims to provide a systematic description of the design rationale behind an interactive web-based tailored intervention promoting HPV-vaccination acceptability. Methods: The 6-step Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol was used to describe the design rationale. After the needs assessment in Step 1, intervention objectives were formulated in Step 2. In Step 3, we translated theoretical methods into practical applications, which were integrated into a coherent intervention in Step 4. In Step 5, we anticipated future implementation and adoption, and finally, an evaluation plan was generated in Step 6. Results: Walking through the various steps of IM resulted in a detailed description of the intervention. The needs assessment indicated HPV-vaccination uptake remaining lower than expected. Mothers play the most important role in decision-making about their daughter's immunization. However, they generally feel ambivalent after they made their decisions, and their decisions are based on rather unstable grounds. Therefore, intervention objectives were to improve HPV-vaccination uptake and informed decision-making, and to decrease decisional conflict among mothers of invited girls. Computer-tailoring was chosen as the main method; virtual assistants were chosen as a practical application to deliver interactive tailored feedback. To maximize compatibility with the needs of the target group, a user-centered design strategy by means of focus groups and online experiments was applied. In these, prototypes were tested and sequentially refined. Finally, efficacy, effectiveness, and acceptability of the intervention were tested in a randomized controlled trial. Results showed a significant positive effect of the intervention on informed decision-making, decisional conflict, and nearly all determinants of HPV-vaccination uptake (P < 0.001). Mothers evaluated the intervention as highly positive. Discussion: Using IM led to an innovative effective intervention for promoting HPVvaccination acceptability. The intervention maps will aid in interpreting the results of our evaluation studies. Moreover, it will ease the comparison of design rationales across interventions, and may provide leads for the development of other eHealth interventions. This paper adds to the plea for systematic reporting of design rationales constituting the process of developing interventions.","Pot, M.",0,10.3389/fpubh.2018.00226,1652
4629,,"Students learning in blended learning and classroom environments benefit from social interaction and vicarious learning experience with their peers and tutors. In comparison, students learning via self-directed Web-based learning cannot benefit from these advantages and may feel isolated. This research investigates if the presence of virtual persuasive agents presented as avatars, happy images and encouraging text can provide social support similar to real peers and improve students’ Web-based learning self-efficacy (WBLSE). This research also examines if low and high fidelity virtual persuasive agents can provide social support in a similar way. This study uses Bandura’s (1982) self-efficacy theory as a framework for changing nursing students’ beliefs in using the Web for learning. The basis for including virtual persuasive agents in this research stems from the media equation theory (Reeves & Nass, 1996) which holds that Computers are Social Actors (CASA) and that people respond to Web-based media as if they were social actors. Adopting the User-Centred Design approach, a bespoke Web-based training package was developed for changing pre-registration and post-registration nursing students’ WBLSE. In a quasi-experimental design, the package was delivered in three separate studies to different groups of pre-registration and post-registration nursing students. Several important findings contributed to the WBLSE body of knowledge. Overall, the training package was found to be effective with the nursing students’ WBLSE improving equally in the intervention groups in all studies. Pre-registration students showed the greatest improvement when learning by self-direction supported by virtual persuasive agents, whereas post-registration students improved when learning in a blended setting without their support. Low-fidelity virtual persuasive agents were sufficient in providing social support for pre-registration students in self-directed settings. The implications for Web-based learning in nurse education, research and practice are discussed.","Poussa, Cherry",1,,1653
4630,Social Connection Modulates Perceptions of Animacy,"Human survival depends on identifying targets potentially capable of engaging in meaningful social connection. Using sets of morphed images created from animate (human) and inanimate (doll) faces, we found converging evidence across two studies showing that the motivation to connect with other people systematically alters the interpretation of the physical features that signal that a face is alive. Specifically, in their efforts to find and connect with other social agents, individuals who feel socially disconnected actually decrease their thresholds for what it means to be alive, consistently observing animacy when fewer definitively human cues are present. From an evolutionary perspective, overattributing animacy may be an adaptive strategy that allows people to cast a wide net when identifying possible sources of social connection and maximize their opportunities to renew social relationships.","Powers, K.

4635,Why Some Humanoid Faces Are Perceived More Positively Than Others: Effects of Human-Likeness and Task,"Ample research in social psychology has highlighted the importance of the human face in human-human interactions. However, there is a less clear understanding of how a humanoid robot's face is perceived by humans. One of the primary goals of this study was to investigate how initial perceptions of robots are influenced by the extent of human-likeness of the robot's face, particularly when the robot is intended to provide assistance with tasks in the home that are traditionally carried out by humans. Moreover, although robots have the potential to help both younger and older adults, there is limited knowledge of whether the two age groups' perceptions differ. In this study, younger () and older adults () imagined interacting with a robot in four different task contexts and rated robot faces of varying levels of human-likeness. Participants were also interviewed to assess their reasons for particular preferences. This multi-method approach identified patterns of perceptions across different appearances as well as reasons that influence the formation of such perceptions. Overall, the results indicated that people's perceptions of robot faces vary as a function of robot human-likeness. People tended to over-generalize their understanding of humans to build expectations about a human-looking robot's behavior and capabilities. Additionally, preferences for humanoid robots depended on the task although younger and older adults differed in their preferences for certain humanoid appearances. The results of this study have implications both for advancing theoretical understanding of robot perceptions and for creating and applying guidelines for the design of robots.","Prakash, A.",0,10.1007/s12369-014-0269-4,1655

Using computational models, embedded in humanoid robots, we are seeking to test the sufficiency of this theoretical account and to evaluate the usefulness of brain-inspired memory systems for social robots. In this contribution, we describe the use of machine learning techniques-Gaussian process latent variable models-to build a multimodal memory system for the iCub humanoid robot and summarize results of the deployment of this system for human-robot interaction. We also outline the further steps required to create a more complete robotic implementation of human-like autobiographical memory and MTT.

4642,,"While MR-only treatment planning has shown promise, there are still several well-known challenges that are currently limiting widespread clinical implementation. Firstly, MR images are affected by both patient-induced and system-level geometric distortions that can significantly degrade treatment planning accuracy. In addition, the availability of comprehensive distortion analysis software is currently limited. Also while many groups have been working toward a synthetic CT solution, further study is needed on the implementation of synCTs as the reference datasets for linac-based image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to help determine their robustness in an MR-only workflow. To determine candidate materials for phantom and software development, 1.0 T MR and CT images were acquired of twelve urethane foam samples of various densities and strengths. Samples were precision machined to accommodate 6 mm diameter paintballs used as landmarks. Final material candidates were selected by balancing strength, machinability, weight, and cost. Bore sizes and minimum aperture width resulting from couch position were tabulated from the literature. Bore geometry and couch position were simulated using MATLAB to generate machine-specific models to optimize the phantom build. Previously developed software for distortion characterization was modified for several magnet geometries, compared against previously published 1.0 T results, and integrated into the 3DSlicer application platform. To evaluate the performance of synthetic CTs in an image guided workflow, magnetic resonance simulation and CT simulation images were acquired of an anthropomorphic skull phantom and 12 patient brain cancer cases. SynCTs were generated using fluid attenuation inversion recovery, ultrashort echo time, and Dixon data sets through a voxel-based weighted summation of 5 tissue classifications. The DRRs were generated from the phantom synCT, and geometric fidelity was assessed relative to CT-generated DRRs through bounding box and landmark analysis. An offline retrospective analysis was conducted to register cone beam CTs to synCTs and CTs using automated rigid registration in the treatment planning system. Planar MV and KV images were rigidly registered to synCT and CT DRRs using an in-house script. Planar and volumetric registration reproducibility was assessed and margin differences were characterized by the van Herk formalism. Over the sampled FOV, non-negligible residual gradient distortions existed as close as 9.5 cm from isocenter, with a maximum distortion of 7.4mm as close as 23 cm from isocenter. Over 6 months, average gradient distortions were -0.07±1.10 mm and 0.10±1.10 mm in the x and y-directions for the transverse plane, 0.03±0.64 and -0.09±0.70 mm in the sagittal plane, and 0.4±1.16 and 0.04±0.40 mm in the coronal plane. After implementing 3D correction maps, distortions were reduced to < 1 pixel width (1mm) for all voxels up to 25 cm from magnet isocenter. Bounding box and landmark analysis of phantom synCT DRRs were within 1 mm of CT DRRs. Absolute planar registration shift differences ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 mm for phantom DRRs on all treatment platforms and from 0.0 to 0.4 mm for volumetric registrations. For patient planar registrations, the mean shift differences were 0.4±0.5 mm, 0.0±0.5 mm, and 0.1±0.3 mm for the superior-inferior (S-I), left-right (L-R), and anterior-posterior (A-P) axes, respectively. The mean shift differences in volumetric registrations were 0.6±0.4 mm (range, 0.2 to 1.6 mm), 0.2±0.4 mm, and 0.2±0.3 mm for the S-I, L-R, and A-P axes, respectively. The CT-SIM and synCT derived margins were <0.3mm different. This work has characterized the inaccuracies related to GNL distortion for a previously uncharacterized MR-SIM system at large FOVs, and established that while distortions are still non-negligible after current vendor corrections are applied, simple post-processing methods can be used to further reduce these distortions to less than 1mm for the entire field of view.

4643,Exploring the contribution of prosody and gesture to the perception of focus using an animated agent,"Speech prosody has traditionally been analyzed in terms of acoustic features. Although visual features have been shown to enhance linguistic processing, the conventional view is that facial and body gesture information in oral (non-signed) languages tends to be redundant and has the role of helping the hearer recover the meaning of an utterance. Though prosodic information in face-to-face communication is produced with concurrent visual information, little is known about their audiovisual multisensory interactions. We conducted two perception experiments modeled after the McGurk paradigm with a 3D animated character, in which varying degrees of discordance between auditory and visual information were created to investigate two related questions regarding the detection of contrastive-corrective focus: (a) how important are gestural cues with respect to auditory cues and (b) what is the relevance of the different gestural movements involved (i.e., head nodding, eyebrow raising)? Participants were presented with combinations of auditory and visual cues for both information and Contrastive Focus Statements (Experiment 1, with the corresponding unimodal control experiments) or combinations of two visual cues (namely combinations of competing eyebrow and head movements) without auditory information (Experiment 2), and were asked to identify whether the utterance presented was a statement or a correction. Results of Experiment 1 showed that (a) the presence of either acoustic or gestural features of contrastive focus were key in guiding the listener towards one interpretation or another, and (b) listeners were more sensitive to one of the modalities when the other was weaker. Results of Experiment 2 showed that (a) both types of visual cues (head and eyebrow movements) contributed individually to the perception of contrastive focus, and (b) head nods were more informative than eyebrow movements for focus identification. Overall, our findings suggest that prosodic and visual information work in a complementary fashion and are not integrated in the same way as auditory and visual information during segmental perception.

4648,Predicting where a ball will land: from thrower's body language to ball's motion,"To predict where a thrown ball will land, an observer may use visual information about its trajectory. However, in addition, the thrower's body language (i.e., body movement and facial expression) may contain useful information that could be used by the observer to understand intention and emotional state. Here, we investigated how observers estimated a ball's landing point thrown by a virtual agent with different amounts of information from body language. In addition, occlusion time was varied to examine how it potentiates the use of body-language information. Results showed that body movement and facial expression carry information about thrower's effort. However, once the ball has left the thrower's hand, advance information on facial expression does contribute to judgments only if consistent with the amplitude of the throw. Moreover, as the occlusion time increases, a stronger influence of the body movement is observed for estimating the landing point. The overriding effect of ball's trajectory availability over body language is discussed.","Prigent, E.",0,10.1007/s00221-014-4137-0,1659
4653,Children and adults use attractiveness as a social cue in real people and avatars,"Observing social interactions between children and adults is a major method in the toolkit of psychologists who examine social development and social relationships. Although this method has revealed many interesting phenomena, it cannot determine the effect of behavior independent of other traits. Research on the role of attractiveness in social development provides an example of this conundrum: Are attractive and unattractive children/adults treated differently because of their attractiveness (independent of their behavior), do they behave differently and thus elicit differential treatment, or both? Virtual world and avatar-based technologies allow researchers to control the social behaviors of targets; however, whether children and adults use the facial attractiveness of avatars as a social cue in the same way as they do with real peers is currently unknown. Using Mii avatars from the popular Nintendo Wii video game console, Study 1 found that the facial attractiveness ratings of real people strongly predicted the attractiveness ratings of avatar faces based on the former group. Study 2 revealed that adults (n = 46) and children (n = 42) prefer attractive avatars as social partners. The results of this set of methodological studies may help to clarify future research on the relationship between attractiveness and behavior throughout the lifespan. Furthermore, the use of avatars may allow studies to experimentally examine the effects of attractiveness in situations where such research is not ethical (e.g., peer victimization).

4655,,"This thesis explores the phenomenon through which numerous directors, from emerging and established film industries from East Asia, have been collectively recognised as auteurs in the West in the last two decades. The thesis proposes a multi-dimensional approach that investigates contexts, discourses, and agencies closely associated with three representative directors that shaped their auteur reputations, as revealed in different forms of archival materials which are treated as auteur paratexts. These paratexts are archival materials associated with the Rotterdam International Film Festival in relation to Apichatpong Weerasethakul, home video promotional materials in relation to Kim Ki-duk, and YouTube user-generated content in relation to Wong Kar-wai. Drawing on and expanding from the method of Foucauldian critical discourse analysis, the findings reveal persistent discourses on geo-politics in relation to national and regional cinema, and an expanded discourse on art cinema in relation to transnational multimedia art forms and diverse taste cultures. Further multi-modal textual analysis of sample materials, which take into account multiple individuals involved, illustrates how directors and associated agents negotiate discursive framings and assert their own pleasure and personal politics through language, voice and performance. Each case study also discusses wider networks of relationship, drawing on and expanding from Pierre Bourdieu's frameworks, which facilitate or undermine the process of auteur reputation-making associated with the three case study directors. In the context of the film festival, Apichatpong has been promoted as a modernist auteur as part of festival branding. Emerging through the commercial context of film distribution, Kim Ki-duk and associated distributors have drawn on and moved away from Kim's restricted cult reputation generated by influential distributors over time. The case study of Wong Kar-wai points to the importance of individual users on YouTube, who are not represented by film-related institutions but exhibit shared taste cultures through maintaining and expanding the director's reputation. As a whole, the thesis offers a multifaceted perspective on the East Asian auteur phenomenon and highlights collective cultures that sustain fascination with the auteur figure.","Promkhuntong, Wikanda",0,,1661
4656,,"Background: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are computer-generated characters that simulate key properties of human face-to-face conversation, such as verbal and nonverbal behavior. In Internet-based eHealth interventions, ECAs may be used for the delivery of automated human support factors. Objective: We aim to provide an overview of the technological and clinical possibilities, as well as the evidence base for ECA applications in clinical psychology, to inform health professionals about the activity in this field of research. Methods: Given the large variety of applied methodologies, types of applications, and scientific disciplines involved in ECA research, we conducted a systematic scoping review. Scoping reviews aim to map key concepts and types of evidence underlying an area of research, and answer less-specific questions than traditional systematic reviews. Systematic searches for ECA applications in the treatment of mood, anxiety, psychotic, autism spectrum, and substance use disorders were conducted in databases in the fields of psychology and computer science, as well as in interdisciplinary databases. Studies were included if they conveyed primary research findings on an ECA application that targeted one of the disorders. We mapped each study’s background information, how the different disorders were addressed, how ECAs and users could interact with one another, methodological aspects, and the study’s aims and outcomes. Results: This study included N = 54 publications (N = 49 studies). More than half of the studies (n = 26) focused on autism treatment, and ECAs were used most often for social skills training (n = 23). Applications ranged from simple reinforcement of social behaviors through emotional expressions to sophisticated multimodal conversational systems. Most applications (n = 43) were still in the development and piloting phase, that is, not yet ready for routine practice evaluation or application. Few studies conducted controlled research into clinical effects of ECAs, such as a reduction in symptom severity. Conclusions: ECAs for mental disorders are emerging. State-of-the-art techniques, involving, for example, communication through natural language or nonverbal behavior, are increasingly being considered and adopted for psychotherapeutic interventions in ECA research with promising results. However, evidence on their clinical application remains scarce. At present, their value to clinical practice lies mostly in the experimental determination of critical human support factors. In the context of using ECAs as an adjunct to existing interventions with the aim of supporting users, important questions remain with regard to the personalization of ECAs’ interaction with users, and the optimal timing and manner of providing support. To increase the evidence base with regard to Internet interventions, we propose an additional focus on low-tech ECA solutions that can be rapidly developed, tested, and applied in routine practice.

4660,Validating Automated Sentiment Analysis of Online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Patient Texts: An Exploratory Study,"Introduction: Sentiment analysis may be a useful technique to derive a user's emotional state from free text input, allowing for more empathic automated feedback in online cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) interventions for psychological disorders such as depression. As guided iCBT is considered more effective than unguided iCBT, such automated feedback may help close the gap between the two. The accuracy of automated sentiment analysis is domain dependent, and ft is unclear how well the technology is applicable to iCBT. This paper presents an empirical study in which automated sentiment analysis by an algorithm for the Dutch language is validated against human judgment. Methods: A total of 493 iCBT user texts were evaluated on overall sentiment and the presence of five specific emotions by an algorithm, and by 52 psychology students who evaluated 75 randomly selected texts each, providing about eight human evaluations per text. Inter-rater agreement (IRR) between algorithm and humans, and humans among each other, was analyzed by calculating the intra-class correlation under a numerical interpretation of the data, and Cohen's kappa, and Krippendorff's alpha under a categorical interpretation. Results: All analyses indicated moderate agreement between the algorithm and average human judgment with respect to evaluating overall sentiment, and low agreement for the specific emotions. Somewhat surprisingly, the same was the case for the IRR among human judges, which means that the algorithm performed about as well as a randomly selected human judge. Thus, considering average human judgment as a benchmark for the applicability of automated sentiment analysis, the technique can be considered for practical application. Discussion/Conclusion: The low human-human agreement on the presence of emotions may be due to the nature of the texts, it may simply be difficult for humans to agree on the presence of the selected emotions, or perhaps trained therapists would have reached more consensus. Future research may focus on validating the algorithm against a more solid benchmark, on applying the algorithm in an application in which empathic feedback is provided, for example, by an embodied conversational agent, or on improving the algorithm for the iCBT domain with a bottom-up machine learning approach.","Provoost, S.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01065,1663
4665,Utility-based Multi-agent System with Spatial Interactions: The Case of Virtual Estate Development A Stochastic Simulation-based Modeling Approach,"A multi-agent system is presented here. Agent decisions are based on economic partial utilities. It's a new computational tool using cellular and agent-based models. Decision processes are represented through computational agents. Land-use and land cover changes are represented through a cellular model. It belongs to kind of models called Multi-Agent Systems model of Land-Use Cover Change. Decisions concern the estate development in the neighborhood of the agents. Space is discretized in heterogeneous cells where heterogeneous agents interact together (directly or via space). Based on partial utility probabilities, several stochastic simulations are achieved. These simulations are then summarized, replicated and a parameter sensitivity analysis provided. The main parameters influencing the decisions of an agent depend on his type (ecologist, etc.) and on the expected economic activities in his neighborhood. Little information is assumed to be known about the mechanisms determining the parameter values guiding the decisions of the agents, except their type. The whole system constitutes a general virtual model, mostly independent from initial conditions and real data. Sensitivity analysis are used to explore behavioral paths and influencing parameters. In summary, the main contribution of this paper consists in: (i) defining a simulation-based framework for modeling the decisions of many heterogeneous economic agents involved in spatial interactions; (ii) capturing the decision process using general utility-based equations; (iii) providing a sensitivity analysis of initial parameter values. An example of possible application investigating strategies of various categories of agents (institutions, landowners, homeowners, etc.) facing an intense residential development is provided. The framework consists of abstracting institutional characteristics of actual local Urbanism Plan procedures in France.

4675,Twitter Activism and Ethical Witnessing: Possibilities and Challenges of Feminist Politics Against Gender-Based Violence,"This article examines digital activism on Twitter against gender-based violence with regard to the March 8, 2017, feminist movement in Spain (8M). We explore a sample of 20,000 messages (tweets, retweets, and mentions) of the most commonly utilized hashtags in this context, such as #8M and #NiUnaMenos (Not one less [woman]). We analyze if, in the case of 8M in Spain, digital feminist activism constituted a challenge to the hegemonic frames of representation of gender-based violence. Using the concept of ""ethical testimony,"", we demonstrate the opportunity that giving testimony on gender-based violence offers to digital feminist activism to act in an effective, political manner on Twitter, circumventing invisibility. These hashtags do not form strong conversational communities but rather serve to diffuse messages at a mass scale. Within these conversational communities, the term ""victim"" is rarely utilized, which we interpret as an accomplishment of women as agents capable of resisting their position of vulnerability.","Puente, S.

4678,Technology versus teachers in the early literacy classroom: an investigation of the effectiveness of the Istation integrated learning system,"Guided by Vygotsky's social learning theory, this study reports a 24-week investigation on whether regular use of Istation(A (R)), an integrated learning system used by approximately 4 million students in the United States, had an effect on the early literacy achievement of children in twelve kindergarten classrooms. A mixed-method, quasi-experimental design was constructed using propensity scores. Also investigated were the effects of the level of teacher literacy support on early literacy achievement and the interaction between Istation(A (R)) use and the level of teacher literacy support. A descriptive discriminant analysis was performed to determine the main effect of Istation(A (R)). The level of teacher support and the interaction effect was then tested using a multivariate between-subject analysis. Results indicated that Istation(A (R)) did have a statistically significant effect on the early literacy skills of the kindergarten students studied and could explain 17.7% of the variance in group differences. Teacher literacy support and the interaction between teacher support and Istation(A (R)) were not significant. This study considers the relationship between technology and early literacy and concludes that Istation(A (R)) can serve as a more knowledgeable other as students develop some early literacy skills; however, teachers are still needed to provide complete literacy instruction for young students.","Putman, R.

4679,,"The proliferation of Internet services drives the data center expansion in both size and the number. More importantly, the energy consumption (as part of total cost of ownership (TCO)) has become a social concern. When the workload demand is given, the data center operators desire minimizing their TCO. On the other hand, when the workload demand is unknown while the requirements on quality (QoE) of experience of the Internet services are given, the data center operators need to determine appropriate amount of resources and design redirection strategies in presence of multiple data centers to guarantee the QoE. For the first problem, we present formulations to minimize server energy consumption and server cost under three different data enter scenarios (homogeneous, heterogeneous, hybrid hetero-homogeneous clusters) with dynamic temporal demand. Our studies show that the homogeneous model significantly differs the heterogenous model in computational time. To be able to compute optimal configurations in near real-time for large scale data centers, we propose aggregation by maximum and aggregation by mean modes for different Internet service requirements. In aggregation by maximum mode, the price of reducing computational time is over-provisioning (which causes extra energy consumption). In aggregation by mean mode, the price is the degradation of the timeliness of services. However, they still result in significant cost savings compared to the scenario when all servers are on during the entire duration. We first introduce an intuitive aggregation method: static aggregation. For each mode, dynamic aggregation is introduced to alleviate their individual drawbacks. The dynamic aggregation by maximum results in cost savings up to approximately 18% over the static aggregation by maximum. For three random distributed workload cases, the dynamic aggregation by mean can save up to approximately 50% workload reallocation compared to static aggregation. Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling (DVFS) capacity is further considered in our model. Our numerical results show that adopting DVFS results in significantly reduction of energy consumption. For the second problem, the data center provides resources via the cloud computing model. We propose a hierarchical modeling approach that can easily combine all components in the data center provisioning environment. Identifying interactions among the components is the key to construct such a model. In providing internet service by cloud computing hosted in data centers, we first construct four sub-models: an outbound bandwidth model, a cloud computing (hosted by data centers) availability model, a latency model and a cloud computing response time model. Then we use a data center redirection strategy graph to glue them together. We also introduce an all-in-one barometer to ease the QoE evaluation. The numeric results show that our model serves as a very useful analytical tool for data center operators to provide appropriate resources as well as design redirection strategies. In addition, we study the redirection strategies (schemes) in a particular Internet service, agent-based virtual private networks architecture (ABVA). It refers to the environment where a third-party provider runs and administers remote access virtual private network (VPN) service for organizations that do not want to maintain their own in-house VPN servers. We consider the problem of optimally connecting users of an organization to VPN server locations in an ABVA environment so that request denial probability and latency are balanced. A user request needs a certain bandwidth between the user and the VPN server. The VPN server may deny requests when the bandwidth is insufficient (capacity limitation). At the same time, the latency perceived by a user from its current location to a VPN server is an important consideration. We present a number of strategies regarding how VPN servers are to be selected and the number of servers to be tried so that request denial probability is minimized without unduly affect","Qian, Haiyang",0,,1668
4680,,"In many real-world multi-agent systems, the intrinsic dynamics of velocity for each agent is usually nonlinear dynamic rather than static. Moreover, it is often difficult to obtain the continuous velocity information of multi-agent systems. To overcome the above essential difficulties, this paper aims at investigating the second-order consensus problem of multi-agents systems with nonlinear dynamics by using impulsive control signal protocol. In detail, by using the impulsive signals from agents and virtual leaders, several impulsive control protocols are designed for reaching the second-order consensus of multi-agent systems with fixed or switching topologies. The theoretical analysis is also given to guarantee the second-order consensus based on algebraic graph theory and stability theory of impulsive differential equations. Finally, two typical examples are used to validate the above developed theoretical results.

4684,,"Rail underground systems are seen as a way to overcome traffic congestion in city environments. Many new subways are being built in China and developing countries. Recent studies have however shown that the ventilation of subway systems is poorly understood. There is significant danger to life if a fire occurs or toxins such as chemical or biological agents are released in a subway. Understanding the air flow inside a subway and how this is affected by the local environment is key in establishing effective evacuation strategies. A series of tracer gas experiments conducted as part of this research have been carried out. To expand the subway climatology from an experimental framework into a virtual and simulation environment, 3D Computational Fluid Dynamic models have been developed, which include the simulation of local microclimate and air movement inside the station respectively. The station CFD model has allowed the analysis of the air flow inside the station under the prevailing external weather condition. Results show promising links between external climatic factors, the subway climatology and the ability to predict the dispersal of smoke/toxins. The local weather pattern has a large influence on the background airflow inside a station and dominated the flow direction at station exits which is been used to evaluate the efficiency of pedestrian evacuation and also determine the safer evacuation route and exit. The possibilities of integrating these findings will allow for a more holistic safety assessment to be carried out that could reduce the loss of life or mitigate harmful effects on public health. It also fills a knowledge gap in design guidelines from a safety perspective underground station construction and ventilation.","Qian, Zi",0,,1670
4685,,"Anthropogenic modification of natural rivers in the form of dams, dredging, or shoreline alteration can significantly impede river connectivity. Fish passage plays a significant role in mitigating ecological impairment. However, the traditional build-and-test paradigm is cost-ineffective when the observed fish passage efficiency performs below expectations. A systematic approach that integrates design and evaluation of fish passage before installation is suggested here as a means of addressing this challenge. This study proposes a framework that combines fish passage design and pre-installation evaluation and implements it in a fish passage project for emerald shiners (Notropis atherinoides) in the Niagara River near Buffalo, New York. The proposed fish passage differs from other more common structures in that it is based on an unconfined design that allows fish to enter or leave the passage at any point along the installation. There are three components of this framework: (1) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, (2) physical modeling, and (3) virtual fish modeling. CFD modeling provides a numerical evaluation of performance of the fish passage design. Physical modeling tests the capability of fish passage modular structures to reduce the velocities to a range in which the emerald shiners can swim sustainably and to demonstrate that fish would choose to swim through the structures. The CFD results show that the recommended design achieves the desired lower velocity, and the physical model results also indicate that the proposed unconfined fish passage can serve as a shelter for migrating emerald shiners. Knowledge of emerald shiner movement and associated hydrodynamic experience in complex flows is obtained in the physical modeling through a new comprehensive video data analysis scheme, which integrates large-scale particle velocimetry (LSPTV), a fish detection model, and a background-foreground subtraction method. LSPTV is employed to compute the instantaneous Eulerian flow field, and the fish detection model and background-foreground subtraction method are used to identify fish positions in each video frame. The fish detection model, which is based on deep learning, is shown to have a success rate of over 93% in identifying fish positions in the video frames. Simultaneous measurements of fish movement and local velocities reveal the precise hydrodynamic conditions experienced by fish in complex flow, which provides a set of ‘hydrodynamic cues – decision’ pairs. A virtual fish model is developed based on the observed fish behavior. The virtual fish is formulated by computing the likelihood of a fish choosing one of a set of discrete moving directions at any instant, including holding position, or swimming forward, left, or right. The model consists of a multilayer forward artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The ANN takes temporal information such as fish prior swimming speed and direction as inputs, and the CNN takes spatially and temporally varying hydrodynamic cues such as velocity, vorticity, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), swirl, and strain rate as inputs. The trained hybrid CNN-ANN virtual fish model has an accuracy of just over 60%, when comparing predicted with observed decisions. Also, virtual fish in the physical model show similar trajectory trends to real fish swimming pathways, which suggests this deep learning technique holds promise in developing a non-parametric virtual fish model. A well-trained virtual fish can work as a smart agent in numerical modeling of different fish passage design candidates to optimize performance. The three components of the framework integrate knowledge of hydrodynamics and fish biology systematically, which offers a new approach for fish passage design and evaluation before installation.","Qiao, Jundong",0,,1671
4686,,"The creation of realistic and believable Three-Dimensional (3D) human characters continues to be an important goal for many modern 3D animators. However, the relationship between quality of 3D human animation and the way in which the audience responds is not yet understood. Since the audience's subjective judgement has implications for their perception and emotional response, it is important to find ways to address whether these are reported similarly by audiences. Moreover, the Uncanny Valley model, which describes a drop in believability as human-like characters become more realistic, assumes that the audience's perception would be affected by their emotional response. Therefore many 3D animators try to improve realism and believability so their 3D human animations cross over the Uncanny Valley. This thesis explore a number of components of 3D human characters and proposes a new model. for better understanding the interplay between 3D human animation and the audience. A review of the literature established that the audience's subjective feeling and emotional response are different aspects of audience perception, although both relate to their prior experience. This new model establishes that 3D human character's Appearance and Movement properties could influence the audience's perception of visual realism, but they also interact with the Contextual properties, which may not match the audience's expectations. These Contextual properties, including emotional expressions, are becoming increasingly important, especially when the 3D human characters are performing in a realistic context. Therefore this thesis investigated a number of factors influencing cephalic animation and perception of cephalic animation in 3D human characters. Empirical studies demonstrated that a dynamic displayed 3D human cephalic animation with speech can significantly affect the audience's subjective judgement, in terms of Eeriness, Believability and Actual Visual Realism. Further investigation demonstrated that there is a range of subcomponents of movements, which affect the audience's subjective judgement.Neck auxiliary, gaze behaviour and eye region all contributed to the audience perception and emotional response in different ways. This thesis adds to this understanding and will facilitate 3D animators to create 3D human characters which can better influence the audience's subjective judgement. Moreover, this thesis suggests that there is more to understanding animated display than simply the display itself or the sum of its component parts.","Qiao, Si",0,,1672
4687,,"Calcium phosphate spheres as biomaterials have been attracting attention in recent years. Calcium phosphate occurs naturally in bone, and a hollow structure could be advantageous for drug loading and release. The combination of a calcium phosphate chemistry and a spherical-hollow structure could be an optimal strategy for specific biomaterial applications, e.g., certain dental and drug-delivery applications.The focus of this thesis is on the synthesis, formation mechanism and applications of hollow, spherical calcium phosphate particles. First, the thesis describes two methods for the synthesis of calcium phosphate (CaP) spherical particles. The first method involves synthesis of hollow calcium phosphate spherical particles via a supersaturated buffer solution based on a previous study. It was utilised to prepare spheres for applications in drug delivery and dentistry. The second method was developed to explain the mechanism of formation of hollow calcium phosphate spheres. It aimed at revealing the particular function of magnesium in the formation of spherical particles. With the use of this modified method, it could be concluded that the only ions active in the formation of CaP spherical particles are calcium ions, phosphate ions and magnesium ions. Compared with the thermodynamics of micellisation, a new model, called three ions virtual micelle effect, was developed to explain the mechanism of the Mg function. Following this mechanism, a series of spherical particles of other compositions were explored. These spherical particles included strontium phosphate, barium phosphate, calcium fluoride, strontium fluoride and barium fluoride.In this thesis, CaP spheres were studied for the controlled delivery of active ingredients and as active agent for tooth remineralisation. The first investigated application was to control the release of vancomycin from Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) cement via strontium-doped CaP spheres (SCPS). The results showed that incorporation of CaP spheres into PMMA could enhance antibiotic release while maintaining the mechanical strength. The second application was to control hydrogen peroxide (HP) release from two bleaching gel, in which CP-loaded CaP spheres were the active ingredient. One gel with low HP concentration was developed as an at-home bleaching gel, and one with high HP concentration was developed as an in-office bleaching gel. The results showed that CaP spheres would give a controlled release of peroxide and thus have a potential to increase the efficacy of the bleaching. The third application was to investigate the potential for an anti-sensitivity effect of the spheres, as active agents in toothpaste. We studied the tooth tubules occlusion and the remineralisation effect of CaP spheres. After 7 days of application, the open dentin tubules and surface were fully covered by a newly formed apatite layer, demonstrating the remineralisation potential of the spheres.","Qin, Tao",0,,1673

4692,"Now you feel it, now you don't How observing human-robot interactions and human-human interactions can make you feel eerie","Robots seemingly in possession of an experiential mind, as well as humans allegedly incapable thereof, have been reported to elicit feelings of eeriness in their perceivers. The current work re-examined this claim, asking participants to rate both robots and humans in various social situations regarding their mind capacities (e.g., emotional capability, intelligence), non-mind qualities (e.g., animacy, usefulness), and overall appeal (e.g., eeriness, likeability). It was found that feelings of eeriness towards both targets formed a distinct emotional response that was separable from simple dislike. Yet, unexpectedly, eeriness towards both targets intensified, the less they were seen as possessing a typical human mind. For robots, however, this association was less consistent. Moreover, eeriness towards robots, but not towards humans, was most strongly predicted by a lack of perceived usefulness. These results indicate that mind attributions affect people's attitudes towards each other more strongly than their attitudes towards humanoid robots.","Quadflieg, S.",0,10.1075/is.17.2.03qua,1675
4695,,"Trust is a critical component to both human-automation and human-human interactions.

However, these design strategies have been primarily used to facilitate initial trust formation but have not been examined means to actively repair trust that has been violated by a system failure. Previous research has shown that trust in another party can be effectively repaired after a violation using various strategies, but there is little evidence substantiating such strategies in human-automation context. The current study examined the effectiveness of trust repair strategies, derived from a human-human or human-organizational context, in human-automation interaction. During a taxi dispatching task, participants interacted with imperfect automation that either denied or apologized for committing competence- or integrity-based failures. Participants performed two experimental blocks (one for each failure type), and, after each block, reported subjective trust in the automation. Consistent with interpersonal literature, our analysis revealed that automation apologies more successfully repaired trust following competence-based failures than integrity-based failures. However, user trust in automation was not significantly different when the automation denied committing competence- or integrity-based failures. These findings provide important insight into the unique ways in which humans interact with machines.","Quinn, Daniel Braden",0,,1676

4697,Judging Others by Your Own Standards: Attractiveness of Primate Faces as Seen by Human Respondents,"The aspects of facial attractiveness have been widely studied, especially within the context of evolutionary psychology, which proposes that aesthetic judgements of human faces are shaped by biologically based standards of beauty reflecting the mate quality. However, the faces of primates, who are very similar to us yet still considered non-human, remain neglected. In this paper, we aimed to study the facial attractiveness of non-human primates as judged by human respondents. We asked 286 Czech respondents to score photos of 107 primate species according to their perceived ""beauty."" Then, we analyzed factors affecting the scores including morphology, colors, and human-likeness. We found that the three main primate groups were each scored using different cues. The proportions of inner facial features and distinctiveness are cues widely reported to affect human facial attractiveness. Interestingly, we found that these factors also affected the attractiveness scores of primate faces, but only within the Catarrhines, i.e., the primate group most similar to humans. Within this group, human-likeness positively affected the attractiveness scores, and facial extremities such as a prolonged nose or exaggerated cheeks were considered the least attractive. On the contrary, the least human-like prosimians were scored as the most attractive group. The results are discussed in the context of the ""uncanny valley,"" the widely discussed empirical rule.","Radlova, S.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02439,1678
4700,Humanoid robots versus humans: How is emotional valence of facial expressions recognized by individuals with schizophrenia? An exploratory study,"Background: The use of humanoid robots to play a therapeutic role in helping individuals with social disorders such as autism is a newly emerging field, but remains unexplored in schizophrenia. As the ability for robots to convey emotion appear of fundamental importance for human-robot interactions, we aimed to evaluate how schizophrenia patients recognize positive and negative facial emotions displayed by a humanoid robot. Methods: We included 21 schizophrenia outpatients and 17 healthy participants. In a reaction time task, they were shown photographs of human faces and of a humanoid robot (iCub) expressing either positive or negative emotions, as well as a non-social stimulus. Patients' symptomatology, mind perception, reaction time and number of correct answers were evaluated. Results: Results indicated that patients and controls recognized better and faster the emotional valence of facial expressions expressed by humans than by the robot. Participants were faster when responding to positive compared to negative human faces and inversely were faster for negative compared to positive robot faces. Importantly, participants performed worse when they perceived iCub as being capable of experiencing things (experience subscale of the mind perception questionnaire). In schizophrenia patients, negative correlations emerged between negative symptoms and both robot's and human's negative face accuracy. Conclusions: Individuals do not respond similarly to human facial emotion and to non-anthropomorphic emotional signals. Humanoid robots have the potential to convey emotions to patients with schizophrenia, but their appearance seems of major importance for human-robot interactions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

4710,Using mimicry of body movements by a virtual agent to increase synchronization behavior and rapport in individuals with schizophrenia,"Synchronization of behavior such as gestures or postures is assumed to serve crucial functions in social interaction but has been poorly studied to date in schizophrenia. Using a virtual collaborative environment (VCS), we tested 1) whether synchronization of behavior, i.e., the spontaneous initiation of gestures that are congruent with those of an interaction partner, was impaired in individuals with schizophrenia compared with healthy participants; 2) whether mimicry of the patients' body movements by the virtual interaction partner was associated with increased behavioral synchronization and rapport. 19 patients and 19 matched controls interacted with a virtual agent who either mimicked their head and torso movements with a delay varying randomly between 0.5 s and 4 s or did not mimic, and rated feelings of rapport toward the virtual agent after each condition. Both groups exhibited a higher and similar synchronization behavior of the virtual agent forearm movements when they were in the Mimicry condition rather than in the No-mimicry condition. In addition, both groups felt more comfortable with a mimicking virtual agent rather than a virtual agent not mimicking them suggesting that mimicry is able to increase rapport in individuals with schizophrenia. Our results suggest that schizophrenia cannot be considered anymore as a disorder of imitation, particularly as regards behavioral synchronization processes in social interaction contexts.","Raffard, S.",0,10.1038/s41598-018-35813-6,1680

How Infants Learn About the Identity of Objects in a Causal Chain,"Four experiments investigated infants' and adults' knowledge of the identity of objects in a causal sequence of events. In Experiments 1 and 2, 18- and 22-month-olds in the visual habituation procedure were shown a 3-step causal chain event in which the relation between an object's part ( dynamic or static) and its causal role was either consistent or inconsistent with the real-world. In Experiment 3, 22-month-olds were tested with a delayed launching causal chain in which the second object, rather than the first, was the agent of the outcome. In Experiment 4, adults were shown the same events and were asked to judge whether the first or second object in the causal chain was animate or inanimate. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that 18-month-olds were unconstrained in the part-causal role relations they would encode, but 22-month-olds learned only those relations that were consistent with the real-world. Experiment 3 showed that 22-month-olds expect the second object in a delayed launching sequence to possess a dynamic, moving part. Experiment 4 showed that adults expect the first object of a causal chain to be animate and the second object to be inanimate.

The curiosity (perceptual curiosity and epistemic curiosity) is realized through combining perceptual saliency detection and Machine-Learning based approaches. The learning is accomplished by autonomous observation of visual patterns and by interaction with an expert (a human tutor) detaining semantic knowledge about the detected visual patterns. Experimental results validating the deployment of the investigated system have been obtained on the basis of a humanoid robot acquiring visually knowledge from its surrounding environment interacting with a human tutor. We show that our cognitive system allows the humanoid robot to discover the surrounding world in which it evolves, to learn new knowledge about it and describe it using human-like (natural) utterances.

4729,Empathy and the Limits of Thought Experiments,"This article criticizes what it calls perspectival thought experiments, which require subjects to mentally simulate a perspective before making judgments from within it. Examples include Judith Thomson's violinist analogy, Philippa Foot's trolley problem, and Bernard Williams's Jim case. The article argues that advances in the philosophical and psychological study of empathy suggest that the simulative capacities required by perspectival thought experiments are all but impossible. These thought experiments require agents toconsciously simulate necessarily unconscious features of subjectivity. To complete these experiments subjects must deploy theory-theoretical frameworks to predict what they think they would (or ought to) do. These outputs, however, systematically mislead subjects and are highly prone to error. They are of negligible probative value, and this bodes poorly for their continued use. The article ends with two suggestions. First, many thought experiments are not problematically perspectival. Second, it should be possible to carry out in-their-shoes perspectival thought experiments by off-loading simulations onto virtual environments into which philosophers place subjects.","Ramirez, E.",0,10.1111/meta.12249,1685

In this paper, we report on our experiences of a chemistry course that was especially designed to encourage learning in small groups of students (four to five per course). The course design included inquiry-based approaches, case methodology and problem-based learning concepts. The main goal was to enhance student motivation and to support them to become active agents ('pro-sumers'). Technology was adopted to support students in their inquiry-based learning processes by using online logs, group wikis and quizzes and with sections of laboratory work. We explored student perceptions during the first 2 years in two courses. The students were, in general, very positive about the course and communicated that the technological tools along with the pedagogical design decisions had assisted them to different extents in their learning.

We investigate several salient features of the interaction between the guider and follower such as: 1) the order of an autoregressive (AR) control policy that maps states of the follower to actions of the guider; 2) how the guider may modulate the pulling force in response to the trust level of the follower; and 3) how learning may successively apportion the responsibility of control across different muscles of the guider. Based on experimental systems identification on human demonstrations from ten pairs of naive subjects, we show that guiders tend to adopt a third-order AR predictive control policy and followers tend to adopt second-order reactive control policy. Moreover, the extracted guider's control policy was implemented and validated by human-robot interaction experiments. By modeling the follower's dynamics with a time varying virtual damped inertial system, we found that it is the coefficient of virtual damping which is most sensitive to the trust level of the follower. We used these experimental insights to derive a novel controller that integrates an optimal order control policy with a push/pull force modulator in response to the trust level of the follower monitored using a time varying virtual damped inertial model.","Ranasinghe, A.",0,10.1109/tcyb.2015.2409772,1687
4741,,"Second Life is one of the most popular multi-purpose online virtual worlds, which supports applications in diversified areas relating to real-life activities. Moreover, it is possible to use Second Life in testing Artificial Intelligence theories by creating intelligent virtual agents. For the successful implementation of many of these applications, it is important to accurately identify events taking place inside Second Life. This involves extracting low-level spatio-temporal data and identifying the embedded high-level domain-specific information. This is an aspect that has not been taken into consideration in the prior research related to Second Life. This paper presents a framework that extracts data from Second Life with high accuracy and high frequency, and identifies the high-level domain-specific events and other contextual information embedded in these low-level data.

4744,F2FCrowds: Planning Agent Movements to Enable Face-to-Face Interactions,"The simulation of human behaviors in virtual environments has many applications. In many of these applications, situations arise in which the user has a face-to-face interaction with a virtual agent. In this work, we present an approach for multi-agent navigation that facilitates a face-to-face interaction between a real user and a virtual agent that is part of a virtual crowd. In order to predict whether the real user is approaching a virtual agent to have a face-to-face interaction or not, we describe a model of approach behavior for virtual agents. We present a novel interaction velocity prediction (IVP) algorithm that is combined with human body motion synthesis constraints and facial actions to improve the behavioral realism of virtual agents. We combine these techniques with full-body virtual crowd simulation and evaluate their benefits by conducting a user study using Oculus HMD in an immersive environment. Results of this user study indicate that the virtual agents using our interaction algorithms appear more responsive and are able to elicit more reaction from the users. Our techniques thus enable face-to-face interactions between a real user and a virtual agent and improve the sense of presence observed by the user.","Randhavane, T.",0,10.1162/PRES_a_00294,1689
4747,An oscillatory neural network model that demonstrates the benefits of multisensory learning,"Since the world consists of objects that stimulate multiple senses, it is advantageous for a vertebrate to integrate all the sensory information available. However, the precise mechanisms governing the temporal dynamics of multisensory processing are not well understood. We develop a computational modeling approach to investigate these mechanisms. We present an oscillatory neural network model for multisensory learning based on sparse spatio-temporal encoding. Recently published results in cognitive science show that multisensory integration produces greater and more efficient learning. We apply our computational model to qualitatively replicate these results. We vary learning protocols and system dynamics, and measure the rate at which our model learns to distinguish superposed presentations of multisensory objects. We show that the use of multiple channels accelerates learning and recall by up to 80%. When a sensory channel becomes disabled, the performance degradation is less than that experienced during the presentation of non-congruent stimuli. This research furthers our understanding of fundamental brain processes, paving the way for multiple advances including the building of machines with more human-like capabilities.","Rao, A.

4748,Community and trust-aware fake media detection,"Nowadays, it becomes increasingly difficult to find reliable multimedia content in the Web 2.0. Open decentralized networks (on the Web) are populated with lots of unauthenticated agents providing fake multimedia. Conventional automatic detection and authentication approaches lack scalability and the ability to capture media semantics by means of forgery. Using them in online scenarios is computationally expensive. Thus, our aim was to develop a trust-aware community approach to facilitate fake media detection. In this paper, we present our approach and highlight four important outcomes. First, a Media Quality Profile (MQP) is proposed for multimedia evaluation and semantic classification with one substantial part on estimating media authenticity based on trust-aware community ratings. Second, we employ the concept of serious gaming in our collaborative fake media detection approach overcoming the cold-start problem and providing sufficient data powering our Media Quality Profile. Third, we identify the notion of confidence, trust, distrust and their dynamics as necessary refinements of existing trust models. Finally, we improve the precision of trust-aware aggregated media authenticity ratings by introducing a trust inference algorithm for yet unknown sources uploading and rating media.","Rashed, K. A.

4752,,"CPU-intensive computing at LHC (The Large Hadron Collider) requires collaborative distributed computing resources to accomplish its data reconstruction and analysis. Currently, institutional Grid is trying to manage and process large datasets within limited time and cost. The baseline paradigm is now well established to use the Computing Grid and more specifically the WLCG (Worldwide LHC Computing Grid) and its supporting infrastructures. In order to achieve its Grid Computing, LHCb has developed a Community Grid Solution called DIRAC (Distributed Infrastructure with Remote Agent Control). It is based on a pilot job submission system to the institutional Grid infrastructures. However, there are other computing resources like idle desktops (e.g. SETI@home), the idle computing cluster (e.g. CERN's Online selection farm outside data-taking periods by LHC detectors) that could be used outside the Grid infrastructures. Because of their lightweight, in particular, simulation activities could benefit from using those opportunistic resources. The DIRAC architecture allows the use of the existing institutional grid resources. To expand the capability of existing computing powers, I have proposed to integrate opportunistic resources in the distributed computing system (DIRAC). In order, not to be dependent on the local settings for the worker node at the external resource, I propose using virtual machines. The architectural modifications required for DIRAC are presented here, with specific examples for data analyses non-Grid clusters. This solution was achieved by making the necessary changes in 3 state-of-the-art technologies: DIRAC, CernVM and OpenNebula. The combination of these three techniques is referred to as the DiCON architecture. I am referring the new approach as a framework rather than a specific technical solution to a specific scientific problem as this can be reused in similar big data analysis environment. I have also shown how this was used to analyse large-scale climate data. This was a rather challenging to use one developed infrastructure to another research area. I have also proposed to use dataflow architecture to exploit the possibilities of opportunistic resources and in the meantime, establish reliability and stability. Dataflow computing architecture in a virtual environment is seen as a possible future research extension of this work. This is a theoretical contribution only and this is a unique approach in a virtual cloud (not in-house computing) environment. This paradigm could give the scientific community access to a large number of non- conventional opportunistic CPU resources for scientific data processing. This PhD work optimises the challenges and the solutions provided by such a computing infrastructure.","Rashid, Md Mamunur",0,,1692
4753,When Automobiles Are Avacars: A Self-Other-Utility Approach to Cars and Avatars,"This article argues that automobiles can be understood as avatars, or avacars, given the inclusive definition of avatars as mediated (not necessarily digital) representations of human users that facilitate interaction with other users, entities, or environments. Building on an understanding of user-avatar relationships, the article argues that automobiles (and avatars in general) serve as self-representations, social others, and/or utilitarian tools in different degrees. Examples of automotive and digital avatars are classified within this Self-Other-Utility (SOU) framework. The article argues that this framework provides a new and valuable approach to understanding the antecedents and consequences of using avatars. Regarding consequences, in the automotive context, the SOU framework could be used to explain how psychological and social factors influence driving habits (i.e., safety), adoption (e.g., of autonomous vehicles), and brand loyalty. A measurement scale to facilitate such research is offered. After presenting some potential limitations to this approach, the article concludes with counterarguments that reaffirm the value and relevance of this new perspective to communication scholarship.","Ratan, R.",0,,1693

As a further refinement and enhancement to our prior work on ECA, this thesis research proposes a cohesive framework to integrate emotion-based facial animation with improved intention discovery. In addition, a machine learning technique modelled from Q-learning (Quality-Learning) technique is introduced to support sentiment analysis for the adjustment of policy design in POMDP-based dialogue management.

4755,Automating the Production of Communicative Gestures in Embodied Characters,"In this paper we highlight the different challenges in modeling communicative gestures for Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs). We describe models whose aim is to capture and understand the specific characteristics of communicative gestures in order to envision how an automatic communicative gesture production mechanism could be built. The work is inspired by research on how human gesture characteristics (e.g., shape of the hand, movement, orientation and timing with respect to the speech) convey meaning. We present approaches to computing where to place a gesture, which shape the gesture takes and how gesture shapes evolve through time. We focus on a particular model based on theoretical frameworks on metaphors and embodied cognition that argue that people can represent, reason about and convey abstract concepts using physical representations and processes, which can be conveyed through physical gestures.","Ravenet, B.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01144,1695
4759,,"Embodied conversational agents are changing the way humans interact with technology. Agents are expected to behave like people, both verbally and non-verbally. Researchers within the Human-Computer Interaction community have found many attributes of an agent’s gesture contribute to an agent’s perceived personality and believability. Gesture amplitude and frequency are two of the attributes that contribute to the naturalness of a gesture. Currently, no previous studies have defined an empirical baseline for generating natural gestures for these two attributes. I seek to discover whether gesture amplitude and frequency affect how users perceive an agent’s naturalness, and which gestures would be preferred for an agent based on its personality. In particular, I seek to quantify gesture amplitude and to compare it to a previous study on the perception of an agent’s naturalness of its gestures. In this thesis, non-verbal gesturing consists of movement of the arms and their location in space. I evaluate whether agents should use specific gestures more frequently than others depending on the personality type they have been designed with. My study is organized into three experiments and evaluations. My results show some indication that introverts and extraverts judge the agent’s naturalness similarly. The larger the amplitude the agent used, the more natural its gestures were perceived. The frequency of gestures between extraverts and introverts seem to show hardly any difference, even in terms of types of gesture used.","Rayon, Alex Michael",0,,1696
4760,The sense of social agency in gaze leading,"Social interactions entail reciprocal reactions where one's communicative acts triggers responses in others. Fluent interpersonal exchange relies on the ability to discriminate behaviors produced by others that are responses to one's actions, thus involving a social sense of agency. Given the pivotal role of gaze in human communication, we propose to use gaze following as a model for studying the sense of agency in social actions. The experiment investigates the influence of sensory expertise and timing of the action's effects by comparing feedback provided by a human avatar versus a nonfigurative animated object (an arrow) and by varying the control exerted by participants' gaze on the feedback (avatar vs arrow). Results revealed a linear relationship between the judgement of agency and feedback latencies and higher agency discriminating performances with the avatar. These outcomes suggest that classical cognitive accounts of the sense of agency can be expanded to the realm of social actions and provide important information for designing virtual agents to train social gaze interactions.","Recht, S.",0,10.1007/s12193-018-0286-y,1697
4762,,"This dissertation is an analysis of four semesters/cycles of practitioner and participatory action research inquiry on my use of critically compassionate intellectualism (CCI)—a framework of critical pedagogy, authentic caring, and a social-justice curriculum and purpose—to humanize an educational foundations course for pre-service teachers in a large urban, Midwestern university. A critical interpretation of social justice teacher education requires an uncompromising commitment to challenge the structural and cultural conventions that continue to marginalize certain students while privileging others. This is most likely to be accomplished by foregrounding consciousness-raising, anti-oppressive, and humane principles not only as educational aims, but, importantly, as keys to educational practice. With critical pedagogical theory and relational–cultural theory as frames, I examine how my implementation of CCI influenced my policies, practices, and pedagogy, and what this meant for students' learning and other experiences in the course. Additionally, I explore how CCI guided my methodological choices in the original four cycles of inquiry, as well as this fifth cycle of critical qualitative analysis. Findings from the study show that students valued the respect and care they experienced through this framework and were able to envision affording their own students the same relational support, which many began enacting immediately in their accompanying field experiences. Most felt empowered to take charge of their own learning and goals, to become critically reflective practitioners, and wanted to act as advocates and change agents for their diverse students. However, certain structural and personal limitations hindered our ability to enact more physically engaged and proactive interventions that would have strengthened their CCI experience. In the final analysis, it was both in spite of and because of these imperfections that I was able to realize my own moral vision of socially just teacher preparation, where reflexivity, critical consciousness, and compassion became assets to both their learning and my own continuing growth as a teacher educator.","Rector-Aranda, Amy",0,,1698

4765,Interactive Learning Experience-Driven Smart Communications Networks for Cognitive Load Management in Grammar Learning Context,"The widespread adoption of technology-enhanced learning in various knowledge disciplines has pushed forward the development of information technology-assisted media for language learning and teaching. However, most of the existing electronic-learning (e-learning) solutions have underexplored and under-addressed given specific characteristics of grammar learning, which is one of the most demanding areas of language education. The lack of pedagogically informed instructional design to enhance learning performance on the current system can result in low motivation and engagement due to an imbalance and excessive increase of the cognitive load. This paper attempts to address these deficiencies posed by the existing systems by proposing smart communication networks that are driven by the student learning experience to manage cognitive load in the context of grammar learning. The e-grammar learning networks serve as a collaborative learning platform that combines a pedagogically informed instructional model named attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) and cyber interaction among teaching/learning agents. From the technological perspective, our numerical simulations demonstrate the desirable performance indicators of the proposed networks to facilitate information exchange and learning. From the education perspective, our empirical studies show that the overall smart network-enabled e-grammar learning system has desirable characteristics to motivate learners (m = 3.78) and manage their overall cognitive load (m = 1.73), which suggest the promising capability of the proposed system.","Refat, N.",0,10.1109/access.2019.2915174,1700

In this article, we present an approach to intercultural training of non-verbal behaviors that makes use of enculturated virtual agents, i.e. interactive systems that take cultural heuristics for interpreting and generating behavior into account. Because current trends in intercultural training highlight the importance of a coaching approach, i.e. the ability to offer training units anytime and anywhere, the system was developed as a mobile solution taking the sensoric capabilities of smart phones into account for the user interaction in form of gesture recognition. After an introduction of the theoretical background on culture and enculturated systems, the system features are discussed in detail followed by an account of the application itself, emphasizing the importance of situated role-plays. Two evaluation studies are presented next that analyze the usability of the approach as well as the more important question of whether training with the system gives better results than traditional methods.","Rehm, M.",0,10.1007/s00530-011-0239-8,1701
4773,Men Scare Me More: Gender Differences in Social Fear Conditioning in Virtual Reality,"Women nearly twice as often develop social anxiety disorder (SAD) compared to men. The reason for this difference is still being debated. The present study investigates gender differences and the effect of male versus female agents in low (LSA) and high socially anxious (HSA) participants regarding the acquisition and extinction of social fear in virtual reality (VR). In a social fear conditioning (SFC) paradigm, 60 participants actively approached several agents, some of which were paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) consisting of a verbal rejection and spitting simulated by an aversive air blast (CS C), or without an US (CS). Primary outcome variables were defined for each of the 4 levels of emotional reactions including experience (fear ratings), psychophysiology (fear-potentiated startle), behavior (avoidance), and cognition (recognition task). Secondary outcome variables were personality traits, contingency ratings, heart rate (HR), and skin conductance response (SCR). As hypothesized, fear ratings for CS C increased significantly during acquisition and the differentiation between CS C and CS vanished during extinction. Additionally, women reported higher fear compared to men. Furthermore, a clear difference in the fear-potentiated startle response between male CS C and CS at the end of acquisition indicates successful SFC to male agents in both groups. Concerning behavior, results exhibited successful SFC in both groups and a general larger distance to agents in HSA than LSA participants. Furthermore, HSA women maintained a larger distance to male compared to female agents. No such differences were found for HSA men. Regarding recognition, participants responded with higher sensitivity to agent than object stimuli, suggesting a higher ability to distinguish the target from the distractor for social cues, which were on focus during SFC. Regarding the secondary physiological outcome variables, we detected an activation in HR response during acquisition, but there were no differences between stimuli or groups. Moreover, we observed a gender but no CS+/CS- differences in SCR. SFC was successfully induced and extinguished according to the primary outcome variables. VR is an interesting tool to measure emotional learning processes on different outcome levels with enhanced ecological validity. Future research should further investigate social fear learning mechanisms for developing more efficient treatments of SAD.","Reichenberger, J.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01617,1702
4779,Social Fear Conditioning Paradigm in Virtual Reality: Social vs. Electrical Aversive Conditioning,"In a previous study we could show that social fear can be induced and extinguished using virtual reality (VR). In the present study, we aimed to investigate the belongingness effect in an operant social fear conditioning (SFC) paradigm which consisted of an acquisition and an extinction phase. Forty-three participants used a joystick to approach different virtual male agents that served as conditioned stimuli. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two experimental conditions. In the electroshock condition, the unconditioned stimulus (US) used during acquisition was an electric stimulation. In the social threat condition, the US consisted of an offense: a spit in the face, mimicked by a sound and a weak air blast to the participant's neck combined with an insult. In both groups the US was presented when participants were close to the agent (75% contingency for CS+). Outcome variables included subjective, psychophysiological and behavioral data. As expected, fear and contingency ratings increased significantly during acquisition and the differentiation between CS+ and CS vanished during extinction. Furthermore, a clear difference in skin conductance between CS+ and CS at the beginning of the acquisition indicated that SFC had been successful. However, a fast habituation to the US was found toward the end of the acquisition phase for the physiological response. Furthermore, participants showed avoidance behavior toward CS+ in both conditions. The results show that social fear can successfully be induced and extinguished in VR in a human sample. Thus, our paradigm can help to gain insight into learning and unlearning of social fear. Regarding the belongingness effect, the social threat condition benefits from a better differentiation between the aversive and the non-aversive stimuli. As next step we suggest comparing social-phobic patients to healthy controls in order to investigate possible differences in discrimination learning and to foster the development of more efficient treatments for social phobia.","Reichenberger, J.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01979,1703
4784,"Learning with Educational Companion Robots? Toward Attitudes on Education Robots, Predictors of Attitudes, and Application Potentials for Education Robots","Previous research on attitudes toward robots has emphasized the aspect of cultural differences regarding the acceptance of social robots in everyday life. Existing work has also focused on the importance of various other factors (e.g., demographic variables, interest in science and technology, prior robot experience) that predict robot acceptance. Specific robot types like service or healthcare robots have also been investigated. Nevertheless, more research is needed to substantiate the empirical evidence on the role of culture, robot type, and other predictors when researching attitudes toward robots. We did so by conducting a survey on attitudes toward education robots in the German context. Besides, in the present research, we investigated predictors of attitudes toward education robots. Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest that German respondents have neutral attitudes toward education robots. However, our data support the notion of relative reluctance to engage in learning processes that include robots. Regarding demographic variables and personality dispositions, our results show that gender, age, need for cognition , and technology commitment significantly predicted people's attitudes. Concerning potential areas of application, respondents could picture using education robots in domains related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and rejected education robots in fields of arts and social sciences.","Reich-Stiebert, N.",0,10.1007/s12369-015-0308-9,1704

Compositionists are often expected to serve as institutional change agents in order to change the culture of writing and composition on their local campuses (McLeod, 1995; Adler-Kassner, 2008). While this expectation is frequently communicated to new members of the discipline, there are not sufficient pedagogical and professional development resources in order to train new graduate students and junior faculty to negotiate the institutional politics that often emerge during efforts to foster change. The object of this study, narrativized accounts of the politics of institutional change, provide one rich resource for this work, but these narratives have not been adequately theorized as pedagogical tools. To analyse these texts, I draw from Mueller’s (2012; 2017) recommendations for utilizing “distant reading” (Moretti, 2005) as a technique for observing disciplinary patterns. The results of this study reveal themes in descriptions of institutional stakeholders named in the selections from Journal of Basic Writing and Computers and Composition, which suggest implicit messages about how compositionists might expect to interact with individuals serving in these roles, Moreover, the results indicate that interactions with institutional stakeholders vary by discipline, as some stakeholders named repeatedly in Journal of Basic Writing were not referenced at all in Computers and Composition. This difference has implications for graduate study, indicating that a one-size-fits-all approach to graduate training about the politics of institutional change fails to capture nuances relevant to teacher-scholars working in a particular subdiscipline of composition. To conclude, I offer recommendations drawn from stakeholder mapping (Newcombe, 2003) and situational analysis (Clarke, 2005; 2015) for new approaches to graduate education that draw on data visualization methods (Mueller, 2012; Moretti, 2005) in this area.","Reid, Evelyn A.",0,,1705
4787,"Does the Modality Effect Exist? and if So, Which Modality Effect?","The modality effect is a central issue in multimedia learning [see Mayer (Cambridge University Press, 2005a), for a review]. Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), for example, presumes that an illustrated text is better understood when presented visually rather than orally. The predictive power of CLT lies in how it links in to Baddeley's (1986) model of working memory and Penney's (Mem Cognit 17: 398-442, 1989) Separate-Streams Hypothesis. Ginns's (Learn Instr 4: 313-331, 2005) recent meta-analysis also supports the modality effect (d = 0.72, based on 43 independent effects). This article replicates the meta-analysis of the modality effect based on 86 independent effects (with within-study subgroups as the unit of analysis and with mean of the outcomes as the dependent measure), with results showing a reduction of the overall effect size by almost half (d = 0.38), and even more when Duval and Tweedie's Trim and Fill method is used to correct publication bias (d = 0.20). This article also widens the scope of the analysis of moderator variables (e. g. Pace of presentation, Type of visualization, Research group) as well as their potentially confounded effects. Finally, it is argued that, for theoretical reasons, the so-called modality effect cannot be based on Penney's or Baddeley's theories and must be explained in a different way.","Reinwein, J.",0,10.1007/s10936-011-9180-4,1706

The agent-based model combines insights from theories related to collective effort, information overload, social identity, and interpersonal attraction to predict motivations for online community participation.

Personalized moderation outperforms other types of moderation in increasing members' commitment and contribution, especially in topically broad communities and those with high message volume.

In this paper, a novel biomimetic object impedance control strategy (BOI) is presented for dual-arm cooperative 7-DOF humanoid manipulators. A general impedance architecture comprising internal impedance control and object impedance control is adopted, which aims at conferring impedance behavior both in end-effector level and object level. Asymptotic stability and convergence of this controller are strictly derived from Lyapunov stability theory. Compared with conventional object impedance, the proposed controller can show different object impedance characteristics according to the external force applied on the object. It also can simultaneously minimize the energy cost of the adaptation process. Simulation and experimental results indicate that this controller exhibits explicit compliance behavior when the interaction with environment is weak and presents accumulation property of the stiffness and damping accordingly when the interaction is strong.

4796,Pupillary Responses to Robotic and Human Emotions: The Uncanny Valley and Media Equation Confirmed,"Physiological responses during human-robots interaction are useful alternatives to subjective measures of uncanny feelings for nearly humanlike robots (uncanny valley) and comparable emotional responses between humans and robots (media equation). However, no studies have employed the easily accessible measure of pupillometry to confirm the uncanny valley and media equation hypotheses, evidence in favor of the existence of these hypotheses in interaction with emotional robots is scarce, and previous studies have not controlled for low level image statistics across robot appearances. We therefore recorded pupil size of 40 participants that viewed and rated pictures of robotic and human faces that expressed a variety of basic emotions. The robotic faces varied along the dimension of human likeness from cartoonish to humanlike. We strictly controlled for confounding factors by removing backgrounds, hair, and color, and by equalizing low level image statistics. After the presentation phase, participants indicated to what extent the robots appeared uncanny and humanlike, and whether they could imagine social interaction with the robots in real life situations. The results show that robots rated as nearly humanlike scored higher on uncanniness, scored lower on imagined social interaction, evoked weaker pupil dilations, and their emotional expressions were more difficult to recognize. Pupils dilated most strongly to negative expressions and the pattern of pupil responses across emotions was highly similar between robot and human stimuli. These results highlight the usefulness of pupillometry in emotion studies and robot design by confirming the uncanny valley and media equation hypotheses.","Reuten, A.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00774,1710

In this research, we propose a new algorithm to tackle the challenge of assigning trust to Web resources. Our algorithm is inspired on Google's famous algorithm PageRank and generates values of trustworthiness of Web resources based on dynamically adjusted user credentials on different areas of study and history of interactions. The proposed algorithm was implemented in the Virtual Learning Commons, a bookmarking system, developed and hosted at the Cyber-ShARE Center of Excellence. The proposed algorithm was evaluated in an academic environment but can be used in other applications. The evaluation shows that the algorithm produced outperforms two out of the three algorithms we benchmarked against, while matching the results of the third. The evaluation results also show that the algorithm provides adequate trust assessments for Web resources. Future work includes the extension of this algorithm to consider additional variables (i.e., beyond user credentials) and a more comprehensive evaluation settings, including a more diverse subject population. Efforts that facilitate Web users to assign values of trustworthiness to Web resources will contribute to the overall utility of the world wide web, it will leverage the knowledge of the world and will formalize said knowledge so that machine agents may use to our benefit.","Reyna Cruz, Joaquin Andres",0,,1711

It argues that, in ignoring time and lived experience, the uncanny valley inscribes exclusionary boundaries around the human that are presented as inherent. The essay places Mori's theory into conversation with Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and what it identifies as the novel's ontology of entanglement between human and nonhuman. From this conversation it suggests that rather than wielding Mori's uncanny valley to uncritically replicate and reify our biases about the human, the uncanny valley can be viewed as a site that renders visible these boundaries and normative conceptions so that we might expand our visions of the human beyond them, while examining the histories by which these boundaries emerge.","Rhee, J.",0,10.1353/con.2013.0022,1712
4801,An incentive mechanism to promote honesty among seller agents in electronic marketplaces,"With the rapid development of online shopping, usually, sellers and buyers have virtual identities, which are not verified beforehand. As a result, establishing trust between sellers and buyers is much harder than before where sellers and buyers would meet face to face before making any transaction. In this work, we propose a method for the marketplace management under anonymous buyers and sellers which makes the honest behavior the most profiting action for rational sellers. In this method, the market operator adopts an honesty promoting mechanism based on direct reward and punishment in which being honest is the most profitable action. In most online marketplaces, a fee or commission is deducted from every payment before settling the account up with the seller. As such, with the dynamic adjustment of the fee, it is possible to reward or punish the seller. The correctness of this method is proven using mathematical models. The apparatus, processes, and algorithms for the marketplace are elaborated in detail so that market operators can easily apply the method in their existing marketplaces.","Riazati, M.",0,10.1007/s10660-018-9298-7,1713
4804,ForgetMeNot: What and how users expect intelligent virtual agents to recall and forget personal conversational content,"An important aspect of human interaction is our ability to store, retain, recall and organise information. Memory assists in building rapport and gaining trust. The growing field of artificial companions involving long term and casual/social relationships will require appropriate handling of memories of the user by an Intelligent Virtual Agent (IVA). This is a first study to determine what types of personal information (i.e., domain/task and casual/social) users expected an IVA to discuss and remember and how users responded to various levels of IVA recall and forgetting of that information: complete recall; total loss of recall; partial recall and incorrect recall. Our experiment collected conversations and survey responses from participants who interacted with a virtual real estate agent according to one of two treatments over three experimental sessions. No significant differences were found in participants' responses between task-focused or casual/social content, however a larger sample size may produce different results and some participants were not comfortable with answering the social questions. Recall was found to increase the user's enjoyment of interacting with the agent and also to increase the believability of the character over multiple interactions. We found that characters who recall information incorrectly are highly frustrating, are seen as having unnatural memory and this decreases the believability of the character. However, characters that exhibit forgetting, either explicitly stating their forgetfulness or not mentioning it at all, are seen to have a more natural memory and can help to increase the believability of the character. The study also suggests that forgetting affects the level of trust the user feels for the character. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Richards, D.",0,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2014.01.005,1714

Given pressure on specialist services and lengthy wait times, we propose a novel approach that involves awebsite and virtual specialist for patients while they are awaiting their specialist appointment. To capture patient history and provide tailored treatment advice, an interactive website was developed. To increase adherence, the website was enhanced with an empathic embodied conversational agent to allow discussion of the suggested treatment. A six-month trial with 74 children with urinary incontinence showed an overall improvement in 74% of patients, with 38% those who used the program reporting a resolution of their wetting without needing a specialist appointment. Capturing the expertise of medical specialists to provide online tailored treatment advice and use of humanlike face-to-face conversations to educate and build rapport with the patient appeared to increase treatment adherence compared to an earlier text-based version without the empathic agent.","Richards, D.",0,10.1109/jbhi.2017.2782210,1715
4808,Trusting Humans and Avatars: A Brain Imaging Study Based on Evolution Theory,"Avatars, as virtual humans possessing realistic faces, are increasingly used for social and economic interaction on the Internet. Research has already determined that avatar-based communication may increase perceived interpersonal trust in anonymous online environments. Despite this trust-inducing potential of avatars, however, we hypothesize that in trust situations, people will perceive human faces differently than they will perceive avatar faces. This prediction is based on evolution theory, because throughout human history the majority of interaction among people has taken place in face-to-face settings. Therefore, unlike perception of an avatar face, perception of a human face and the related trustworthiness discrimination abilities must be part of the genetic makeup of humans. Against this background, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment based on a multiround trust game to gain insight into the differences and similarities of interactions between humans versus human interaction with avatars. Our results indicate that (1) people are better able to predict the trustworthiness of humans than the trustworthiness of avatars; (2) decision making about whether or not to trust another actor activates the medial frontal cortex significantly more during interaction with humans, if compared to interaction with avatars; this brain area is of paramount importance for the prediction of other individuals' thoughts and intentions (mentalizing), a notably important ability in trust situations; and (3) the trustworthiness learning rate is similar, whether interacting with humans or avatars. Thus, the major implication of this study is that although interaction on the Internet may have benefits, the lack of real human faces in communication may serve to reduce these benefits, in turn leading to reduced levels of collaboration effectiveness.","Riedl, R.",0,10.2753/mis0742-1222300404,1716

Across multifarious platforms, including books, apps and television shows, it offers hope that we can be our own agents of change for a happier life. Critical research troubles this premise, arguing that the recurring trope of the individualistic ideal-self found in self-help literature is at the expense of seeking solutions in collective, feminist, or otherwise politicised activism. Self-help is also problematically gendered, since women are often positioned as particularly in need of improvement, an understanding further intensified by postfeminist sensibility. These issues are examined conceptually before introducing 10 articles on self-help published in Feminism & Psychology across three decades and brought together as a Virtual Special Issue to offer a significant body of work for scholars and students alike.","Riley, S.",0,10.1177/0959353519826162,1717
4817,Using Emotions in Intelligent Virtual Environments: The EJaCalIVE Framework,"Nowadays, there is a need to provide new applications which allow the definition and implementation of safe environments that attends to the user needs and increases their wellbeing. In this sense, this paper introduces the EJaCalIVE framework which allows the creation of emotional virtual environments that incorporate agents, eHealth related devices, human actors, and emotions projecting them virtually and managing the interaction between all the elements. In this way, the proposed framework allows the design and programming of intelligent virtual environments, as well as the simulation and detection of human emotions which can be used for the improvement of the decision-making processes of the developed entities. The paper also shows a case study that enforces the need of this framework in common environments like nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Concretely, the case study proposes the simulation of a residence for the elderly. The main goal is to have an emotion-based simulation to train an assistance robot avoiding the complexity involved in working with the real elders. The main advantage of the proposed framework is to provide a safe environment, that is, an environment where users are able to interact safely with the system.","Rincon, J.

We describe the design of a multimodal conversational agent-based system designed to provide longitudinal social support to isolated older adults. Results from a requirements analysis study and a remote ""Wizard-of-Oz"" study are presented that inform the design of the autonomous social support agent. An exploratory pilot study was conducted in which the agent was placed in the homes of 14 older adults for a week. Results indicate high levels of acceptance and satisfaction of the system. Results also indicate that when the agent proactively draws elders into interactions, triggered by a motion sensor, it is more effective at addressing loneliness than when the agent passively relies upon elders to initiate interactions. We discuss future research opportunities for affective computing to address this important societal problem.","Ring, L.",0,10.1007/s12193-014-0157-0,1719
4826,,"Often, when thinking of cities we envision designed landscapes, where people regulate everything from water to weeds, ultimately resulting in an ecosystem decoupled from biophysical processes. It is unclear, however, what happens when the people regulating these extensively managed landscapes come under stress, whether from unexpected economic fluctuations or from changing climate norms. The overarching question of my dissertation research was: How does urban vegetation change in response to human behavior? To answer this question, I conducted multiscale research in an arid urban ecosystem as well as in a virtual desert city. I used a combination of long-term data and agent-based modeling to examine changes in vegetation across a range of measures influenced by biophysical, climate, institutional, and socioeconomic drivers. At the regional scale, total plant species diversity increased from 2000 to 2010, while species composition became increasingly homogeneous in urban and agricultural areas. At the residential scale, I investigated the effects of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers—the Great Recession of 2007-2010 in particular—on changing residential yard vegetation in Phoenix, AZ. Socioeconomic drivers affected plant composition and increasing richness, but the housing boom from 2000 through 2005 had a stronger influence on vegetation change than the subsequent recession. Surprisingly, annual plant species remained coupled to winter precipitation despite my expectation that their dynamics might be driven by socioeconomic fluctuations. In a modeling experiment, I examined the relative strength of psychological, social, and governance influences on large-scale urban land cover in a desert city. Model results suggested that social norms may be strong enough to lead to large-scale conversion to low water use residential landscaping, and governance may be unnecessary to catalyze residential landscape conversion under the pressure of extreme drought conditions. Overall, my dissertation research showed that urban vegetation is dynamic, even under the presumably stabilizing influence of human management activities. Increasing climate pressure, unexpected socioeconomic disturbances, growing urban populations, and shifting policies all contribute to urban vegetation dynamics. Incorporating these findings into planning policies will contribute to the sustainable management of urban ecosystems.","Ripplinger, Julie",0,,1720
4827,Occluding the face diminishes the conceptual accessibility of an animate agent,"The language that people use to describe events reflects their perspective on the event. This linguistic encoding is influenced by conceptual accessibility, particularly whether individuals in the event are animate or agentive - animates are more likely than inanimates to appear as Subject of a sentence, and agents are more likely than patients to appear as Subject. We tested whether perceptual aspects of a scene can override these two conceptual biases when they are aligned: whether a visually prominent inanimate patient will be selected as Subject when pitted against a visually backgrounded animate agent. We manipulated visual prominence by contrasting scenes in which the face/torso/hand of the agent were visible vs. scenes in which only the hand was visible. Events with only a hand were more often associated with passive descriptions, in both production and comprehension tasks. These results highlight the power of visual prominence to guide how people conceptualise events.","Rissman, L.",0,10.1080/23273798.2018.1525495,1721

4831,Humanizing Machines: Anthropomorphization of Slot Machines Increases Gambling,"Do people gamble more on slot machines if they think that they are playing against humanlike minds rather than mathematical algorithms? Research has shown that people have a strong cognitive tendency to imbue humanlike mental states to nonhuman entities (i.e., anthropomorphism). The present research tested whether anthropomorphizing slot machines would increase gambling. Four studies manipulated slot machine anthropomorphization and found that exposing people to an anthropomorphized description of a slot machine increased gambling behavior and reduced gambling outcomes. Such findings emerged using tasks that focused on gambling behavior (Studies 1 to 3) as well as in experimental paradigms that included gambling outcomes (Studies 2 to 4). We found that gambling outcomes decrease because participants primed with the anthropomorphic slot machine gambled more (Study 4). Furthermore, we found that high-arousal positive emotions (e.g., feeling excited) played a role in the effect of anthropomorphism on gambling behavior (Studies 3 and 4). Our research indicates that the psychological process of gambling-machine anthropomorphism can be advantageous for the gaming industry; however, this may come at great expense for gamblers' (and their families') economic resources and psychological well-being.","Riva, P.",0,10.1037/xap0000057,1723

These are neither sensitive nor accurate enough to respond to users' emotional states, the fundamental basis for effective communication in real time. This offered the challenge of investigating factors that would impact on the designing of effective and more emotionally intelligent interaction strategies for Companions. These were applied to a conceptual tool, the Affective Channel (AC), to endow Companions with emotional capabilities. This was implemented in the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) platform to evaluate Companions in real time. The WoZ is an experimental setup where existing immature technologies and a human operator combine to simulate Companion interaction with end users.

Experiments, focus groups and face to face interviews were carried out to ascertain users' perception and expectations of virtual agents. ‘Descriptors' thus identified formed the bases for the designing of user friendly Companions. Verbal and facial expressions data and other affective elements of effective human-companion interactionwere collected for use in the AC and the WoZ as stated above. Companion evaluations yielded the subsidiary contribution that Companions are perceived as empathetic, useful and trustworthy entities. Further, that they arouse positive emotions in children and also that they promote their learning improvement.

The agency of participants' teammates was varied between conditions; participants either worked with a virtual surgeon and a virtual anesthesiologist, a human confederate playing a surgeon and a virtual anesthesiologist, or a virtual surgeon and a human confederate playing an anesthesiologist. While participants perceived the human confederates to have more social presence (p < 0.01), participants did not preferentially agree with their human team members.

As in other countries British men and women were moved to intervene directly and the memory of the war, and of British participation in it, has held an enduring appeal in the UK. The Civil War was also notable for its use of the visual as a weapon of propaganda, and the Spanish Republican Government deployed visual imagery to great effect as an instrument through which it exhibited its progressive educational and welfare reforms to an international audience. This article focuses on the visual and textual representations of displaced children in Republican educational colonies in Spain that are preserved in British archive collections. Taking as its starting point a series of photographs of children in colonies gathered together as part of the International Brigade Memorial Archive in London, the paper will consider the construction, use, and circulation of these images and associated texts by British and American political and humanitarian networks and their subsequent collection and preservation in British archival institutions. The paper will assess the effectiveness of the images and texts as pedagogical and political agents and explore how their meaning shifted as they travelled through a range of performative spaces on a journey from their construction as artefacts designed initially to record and communicate the Spanish Republic's progressive educational project, to commemorative objects in the archive.","Roberts, S.",0,10.1080/00309230.2013.848911,1730

This study sought to answer the following research questions: How do developmental English faculty members experience teaching students who are underprepared for college-level reading and writing? Also, what are the successes and challenges experienced by developmental English faculty as they teach students who are underprepared for college-level reading and writing? Six developmental English faculty members from various community colleges were interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol. The findings uncovered four themes and one subtheme: 1) students entered developmental English class underprepared in reading, 2) all faculty members were motivated to be agents of change for their students, 3) most students were faced with personal challenges that hindered their progress in developmental English, 4) developmental English faculty felt underprepared to teach students how to read as they were not properly trained in reading pedagogy, resulting in the faculty members need to be innovative in the classroom (subtheme). This study validated current literature that high faculty expectations lead to better academic performance from students, faculty loathe the new accelerated format of developmental English courses, and more collaboration between high schools and colleges is necessary for student success in postsecondary education. It is suggested that this study be used as a foundation to further research topics of pedagogical preparation for developmental English faculty, collaboration between secondary and postsecondary faculty, and the experiences of faculty members of college-level courses.

4872,,"X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging is the second most commonly used clinical imaging modality with an estimated 82 million clinical exams performed in the U.S in 2016. Despite an average annual decline of 2% since a high of 85.3 million in 2011, it is highly sought for visualizing a host of medical conditions because of its clinical advantages in providing high spatial resolution and fast imaging time. Although limited, the high resolution of CT imaging enables small objects such as lesions to be realized with good detail. Partly due to their size and the fact that CT is noise and resolution limited, the effects of system resolution and lesion characterization processes (i.e., segmentation and CAD algorithms) are challenging to quantify. For this reason, there is a significant need to account for system resolution and algorithm impact on lesion characterization in a quantitatively reproducible manner. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. A fundamental aspect of cancer diagnosis, treatment and management is effective use of medical imaging. In recent years, cancer screening has received significant attention. In fact, results of screening suggest that early cancer detection can result in higher survival rates. Beyond just visual inspection, extraction of quantitative lesion features could provide more diagnostic and treatment benefits. Assessing the quantitative capabilities of CT systems is complicated by technical factors such as noise, blur, and motion artifacts. As such, traditional modulation transfer function (MTF) methods are insufficient in characterizing system resolution, especially when non-linearities are introduced by iterative reconstruction. These aforementioned factors contribute to a major component of lesion characterization uncertainty in that they limit the apprehension of lesion ground truth. That being said, there is a wealth of quantifiable information that can be garnered from clinical images, since lesion size, morphology, and potentially texture (i.e., internal heterogeneities) are important quantitative biomarkers for effective clinical decision-making. Considering this, the imaging physics community is steadily progressing toward a quantitative paradigm in CT. As such, the purpose of this doctoral project was to develop, validate, and disseminate a new phantom, image databases and assessment tools that are appropriate for ground truth lesion characterization in the context of modern x-ray computed tomography (CT) systems. The project developed lesion assessment methods in the framework of two distinct modes, (a) anthropomorphic phantoms and (b) clinical images. As an alternative to the MTF, the first aspect of this project aimed at validating the task transfer function (TTF), which is a quantitative measure of system resolution. TTF was used as a means to account for the accurate modeling of low-contrast signal transfer properties of a non-linear imaging system. This study assessed the TTF as a CT system resolution model for lesion blur in the context of reconstruction algorithm, dose, and lesion size, shape, and contrast. TTF-blurred simulated lesions were compared with CT images of corresponding physical lesions using a series of comparative tools. Amidst the presence of confounding factors, in a multiple alternative forced-choice testing paradigm (4AFC) reader study, it was found that readers performed a little better than random guessing in detecting simulated lesions at a rate of 37.9±3.1% (25% implied random guessing). The visual appearance, edge-blur, size, and shape of simulated lesions were similar to the physical lesions, which suggested 3D-TTF modeled the low-contrast signal transfer properties of this non-linear CT reasonably well. In the second study, the TTF became a useful tool for effective implementation in lesion simulation and virtual insertion.

4873,Emotions in Music,"In this essay we argue that musical expressiveness is not confined to ""emotion characteristics in appearances,"" i.e., musical gestures which are experienced as resembling gestures or behaviors characteristic"" of a person in a particular emotional state, such as vocal expressions of sadness or anger (sighing, wailing, shouting, etc.) and behaviors expressive of joy (skipping lightly), or sadness (moving heavily and slowly as in a funeral procession). We claim that sometimes music can appropriately be heard as containing a ""persona,"" a fictional or virtual agent whose emotions are expressed in the music, and that this persona can be experienced as expressing more complex emotions, such as hopefulness or resignation, as well as blends of emotion, and emotions that develop and change over time. A complex piece of music may have a composed expressive trajectory or musical ""plot,"" which dramatizes a psychological journey by a persona. Moreover, listeners may be invited not only to recognize the emotions expressed in such music but also to experience those emotions themselves, either actually or in imagination, by empathizing with the musical persona as he or she travels on a psychological journey through the music. Such experiences are typically reinforced by the arousal of actual physiological states and action tendencies in listeners. We illustrate our argument by means of analyses of the Prelude in El, Minor from Book I of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier and the third movement of Brahms's Piano Quartet in C Minor, Opus 60. Finally, we admit that not all listeners will approach music in the way we suggest, but we argue that listening in the way we recommend can significantly enrich our musical experiences.","Robinson, J.",0,10.1525/mts.2012.34.2.71,1734

However, OER adoption is not part of the prevailing paradigm in higher education, both at the global level and in Latin America. This paper describes results of a study that analysed the social representations regarding the development, use, and reuse of OER by university teachers in their pedagogical practices. We conducted a study of 12 cases from Latin American universities based on Grounded Theory. The results show that the use and reuse of OER lacks of public and institutional policies. The main agents are teachers organised in teams that support OER adoption. The reasons that encourage the creation of OER are mainly intrinsic, such as the pleasure derived from contributing and sharing, as well as external and related to professional development needs from the reflection on one's own educational practice. Educators consider it essential to evaluate the resources created so that they can be reused in continuous improvement processes. Commercial use and misappropriation of the works are two of the main tensions identified. The community factor of teaching guides most behaviours in OER adoption in educational institutions and is presented as an inherent part of the development and transformation of the curriculum.","Rodes, V.",0,,1736

In this study we explored different ways of presenting single representations. Method: In Experiment 1, participants (n = 36) learned about plate tectonics from a multimedia presentation including either realistic or schematic dynamic graphics. After the presentation, participants solved tests requiring structural and conceptual knowledge. In Experiment 2, participants (n = 40) learned about plate tectonics from a multimedia presentation including narrations spoken in either male or female voice. After the presentation, participants solved retention and transfer tests. Results: The results in Experiment 1 showed that participants in the schematic condition out-performed those in the realistic condition in the conceptual test. In Experiment 2 participants receiving narrations in male voice outperformed those in the female voice condition in the two tests. Discussion: The results in Experiment 1 mean that learners learn better from graphics that eliminate extraneous material, as they allow learners to use all cognitive resources in germane processing. Those in Experiment 2 indicate that learners learn better from agents perceived as competent instructors, as this enhances motivation and, thus, active processing.

A key question, with no clear answer so far, is how best to present these support devices. One possibility is to insert them into the multimedia presentation (canned support), while another is to have a human agent provide them (human tutoring). Human tutoring poses potential advantages: it uses spoken modality, displays non-verbal cues and implies social interaction. However, there is mixed evidence regarding these supposed advantages, and prior research comparing human and computer support presents problems. Our goal was to explore whether the advantages of human tutoring actually exist while avoiding the problems of prior research. In one experiment, participants learned Geology from a multimedia presentation including one of three forms of support: human tutoring, canned support or no support. After viewing the presentation, participants solved retention and transfer tests. Results revealed that participants in the human tutoring condition outperformed those in the other two conditions, who did not differ from each other. This means that human tutoring is advantageous, a fact that has implications in the design of support devices in multimedia learning.","Rodicio, H. G.",1,10.1080/10494820.2010.500090,1738
4882,The Effects of an Interactive Software Agent on Student Affective Dynamics while Using an Intelligent Tutoring System,"We study the affective states exhibited by students using an intelligent tutoring system for Scatterplots with and without an interactive software agent, Scooter the Tutor. Scooter the Tutor had been previously shown to lead to improved learning outcomes as compared to the same tutoring system without Scooter. We found that affective states and transitions between affective states were very similar among students in both conditions. With the exception of the ""neutral state,"" no affective state occurred significantly more in one condition over the other. Boredom, confusion, and engaged concentration persisted in both conditions, representing both ""virtuous cycles"" and ""vicious cycles"" that did not appear to differ by condition. These findings imply that-although Scooter is well liked by students and improves student learning outcomes relative to the original tutor-Scooter does not have a large effect on students' affective states or their dynamics.","Rodrigo, M.

4889,A Process Model of Empathy For Virtual Agents,"For more than a century, empathy has been a central topic in the study of human emotion. It plays a crucial role in our everyday social life, having implications for the survival of the species. In the case of agents that inhabit virtual worlds and interact socially among each other and with humans, empathy has also been considered to be an important mechanism to promote engaging and believable interactions. However, creating empathic agents, until recently, has been accomplished mostly through the implementation of specific empathic behaviors or by using domain-dependent empirical models. In this article, we propose a generic computational model of empathy that is grounded on recent psychological theories about empathy. The proposed model treats empathy as a process in which the intensity of the empathic response is modulated by a set of factors that involve the relationship between the agents of the empathic interaction, namely, the similarity and affective link, as well as some characteristics of the empathizer agent, such as mood and personality. This model was implemented into an affective agent architecture, which was then used in an evaluation that had 77 participants. The results indicate that our empathy model, when used to simulate a social scenario with a small group of agents, significantly changed the way that the users perceived and described the interactions between those agents.","Rodrigues, S.

4893,,"Leadership is a key factor in the quality of personal life, organizational culture, and social projection of each member in any organization. Bringing out the best of each person involved in any decision is a must for a Preventive Leader. This kind of leadership opens the possibility to develop, adapt, change and modify the theoretical construct of the definition of a leader from the Preventive horizon, the practical implications of Preventive Leadership development, and the learning and practice of Preventive leadership in a contextualized environment, creating interactions and interdependencies in a net-like pattern of relationships situated in one specific context: the VUCA world. ""Preventive Leadership"" is therefore proposed in this study as a plausible paradigm of convergence between Lonergan's anthropological method, Vygotskian community of learning model, and a reinterpretation of the Salesian Preventive System principles. The novelty in this approach is the viability of the Preventive Leader construct into the specific context of college students and the educational community surrounding them. In a VUCA world, it is critically important that a leader not only knows how to but also knows what and why to be successful. The Preventive Leadership framework contributes to the understanding of the leader itself with a positive, holistic, propositional and end-oriented reflection. The Preventive Leadership construct opens and enriches the leadership development theory and practice by incorporating intrapersonal and interpersonal methods of self-awareness and self-knowledge, learning process from a community perspective, ethical behaviors, and the phases comprising decision-making. A case study of the Salesian University in Mexico City, where students, alumni and professors have been active participants in the Preventive Leadership Program, provided the information and experience, insights and questions, challenges and desires for the use of a mixed method study. The methodology applied facilitated the process of a case study embedding the quantitative data into the qualitative data, and it provided rediscovering the reading of the Salesian Preventive System from a leadership perspective. The paradigm of convergence in an interdisciplinary dialogue between method, model, and preventive principles has been the focal point and the binding agent to interpret, modify and renew the meaning and impact of leader comprehension and leadership development. The results of this study indicated that students and professors agreed that the Preventive Leadership Program in the University is valuable, meaningful and the impact goes beyond the college experience time frame. The study concluded that (a) the construct ""Prevention"" from a Salesian perspective is fresh, inclusive, flexible and adaptive to any context, and leadership theory; specially connected to the transformational, transformative and authentic leadership in universities, (b) the paradigm of convergence between an anthropological method of knowledge, a pedagogical method with a social learning tendency, and a renewed preventive framework is a very plausible reality, and (c) the Innermost-nurturing principle, and the Feedforward Principle are two aspects of same reality and both crystallize conditions, parameters, criteria, educational strategies, and social parameters that all leader who presumes to be Preventive should consider in all circumstances.","Rodriguez, Alejandro",0,,1741
4894,New Approach for Conversational Agent Definition by Non-Programmers: A Visual Domain-Specific Language,"Intelligent tutors and conversational agents (CAs) have proven to be useful learning tools. They have potential not only as stand-alone devices but also as integrable components to enrich and complement other educational resources. For this, new authoring approaches and platforms are required. They should be accessible to non-programmers (such as most teachers) and they should be integrable into current web-based educational platforms. This paper proposes a new approach to define such agents through a visual domain-specific language based on Google Blockly (a scratch-like language). It also develops a web-based integrable authoring platform to serve as a prototype, describing the requirements and architecture. To evaluate whether this novel approach is effective, a multi-stage experiment was conducted. First, participants learned to use the prototype authoring platform through an interactive tutorial. Second, they created a CA with a specific domain model. Times and performance were measured. Finally, they answered a standardized usability questionnaire (UMUX) and a purpose-specific survey. Results show that participants were able to learn to use the domain-specific language in a short time. Moreover, the purpose-specific survey indicates that their perception of the approach (and its potential) is positive. The standardized questionnaire indicates that even in its prototype stage, its usability is satisfactory.","Rodriguez-Gil, L.",0,10.1109/access.2018.2883500,1742
4899,,"The article presents the results of the study, illustrating the expectations and the persistent stereotypes about the parent and the pedagogical community, which reduce the possibility of confidential interaction development in the sphere of education. The conceptual provisions of ""confidence"" theory by P. Sztompka, in which trust is viewed as a strategic resource for the development of social systems, became the initial prerequisites for the study. The empirical base of the study was represented by the educational facilities of Moscow. The focus group method was used as the main research method, in which 34 representatives of the parental community and 20 teachers of the Moscow general education schools took part. The authors conclude that there are contradictions in the key expectations of educational space subjects. Parents consider the school as a social compensator for family dysfunctions, considering it is necessary to involve a teacher in the upbringing and the socialization of younger generation. The results of the study showed that the modern school does not have the necessary resource, personnel and socio-cultural potential; it is unable to meet the expectations of the parental community in the current circumstances. This circumstance undermines the very possibility of educational space key agent trust and supports the functional weakness of the modern school. The novelty of the data obtained in the course of the study is the conclusion that the boundaries of social tension, the manifestations of frustration and the uncertainty of the parental and pedagogical community, as well as the risks of school education modernization have extended. The materials of the research work illustrate the reduction of positive motivation for educational space actors, the alienation during the interactions between a family and a school and the lack of an effective managerial practice in the development of constructive cooperation. Social attitudes of a student and a teacher, refracted in the prism of formal interactions between a ""client"" and ""educational service provider"", initiate the educational space deformation and the distortion of traditional roles.","Rogach, Olga V.",0,,1743
4902,"The ITS-driven affective embodied conversational agent EVA, based on a novel conversational-behavior generation algorithm","As a result of the convergence of different services delivered over the internet protocol, internet protocol television (IPTV) may be regarded as the one of the most widespread user interfaces accepted by a highly diverse user domain. Every generation, from children to the elderly, can use IPTV for recreation, as well as for gaining social contact and stimulating the mind. However, technological advances in digital platforms go hand in hand with the complexity of their user interfaces, and thus induce technological disinterest and technological exclusion. Therefore, interactivity and affective content presentations are, from the perspective of advanced user interfaces, two key factors in any application incorporating human-computer interaction (HCI). Furthermore, the perception and understanding of the information (meaning) conveyed is closely interlinked with visual cues and non-verbal elements that speakers generate throughout human-human dialogues. In this regard, co-verbal behavior provides information to the communicative act. It supports the speaker's communicative goal and allows for a variety of other information to be added to his/her messages, including (but not limited to) psychological states, attitudes, and personality. In the present paper, we address complexity and technological disinterest through the integration of natural, human-like multimodal output that incorporates a novel combined data- and rule-driven co-verbal behavior generator that is able to extract features from unannotated, general text. The core of the paper discusses the processes that model and synchronize non-verbal features with verbal features even when dealing with unknown context and/or limited contextual information. In addition, the proposed algorithm incorporates data-driven (speech prosody, repository of motor skills) and rule-based concepts (grammar, gesticon). The algorithm firstly classifies the communicative intent, then plans the co-verbal cues and their form within the gesture unit, generates temporally synchronized co-verbal cues, and finally realizes them in the form of human-like co-verbal movements. In this way, the information can be represented in the form of both meaningfully and temporally synchronized co-verbal cues with accompanying synthesized speech, using communication channels to which people are most accustomed.","Rojc, M.",1,10.1016/j.engappai.2016.10.006,1744

4913,,"Humans are distinct from machines in their capacity to emote, stimulate, and express emotions. Because emotions play such an important role in human interactions, human-like agents used in pedagogical roles for simulation-based training should properly reflect emotions. Currently, research concerning the development of this type of agent focuses on basic agent interface characteristics, as well as character building qualities. However, human-like agents should provide emotion-like qualities that are clearly expressed, properly synchronized, and that simulate complex, real-time interactions through adaptive emotion systems. The research conducted for this dissertation was a quantitative investigation using 3 (within) x 2 (between) x 3 (within) factorial design. A total of 56 paid participants consented to complete the study. Independent variables included emotion intensity (i.e., low, moderate, and high emotion), levels of expertise (novice participant versus experienced participant), and number of trials. Dependent measures included visual attention, emotional response towards the animated agents, simulation performance score, and learners' perception of the pedagogical agent persona while participants interacted with a pain assessment and management simulation. While no relationships were indicated between the levels of emotion intensity portrayed by the animated agents and the participants' visual attention, emotional response towards the animated agent, and simulation performance score, there were significant relationships between the level of expertise of the participant and the visual attention, emotional responses, and performance outcomes. The results indicated that nursing students had higher visual attention during their interaction with the animated agents. Additionally, nursing students expressed more neutral facial expression whereas experienced nurses expressed more emotional facial expressions towards the animated agents. The results of the simulation performance scores indicated that nursing students obtained higher performance scores in the pain assessment and management task than experienced nurses.

4914,Modelling the Interruption on HCI Using BDI Agents with the Fuzzy Perceptions Approach: An Interactive Museum Case Study in Mexico,"Technological advancements have revolutionized the proliferation and availability of information to users, which has created more complex and intensive interactions between users and systems. The learning process of users is essential in the construction of new knowledge when pursuing improvements in user experience. In this paper, the interruption factor is considered in relation to interaction quality due to human-computer interaction (HCI) being seen to affect the learning process. We present the results obtained from 500 users in an interactive museum in Tijuana, Mexico as a case study. We model the HCI of an interactive exhibition using belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents; we adapted the BDI architecture using the Type-2 fuzzy inference system to add perceptual human-like capabilities to agents, in order to describe the interaction and interruption factor on user experience. The resulting model allows us to describe content adaptation through the creation of a personalized interaction environment. We conclude that managing interruptions can enhance the HCI, producing a positive learning process that influences user experience. A better interaction may be achieved if we offer the right kind of content, taking the interruptions experienced into consideration.","Rosales, R.",0,10.3390/app7080832,1748
4920,Visually-naive chicks prefer agents that move as if constrained by a bilateral body-plan,"From the first hours of life, the prompt detection of animate agents allows identification of biologically relevant entities. The motion of most animate agents is constrained by their bilaterally-symmetrical body-plan, and consequently tends to be aligned with the main body-axis. Thus parallelism between the main axis of a moving object and its motion trajectory can signal the presence of animate agents. Here we demonstrated that visually-naive newborn chicks (Gallus gem domesticus) are attracted to objects displaying such parallelism, and thus show preference for the same type of motion patterns that elicit perception of animacy in humans. This is the first demonstration of a newborn non-human animal's social preference for a visual cue related to the constraints imposed on behaviour by bilaterian morphology. Chicks also showed preference for rotational movements a potential manifestation of self-propulsion. Results are discussed in relation to the mechanisms of animacy and agency detection in newborn organisms.","Rosa-Salva, O.",0,10.1016/j.cognition.2018.01.004,1749
4924,,"This article offers a vision for technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning at scale. It begins with historical work in the area of tutorial dialogue systems. It traces the history of that area of the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education as it has made an impact on the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning through the creation of forms of dynamic support for collaborative learning, and makes an argument for the importance of advances in the field of Language Technologies for this work. In particular, this support has been enabled by an integration of text mining and conversational agents to form a novel type of micro-script support for productive discussion processes. This research from the early part of the century has paved the way for emerging technologies that support discussion-based learning at scale in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In the next 25 years, we expect to see this early, emerging work in MOOC contexts grow into ubiquitously available social learning approaches in free online learning environments like MOOCs, or what comes next in the online learning space. These ambitious social learning approaches include Problem Based Learning, Team Project Based Learning, and Collaborative Reflection. We expect to see the capability of drawing in and effectively supporting learners of all walks of life, especially impacting currently under-served learners. To that end, we describe the current exploratory efforts to deploy technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning in MOOCs and offer a vision for work going forward into the next decade, where we envision learning communities and open collaborative work communities coming together as persistent technology supported and enhanced communities of practice.

4926,Assessing Students in Human-to-Agent Settings to Inform Collaborative Problem-Solving Learning,"In order to understand potential applications of collaborative problem-solving (CPS) assessment tasks, it is necessary to examine empirically the multifaceted student performance that may be distributed across collaboration methods and purposes of the assessment. Ideally, each student should be matched with various types of group members and must apply the skills in varied contexts and tasks. One solution to these assessment demands is to use computer-based (virtual) agents to serve as the collaborators in the interactions with students. This article proposes a human-to-agent (H-A) approach for formative CPS assessment and describes an international pilot study aimed to provide preliminary empirical findings on the use of H-A CPS assessment to inform collaborative learning. Overall, the findings showed promise in terms of using a H-A CPS assessment task as a formative tool for structuring effective groups in the context of CPS online learning.","Rosen, Y.",1,10.1111/jedm.12131,1751
4927,,"There is a great debate among scholars on the virtues of digital online culture, yet as people spend more time in cyberspace, little attention is being paid to understanding the forces at play within these contexts as well as their impact on identities. Education is critical to protect and equip the citizenry in this new environment; however, perspectives have not shifted to include meaningful theorizing in how to live the information revolution. This dissertation draws on the work of scholars across the disciplines of cultural studies, education, communication, and philosophy to provide a cultural, ideological critique of identity construction in the context of virtualization and to draw some conclusions for schooling in light of the analysis. Subsequently, each chapter represents a different facet of the real-virtual and human-machine lines to help deconstruct the ontological distinction between these realms of being. This is accomplished by using a multiperspectival approach employing the theoretical frameworks of constructivist psychology, critical theory, symbolic interactionism, and sociocultural identity theory. Organized in five chapters, the first initially identifies technological agents of change that have generated shifts in personal identity. The second critically engages the work of Sherry Turkle, a pioneer researcher of digital online culture. The third chapter historicizes identity formation and the cultural transformations that have occurred since the Internet's inception. The fourth unravels neoliberal and high-tech capitalist forms of manufactured consciousness followed by mapping today's new forms of resistance. The fifth and concluding chapter demonstrates how education is implicated in the current hegemonic movement and the role it could play to guide the citizenry through this area of complex interactions. This dissertation highlights the personal and cultural changes occurring as a result of increasing reliance on online environments. Additionally, it proposes a new perspective on education's role in this evolution and advocates for schooling to take a stance in the face of the current digital, globalized world. This work is intended to benefit educators, social scientists, critical theorists and scholars currently struggling to identify the individual and societal changes underway as it proposes meaningful and original strategies to address contemporary challenges to schooling's normative ideal.","Rosenfeld, Kimberly Nicole",0,,1752
4928,Individuals' Evaluations of and Attitudes Towards Potentially Uncanny Robots,"In the present work we provide an overview and categorization of explanatory approaches for the uncanny valley effect and present an empirical study. Against the background of the uncanny valley hypothesis, the study utilized qualitative interviews in which participants were presented with pictures and videos of potentially uncanny humanoid and android robots to explore participants' evaluations of very human-like robots, their attitudes about these robots, and their emotional reactions towards these robots. In this regard, the influence of the robots' appearance, movement and the context of HRI were examined. Results showed that, contrasting the hypothesis, participants reported not only negative, but also positive emotional reactions towards the possibly uncanny robots. The robots' appearance was of great importance for the participants, because certain characteristics were equalized with certain abilities, merely human appearance without a connected functionality was not appreciated, and human rules of attractiveness were applied to the android robots. The analysis also demonstrated the importance of the robots' movements and the social context they were placed in. The importance of two possible causes and explanations of the uncanny valley, namely uncertainty at category boundaries (cf. Ramey in Proceedings of views of the uncanny valley workshop: IEEE-RAS international conference on humanoid robots, 2005; Proceedings of the ICCS/CogSci-2006 long symposium ""Toward Social Mechanisms of Android Science"", 2006) and subconscious fears of being replaced (cf. MacDorman & Ishiguro in Interact Stud 7(3):297-337, 2006) were explored in this work. On this reflective level of evaluation we found some support for the assumptions that participants experienced uncertainty how to categorize android robots (as human or machine) and that some (but not all) participants felt uncomfortable at the thought to be replaced by robots.","Rosenthal-von der Puetten, A.

To explain the concerns that a holistic view of the phenomenon is needed the authors consider three relevant aspects: personality traits and pre-experiences, robot behavior and task context, and reflective vs. implicit reactions and how these may affect uncanny valley judgments.

In the first two studies participants interacted with the robot either without any learning ability (control group) or with one out of three versions of a learning algorithm implementing gradually aspects of more humanlike learning abilities. Results show that the implementation of a learning algorithm had positive effects regarding the evaluation of the robot, its learning abilities and the interaction. We found that more humanlike learning abilities do not always lead to better performance and evaluation and that results were to some extend influenced by longer or shorter interaction times. In a third study, we additionally explored the influence of other behavioral variations such as low or high verbal skills and interaction modalities in perceived intelligence of the robot irrespective of the implemented learning algorithm, but did not find significant effects. Results are discussed with regard to the socialness of future interaction scenarios.","Rosenthal-von der Putten, A. M.",0,10.1007/s12369-017-0445-4,1755

We conducted a web-based survey (N = 151) with standardized pictures of 40 robots which were evaluated. A cluster analysis revealed six clusters of robots. We were able to identify different groups of robots which were rated significantly different on six dimensions. Interestingly, in two clusters robots were rated both low in human-likeness and low in ""mechanical"" indicating that in future research these adjectives should be used separately. The robots in those clusters with a high mean concerning ""Threatening"" are almost all bi-pedal robots. In contrast to the humanoid robots (cluster 5), the android robots (clusters 3 and 4) were rated higher on ""Familiarity"", and on ""Likability"" although all three clusters (3, 4, and 5) were rated as ""Threatening"" which contrasts the uncanny valley hypothesis. Moreover, the data in the present study could not be explained by a cubic function as would be suggested by the graph proposed by Mod, but rather by linear or quadratic relationships.

4944,"The Effects of Humanlike and Robot-Specific Affective Nonverbal Behavior on Perception, Emotion, and Behavior","Research demonstrated that humans are able to interpret humanlike (affective) nonverbal behavior (HNB) in artificial entities (e.g. Beck et al., in: Proceedings of the 19th IEEE international symposium on robot and human interactive communication, IEEE Press, Piscataway, 2010. 10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598649; Bente et al. in J Nonverbal Behav 25: 151-166, 2001; Mumm and Mutlu, in: Proceedings of the 6th international conference on human-robot interaction, HRI. ACM Press, New York, 2011. 10.1145/1957656.1957786). However, some robots lack the possibility to produce HNB. Using robot-specific nonverbal behavior (RNB) such as different eye colors to convey emotional meaning might be a fruitful mechanism to enhance HRI experiences, but it is unclear whether RNB is as effective as HNB. We present a review on affective nonverbal behaviors in robots and an experimental study. We experimentally tested the influence of HNB and RNB (colored LEDs) on users' perception of the robot (e.g. likeability, animacy), their emotional experience, and self-disclosure. In a between-subjects design, users interacted with either (a) a robot displaying no nonverbal behavior, (b) a robot displaying affective RNB, (c) a robot displaying affective HNB or (d) a robot displaying affective HNB and RNB. Results show that HNB, but not RNB, has a significant effect on the perceived animacy of the robot, participants' emotional state, and self-disclosure. However, RNB still slightly influenced participants' perception, emotion, and behavior: Planned contrasts revealed having any type of nonverbal behavior significantly increased perceived animacy, positive affect, and self-disclosure. Moreover, observed linear trends indicate that the effects increased with the addition of nonverbal behaviors (control< RNB< HNB). In combination, our results suggest that HNB is more effective in transporting the robot's communicative message than RNB.","Rosenthal-von der Putten, A. M.",0,10.1007/s12369-018-0466-7,1758

We report a bipartite experimental laboratory study with young adults (N = 87) and seniors (N = 38). In the first part of the study, young adults interacted with the virtual agent in a desert-survival-scenario-task in a 2 (dominant vs. submissive nonverbal behavior) x 2 (no attention guiding behavior vs. attention guiding behavior) experimental between-subjects design. Besides scrutinizing the effects of dominant nonverbal behavior, we wanted to know how adding nonverbal behavior to guide the users' attention influences the perception of dominant nonverbal behavior. While the dominant agent was indeed perceived as being more dominant, evaluations of the agent regarding likability and intelligence was not influenced by its nonverbal behavior. There were some effects for the perception of the game, however, the dominant behavior was not more successful regarding persuasion (following the agents suggestions during the game). Adding attention guiding nonverbal behavior did only result in lower perceived competence of the agent. In the second part of the study, we replicated the submissive/dominance manipulation with senior participants in order to explore age differences. We found a number of effects: seniors evaluated the agent generally more positively (e.g., more likable, autonomous, intelligent, submissive, verbally and nonverbally capable). Moreover, we found an interaction effect for persuasion, showing that seniors strongly follow the suggestions of the dominant agent. We discuss these findings especially against the background of agent applications in a medical context.","Rosenthal-von der Putten, A. M.",1,10.1016/j.chb.2018.08.047,1759

We recommend that researchers more frequently examine moderating variables that might limit interventions' results, including individual-level variables such as gender, contextual-level variables such as the subject in which an intervention was conducted, and design-level variables such as intervention length. Additionally, researchers might better align their interventions with motivation theory.

Virtual humans offer structured learning of interview skills, can facilitate learning about unusual conditions, and are always available. However, the creation of virtual humans with the ability to understand and respond to natural language requires costly engineering by conversation knowledge engineers (generally computer scientists), and incurs logistical cost for acquiring domain knowledge from domain experts (educators). We address these problems using a novel crowdsourcing method entitled Human-centered Distributed Conversational Modeling. This method facilitates collaborative development of virtual humans by two groups of end-users: domain experts (educators) and domain novices (students). We implemented this method in a web-based authoring tool called Virtual People Factory. Using Virtual People Factory, medical and pharmacy educators are now creating natural language virtual patient interactions on their own. This article presents the theoretical background for Human-centered Distributed Conversational Modeling, the implementation of the Virtual People Factory authoring tool, and five case studies showing that Human-centered Distributed Conversational Modeling has addressed the logistical cost for acquiring knowledge.

4959,Socially Assistive Robot for Providing Recommendations: Comparing a Humanoid Robot with a Mobile Application,"Socially assistive robotics has gained a valuable role in assisting, influencing and motivating the human behavior in many Human-Machine Interaction contexts. This finding suggested the use of social robots as recommendation interfaces. Despite many other types of recommending technologies exist (e.g., virtual agents, apps on cell phones, etc.), experimental studies convey that human beings result to be more engaged and influenced by the interaction with robots with respect to these other technologies. In particular, this has been shown by comparing social robots with virtual agents; a poor literature copes with the comparison between social robots and applications on mobile phones. To this extent, in this work, we address the comparison between these latest two technologies in the context of movie recommendation, where the two considered interfaces are programmed to provide the same contents, but through different communication channels. We provide the results of two experimental studies with the aim of evaluating the quality of the interaction from both the point of view of the application (by considering the users' acceptance rate of the recommendations) and of the users (by analyzing the users' evaluations) while interacting with the two interfaces. The main result arising from this study is that the social robot is preferred by users although, apparently, it does not change the acceptance rate of the proposed movies.","Rossi, S.",0,10.1007/s12369-018-0469-4,1763
4962,"Parsons, Luhmann, Spencer Brown. NOR design for double contingency tables","Purpose - Cross tables are omnipresent in management, academia and popular culture. The Matrix has us, despite all criticism, opposition and desire for a way out. This paper draws on the works of three agents of the matrix. The paper shows that Niklas Luhmann criticised Talcott Parsons' traditional matrix model of society and proceeded to update systems theory, the latest version of which is coded in the formal language of George Spencer Brown. As Luhmann failed to install his updates to all components of his theory platform, however, regular reoccurrences of Parsonian crosstabs are observed, particularly in the Luhmannian differentiation theory, which results in compatibility issues and produces error messages requesting updates. This paper aims to code the missing update translating the basic matrix structure from Parsonian into Spencer Brownian formal language. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on work by Boris Hennig and Louis Kauffman and a yet unpublished manuscript by George Spencer Brown, to demonstrate that the latter introduced his cross as a mark to indicate NOR gates in circuit diagrams. The paper also shows that this NOR gate marker has been taken out of and may be observed to contain the tetralemma, an ancient matrix structure already present in traditional Indian logic. It then proceeds to translate the basic structure of traditional contingency tables into a Spencer Brownian NOR equation and to demonstrate the difference this translation makes in the modelling of social systems. Findings - The translation of cross tables from Parsonian into Spencer Brownian formal language results in the design of a both matrix-shaped and compatible test routine that works as a virtual window for the observation of the actually unobservable medium in which a form is drawn, and can be used for consistency checks of expressions coded in Spencer Brownian formal language. Originality/value - This paper quotes from and discusses a so far unpublished manuscript finalised by Spencer Brown in April 1961. The basic matrix structure is translated from Parsonian into Spencer Brownian formal language. A Spencer Brownian NOR matrix is coded that may be used to detect errors in expressions coded in Spencer Brownian formal language.","Roth, S.",0,10.1108/k-05-2017-0176,1764
4963,,"Reply by the current authors to the comment made by Eric Smith (see record 2014-49247-018) on the original article (see record 2014-23629-007). Dr. Smith asks an important question, namely if ""d-cycloserine augmentation of virtual reality exposure therapy appeared to be associated with worse outcomes for the subset of patients experiencing little response or worsening of subjective distress during the treatment."" The figure and analysis to which Dr. Smith refers are implied from a mixed-effect model that included all participants (N5156). Dr. Smith suggests ""adding the d-cycloserine or a similar agent after the first couple of sessions and only for that subset of patients that have already started to experience a positive response to the treatment."" The author agrees with Dr. Smith's suggestions to determine who is most likely to respond well to exposure therapy and to exposure therapy combined with cognitive enhancers. In this study, those patients who displayed larger startle responses prior to treatment and had lower salivary cortisol in response to the virtual scenes embedded with acoustic startle probes fared better when the virtual reality exposure therapy was combined with d-cycloserine compared with alprazolam or placebo.

4966,Short- and Long-Term Effects of Video Game Violence on Interpersonal Trust,"Two studies investigate the psychological processes underlying short- and long-term effects of video game violence on interpersonal trust. Study 1 demonstrates that interacting with physically aggressive virtual agents decreases players' trust in subsequent interactions. This effect was stronger for players who were dispositionally sensitive to victimization. In Study 2, long-term effects of adolescents' frequent exposure to video game violence on interpersonal trust and victim sensitivity were investigated. Cross-lagged path analyses show that the reported frequency of playing violent video games reduced interpersonal trust over a period of 12 months, particularly among victim-sensitive players. These findings are in line with the sensitivity to mean intentions (SeMI) model, and they suggest that interpersonal mistrust is a relevant long-term outcome of frequent exposure to video game violence.","Rothmund, T.",0,10.1080/15213269.2013.841526,1766

4972,Is the Theory of Mind deficit observed in visual paradigms in schizophrenia explained by an impaired attention toward gaze orientation?,"Schizophrenia is associated with poor Theory of Mind (ToM), particularly in goal and belief attribution to others. It is also associated with abnormal gaze behaviors toward others: individuals with schizophrenia usually look less to others' face and gaze, which are crucial epistemic cues that contribute to correct mental states inferences. This study tests the hypothesis that impaired ToM in schizophrenia might be related to a deficit in visual attention toward gaze orientation. We adapted a previous non-verbal ToM paradigm consisting of animated cartoons allowing the assessment of goal and belief attribution. In the true and false belief conditions, an object was displaced while an agent was either looking at it or away, respectively. Eye movements were recorded to quantify visual attention to gaze orientation (proportion of time participants spent looking at the head of the agent while the target object changed locations). 29 patients with schizophrenia and 29 matched controls were tested. Compared to controls, patients looked significantly less at the agent's head and had lower performance in belief and goal attribution. Performance in belief and goal attribution significantly increased with the head looking percentage. When the head looking percentage was entered as a covariate, the group effect on belief and goal attribution performance was not significant anymore. Patients' deficit on this visual ToM paradigm is thus entirely explained by a decreased visual attention toward gaze. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

4976,Reinforcement Learning as a tool to make people move to a specific location in Immersive Virtual Reality,"This paper describes the use of Reinforcement Learning in Immersive Virtual Reality to make a person move to a specific location in a virtual environment. Reinforcement Learning is a sub-area of Machine Learning in which an active entity called an agent interacts with its environment and learns how to act in order to achieve a predetermined goal. The Reinforcement Learning had no prior model of behaviour and the participants no prior knowledge that their task was to move to and stay in a specific place. The participants were placed in a virtual environment where they had to avoid collisions with virtual projectiles. Following each projectile the agent analysed the movement made by the participant to determine paths of future projectiles in order to increase the chance of driving participants to the goal position and make them stay there as long as possible. The experiment was carried out with 30 participants, 10 were guided towards the leftmost part of the environment, 10 to the rightmost area, and 10 were used as control group where the projectiles were shot randomly throughout the game. Our results show that people tended to stay close to the target area in both the Left and Right conditions, but not in the Random condition.","Rovira, A.",1,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.10.007,1769
4978,Exploring the influence of a human-like dancing virtual character on the evocation of human emotion,"Dance has universally been used as a form of human expression for thousands of years. This common human behaviour and communication method has not been explored much in the context of computer-based technology, even within the field of virtual human research. This paper presents an experimental study investigating the impact of watching dancing virtual characters on human emotions. The study analysed the responses of 55 participants, composed of a mix of dancers and non-dancers, who watched a dancing virtual character perform 3 different dances that represented anger, sadness and happiness in different display orders. The participants' reported changes in their emotions and their feelings of anger, sadness and happiness were significantly dependent on which dancing character's emotion they watched and the emotional change did not rely on correct recognition of the depicted emotion. For experimental control, our characters were faceless and danced without music. Our results suggest that just by watching a dancing virtual character some of the benefits associated with dancing could be accessed in circumstances where it is not desirable or feasible to dance, justifying further research to develop a personalised character with a face and music that adapts according to the humans' emotions and preferences.","Roxas, J.

4982,,"A potential health crisis looms large in the Punjab, India where alcohol consumption has risen dramatically. Adolescents are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of alcohol. This empirical study presents a pedagogical intervention, Children as Agents of Social Change (CASC), which aimed to raise awareness about the effects of alcohol using an ICT-supported educational dialogue among adolescent students and alcohol-experts from multiple domains. Primary data consists of pre- and post-test questionnaires from the control and experimental groups (N=379) and an interview of the teacher-in-charge of one experimental school. Results indicate that the intervention significantly improved students' scientific knowledge about alcohol; changed their attitudes towards media and celebrity promotion of alcohol; and enabled them to surmount the odds to spread information - acquired during the CASC intervention- to people outside the school, including adult drinkers. Learner-centric pedagogy combined with ICT clearly amplified transformative learning. CASC appears to be a promising approach in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). It can be used for multiple sustainability issues.","Roy, Amit",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/dcse-2018-0014,1771
4986,,"One of the goals of education is to create responsible citizens who can adequately understand the problems faced by their societies and who can then act to help solve them. Such behaviour can be fostered through proper education that facilitates expert knowledge about social issues, nurtures the ability to think critically and grows the skills needed to pro-actively search for possible solutions. Through this study, we aimed to develop an Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) supported pedagogical framework ""Children as Agents of Social Change"" (CASC) as a possible vehicle to facilitate proper education about social issues. This article analyses the first implementation of the CASC framework carried out at schools in Tanzania. Forest fires in Tanzania are often caused by human activity and education about this pressing problem needs to be provisioned on a large scale. However, due to a lack of teachers and teacher expertise, this is not being done. We created a locally contextualized video supported by a Problem Based Learning (PBL) solution to connect local forest experts with school students. These students then creatively conducted PBL activities in order to help solve local environmental and conservation problems. Data was collected through pre- and post-tests of control-experimental groups and teacher interviews. Results suggest that the participants were enlightened as to a variety of active problem solving possibilities and that they ranked the CASC methodology as an effective approach to environmental education.","Roy, Amit",0,,1772
4991,A case of visuo-auditory sensory substitution in rats,"Sensory substitution refers to a process whereby an agent, by means of a removable specialized instrumentation, becomes capable of exploiting an available sensory modality in order to perceive properties of the environment which are normally accessible by means of a different modality. We describe a situation of visual-auditory sensory substitution in the rat. Rats were placed in complete darkness, and trained to follow a virtual path whose position was signalled by a sound activated by a video-tracking device. Our hypothesis was that the rats would be able to succeed in this task of spatial navigation, following the sound contour by means of sensory-motor coupling based on seeking the sound (all-or-none) and mastering the relation between their own actions and the expected sensory feedback. Our results confirm this hypothesis and show the progressive structuring of meaningful exploratory activity, leading from the appearance of stopping behaviour when the sound is lost or acceleration when the sound is discovered, up to a veritable sensory-motor strategy which maximizes the possibilities for discovering and following the sound path. Thus, the animals seem to have developed a new form of perception which translates in particular into motor behaviour adapted to the search for sound.","Roy, V.",0,10.1016/j.beproc.2019.05.001,1773

Given that television is a powerful socializing agent, this study seeks to identify how gender is being represented in it using content analysis. The gender and role of 826 major characters across 89 programmes, which were telecast on 11 channels during the evenings, was analysed. The results show that 91.01% of all the programmes were animated. There was a gender bias in the programme titles, as the majority contained only male or gender-neutral names. Males (74.94%) outnumber females (25.06%) across all channels, irrespective of their target audience. More males than females were cast in all the character roles except in the role of the protagonist's family member, where both genders were cast equally. The underrepresentation of females in some character roles also veered towards 100% on certain channels. Overall, most programmes seem oriented towards boys than girls.","Rozario, A.

5001,,"In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) low-power wireless mobile agents are rapidly deployed to provide a communication infrastructure where one previously did not exist. Agents in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) typically have no knowledge of the environment that they are to be deployed in nor where they will be located. All information a mobile agent has access to is provided locally by other mobile agents within its communication range. If all nodes in a MANET used flooding/broadcasting to disseminate information to nodes not in their immediate neighborhood, a broadcast storm will arise. To avoid broadcast storm and improve scalability, a virtual backbone can be constructed among the agents to forward messages to a destination. A common way of creating a virtual backbone in a MANET is through finding a Connected Dominating Set (CDS). To reduce routing and message overhead, a small CDS is preferred and many of the existing algorithms choose nodes with the most connections to be included in the CDS to approximate a small CDS. This causes nodes in the CDS to lose energy much faster than the rest of the MANET. Instead of selecting nodes with the highest degree to represent the virtual backbone, this thesis expands on an algorithm that is based on balancing the traffic load among the nodes called a Load Balanced Connected Dominating Set (LBCDS). The new localized LBCDS algorithm, named L2BCDS, is simulated in ns2 and compared to two well known algorithms. This thesis shows that a small backbone can still be constructed without using the maximum degree of a node as the determining factor for the CDS, and that energy consumption is improved across the whole network using L2BCDS. Due to the nature of random deployment, agents may be clustered together which creates coverage holes in the network. Most of the existing work that focuses on improving area coverage deals with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) where wireless connections between individual agents are not a concern when moving the agents. This thesis proposes a method to improve area coverage while preserving communication links between the mobile agents. A distributed consensus protocol based on Voronoi tessellation is introduced. A constrained convex optimization is then used to solve the distributed consensus protocol to determine an optimal position for a node inside of its Voronoi cell without losing communication with neighbors. This work is based on the belief that a node covers the most area when it covers most or all of its Voronoi cell. The convex optimization is then tested on a small network of agents and a MANET with a virtual backbone to show that area coverage is improved.","Ruble, Zach A.",0,,1775
5002,Gelotophobia and the challenges of implementing laughter into virtual agents interactions,"This study investigated which features of AVATAR laughter are perceived threatening for individuals with a fear of being laughed at (gelotophobia), and individuals with no gelotophobia. Laughter samples were systematically varied (e.g., intensity, laughter pitch, and energy for the voice, intensity of facial actions of the face) in three modalities: animated facial expressions, synthesized auditory laughter vocalizations, and motion capture generated puppets displaying laughter body movements. In the online study 123 adults completed, the GELOPH < 15 > (Ruch and Prayer, 2008a,b) and rated randomly presented videos of the three modalities for how malicious, how friendly, how real the laughter was (0 not at all to 8 extremely). Additionally, an open question asked which markers led to the perception of friendliness/maliciousness. The current study identified features in all modalities of laughter stimuli that were perceived as malicious in general, and some that were gelotophobia specific. For facial expressions of AVATARS, medium intensity laughs triggered highest maliciousness in the gelotophobes. In the auditory stimuli, the fundamental frequency modulations and the variation in intensity were indicative of maliciousness. In the body, backwards and forward movements and rocking vs. jerking movements distinguished the most malicious from the least malicious laugh. From the open answers, the shape and appearance of the lips curling induced feelings that the expression was malicious for non-gelotophobes and that the movement round the eyes, elicited the face to appear as friendly. This was opposite for gelotophobes. Gelotophobia savvy AVATARS should be of high intensity, containing lip and eye movements and be fast, non-repetitive voiced vocalization, variable and of short duration. It should not contain any features that indicate a down-regulation in the voice or body, or indicate voluntary/cognitive modulation.","Ruch, W. F.",0,10.3389/fnhum.2014.00928,1776
5009,,"In this study, the researcher used an action research methodology to investigate the self-initiated creative processes and artifacts of his fourth and fifth grade students over the course of one school year in an attempt to shed light on the pedagogical effects of an elementary classroom that allows its students significant creative agency. The majority of the literature on the self-initiated creativity of children examines the work of primary grade students in an art room setting, revealing a gap in the literature and the need for a study regarding self-initiated creative processes and products made by children in an intermediate general classroom setting. The research site was a democratically based, child-centered classroom in a private day school where students were encouraged to share in the development of the conceptual, curricular, and physical aspects of the learning environment. The self-initiated creative activities of the children provided a unique lens through which the researcher was able to view and understand his students’ learning styles, gain insight into their metacognitive processes, and observe the ways they navigated their classroom space. Empowering students to become critical agents through choice and autonomy led to arts-based approaches of inquiry and spontaneous creative learning experiences. An analysis of the data contributed to an understanding of six essential principles for facilitating self-initiated creativity within the everyday constraints of a traditional schooling environment, as well as cautionary revelations about how I could have been more effective at co-constructing an enduring culture that supported self-initiated creative learning in collaboration with my colleagues at the research site.","Rufo, David",0,,1777
5010,Perceived Human-Likeness of Social Robots: Testing the Rasch Model as a Method for Measuring Anthropomorphism,"Anthropomorphism is generally defined as the attribution of human-like characteristics to social robots and other non-human objects. We argue that different researchers have different interpretations of this concept, leading to measuring instruments that focus on different subsets of human-like characteristics. In the current paper, we discuss these different interpretations and explore a new method for measuring anthropomorphism, based on the Rasch model. The aim of the current work is to map anthropomorphism as a range of human-like characteristics on a one-dimensional scale. The scale's validity and sensitivity were tested by comparing it with two available measuring instruments and by comparing people's responses to different types of agents. In three studies, we explored whether the Rasch model is suitable for measuring anthropomorphism. Despite some limitations, results showed that the Rasch model can successfully be applied to the measurement of anthropomorphism. Implications for future work on anthropomorphism of social robots are discussed.","Ruijten, P. A. M.",0,10.1007/s12369-019-00516-z,1778
5014,Lonely and Susceptible: The Influence of Social Exclusion and Gender on Persuasion by an Artificial Agent,"Earlier research showed that artificial social agents can influence human behavior. This article argues that, especially under certain circumstances, people are sensitive to persuasion by (artificial) social agents. For example, when people feel socially excluded, they are motivated to increase their social connections with others. It was hypothesized that socially excluded people would attribute more human-likeness and be persuaded more by an artificial agent than socially included people. These hypotheses were investigated in two studies in which participants were either socially included or excluded, after which they performed an energy-saving task while receiving social feedback from an artificial agent. Results did not support the expectation that socially excluded people ascribe more human-likeness to an artificial agent, but they did show the expected effects on behavior change, indicating the importance of including a person's psychological state in the design of human-agent interactions. Also, in line with earlier findings, female participants were more susceptible to the agent's feedback than male participants, indicating that a user's gender may also determine the effectiveness of persuasive technology.","Ruijten, P.

5017,,"Over the course of my studies in linguistics, I became intrigued by the impact of computer code on communication. As physical space can be used to provide communicative advantages to one party over another, so the computer code that structures a virtual communicative channel shapes discourse patterns. This dissertation is organized as a collection of three papers, each of which considers the asymmetries of discourse in a different virtual environment. The first environment is an online message board for sports fans. Its conversations follow a tree-structure format which identifies whether the author of a message is a donor to the website, a social status marker signaled by the underlying computer code. In this chapter, I investigate how the board's tree-structure influences which messages are read. I also consider what quantifiable differences in participation and readership exist between donors and non-donors. The study of the board structure demonstrates that a reply's proximity to its parent messages affects its readership, with those replies closest to the parent message receiving the highest readership. The study also finds that donors have a higher participation rate in conversations, but on average, messages posted by donors receive slightly less readership per message than those of non-donors. The second environment is in the domain of second language learning and examines students in first semester university Spanish interacting with a virtual conversation partner in Spanish. The conversations followed a format similar to in-class role play activities and were guided by prompted questions from the virtual agent. The study shows that students believe that metalinguistic feedback is necessary for a language learning activity to be useful, although there was not a consensus on the pedagogical effects of the feedback. The pilot study also indicates a preference to have feedback delivered by a separate virtual agent, rather than have the role of conversation partner and tutor be executed by the same agent. The third environment is one of virtual agents designed for tactical questioning training. This chapter looks at interactions primarily from the perspective of the authors creating interactive narratives; it examines communicative asymmetries that are inherent to authoring, as well as restrictions imposed by the specific architecture used to develop the agents. As computers become increasingly ubiquitous as a communication tool, it is important to consider how different environments are structured through computer code. These three studies contribute to the understanding of how design decisions regarding computer-mediated conversation environments affect user interactions.","Rushforth, Michael Dennis",0,,1780
5018,Biologically-inspired heuristics for human-like walking trajectories toward targets and around obstacles,"We describe simple heuristics, based on perceptual variables, that produce human-like trajectories towards moving and stationary targets, and around moving and stationary obstacles. Interception of moving and stationary objects can be achieved through regulation of self-movement to maintain a target at a constant eccentricity, or by cancelling the change (drift) in the eccentricity of the target. We first show how a constant eccentricity strategy can be extended to home in on optimal paths and avoid obstacles. We then identify a simple visual speed ratio that signals a future collision, and the change in path needed for avoidance. The combination of heuristics based on eccentricity and the speed-ratio produces human-like behaviour. The heuristics can be used to animate avatars in virtual environments or to guide mobile robots. Combined with higher-level goal setting and way-finding behaviours, such navigation heuristics could provide the foundation for generative models of natural human locomotion. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

5020,Cogs in the machine: The prioritization of money and self-dehumanization,"The dehumanization of other people is an unfortunately common occurrence that drives discrimination and conflict. We examined when and why the self can also be dehumanized. Across six studies, we found a reciprocal relationship between self-dehumanization and the prioritization of money. Participants who prioritized money (vs. control participants) attributed less humanness to themselves (Studies 1-4), and in turn, chose to socially distance themselves from a coworker (Study 4). Participants led to self-humanize (vs. control participants) were less likely to prioritize money over other goals (Studies 5A-6). The human nature dimension of humanness, which refers to attributes that separate humans from inanimate objects, was more sensitive to money-prioritization than was the human uniqueness dimension, which refers to attributes that separate humans from non-human animals. Alternative explanations based on affect and self-esteem were ruled out. These results suggest that the prioritization of money is at odds with our perceptions of human nature.","Ruttan, R.

Similarly, in schools even well-intentioned educators focus on what they lack, rather than the various stories, experiences, and perspectives they have to offer. To provide another perspective, we aim to find ways to empower resettled refugee youth and draw implications for education of former refugees and other marginalized students. Through interviews, we sought to understand the stories of ten former Burmese refugee adolescents with respect to their backgrounds, migration, and school experiences. Our analysis shows that they recognized their marginalized positionings in the United States that are attributable to their limited English proficiency, ethnicity and race, and former refugee status. They, however, authored narratives of themselves that contest such marginalizing narratives by providing diverse stories of refugees different from dominant ones and positioning themselves as valuable members of local communities and change agents for a more equitable society. These findings call for pedagogical approaches in which schools and communities provide space for stories that former refugee youths bring, value stories authored by them, and draw on their perspectives on inequity and social transformation.

5033,,"Is there a double standard when it comes to the moral acceptability of fiction that encourages the imagination of acts that violate moral norms of harm and moral norms of purity? Observations of ethics, legal proceedings, and public reactions to different types of media seems to suggest so. Over six experiments this phenomenon, coined the fictive pass asymmetry, will be tested. The fictive pass asymmetry hypothesis proposes that fictional contexts including imagination, film, and virtual environments, will mitigate the condemnation of harm code violations more so than purity code violations. In other words, fictional representations of harm are given a ""fictive pass"" in moral condemnation, but the fictional representation of purity code violations that involve an abnormal use of one's body are denied a pass, and thus evaluated more similarly across real and fictional contexts. Chapters 1 through 3 introduce the fictive pass asymmetry and review the literature that provide its theoretical framework. Chapter 4 presents three experiments that establish initial evidence in support of the fictive pass asymmetry effects. Experiment 1 presented participants (N = 431) with vignettes that described agents committing either sexual acts or violent acts that were described as occurring in real life, being performed in a video game, or watched in a film. Experiments 2 and 3 (N = 360 and N = 321, respectively) systematically improved methodology by expanding upon the fictive contexts and creating manipulations based more strictly on the moral psychology literature. Chapter 5 presents experiment 4 (N = 312) and experiment 5 (N = 352) which deepened the understanding of the fictive pass asymmetry effects by using mediation analyses to demonstrate how the perceived wrongness of fictional purity code violations can be explained by the extent to which they signal poor moral character. Lastly, chapter 6 contains a final experiment (N = 484) and a series of meta-analyses. The final experiment considers fictive pass asymmetry effects in relation to an opposing theoretical framework, validates a number of manipulations, and tests the presumption of desire as an alternate explanation of fictive pass asymmetry effects. Finally, the meta-analyses aggregate the data of these experiments to highlight the robustness of the fictive pass asymmetry effects. Chapter 7, the concluding chapter, reviews the experiments and discusses the results in regards to theories of anger and disgust, moral theories of act and character, as well as the fictive pass asymmetry's implications in media use and regulation.","Sabo, John",0,,1786
5034,Imagining Wrong: Fictitious Contexts Mitigate Condemnation of Harm More Than Impurity,"Over 5 experiments, we test the fictive pass asymmetry hypothesis. Following observations of ethics and public reactions to media, we propose that fictional contexts, such as reality, imagination, and virtual environments, will mitigate people's moral condemnation of harm violations, more so than purity violations. That is, imagining a purely harmful act is given a ""fictive pass,"" in moral judgment, whereas imagining an abnormal act involving the body is evaluated more negatively because it is seen as more diagnostic of bad character. For Experiment 1, an undergraduate sample (N = 250) evaluated 9 vignettes depicting an agent committing either violations of harm or purity in real life, watching them in films, or imagining them. For Experiments 2 and 3, online participants (N = 375 and N = 321, respectively) evaluated a single vignette depicting an agent committing a violation of harm or purity that either occurred in real life, was imagined, watched in a film, or performed in a video game. Experiment 4 (N = 348) used an analysis of moderated mediation to demonstrate that the perceived wrongness of fictional purity violations is explained both by the extent to which they are seen as a cue to, and a cause of, a poor moral character. Lastly, Experiment 5 (N = 484) validated our manipulations and included the presumption of desire as an additional mediator of the fictive pass asymmetry effects. We discuss implications for moral theories of act and character, anger and disgust, and for media use and regulation.","Sabo, J. S.",0,10.1037/xge0000251,1787
5036,Being a leader in a rhythmic interaction activates reward-related brain regions,"Interpersonal rhythmic interaction is one of the fundamental behaviors that allow humans to socially interact with others. In this study, we provide novel neuroimaging evidence that being followed by other agents in such an interaction is pleasant for humans. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the brain activity of 17 participants while they performed a virtual drum-hitting task, in one of the following conditions: a) alternating with a virtual agent that would always copy their hitting pace, or b) alternating with a virtual agent that would randomly hit the drum. The participants reported a significantly higher subjective feeling of being followed by the agent in the first condition. Moreover, almost all participants preferred the agent that followed their drum-hitting rhythm. The activity of the caudate nucleus, which is one of the reward-related brain structures, was found to be associated with the subjective feeling of being followed, suggesting that the sense of being the leader, in an interpersonal rhythmic interaction, creates a pleasant feeling.

5041,Evidence for a dyadic motor plan in joint action,"What mechanisms distinguish interactive from non-interactive actions? To answer this question we tested participants while they took turns playing music with a virtual partner: in the interactive joint action condition, the participants played a melody together with their partner by grasping (C note) or pressing (G note) a cube-shaped instrument, alternating in playing one note each. In the non-interactive control condition, players' behavior was not guided by a shared melody, so that the partner's actions and notes were irrelevant to the participant. In both conditions, the participant's and partner's actions were physically congruent (e.g., grasp-grasp) or incongruent (e.g., grasp-point), and the partner's association between actions and notes was coherent with the participant's or reversed. Performance in the non-interactive condition was only affected by physical incongruence, whereas joint action was only affected when the partner's action-note associations were reversed. This shows that task interactivity shapes the sensorimotor coding of others' behaviors, and that joint action is based on active prediction of the partner's action effects rather than on passive action imitation. We suggest that such predictions are based on Dyadic Motor Plans that represent both the agent's and the partner's contributions to the interaction goal, like playing a melody together.","Sacheli, L.

5044,Causative role of left aIPS in coding shared goals during human-avatar complementary joint actions,"Successful motor interactions require agents to anticipate what a partner is doing in order to predictively adjust their own movements. Although the neural underpinnings of the ability to predict others' action goals have been well explored during passive action observation, no study has yet clarified any critical neural substrate supporting interpersonal coordination during active, non-imitative (complementary) interactions. Here, we combine non-invasive inhibitory brain stimulation (continuous Theta Burst Stimulation) with a novel human-avatar interaction task to investigate a causal role for higher-order motor cortical regions in supporting the ability to predict and adapt to others' actions. We demonstrate that inhibition of left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), but not ventral premotor cortex, selectively impaired individuals' performance during complementary interactions. Thus, in addition to coding observed and executed action goals, aIPS is crucial in coding 'shared goals', that is, integrating predictions about one's and others' complementary actions.","Sacheli, L.

5048,How preschoolers and adults represent their joint action partner's behavior,"We investigated the cognitive mechanisms underlying turn-taking joint action in 42-month-old children (Experiment 1) and adults (Experiment 2) using a behavioral task of dressing a virtual bear together. We aimed to investigate how participants represent a partners' behavior, i.e., in terms of specific action kinematics or of action effects. The bear was dressed by pressing a smaller and a bigger button. In the Action-response task, instructions asked participants to respond to the partner by pressing the same or opposite button; in the Action-effect task they had to respond to the partner's action effect by dressing the bear with the lacking part of the clothing, which in some cases implied pressing the same button and in other cases implied pressing the opposite button. In 50% of the trials, the partner's association between each button and the ensuing effect (dressing the bear with t-shirt or pants) was reversed, while it never changed for participants. Both children and adults showed no effect of physical congruency of actions, but showed impaired performance in the Action-effect task if their partner achieved her effect through a different action-effect association than their own. These results suggest that, when encoding their partner's actions, agents are influenced by action-effect associations that they learnt through their own experience. While interference led to overt errors in children, it caused longer reaction times in adults, suggesting that a flexible cognitive control (that is still in development in young children) is required to take on the partner's perspective.","Sacheli, L.

5053,Automated identification of miscoded and misclassified cases of diabetes from computer records,"Aims To develop a computer processable algorithm, capable of running automated searches of routine data that flag miscoded and misclassified cases of diabetes for subsequent clinical review. Method Anonymized computer data from the Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney Disease (QICKD) trial (n = 942 031) were analysed using a binary method to assess the accuracy of data on diabetes diagnosis. Diagnostic codes were processed and stratified into: definite, probable and possible diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Diagnostic accuracy was improved by using prescription compatibility and temporally sequenced anthropomorphic and biochemical data. Bayesian false detection rate analysis was used to compare findings with those of an entirely independent and more complex manual sort of the first round QICKD study data (n = 760 588). Results The prevalence of definite diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes were 0.32% and 3.27% respectively when using the binary search method. Up to 35% of Type 1 diabetes and 0.1% of Type 2 diabetes were miscoded or misclassified on the basis of age/BMI and coding. False detection rate analysis demonstrated a close correlation between the new method and the published hand-crafted sort. Both methods had the highest false detection rate values when coding, therapeutic, anthropomorphic and biochemical filters were used (up to 90% for the new and 75% for the hand-crafted search method). Conclusions A simple computerized algorithm achieves very similar results to more complex search strategies to identify miscoded and misclassified cases of both Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to be used as an automated audit instrument to improve quality of diabetes diagnosis.","Sadek, A. R.",0,10.1111/j.1464-5491.2011.03457.x,1792

5060,,"Nonverbal behaviors externalized through head, face and body movements for conversational agents (CAs) play an important role in human computer interaction (HCI). Believable movements for CAs have to be meaningful and natural. Previous studies mainly relied on rule-based or speechdriven approaches. We propose to bridge the gap between these two approaches overcoming their limitations. We build a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), with a discrete variable to constrain the behaviors. We implement and evaluate the approach with discourse functions as constraints (e.g., questions). The model learns the characteristic behaviors associated with a given discourse class learning the rules from the data. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach over an unconstrained model. Another problem with speech-driven models is that they require all the potential utterances of the CA to be recorded. Using existing text to speech (TTS) systems scales the applications of these methods by providing the flexibility of using text instead of pre-recorded speech. However, training the models with natural speech, and testing them with TTS creates a mismatch affecting the performance of the system. We propose a novel strategy to address this mismatch. It starts by creating a parallel corpus with synthetic speech aligned with the original speech for which we have motion capture recordings. This parallel corpus is used to retrain the models from scratch, or adapt the models built with natural speech. Subjective and objective evaluations show the effectiveness of this solution in reducing the mismatch. In addition to head movements, face conveys a blend of verbal and nonverbal information playing an important role in daily interaction. While speech articulation mostly affects the orofacial area, emotional behaviors are externalized across the entire face. Furthermore, facial muscles connect areas across the face, creating principled relationships and dependencies between the movements that have to be taken into account. Using multi-task learning (MTL), we create speech-driven models that jointly capture the relationship not only between speech and facial movements, but also across facial movements. We build our models with bidirectional long-short term memory (BLSTM) units which are shown to be very successful in modeling dependencies for sequential data. Within the face, the orofacial area conveys information including speech articulation and emotions. These two factors add constraints to the facial movements creating non-trivial integrations and interplays. The relationship between these factors should be modeled, to generate more naturalistic movements for CAs. We provide deep learning speech-driven structures to integrate these factors. We use MTL, where related secondary tasks are jointly solved when synthesizing orofacial movements. In particular, we evaluate emotion and viseme recognition as secondary tasks. The approach creates orofacial movements with superior objective and subjective performances than baseline models. Taken collectively, this dissertation has made algorithmic advancements into speech and body movements sequential modeling to leverage knowledge extraction from speech for nonverbal characterization over time.","Sadoughi Nourabadi, Najmeh",0,,1794
5061,In-Vehicle Cognitive Route Decision Using Fuzzy Modeling and Artificial Neural Network,"The departments of transportation worldwide are facing various challenges despite introducing and incorporating various vehicular features. One of such challenges is to make vehicles autonomous, intelligent, and capable of self-learning to evolve their knowledge repository. In this paper, human cognition is proposed to be implemented in vehicles so that they can perform human-like decisions. Therefore, the process of vehicular route decision is debated cognitively in order to provide route information intelligently. The in-vehicle routes provided by the GPS are not optimal and lack on-demand user requirements. GPS connectivity issues, in certain conditions, make it difficult for vehicles to take real-time decisions. This leads to the idea of self-decision by the vehicle controller. We propose a cognitive framework for vehicles to make self-decisions that use cognitive memory for storing route experiences. The framework strengthens the existing in-vehicle route finding capability and its provision in a more realistic manner. The user is provided with all available route-related information that is required for the journey. In addition, the route episodes are learned, stored, and accessed inside the cognitive memory for an optimal route provision. The vehicle learns about the routes and matures with route-experience by itself with the passage of time. In simulations, fuzzy modeling is used to validate the impact of cognitive parameters over static/conventional parameters. Moreover, artificial neural networks are used to minimize the error rate in learning to achieve cognitive route decisions. The proposed in-vehicle cognitive framework outperforms the existing route provision system that is inadequate and provokes the user's anxieties during driving. Besides, the proposed scheme gradually gets mature in delivering optimal as well as latest route-related information.","Saeed, Y.",0,10.1109/access.2019.2895832,1795
5067,,"In this thesis, we study the asymptotic behavior of Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems that describe fusion in dynamic multi-agent networks. We consider networks that consist of at least one anchor (node with known state) and an arbitrary number of mobile agents that perform a distributed algorithm to achieve a common goal. Due to mobility, the state-update at each agent depends on the availability of neighbors. Agent mobility, thus, leads to an LTV abstraction where the system matrices are random, and can be either stochastic, if the neighborhood at the updating agent does not contain any anchor, or, sub-stochastic, if the neighborhood contains anchors. We refer to the general class of such time-varying fusion algorithms over mobile agents as Distributed Dynamic Fusion (DDF). In this context, we study the conditions required on the DDF system matrices such that the dynamic fusion forgets the initial conditions and converges to (a linear combination of) the anchor state(s). To this aim, we partition the sequence of system matrices into non-overlapping slices, and by introducing the notion of unbounded connectivity , we obtain stability conditions in terms of the slice lengths and some network parameters. In particular, we show that the system is asymptotically stable if the unbounded lengths of an infinite subset of slices grow slower than an explicit exponential rate. We apply the DDF theory in the design and analysis of the following distributed algorithms: (i) dynamic leader-follower; and (ii) localization in dynamic multi-agent networks. We first consider dynamic leader-follower problem, where the goal for the entire network is to converge to the state of a leader. We assume that at each iteration, one agent exchanges information with nearby nodes and updates its state as a linear-convex combination of the neighboring states. We develop the conditions under which the underlying (sub-) stochastic LTV system converges to the leader state regardless of the agents' initial conditions. We then consider localization in mobile multi-agent networks. We provide a distributed algorithm to localize an arbitrary number of agents moving in a bounded region of interest. In the case of such mobile networks, the main challenge is that the agents may not be able to find nearby agents to implement a distributed algorithm. We address this issue by providing an opportunistic algorithm that only implements a linear-convex location update when it lies inside the convex hull of nearby agents and does not update otherwise. We abstract this algorithm as an LTV system, whose system matrices may be stochastic, or sub-stochastic, intermittently, and provide sufficient conditions for the network to track the agents' true locations. By introducing the notion of virtual convex hull, we provide an alternative localization algorithm that does not require an agent to lie inside the convex of the neighbors at any given time. We investigate the effects of noise on both localization algorithms and provide modifications to counter the undesirable effects of noise. Finally, we relate the dimension of motion in the network to the number of anchors required, and show that a network of mobile agents with full degrees of freedom in the motion can be localized precisely, as long as there is at least one anchor in the network. To the best of our knowledge, this is a unique property that distinguishes the proposed localization approach in this thesis from the existing algorithms in the literature.","Safavi, Sam",0,,1796
5068,"Effects of visual and linguistic anthropomorphic cues on social perception, self-awareness, and information disclosure in a health website","Acknowledging the lack of studies examining both visual and linguistic anthropomorphic cues and the underlying mechanisms of their effects, we investigated how the different modalities of anthropomorphic cues in a health website influenced information disclosure. In a 2 (visual cues: human vs. non-human image) x 2 (linguistic cues: conversational vs. impersonal language) x 2 (question type: less vs. more sensitive questions) between-subjects experiment (N = 254), participants registered with a mock-up health website. We assessed a behavioral outcome of not disclosing personal information and psychological outcomes of social perception and self-awareness as potential mediators. Results revealed distinctive effects of the two modalities of the anthropomorphic cues. Anthropomorphic images, on one hand, increased public and private self-awareness, and public self-awareness in turn led to less information disclosure. Anthropomorphic language, on the other hand, heightened social perception and promoted information disclosure, but social perception did not predict the disclosure. These results indicate unique underlying mechanisms of the effects of anthropomorphism: priming effect of visual cues, and communicative effects of linguistic cues. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

5070,"Mandarin lessons: modernity, colonialism and Chinese cultural nationalism in the Dutch East Indies, c.1900s","The Chinese Association in the Dutch East Indies, known locally as the Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan (THHK) was first established in Batavia in 1900. A key objective of the THHK's foundation was the creation of modern schools instructing in Mandarin for local Chinese students. At the turn of the 20th century, this odd choice of instructional language led to highly charged debates about languages, pedagogical efficacy, practicality, modernity-tradition and cultural authenticity. Using underutilized source materials in the local Malay-Hokkien vernacular, this article revisits these debates amongst the Chinese in the Dutch colony. This article interrogates the transparency of common ethnicity in analyses of Chinese nationalisms that developed outside of continental China. Drawing on the concept of literary governance as well as comparative work by scholars on Indian and continental Chinese nationalisms, it demonstrates the significance of the colonial context which provoked the THHK to adopt the vocabulary of modernity in reworking progressive ideas circulating in displaced Chinese nationalistic circles. Notwithstanding the THHK's promotion of Mandarin, such reworking was accomplished through vigorous acts of transliteration and translation in the hybridized Malay-Hokkien vernacular. The THHK was hardly on the receiving end of nationalistic influences emanating from the proverbial China core but was an active agent in what has been described as a global moment of Chinese nationalism. The case of the THHK demonstrates the need for a finer understanding of multivalent histories of Chinese nationalisms as well as how these histories intersected with those of European colonialism in Southeast Asia.","Sai, S.

VHs have the ability to replicate human like verbal (speech) and non-verbal (gestures, facial expressions) interactive behaviors. They are presently being used in training, testing, improving communication skills and practice, with the added advantages of; fidelity of presentation; ability to portray a much wider range of personality; appearance; emotions; behavior; and the potential to be available anywhere, anytime, and at a low cost. My research objective is to develop intelligent VHs with the ability to portray emotions and generate behaviors based on their history, education, personal experiences and cognitive state of mind. Emotions described as a state of feeling in the sense of an affect are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation. Over the years various agent architectures have been developed using computational models of emotions to drive the behavior of VHs. A common deficit seen across these agent architectures is their inability to incorporate one's personal experiences, history, and education while computing the decision making process for behavior generation. To this effect an agent architecture, called Culturally Modified Agent Architecture (CMAA), was developed with the ability to generate autonomous VHs whose cognitive state of mind is driven by three main factors: 1) agent's belief (past history and personal experiences), 2) agent's personality and the 3) mood of the agent. The two main components driving the CMAA architecture are- the appraisal model (responsible for appraising the events based on agent's belief) and the emotion model (responsible for generating a set of emotions based on appraisal variables and PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) rules of personality and emotions). To test the feasibility of developing autonomous intelligent VHs using the proposed CMAA agent architecture, a VH prototype was implemented within the clinical setting. A VH prototype termed as VSP (Virtual Standardized Patient) portraying an OEF (Operation Enduring Freedom)/OIF (Operation Iraqi Freedom)/OND (Operation New Dawn) Veteran, exhibiting symptoms associated with mild TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury), was developed as a screening tool for evaluation purposes. Currently two different versions of the VSP exist- Version 1, where the VSPs behavior and emotions are scripted by the experts based on observations of a typical screening of mild TBI patient, and Version 2, where the behavior and emotions are automated and driven by the CMAA agent architecture. Evaluation studies were designed to 1) test the validity and believability of the VSP portraying symptoms of mild TBI and 2) test the effectiveness of using the VSP as a training tool to practice diagnostic evaluation and improve communication between a patient and a provider within a clinical setting. This dissertation presents an in-depth review of the development and social impact of VHs across various domains. It describes the working of the CMAA agent architecture and its structural components for creating personalized, autonomous, intelligent agents. The dissertation then describes the design and development of the VSP as a diagnostic training tool for evaluation of mild TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury). Lastly an in-depth description of the evaluation studies along with the results are presented. The dissertation concludes by highlighting the potential possibilities of future work.","Sakpal, Raghavi",0,,1800

In turn, their ability to recognize faces of other species declines at almost the same period (perceptual narrowing). In the current study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between the perception of uncanniness of faces and perceptual narrowing in infants and adults. We used the ""uncanny valley task,"" in which the participants were required to discriminate the faces of humans and monkeys by different eye size. Results showed that 3- to 5-month-old infants could not discriminate either monkey or human faces by eye size, whereas 6- to 8-month olds could. Adults showed higher discrimination performance for human than monkey faces and perceived the human faces with extremely large or small eyes as exceedingly eerie.

5079,,"Of the various types of VoIP handling protocols, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application layer protocol considered to be the most commonly used signaling protocol in the VoIP services industry. It is used for the purpose of creation, modification, and termination of sessions that contain multimedia streams at the endpoints known as User Agents (UA). SIP was standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and is designed to work with other IETF Internet protocols to establish a full multimedia session. SIP is also the basis for the operation of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which forms the essential infrastructure for service offering in 4G LTE or Long Term Evolution wireless networks. IMS facilitates Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) and is expected to play an important role in next generation wireless networks as well. This work considers VoIP Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and focuses on studying the overall requirements for improving Quality of Service (QoS). The objective is to study the effects of KPIs on VoIP Calls’ QoS for both SIP and RTP, with a view on the effects of adding a play-out buffer on KPIs. Thus the central theme and quest of this work is finding an ideal buffer size that will simultaneously satisfy multiple KPIs and create a balanced and effective system. With respect to SIP, we also look into analyzing and validating the SIP dynamic Priority scheme proposed by [12]. The scheme is implemented using open source VoIP Call generators and packet analyzers. Determination of the ideal range of arrival rates will help determine the effectiveness of the SIP dynamic priority scheme.

5080,,"Conventional real-time scheduling algorithms are in care of timing constraints; they don’t pay any attention to enhance or optimize the real-time packet’s security performance. In this work, we propose an adaptive security-aware scheduling with congestion control mechanism for packet switching networks using real-time agent-based systems. The proposed system combines the functionality of real-time scheduling with the security service enhancement, where the real-time scheduling unit uses the differentiated-earliest-deadline-first (Diff-EDF) scheduler, while the security service enhancement scheme adopts a congestion control mechanism based on a resource estimation methodology. The security service enhancement unit was designed based on two models: single-layer and weighted multi-layer design models. For single-layer, the design provides an enhancement for a single security service: confidentiality, integrity, or authentication, while the weighted multi-layer design provides an enhancement for multiple security services with different weights on a real-time network with multi-processor end nodes. The proposed system provides the required QoS guarantees for different classes of real-time data flows (video, audio), while adaptively enhances the packet’s security service levels according to a feedback from the congestion control model, which efficiently utilizes the buffering system at the edge network, and thus protects the network from being congested by heavy traffic load. Our agent-based system eliminates the overhead of the security association phase performed by the internet protocol security (IPsec). Such elimination had been achieved by overloading the priority code point (PCP) fields of the IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame format for the single-layer scheme, while repeated single-layer and overloading the PCP and the virtual-LAN identifier (VID) fields of the IEEE 802.1Q were the adopted methodologies by the weighted multi-layer security design model. By using the Diff-EDF scheduler, the proposed system minimizes the flows miss rates and the flows average total delays compared to the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) and the first-come-first-served (FCFS) schedulers. From the other hand, our adaptive security enhancement scheme minimizes the buffer consumption, the average total packet delays, and the pending packets at the end users compared to the IPsec protocol. It was also compared to an implemented feedback-IPsec, where our adaptive system eliminated the repeated security associations performed by the feedback-IPsec, hence less overhead and increases the chances to meet the flows QoS requirements.","Saleh, Ma'en Saleh",0,,1804
5081,,"Mutations can lead to many human diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, color-blindness, and cancer. The vast search spaces in these medically significant mutations make exhaustive experimental explorations infeasible. Thus, approaches aiming towards combining computation with biology are indispensable and could have major impact on many genetic diseases. This dissertation addressed this problem for the specific case of p53 protein mutations. Tumor suppressor protein p53, called the ""Guardian of the Genome,"" is one of most important cellular agents involved in control and suppression of human cancer tumors. p53 is mutated in about 50% of all human cancers. Here we have investigated several computational techniques to facilitate reactivation of destabilized p53 cancer mutants. First, a bioinformatics strategy employing a series of filters called CHOPER filtering was developed. This strategy provided a novel error correction and mutation detection pipeline for a complex mutagenesis population by next generation sequencing (NGS). Our computational methods increased the average NGS accuracy of all p53 cancer mutant M237I codon positions from 74.51% to 99.73% at the expense of discarding only 21.28% of bases. For the specific problem addressed here, these filters reduced 13% more errors and also discarded half as many bases, relative to NGS error filtering based on Phred quality scores. In addition, a fast alignment algorithm was developed to extend the efficiency of CHOPER filtering method. Next, stability and flexibility of p53 mutants were investigated by developing novel computational metrics. Specifically, the residue distance map and Sum of Standardized Features (SSF) metrics were developed using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The residue distance map approach predicted activity of the 23 investigated p53 cancer and rescue mutants with 96% accuracy. It distinguished two essential structural regions in p53 reactivation, and the SSF metric correlated well (r2 = 0.82) with the experimental thermodynamic stability data. Finally, reactivation of p53 cancer mutants by small molecules was explored as a long term goal in cancer therapy. A combination of different virtual screening scores, diversity considerations, and other filtering criteria was used to select 138 pilot compounds which were tested biologically. 15 of these compounds proved to be p53 cancer mutant reactivation compounds. This pilot experiment alone yielded more putative new p53 cancer mutant reactivation compounds than all those found in research efforts of the past 10 years. The results of this pilot study was then used to train a classifier based on virtual screening scores, binary fingerprints, and similarity scores to predict and select more potential p53 reactivation compounds. In the second pilot experiment, 7 compounds were purchased and biologically tested, which yielded 2 additional novel p53 cancer mutant reactivation compounds.","Salehi Amiri, Seyedeh Faezeh",0,,1805

In an experiment with a humanoid robot we investigated the effects of the robot's hand and arm gestures on the perception of humanlikeness, likability of the robot, shared reality, and future contact intentions after interacting with the robot. For this purpose, the speech-accompanying non-verbal behaviors of the humanoid robot were manipulated in three experimental conditions: (1) no gesture, (2) congruent co-verbal gesture, and (3) incongruent co-verbal gesture. We hypothesized higher ratings on all dependent measures in the two multimodal (i.e., speech and gesture) conditions compared to the unimodal (i.e., speech only) condition. The results confirm our predictions: when the robot used co-verbal gestures during interaction, it was anthropomorphized more, participants perceived it as more likable, reported greater shared reality with it, and showed increased future contact intentions than when the robot gave instructions without gestures. Surprisingly, this effect was particularly pronounced when the robot's gestures were partly incongruent with speech, although this behavior negatively affected the participants' task-related performance. These findings show that communicative non-verbal behaviors displayed by robotic systems affect anthropomorphic perceptions and the mental models humans form of a humanoid robot during interaction.","Salem, M.",1,10.1007/s12369-013-0196-9,1806
5088,Modelling Cooperation Mechanisms: Some Conceptual Issues,"Several evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed to explain how natural selection leads to cooperation between competing individuals. Social dilemmas modelled with the aid of game theory capture the essence of this problem, and computer simulation is usually the technique used to test and formalise those explanatory mechanisms. However, scarce attention has been paid to what the notion of 'mechanisms' means and involves in the literature. Also, the key issue about when a computer simulation provides a good explanation tends to be ignored. In this article, we tackle these two drawbacks in the literature by calling attention to the implications of the notion of 'social mechanism' along different conceptual dimensions, such as ontological status, regularity, transparency, intelligibility, and reduction. We also claim that computer simulation, and specially agent-based modelling, provides a plausible explanation to social cooperation only if it satisfies some criteria of empirical adequacy instead of just being capable of generating cooperation in a virtual system. Finally, we relate these issues to five evolutionary mechanisms that explain the evolution of cooperation. We review and briefly describe the literature on these mechanisms, and we explain their most important features, how they are to be considered along the conceptual dimensions used to describe the notion of mechanism, what is the empirical and computational evidence to support them, and which are the shortcomings that each of them has as explanatory hypotheses for the evolution of cooperation.","Salgado, M.",0,10.1007/s10816-013-9186-3,1807
5091,,"Sharing healthcare information—including electronic health/medical records (EHRs/EMRs)—among healthcare information systems is necessary for improving the quality of healthcare. However, facilitating data exchange increases privacy threats—due to easier copying and dissemination of healthcare information. We propose a solution that provides privacy protection for patients’ EHRs/EMRs disseminated among different authorized healthcare information systems. Our solution builds upon the existing construct named an Active Data Bundle (ADB). In the proposed solution, ADBs keep EHRs/EMRs as sensitive data; include metadata describing sensitive data and prescribing their use; and encompass a policy enforcement engine (called a virtual machine or VM), which controls and manages how its active bundle behaves. The VM enforces ADB’s data integrity and ADB’s privacy policies (specified as a part of metadata). We first modify the existing design and implementation of the ADB scheme, known as Active Bundles using Trusted Third Party (ABTTP). ABTTP uses ADBs and trusted third parties (TTPs). The latter maintain and provide to ADBs trust values of visited hosts, as well as hash values and decryption keys. Our modification, named Active Data Bundles with Trusted Third Party (ADB-TTP), is only a starting point for significant enhancements and improvements to the ADB scheme proposed by us. They include: (i) using nested VMs in ADB-TTP instead of using single VM in ABTTP, (ii) adding new phases to the ADB lifecycle including ADB auditing and ADB Termination; and (iii) using the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) to specify the privacy policies and to enforce them. We also develop a new ADB scheme implementation, known as Active Data Bundles with Multi-Agent System (ADB-MAS). ADB-MAS implements active data bundles as mobile intelligent agents, which eliminate the need for using TTPs. In order to test the effectiveness of different ADB schemes and evaluate their use in healthcare applications, we use a real-life healthcare scenario for dissemination of EHRs in healthcare information systems. We evaluate both ADB-TTP and ADB-MAS using separate testbeds implemented with Java Standard Edition (JDK 1.8) and Java Agent Development Framework (JADE), respectively. We run consistent experiments on both testbeds to evaluate and compare performance for both solutions (the experiments are ""consistent"" as much as possible in the context of separate testbed implementations). The evaluation criteria for ADB-TTP and ADB-MAS include rates of data reduction, data disclosure, and successful/unsuccessful data delivery. Our evaluation shows that ADBs are able to protect patient EHRs//EMRs during their dissemination among healthcare providers. The quantitative results show that under different circumstances either ADB-TTP or ADB-MAS is a better protector of data (via so called “evaporation” or “apoptosis” of the most sensitive data). The qualitative conclusions are that ADB-MAS outperforms ADB-TTP in protection of privacy of healthcare data (EHRs/EMRs) because ADB-MAS performs a priori trust verification of destination hosts (to which EHRs/EMRs are delivered by ADBs). Our results demonstrate that ADB-MAS, our new implementations of the ADB scheme, improve the privacy and efficiency of processing of patients’ data in healthcare information systems. In the broader area of computing technology, ADB-MAS can be used to prevent privacy violations, including stealing and leaking of sensitive data in diverse distributed computing applications areas, including Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Opportunistic Resource Utilization Networks (Oppnets), and distributed database systems.","Salih, Raed M.",0,,1808
5092,,"Many wheelchair users rely upon fixed route public transportation using large accessible transit vehicles (LATVs) for independent transportation to and from work, healthcare appointments and leisure activities. A substantial number of these wheelchair users may not be able to transfer from their wheelchair to a motor vehicle seat during transit. It is necessary to afford these wheelchair users the same level of safety as occupants seated in motor vehicle seats. Therefore, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that LATVs be equipped with wheelchair securement and occupant restraint systems (WTORS). The four-point tiedowns and occupant restraints are the primary means of WTORS on LATVs. Recent research has shown extremely high disuse and misuse rates for this wheelchair and tiedown occupant restraint system (WTORS). However, to-date, no studies have investigated the underlying causes of WTORS disuse and misuse. Perhaps more importantly, the consequences of WTORS misuse and disuse for wheelchair passengers aboard LATVs have not been determined. This study had three major phases aimed at describing consequences of WTORS misuse and disuse for wheelchair passengers on LATVs: I) A case series of adverse events involving wheelchair seated passengers on LATVs, II) Driving experiments using a wheelchair seated anthropomorphic testing device onboard a LATV, III) Development, validation and verification of a computer simulation of a wheelchair passenger onboard a LATV. This study revealed that the vast majority of wheelchair related instabilities are associated with minor wheelchair excursions. We also found when WTORS are properly used, the wheelchair passenger does not appear to be at increased risk of injury, while WTORS disuse and misuse are associated with a high frequency of wheelchair passenger ejection from the wheelchair, especially during an emergency braking maneuver. We found that a manual wheelchair brake can play a major role in limiting wheelchair excursions when WTORS are not properly used and that lateral wheelchair excursions can be limited by the folded-seat side barrier under the window.","Salipur, Zdravko",0,,1809
5093,,"The Project: The aim of this thesis was to develop a deeper understanding of the nature and context within which interactions between a robotic exhibit (dynamic avatar and conversational agent) called the Articulated Head (AH) and a human interacting with it took place. The main focus of the research was directed at understanding the nature of the experience of avatar, conversational agent and audience interaction within the constraints and context of the Articulated Head’s exhibited status: that of an enclosed situated robotic exhibit in a public exhibition space. The Articulated Head is predominantly referred to in the past tense because the project is essentially over. The hardware components of the Articulated Head were decommissioned from exhibition at the Powerhouse Museum in Ultimo, Sydney, Australia in November 2012. The purpose of this research: The purpose of this research was to consider how interaction between humans and the Articulated Head could be improved. Therefore, a primary goal of this investigation was to find ways in which human engagement was enhanced during these interactions. The following research questions underpinned the investigation: a. In which ways ‘has and can’ the avatar be given agency? b. In which ways ‘is and can’ the avatar be multi-sensory and multi-present? c. In which ways ‘can and do’ the characteristics of a `virtual' performer (e.g., personality, nuance of response, context) condition affect and engagement? Auditory-visual creative new media additions (see section 6) were added to the Articulated Head’s exhibit space with the express intention that they would help contribute to enhancing the interactive experience for the active audience visiting the Articulated Head. These auditory-visual additions were tested to determine whether they would enhance active audience engagement and thereby improve the exhibits interaction design.","Salmon, Richard Andrew",0,,1810
5095,Robotics for Seabed Teleoperation: Part-1-Conception and Practical Implementation of a Hybrid Seabed Robot,"Remote exploration and work on the seabed require special-use robots that are adapted to both working on rough surfaces and traveling through an underwater environment. This paper discusses a prototype design for a hybrid robot that moves like a submarine in one configuration and like a humanoid in another. This hybrid design allows the robot to move efficiently on the work surface and execute its functions on that surface with human-like movements. Moreover the robot has hydraulic actuators with 24 degrees of freedom. Furthermore, this paper discusses design choices and preliminary tests related to navigation, transformation from one configuration to another, and a gestural teleoperation control scheme.","Saltaren, R.",0,10.1109/access.2018.2876040,1811
5098,Perception and Generation of Affective Hand Movements,"Perception and generation of affective movements are essential for achieving the expressivity required for a fully engaging human-machine interaction. This paper develops a computational model for recognizing and generating affective hand movements for display on anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic structures. First, time-series features of these movements are aligned and converted to fixed-length vectors using piece-wise linear re-sampling. Next, a feature transformation best capable of discriminating between the affective movements is obtained using functional principal component analysis (FPCA). The resulting low-dimensional feature transformation is used for classification and regeneration. A dataset consisting of one movement type, closing and opening the hand, is considered for this study. Three different expressions, sadness, happiness and anger, were conveyed by a demonstrator through the same general movement. The performance of the developed model is evaluated objectively using leave-one-out cross validation and subjectively through a user study, where participants evaluated the regenerated affective movements as well as the original affective movements reproduced both on a human-like model and a non-anthropomorphic structure. The proposed approach achieves zero leave-one-out cross validation errors, on both the training and testing sets. No significant difference is observed between participants' evaluation of the regenerated movements as compared to the original movement, which confirms successful regeneration of the affective movement. Furthermore, a significant effect of structure on the perception of affective movements is observed.","Samadani, A. A.",0,10.1007/s12369-012-0169-4,1812
5102,Testing group dynamics with a virtual partner to increase physical activity motivation,"Purpose: The Kohler group dynamic motivation effect capitalizes on group interdependence to motivate greater effort for lower ability members (when the outcome is dependent on the weaker member). This field study applied the Kohler group dynamic in a mobile app with a software-generated partner (SGP), for the first time, to motivate adults to persist with moderate intensity exercise. This study also explored a novel application of interpersonal synchrony during a walk warm-up period to boost perceptions of interpersonal connectedness with the SGP. Methods: Community adults were randomized to one of three conditions to walk with the app in their environment of choice for 3 weeks: no-partner individual control (IC); more capable SGP; synchronous more capable SGP (syncSGP). Results: Non-statistically significant differences for mean minutes of walking favored the syncSGP over IC walkers with an effect size (d = 0.47) comparable in magnitude to other recent Kohler effect exercise lab studies using SGPs. Conclusion: Group persistence differences and trends appear to provide support for this innovative application of a physical activity group dynamics motivational tool with community adults in free-living environments.","Samendinger, S.",1,10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.004,1813
5105,,"Humor in face-to-face interactions regularly exploits multimodal cues such as emotional facial expressions as social cognitive tools that help us coordinate our beliefs with others’. The encryption theory of humor (Flamson & Barrett, 2008) states that humorous acts are encrypted and we need a common “key” to understand what’s funny and humor acts a marker of internal similarity. We communicate this shared knowledge with laughter, which denotes affiliative interactions and shared underlying assumptions about the world (e.g., “This is socially okay, so I can believe it’s funny”; Flamson & Bryant, 2013) while cringing away indicates an affective stance of “this is not okay”. These interactions are prevalent in every day face-to-face conversations, but are difficult to express in computer-mediated communication (CMC). However, the regular use and presence of GIFs in online mediums such as text messaging newly affords a similar style of multi-party interactions where one’s commentary on another person’s jokes may change someone’s opinion of the joke and interaction itself. If these multimodal cues exist in face-to-face group interactions, can CMC afford the same socioemotional cuing? GIFs, which re-present looped animations of embodied actions and are commonly used as reactions to everyday occurrences (Herring, 2015) have been found to act as embodied depictions that demonstrate one’s own current reactions in text-messaged conversations (Tolins & Samermit, 2016). With the affordances, the possibilities for action that an agent directly perceives in an object or an environment (Gibson, 1979), provided with GIFs, this dissertation aims to answer the following broad question: How does the presence of a reaction GIF change how funny people perceive “overheard” text-messaged jokes? And does the way the GIF is understood as ironic (a combination of different dimensions of irony, such as how hyperbolic, understated, sarcastic, playful, performative, and humorous people find something; Gibbs & Samermit, 2017) have a predictive relationship with how funny they might find the joke itself? This dissertation addressed these broad question in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants acted as “overhearers” in a text-messaged group chat where they received a joke from one member of the group, and viewed either another member’s positive or negative GIF response, another member’s positive or negative Text response, or no response at all, before rating how funny they found the joke, and how ironic (sarcastic, hyperbolic, critical, and playful) they found the response. In Experiment 2, participants did the same as Experiment 1, but also saw static or animated GIF or Text responses. The two experiments tested two hypotheses: the passive observer hypothesis, where overhearers do not integrate valence with ironic information into their judgments of humor, and the active negotiator hypothesis, where they do. Results across both experiments support the active negotiator hypothesis, indicating overhearers in text messaged conversations conduct metarepresentational reasoning and integrate valence with ironic information about responses to make judgments of humor. This finding supports the encryption theory of laughter and humor.","Samermit, Patrawat",0,,1814
5106,How prescriptive norms influence causal inferences,"Recent experimental findings suggest that prescriptive norms influence causal inferences. The cognitive mechanism underlying this finding is still under debate. We compare three competing theories: The culpable control model of blame argues that reasoners tend to exaggerate the causal influence of norm violating agents, which should lead to relatively higher causal strength estimates for these agents. By contrast, the counterfactual reasoning account of causal selection assumes that norms do not alter the representation of the causal model, but rather later causal selection stages. According to this view, reasoners tend to preferentially consider counterfactual states of abnormal rather than normal factors, which leads to the choice of the abnormal factor in a causal selection task. A third view, the accountability hypothesis, claims that the effects of prescriptive norms are generated by the ambiguity of the causal test question. Asking whether an agent is a cause can be understood as a request to assess her causal contribution but also her moral accountability. According to this theory norm effects on causal selection are mediated by accountability judgments that are not only sensitive to the abnormality of behavior but also to mitigating factors, such as intentionality and knowledge of norms. Five experiments are presented that favor the accountability account over the two alternative theories. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

5108,,"In this thesis, we present the research work performed with various robots including Android PKD, Zeno and the Atlas robot. The main focus of this thesis is to develop algorithms for vision based natural human robot interaction in real time. Zeno is a childlike robot that we use for the research related to Autism in children. Children with Autism who lack motor skills tend to shy away from humans. In this project we use the robot Zeno that is capable of facial expressions, arm and body motions to teach motor skills to them. For this purpose we developed a program that plays predetermined gestures like hand wave, tummy rub and fist bump in a particular sequence. This was used in the UNT Health science center to record the motion of the Autistic children so that we can compare the motion of the child and the robot. Android PKD is an avatar of the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick. In this project we developed a novel algorithm to distribute the motion between the neck and the eye servo motors to solve the redundancy involved. The robot was able to track faces by moving its eyes and neck in a realistic humanlike motion. Another project was done to mimic the facial expressions and the 3D rotations of the human head by the PKD. In this the mapping between the facial feature space and the actuator space is addressed using linear and nonlinear methods. Both of these demos and Zeno were exhibited at the Humanoids 2013 conference in Atlanta. An algorithm to map the human arm, torso and leg motion to the robot was developed as a project for DARPA Robotics challenge and also controlling the robot in real time. The robot used is called Atlas and it is a virtual robot in a Gazebo simulation environment. The issue of singularities has been addressed while mapping the human motion to the robot.","Sampathkumar, Suresh",0,,1816
5109,,"This thesis looks at improving the generation of maps for intelligent virtual agents in large scale environments. Virtual environments are growing larger in size and becoming more complex. There is a major challenge in providing agents that are able to autonomously generate their own map representations of the environment for use in navigation. Currently, map generation for agents in large scale virtual environments is performed either by hand or requires a lengthy pre-processing step where the map is built online. We are interested in environments where this process is not possible, such as those that encourage user generated content. We look at improving map generation in these environments by using trails. Trails are a set of observations of how a user navigates an environment over time. By observing trails an agent is able to identify free space in an environment and how to navigate between points without needing to perform any collision checking. We found that trails in a virtual environments are a useful source of information for an agent's map building process. Trails can be used to improve rapidly exploring randomised tree and probabilistic roadmap generation, as well as being used as a source of information for segmenting maps in very large scale environments.","Samperi, Katrina",0,,1817
5110,Semantic cross-correlation as a measure of social interaction,"Achieving human-level social and emotional intelligence is vital for the integration of future virtual agents and robots into the human society. To solve the challenge, it is necessary to have efficient metrics and criteria that would allow us to measure how close the solution is to the state of the art. In this work, one such potentially useful measure is introduced: semantic cross-correlation computed in addition to semantic trajectories characterizing a dialogue. This measure characterizes social interaction. Two different kinds of dialogues are used: (1) between physicians and schizophrenic patients and (2) between ad hoc participants assigned the roles of a user and a system who cooperatively solve problems. Similar in some aspects and at the same time different patterns of semantic characteristics are observed in the two cases. The new measure is applicable to dialogue transcripts as well as to sequences of actions with known semantic characteristics attributed to them. Therefore, it can be expected to become a useful general metric in evaluation of social-emotional interactions and social intelligence of virtual agents. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

5111,Semantic-map-based analysis of insight problem solving,"Intelligent agents and co-robots, or cobots, become increasingly popular today as assistants of creators of arts. They can be also expected to become popular in the near future as assistants in other creative work, including research and, in particular, insight problem solving. Arguably, the success of such tools is linked to their social-emotional intelligence. This work continues the previous study of the concept of a cobot-assistant of an insight problem solver (Kuznetsova & Samsonovich, Procedia Computer Science 123:258-64, 2018). The concept is based on a semantic map, that represents cognitive and emotional states and attitudes. The previously constructed semantic map is used here to study the dynamics of human cognitive and emotional states during insight problem solving. It is found here that subjects solving an insight problem become more excited and try to take more radical approaches, and also become slightly more confident, as they approach the insight moment, regardless of whether they actually succeed. This finding should help to formulate rules and cognitive schemas to be tested in future studies of the proposed insight problem solver assistant. The expected impact is on the anticipated emergence of general-purpose virtual cobots-assistants, unleashing higher creativity in their users.","Samsonovich, A. V.",0,10.1016/j.bica.2018.07.017,1819

The role played by digital resources to establish family-school relationships in pre-schools for children up to three is identified and analysed on the basis of experiences in schools in which ICT resources are being used for communicative processes. The results show that the most commonly used resources are blogs/websites and email, mainly for providing families with information. It is also observed that the introduction of ICT tools in these relations lacks the pedagogical reflection that would determine the communicative goals and the role played by both educational agents in the relationship scenarios mediated by ICT.","Sanchez-Garrote, I.",0,10.1080/11356405.2015.1006851,1820

5119,,"Multi-drug resistance in bacterial pathogens has become a global health crisis. Each year, millions of people worldwide are infected with bacterial strains that are resistant to currently available antibiotics. Diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, and gonorrhea have become increasingly more difficult to treat. It is essential that novel drugs and cellular targets be identified in order to treat this resistance. Bacterial topoisomerase IA is a novel drug target that is essential for cellular growth. As it has never been targeted by existing antibiotics, it is an attractive target. Topoisomerase IA is responsible for relieving torsional strain on DNA by relaxing supercoiled DNA following processes such as replication and transcription. The aim of this study is to find novel compounds that can be developed as leads for antibiotics targeting bacterial type IA topoisomerase. Various approaches were used in order to screen thousands of compounds against bacterial type IA topoisomerases, including mixture-based screening and virtual screening. In the mixture-based screen, scaffold mixtures were tested against the M. tuberculosis topoisomerase I enzyme and subsequently optimized for maximum potency and selectivity. The optimized compounds were effective at inhibiting the enzyme at low micromolar concentrations, as well as killing the tuberculosis bacteria. In a virtual screen, libraries with hundreds of thousands of compounds were screened against the E. coli and M. tuberculosis topoisomerase I crystal structures in order to find new classes of drugs. The top hits were effective at inhibiting the enzymes, as well as preventing the growth of M. smegmatis cells in the presence of efflux pump inhibitors. Organometallic complexes containing Cu(II) or Co(III) were tested as well against various topoisomerases in order to determine their selectivity. We discovered a poison for human type II topoisomerase that has utility as an anticancer agent, as it killed even very resistant cell lines of breast and colon cancer. The Co(III) complexes were found to inhibit the bacterial topoisomerase I very selectively over other topoisomerases. The various methods of drug discovery utilized here have been successful at identifying new classes of compounds that may be further developed into antibiotic drugs that specifically target bacterial type IA topoisomerases.","Sandhaus, Shayna",0,,1822
5120,,"This paper re-evaluates what constitutes a social robot by analysing how a range of different forms of robot are interpreted as socially aware and communicative. Its argument juxtaposes a critical assessment of the development of humanlike and animal-like robotic companions with a consideration of human relations with machinelike robots in working teams. The paper employs a range of communication theories alongside ideas relating to anthropomorphism and zoomorphism in discussing human–robot interactions. Some traditions of communication theory offer perspectives that support the development of humanlike and animal-like social robots. However, these perspectives have been critiqued within communications scholarship as unethically closed to the possibilities of otherness and difference. This paper therefore reconfigures and extends the use of communication theory to explore how machinelike robots are interpreted by humans as social and communicative others. This involves an analysis of human relations with explosive ordnance disposal robots and with the robotic desk lamp, AUR. The paper positions social robotics research as important in understanding working teams containing humans and robots. In particular, this paper introduces the value of tempered anthropomorphism and zoomorphism as processes that support communication between humans and machinelike robots, while also ensuring that a sense of the otherness of the machine and respect for its non-human abilities is retained.

5122,"The Chinese family as instituted fantasy: or, rescuing kinship imaginaries from the 'symbolic'","This article revisits well-travelled ethnographic portrayals of traditional Chinese family dynamics to draw attention to desire as a product of family life and to how crucial elements of family organization and ideology can be understood, in turn, as effects of desire - that is, as instituted fantasies. Although my case in point is the Chinese family, the analysis addresses the category 'family' cross-culturally. In any of its variations, the 'family' exists at two synergistically implicated levels: first, it comprises an important part of the reality into which individuals are socialized; second, it embodies in instituted form individuals' attempts to realize - to bring into being - social arrangements as they would like them to be. In the Chinese case, at least two ironies are embedded in this synergy. First, women are primary producers and reproducers of the family in the 'real world', despite the fact that patriliny as 'instituted fantasy' downplays or veils their agency. Second, the normative subordination of the son to a patriarchal father, expressed and mediated through institutions including ancestor worship and valorization of filial piety, veils a valorizing of the son as agent or protagonist of filial action. Although ultimately unrealizable, patrilineal and familial fantasies animate Chinese family life and are thus an important constituent of Chinese realities. To these ends the analysis re-purposes 'the symbolic' and 'imaginaries', categories widely employed in contemporary gender studies and social theory, arguing that understanding kinship enjoins incorporating desire's role both in defining institutions and in motivating their creators.","Sangren, P.

5123,Where do antipassive constructions come from? A study in diachronic typology,"The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the main sources of anti-passive constructions based on a 120-language sample. The sample includes the 48 languages with an antipassive in the WALS (Polinsky 2013) + 72 further languages in which an antipassive or a functionally equivalent construction is attested (e.g., deobjective constructions, unspecified object constructions, etc.). The diachronic sources of antipassives are identified drawing on two kinds of evidence: (i) etymological reconstructions based on the comparative method; (ii) synchronic resemblance between (some features of) the source construction and (some features of) the target construction. Four main diachronic sources are recurrent in the sample: (i) agent nominalizations; (ii) generic/indefinite items filling the object position (e.g., ""person"" for animate objects, ""(some) thing"" for inanimate objects); (iii) action nominalizations, sometimes accompanied by a light verb like ""do""; and (iv) morphemes encoding reflexive/reciprocal actions. For each of these sources, a diachronic scenario is proposed through which the antipassive construction might have come into existence. The article also explores the hypothesis that at least some of the functional and structural differences among antipassive constructions across languages may be explained by taking into account the diachronic sources of these constructions.","Sanso, A.",0,10.1075/dia.34.2.02san,1825
5124,The Aesthetic Appeal of Prosthetic Limbs and the Uncanny Valley: The Role of Personal Characteristics in Attraction,"The aesthetics of prosthetic design is a field of study which until now has been subject to little investigation, and no research has been attempted before into the relationship of aesthetic attraction to devices and their human-likeness. The main aim of this paper is to explore this issue, testing the existence of a relationship between the Uncanny Valley (UV) (Mori, 1970) and prosthetic devices. The secondary aim is to explore whether or not attraction is related to the personal characteristics of the participants. We employed a cross-sectional questionnaire and involved 114 participants. The results did not demonstrate the existence of the UV for prostheses, as a high level of attraction to realistic devices was recorded; instead the data resulted in an ""N-shaped"" graph, showing only a small dip in attraction in relation to prostheses with human shape but with clear artificial patterns. Visual attraction to non-human-like devices was found, and the discriminating factors included gender and to a lesser extent nationality and the presence of amputation. This paper aims to set the basis for future investigations around the belief that prosthetic designs endorsing certain characteristics may be more suitable for some categories of prosthetic users in order to potentially achieve a greater satisfaction with their prostheses.","Sansoni, S.",0,,1826
5128,,"In recent years, the architectural design process has witnessed a mounting demand for qualified practitioners who can resolve the highly complex social, cultural, technological, and economical issues associated with ‘Sustainability’. Designers are thus faced with wider pallet of challenges, developing conceptual designs that are sustainably effective. Pressure is mounting on educational institutions to prepare architects that are well accustomed to the environmental design concepts and parameters, aiming to reduce the impact on the environment and preserve valuable natural resources to bring the building’s interior to comfortable living conditions. However, architectural education has been notably slow to respond effectively to the requirements introduced by sustainability. Evidently there are a number of pedagogical challenges that clearly impede the consistent endorsement of sustainability in the design curricula and thus hinder any potential values and opportunities that can result from its effective integration. This research project examines these challenges and investigates more into their nature and attributes. Accordingly, it proposes a method that endeavours to overcome the noted challenge and attempts to improve the design students' motivation and acceptance to incorporate sustainability. In essence, this method aims to mould the technical nature of Building Performance Simulation applications into the cognitive design process. In order to achieve this, the proposed method utilizes 3D games technology, incorporating Multi-Agent System and Data Mining techniques, to assist design students in achieving higher levels of motivation, engagement, and comprehension of the environmental design concepts.

5129,,"Protection of data in cloud computing including distributed environments is a critical concern for many enterprises. This study proposes a solution that protects sensitive data outsourced to a cloud throughout their entire life cycle—both in the cloud as well as outside of the cloud (e.g., during transmission to or from the cloud). The solution enhances the existing data protection approach known as Active Bundle scheme, which uses a Trusted Third Party (ABTTP). The Active Data Bundle (ADB) was formerly called an Active Bundle (AB). It is a software construct that encapsulates data, metadata, and a virtual machine (VM). The metadata includes, among other aspects, data access and data privacy policies for the ADB’s data. The VM executes and directs ADB active operations on its sensitive data and metadata, such as enforcement of all ADB policies (included in metadata), integrity self-checking, evaporation (that is, a partial ADB self-destruction), and apoptosis (that is, a complete ADB self-destruction). The current ADB implementation relies on a centralized trusted third party (TTP) server. Using a centralized TTP in ABTTP increases the risks of many attacks, including side channel and correlation attacks. Our solution, known as Active Data Bundle using Secure Multiparty Computation (ADB-SMC), uses: (i) active data bundles (ADBs) for self-protecting data; (ii) ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption for fine-grained access control; (iii) threshold RSA to eliminate the problem posed by centralized TTPs; and (iv) multi-agent systems (MAS) to reduce network traffic and support fault tolerance. We have implemented a prototype of ADB-SMC on five hosts and re-implemented the prototype of ABTTP to record measurements and compare the overhead of the two solutions. The results of performance tests on our ADB-SMC prototype show that the execution time overhead is acceptable. The features that distinguish ADB-SMC comparing to previous ABTTP solutions are: (i) improvement of the creation, dissemination, and trust management of the earlier implementations; (ii) providing higher security and fault tolerance due to eliminating an easy target in the form of a single centralized TTP for key management; (iii) implementing a data access policy to support secure fine-grained access control for ADB data; (iv) protecting against data loss and reducing ADB dissemination overhead in the cloud by using secure ADB backup services; and (v) deploying the solution on multiple hosts using an inter-platform mobility service (IPMS). IPMS is suitable for a distributed environment since it uses a ""one-shot"" migration strategy to transfer data and code every time an agent moves, thus supporting fault-tolerance. Our solution has a significant impact on protecting privacy in clouds and many other distributed systems. The effects are noticeable for an application having, among others, the following needs: (i) full protection of privacy of sensitive data throughout their entire lifecycle; (ii) full protection of privacy of sensitive output data on untrusted hosts; (iii) strong data and IDM (identity management) security in clouds and other distributed computing systems; (iv) fault tolerance; and (v) efficiency due to exploiting parallelism.","Sarhan, Akram Y.",0,,1828
5130,An Arendtian Recognitive Politics: The Right to Have Rights as a Performance of Visibility,"Working with Hannah Arendt's implicit argument about place and visibility, this article develops an account of recognition in order to rethink the nature of community. I argue for an Arendtian recognitive politics, a two-tiered account of recognition, which takes into account social identities as the condition of possibility for the free political action that so animated Arendt. If we require a place to act freely, in other words, we are visible to another in that place. Claims such as Arendt's ""right to have rights"" consequently understate the vital conditions of visibility and the role such visibility plays in the political sphere where agents are recognized as equals. The two-tiered account of recognition developed in this article allows me to argue that (1) the performance of visibility in relation to the recognition of one's social identity is what in turn allows for (2) the possibility of recognizing one's unique political identity in the political space.","Sari, Y.",0,10.5840/philtoday2017105178,1829
5131,Patient Perspectives of Dabigatran: Analysis of Online Discussion Forums,"Background In 2010 the US FDA approved dabigatran, the first new anticoagulant for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) since 1954. To date there is little data that reflects the experiences and perceptions of real-world patients with dabigatran. The abundance of Internet-based discussion forums and support groups related to AF or anticoagulation may provide a low-cost resource for assessing patient experiences. Objective The aim of this study was to determine patient experiences and perceptions regarding dabigatran through qualitative thematic content analysis of comments posted on publicly accessible virtual discussion forums and Internet support groups. Measurements Comments posted between January 2011 and September 2012 were downloaded from websites focusing on support of patients with AF or on anticoagulation therapy. Comments were analyzed for thematic content. Results Five broad thematic categories emerged from the posted comments: general concerns about safety and efficacy, questions about indications and contraindications, questions about proper use and storage, questions about diet and drug restrictions, and experiences with perceived side effects. Our data revealed that a primary concern for patients taking dabigatran is the lack of antidote to reverse the effects of dabigatran if bleeding occurs. Several questions pertaining to the use of dabigatran with other medications or medical conditions were noted, and multiple patients expressed confusion about instructions for using dabigatran before and after medical procedures. An unexpected finding included several criticisms of the medication packaging, which many patients found inconvenient or difficult to open. Finally, several perceived side effects were noted, including some not reported in clinical trials. Conclusions Online communities may provide information about topics that are a concern to patients and that may not be discernible in clinical trials, such as medication side effects, proper use, and safety. Our data also highlighted potential topics that may not be a priority to researchers but are nevertheless important to patients (e.g. medication convenience or packaging). Despite the growing use of online health-related communities, very little research makes use of this low-cost resource for identifying patient interests regarding therapeutic treatments to guide patient-oriented research.","Sarrazin, M.

5136,Avoidance of Novelty Contributes to the Uncanny Valley,"A hypothesis suggests that objects with a high degree of visual similarity to real humans trigger negative impressions (i.e., the uncanny valley). Previous studies have suggested that difficulty in object categorization elicits negative emotional reactions to enable the avoidance of potential threats. The present study further investigated this categorization-difficulty hypothesis. In an experiment, observers categorized morphed images of photographs and human doll faces as ""photograph"" or ""doll"" and evaluated the perceived eeriness of the images. Additionally, we asked the observers to answer questionnaires on behavioral inhibition systems (BIS). The results indicated that individual differences in the BIS score were associated with enhanced eeriness in the objects with a specific human likeness. These findings suggest that the tendency to avoid a potentially threatening novel experience contributes to promoting the perceived eeriness of objects with some degree of visual similarity to real humans.","Sasaki, K.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01792,1831
5139,Trypophobic Discomfort is Spatial-Frequency Dependent,"Clusters of holes, such as those in a lotus seedpod, induce trypophobic discomfort. Previous research has demonstrated that high-contrast energy at midrange spatial frequencies in images causes trypophobic discomfort. The present study examined the effects on discomfort of eliminating various spatial frequency components from the images to reveal how each spatial frequency contributes to the discomfort. Experiment 1 showed that eliminating midrange spatial frequencies did not affect trypophobic discomfort, while Experiment 2 revealed that images of holes that consisted of only high-spatial frequencies evoked less discomfort than other images and that images containing only low or midrange spatial frequencies induced as much trypophobic discomfort as did the original images. Finally, Experiment 3 found that participants with a high level of the trypophobic trait experienced stronger discomfort from the original images and the images containing only low or midrange spatial frequencies than participants with a low level of the trypophobic trait. Our findings thus suggest that trypophobic discomfort can be induced by middle and low spatial frequencies.","Sasaki, K.",0,10.5709/acp-0222-2,1832
5143,Effective task training strategies for human and robot instructors,"From teaching in labs to training for assembly, a role that robots are expected to play is to instruct their users in completing physical tasks. While instruction requires a range of capabilities, such as use of verbal and nonverbal language, a fundamental requirement for an instructional robot is to provide its students with instructions in a way that maximizes their task performance. In this paper, we present an autonomous instructional robot and investigate how different instructional strategies affect user performance and experience. Our analysis of human instructor-trainee interactions identified two key instructional strategies: (1) grouping instructions together and (2) summarizing the outcome of subsequent instructions. We implemented these strategies into a humanlike robot that autonomously instructed its users in a pipe-assembly task. To achieve autonomous instruction, we also developed a repair mechanism that enabled the robot to correct mistakes and misunderstandings. An evaluation of the instructional strategies in a human-robot interaction study showed that employing the grouping strategy resulted in faster task completion and increased rapport with the robot, although it also increased the number of task breakdowns. A comparison of our results with the human instructor-trainee interactions revealed many similarities, areas where our model for robot instructors could be improved, and the nuanced ways in which human instructors use training strategies such as summarization. Our findings offer strong implications for the design of instructional robots and directions of future research.","Sauppe, A.",1,10.1007/s10514-015-9461-0,1833
5145,,"The growing popularity of online virtual communities such as Second Life and ActiveWorlds demands the presence of intelligent agents to assist users in their daily online activities (e.g., exploring, shopping, and socializing). As these virtual environments become more crowded, multiple agents are needed to support the increasing number of users. Multi-agent environments, however, can suffer from the problem of resource competition among agents. It is therefore necessary that agents within multi-agent environments include a coordination mechanism to prevent unrealistic behaviors. Moreover, it is essential that these agents exhibit some form of intelligence, or the ability to learn, to support realism as well as to eliminate the need for developers to write separate scripts for each task the agents are required to perform. This research presents a coordinated reinforcement learning framework which can be used to develop task-oriented intelligent agents in multi-agent virtual environments. The framework contains a combination of a ""next available agent"" coordination model and a reinforcement learning model consisting of existing temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. Furthermore, the framework supports evaluations of reinforcement learning algorithms to determine which methods are best suited for task-oriented intelligent agents in dynamic, multi-agent virtual environments. To assess the effectiveness of the temporal difference reinforcement algorithms used in this study (Q-learning and Sarsa), experiments were conducted that measured an agent's ability to learn three tasks commonly performed by workers in a café environment. These tasks were basic sandwich making (BSM), complex sandwich making (CSM), and dynamic sandwich making (DSM). The BSM task consisted of four steps. The CSM and DSM tasks contained an additional fifth step. The agent learned the BSM and CSM tasks from scratch while the DSM task was learned after the agent became skillful in BSM. The measurements used to evaluate the efficiency of the Q-learning and Sarsa algorithms were the percentage of successful and optimally successful episodes performed by the agent and the average number of time steps taken by the agent to complete a successful episode. The experiments were run using both a fixed (FEP) and variable (VEP) ε-greedy probability rate. Results showed that the Sarsa reinforcement learning algorithm, on average, outperformed the Q-learning algorithm in almost all experiments except when measuring the percentage of successfully completed episodes using FEP for CSM and DSM, in which Sarsa performed almost equally as well as Q-learning. Overall, experiments utilizing VEP resulted in higher percentages of successes and optimal successes, and showed convergence to the optimal policy when measuring the average number of time steps per successful episode.","Sause, William J.",0,,1834
5146,,"Virtual machines provide an economical solution to the problem of underutilized computer hardware by abstracting and leveraging the resources of a physical host, enabling the host to efficiently run multiple virtual machine instances simultaneously. Such virtualization is the basis for cloud computing, in which many different types of computing machines can run economically in a highly virtualized environment. Two or more virtual machines are “co-resident” when they reside on the same physical host. Because cloud computing is becoming ubiquitous, co-residency represents a major security threat and a potential target for malicious attackers. A malicious agent that is able to discover a co-resident virtual machine may then be able to gain unauthorized access to the virtual machine and pilfer data. Only a few techniques are known to detect co-residency. This thesis will focus on one of these techniques, network traffic analysis, because it embodies a very simple principle that can potentially be exploited to detect co-residency. However, while common network protocols are generally invariant, network traffic is dynamic, varying in both time and packet volume, which makes analysis challenging. Further, capturing and parsing network traffic presents an additional challenge. This thesis seeks to address these challenges and develop a tool that models cloud network traffic and employs statistical analysis of network packet data to detect co-residency.","Savage, James A.",0,,1835
5147,,"This thesis offers an ethnography, with both audiovisual and written components, of the virtual places brought into being through the creation and consumption of event videos in a transnational community. It is intended as a contribution to the development of conceptual and methodological frameworks, which will allow anthropological engagements with vernacular audiovisual media that take into account their phenomenological properties as mimetically active assemblages. In San Francisco Tetlanohcan, Mexico, young parents often leave their children behind as they cross the border illegally, heading north to look for work. Event videos, made by videographers at rite of passage ceremonies and sent to the USA, are an important aspect of migrant life. This research draws on thinking in philosophy and film studies to conceptualise these videos as agents in a process of ‘filmic emplacement’ as their production and consumption bring into being imagined places and selves. The project combines methodological approaches borrowed from sensory ethnography with video editing techniques inspired by avant-garde filmmaking, in a dynamic evocation and exploration of these filmic places. Close participation in the creation and consumption of event videos combined with the movement of alternative ‘video messages’ across the border, gave the researcher a sense of these places. Shared screenings of found footage sequences materialised and refined that understanding. By co-opting the aesthetics of popular television, event videos transform that which they depict, bringing into being collectively created and experienced imagined places. This coherent and constant virtual realm allows for the creation and maintenance of kinship and fictive kinship relationships, despite separations over space and time. The video 900,000 Frames Between Us produced as part of this thesis uses the juxtaposition of ontologically diverse images and sounds to provide an audiovisual evocation of this ‘filmic home’. In addition to contributing to the anthropological understanding of San Francisco, this thesis suggests ways in which visual anthropologists might engage with and understand the mediated experiences of others.","Savage, Rebecca",0,,1836
5148,,"Modern search engines have made dramatic progress in answering many user questions, especially about facts, such as those that might be retrieved or directly inferred from a knowledge base. However, many other more complex factual, opinion or advice questions, are still largely beyond the competence of computer systems. For such information needs users still have to dig into the ""10 blue links"" of search results and extract relevant information. As conversational agents become more popular, question answering (QA) systems are increasingly expected to handle such complex questions and provide users with helpful and concise information. In my dissertation I develop new methods to improve the performance of question answering systems for a diverse set of user information needs using various types of user-generated content, such as text documents, community question answering archives, knowledge bases, direct human contributions, and explore the opportunities of conversational settings for information seeking scenarios. To improve factoid question answering I developed techniques for combining information from unstructured, semi-structured and structured data sources. More specifically, I propose a model for relation extraction from question-answer pairs, the Text2KB system for utilizing textual resources to improve knowledge base question answering, and the EviNets neural network framework for joint reasoning using structured and unstructured data sources. Next, I present a non-factoid question answering system, which effectively combines information obtained from question-answer archives, regular web search, and real-time crowdsourcing contributions. Finally, the dissertation describes the findings and insights of three user studies, conducted to look into how people use dialog for information seeking scenarios and how existing commercial products can be improved, e.g., by responding with certain suggestions or clarifications for hard and ambiguous questions. Together, these techniques improve the performance of question answering over a variety of different questions a user might have, increasing the power and breadth of QA systems, and suggest promising directions for improving question answering in a conversational scenario.","Savenkov, Denis",0,,1837

This article draws on historical literature and theories that to date have largely been ignored in order to (re)contextualise two studies that used responsive evaluation to examine the use of pedagogical agents in education. Findings suggest that emotional interactions with pedagogical agents are intrinsic to a user's sense of trust, and that truthfulness, personalisation and emotional engagement are vital when using pedagogical agents to enhance online learning. Such findings need to be considered in the light of ways in which notions of learning are being redefined in the academy and the extent to which new literacies and new technologies are being pedalled as pedagogies in ways that undermine what higher education is, is for, and what learning means.","Savin-Baden, Maggi",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2042753015571835,1838

5157,,"Virtual World (VW) applications are digital 3D-simualtion environments used for military, education, sport and healthcare purposes. In this work, an architecture-inspired method called the Virtual World Applications Design Method (VWADM) is presented for designing such applications. The VWADM combines a generative design grammar (GDG) framework and a generative design agent (GDA) model to form the template of a mechanism that can be used for creating place models of VW applications during the design process. The GDG framework is used to develop GDGs for capturing spatial data that pertains to VW applications, transforming and storing such data and subsequently using it to create placeoriented conceptual models of these applications. In complement, the GDA model is used to develop GDAs for automatically generating physical models of VW applications, whose specifications are derived from the GDGs. The development of the VWADM is grounded in design science research (DSR), which is a research paradigm that provides a set of synthetic and analytical techniques and perspectives for understanding, conducting, evaluating and reporting creative work. DSR involves answering questions that are relevant to human problems through the design of novel and innovative artefacts. The thesis focuses on describing the design of the VWADM, demonstrating its functionality and evaluating its fitness and utility for designing VW applications. Details are presented of software that was developed to establish proof of concept for the VWADM. Through the development of the VWADM, the research establishes (1) a set of modelling concepts that use grammar and rules as the basis for capturing the semantics of the conceptual models of VW applications, (2) a set of visual notations that include basic shapes and symbols, which can be used to present the conceptual models of VW applications to stakeholders for them to manually review, (3) an intelligent component that is used for automatically generating physical models of VW applications and (4) a stepwise process, which involves layout design, object design, navigation design and interaction design and acts as a guide for the process of creating the conceptual and physical models of VW applications. Feedback from developers suggest that the VWADM can provide a significant contribution to automating the process of VW design specifically from the point of view of place-oriented design.

5158,The thing that should not be: predictive coding and the uncanny valley in perceiving human and humanoid robot actions,"Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) repetition suppression, we explored the selectivity of the human action perception system (APS), which consists of temporal, parietal and frontal areas, for the appearance and/or motion of the perceived agent. Participants watched body movements of a human (biological appearance and movement), a robot (mechanical appearance and movement) or an android (biological appearance, mechanical movement). With the exception of extrastriate body area, which showed more suppression for human like appearance, the APS was not selective for appearance or motion per se. Instead, distinctive responses were found to the mismatch between appearance and motion: whereas suppression effects for the human and robot were similar to each other, they were stronger for the android, notably in bilateral anterior intraparietal sulcus, a key node in the APS. These results could reflect increased prediction error as the brain negotiates an agent that appears human, but does not move biologically, and help explain the 'uncanny valley' phenomenon.","Saygin, A.

5163,The role of appearance and motion in action prediction,"We used a novel stimulus set of human and robot actions to explore the role of humanlike appearance and motion in action prediction. Participants viewed videos of familiar actions performed by three agents: human, android and robot, the former two sharing human appearance, the latter two nonhuman motion. In each trial, the video was occluded for 400 ms. Participants were asked to determine whether the action continued coherently (in-time) after occlusion. The timing at which the action continued was early, late, or in-time (100, 700 or 400 ms after the start of occlusion). Task performance interacted with the observed agent. For early continuations, accuracy was highest for human, lowest for robot actions. For late continuations, the pattern was reversed. Both android and human conditions differed significantly from the robot condition. Given the robot and android conditions had the same kinematics, the visual form of the actor appears to affect action prediction. We suggest that the selection of the internal sensorimotor model used for action prediction is influenced by the observed agent's appearance.","Saygin, A. P.",0,10.1007/s00426-012-0426-z,1843
5165,Application of Psychological Theories in Agent-Based Modeling: The Case of the Theory of Planned Behavior,"It is likely that computer simulations will assume a greater role in the next future to investigate and understand reality (Rand & Rust, 2011). Particularly, agent-based models (ABMs) represent a method of investigation of social phenomena that blend the knowledge of social sciences with the advantages of virtual simulations. Within this context, the development of algorithms able to recreate the reasoning engine of autonomous virtual agents represents one of the most fragile aspects and it is indeed crucial to establish such models on well-supported psychological theoretical frameworks. For this reason, the present work discusses the application case of the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) in the context of agent-based modeling: It is argued that this framework might be helpful more than others to develop a valid representation of human behavior in computer simulations. Accordingly, the current contribution considers issues related with the application of the model proposed by the TPB inside computer simulations and suggests potential solutions with the hope to contribute to shorten the distance between the fields of psychology and computer science.","Scalco, A.",0,,1844

Rather, informed by ethnographic data, the Native American abstracted, costumed forms, along with conflated human/animal subjects, define humanity's intimate link to the cosmos, and their added attributes evoke the supernatural strengths of other living beings, along with animated entities such as rain-clouds and the sun. These images themselves are perceived as active agents, attracting the pictured forces, sanctifying place and facilitating communication with resident spirits. What is pictured on stone extends to the performative dimensions of ethnographic contexts, thereby blurring the boundaries between the ceremonial participants, the representations and the animistic cosmos.","Schaafsma, P.",0,10.1017/s0959774317000968,1845

Instead of normal eyes, zombies' eyes are vacantly white, vampires' eyes glow with the color of blood, and those possessed by demons are cavernously black. In the Academy Award winning Pan's Labyrinth, director Guillermo del Toro created the creepiest of all creatures by entirely removing its eyes from its face, placing them instead in the palms of its hands. The unease induced by altering eyes may help to explain the uncanny valley, which is the eeriness of robots that are almost-but not quite-human (Mori, 1970). Much research has explored the uncanny valley, including the research reported by MacDorman & Entezari (in press), which focuses on individual differences that might predict the eeriness of humanlike robots. In their paper, they suggest that a full understanding of this phenomenon needs to synthesize individual differences with features of the robot. One theory that links these two concepts is mind perception, which past research highlights as essential to the uncanny valley (Gray & Wegner, 2012). Mind perception is linked to both individual differences-autism-and to features of the robot-the eyes-and can provide a deeper understanding of this arresting phenomenon. In this paper, we present original data that links uncanniness to the eyes through aberrant perceptions of mind.","Schein, C.",0,10.1075/is.16.2.02sch,1847
5173,,"We present work to transfer decentralized neuromuscular control strategies of human locomotion to powered segmented robotic legs. State-of-the-art robotic locomotion control approaches, like centralized planning and tracking in fully robotic systems and predefined motion pattern replay in prosthetic systems, do not enable the dynamism and reactiveness of able-bodied humans. Animals largely realize dexterous segmented leg performance with leg-encoded biomechanics and local feedback controls that bypass central processing. A decentralized neuromuscular controller was recently developed that enables robust locomotion for a simulated multi-segmented planar humanoid. A portion of this controller was used in an active ankle-foot prosthesis to modulate ankle torque during stance, enabling level and inclined ground walking. While these results suggest that the neuromuscular controller is a promising alternative control method for both fully robotic systems and powered prostheses, it is unclear if the controller can be transferred to multi-segmented robotic legs. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of controlling a multi-segmented robotic leg with the proposed neuromuscular control approach, which may enable robots and powered prostheses to react to locomotion disturbances dynamically and in a human-like way. Specifically, work in this thesis investigates two hypotheses. Hypothesis one posits that the proposed decentralized swing-leg controllers enable more robust foot placements into ground targets than state-of-the-art impedance controls. Hypothesis two posits that neuromuscular swing-leg control enables more human-like motion than state-of-the-art impedance control. To transfer neuromuscular controls to powered segmented robotic legs, we use a model-based design approach. The initial transfer is focused on neuromuscular swing-leg controls, important for maintaining dynamic stability of both fully robotic systems and powered prostheses in the presence of unexpected locomotion disturbances, such as trips and pushes. We first present the design of RNL, a three segment, cable-driven, antagonistically actuated robotic leg with joint compliance. The robot’s size, weight, and actuation capabilities correspond to dynamically scaled human values. Next, a high-fidelity simulation of the robot is created to investigate the feasibility of transferring neuromuscular controls, pre-tune hardware gains via optimization, and serve as a benchmark for hardware experiments. An idealized version of the swing-leg controller with mono-articular actuation, as well as the neuromuscular interpretation of this controller with multi-articular actuation is then transferred to RNL and evaluated with foot placement experiments. The results suggest that the proposed swing-leg controllers can accurately regulate foot placement of robotic legs during undisturbed and disturbed motions. Compared to impedance control, the proposed controls achieve foot placements over a range of ground targets with a single set of gains, which make them attractive candidates for regulating the motion of legged robots and prostheses in the real-world. Furthermore, the ankle trajectory traced out by the robot under neuromuscular control is more human-like than the trajectories traced out under the proposed idealized control and impedance control. In parallel to this control transfer, a synthesis method for creating compact nonlinear springs with user-defined torque-deflection profiles is presented to explore methods for improving RNL’s series elastic actuators. The springs use rubber as their elastic element, which, while enabling a compact spring design, introduce viscoelastic behavior in the spring that needs to be accounted for with additional control. To accurately estimate force developed in the rubber, an empirically characterized constitutive rubber model is developed and integrated into the series elastic actuator controller used by the RNL test platforms.

Using a virtual agent-based testing methodology, a set of 3 studies in 11 countries found that the presentation of the SPR varies depending on where people search for suicide-related information.

Although much of the literature on shared mental models has focused on quantifying the success of teams that can use them effectively, there is little work on the types of data structures and processes that operate on them, which are required to operationalize shared mental models. This paper proposes the first comprehensive formal and computational framework based on results from human teams that can be used to implement shared mental models for artificial virtual and robotic agents. The formal portion of the framework specifies the necessary data structures and representations, whereas the computational framework specifies the necessary computational processes and their interactions to build, update, and maintain shared mental models.

5180,,"How do human brains integrate content with social context in communication? Recent research demonstrates that the perceived communicative embedding of perceptually identical language messages alters their cortical processing. When emotional trait-adjectives are perceived as human-generated personality feedback, event-related brain potentials are considerably larger than when the same adjectives are perceived as random computer-generated feedback. Here, we investigate the unique role of ascribed sender humanness for the underlying neural mechanisms. Participants were told that they were going to receive written positive, negative, or neutral feedback from an unknown stranger or from a socially intelligent computer system while high-density EEG was recorded. In the event-related potential (ERP), feedback from the ‘human sender’ elicited larger P2, Early Posterior Negativity (EPN), P3, and Late Positive Potential (LPP) components. The sources of this activity were localized in extended visual cortex, but also in the right superior frontal gyri, related to mentalizing about others, and the bilateral postcentral gyri implicated in embodied language processing. For emotional feedback, larger EPN, P3 and LPP amplitudes were also observed, resulting from enhanced activity in visual and temporal regions. Finally, for the EPN an interaction between sender and emotion was found, showing substantially increased visual processing of human-generated emotional feedback. These data confirm visual amplification effects induced by motivated attention but crucially also reveal distinct effects of perceiving a communication partner as human that activate ‘social brain’ structures. Obviously who is perceived as saying something can be as relevant as what is said and induce specific brain activity.

5182,Differential effects of face-realism and emotion on event-related brain potentials and their implications for the uncanny valley theory,"Cartoon characters are omnipresent in popular media. While few studies have scientifically investigated their processing, in computer graphics, efforts are made to increase realism. Yet, close approximations of reality have been suggested to evoke sometimes a feeling of eeriness, the ""uncanny valley"" effect. Here, we used high-density electroencephalography to investigate brain responses to professionally stylized happy, angry, and neutral character faces. We employed six face-stylization levels varying from abstract to realistic and investigated the N170, early posterior negativity (EPN), and late positive potential (LPP) event-related components. The face-specific N170 showed a u-shaped modulation, with stronger reactions towards both most abstract and most realistic compared to medium-stylized faces. For abstract faces, N170 was generated more occipitally than for real faces, implying stronger reliance on structural processing. Although emotional faces elicited highest amplitudes on both N170 and EPN, on the N170 realism and expression interacted. Finally, LPP increased linearly with face realism, reflecting activity increase in visual and parietal cortex for more realistic faces. Results reveal differential effects of face stylization on distinct face processing stages and suggest a perceptual basis to the uncanny valley hypothesis. They are discussed in relation to face perception, media design, and computer graphics.","Schindler, S.",0,10.1038/srep45003,1852
5186,,"""Making the Capitalist City: The B&O Railroad and Urban Space in Baltimore, 1827-1877"" is animated by three central concerns: how nineteenth-century Americans imagined, understood, and experienced urban space; how the development of capitalist institutions and ideologies entailed remaking and reconceptualizing geography; and how the boundaries of ""public"" and ""private"" shifted in the nineteenth century. All of these questions come together in a close examination of the relationship between the first railroad in the United States (the Baltimore & Ohio) and its terminal city (Baltimore). Looking at this relationship can help scholars better understand the shaping of the nineteenth-century city, the development of corporate power, and the spatial dynamics of capitalism. Scholars have long recognized the transformative powers of the railroad—its ability to effect what Karl Marx called the ""annihilation of space by time."" Yet explanations of this annihilation typically turn on teleologies of technological development or abstract market processes. In Baltimore, by contrast, the relationship between the railroad and urban space was dialectical—rather than simply ""annihilating"" space, the transformative powers of the railroad developed amidst political conflicts over the use of city streets. Baltimore, as the birthplace of American railroading, was the first city to contend with the railroad's effects on the built environment and saw some of the earliest debates and negotiations over rail policy. Solutions worked out on the ground in Baltimore had implications for cities across the United States. The railroad company laid tracks and ran steam engines through city streets, remaking urban space as a site of mechanized movement. These infrastructural changes not only rearranged the experience of the city, they changed the very meaning of urbanism. Conflicts over the politics and prerogatives of urban movement laid the groundwork for an understanding of commerce that cast cities as places of transit and corporations as the agents of economic competition. Remaking Baltimore in this manner presaged the contemporary spatial logic of globalization, in which multi-national companies claim to transcend geographical boundaries even as they reshape the built environment.","Schley, David H.",0,,1853
5187,,"Comments on the original article by Howard Rachlin (see record 2012-28920-001) regarding Rachlin's two general assertions: (a) ‘‘To be human is to behave as humans behave, and to function in society as humans function,’’ and (b) ‘‘essential human attributes such as consciousness, the ability to love, to feel pain, to sense, to perceive, and to imagine may all be possessed by a computer’’. Although Rachlin’s article is an exercise in speculating about what would make us call a computer human, as he admits, it also allows us to contemplate the question of what makes us human. Even though it may be possible to construct a Watson (Watson II) with attributes that resemble those in humans, the question of whether the resulting computer would be human is moot. A more practical question, as the author suggests, is whether there is any justification to describe Watson II with terms usually occasioned by the behavior of biological organisms, especially humans. But even then, the critical question is: What is to be gained by talking about computers using terms occasioned by humans? It would challenge us to analyze attributes such as perception, imagination, and consciousness into their behavioral atoms and the history of reinforcement necessary to produce them, and then try to build a computer (Watson II) that would interact with its environment such that those repertoires would be differentially selected. If we were successful, would we then call Watson II human? Rachlin’s thesis is that we would. The purpose of this commentary is that such a conclusion is, at the present time, too uncertain, and we would have to wait and see if Watson II would occasion the response ‘‘human.’’ Watson II may be human-like in some very important ways. Regardless, the questions posed by Rachlin should help to pave the way for thinking about how to construct a computer that is most human-like. Rachlin is correct that, in order to do so, the computer must function like a human in a human environment. However, some of the so-called human functions mentioned by Rachlin (e.g., sensation and perception) are also possessed by other animals. The most important considerations in going forward with designing human-like computers is to build them with the ability for their ‘‘behavior’’ to be adaptive and then see what happens.

5188,"Domain-specific perceptual causality in children depends on the spatio-temporal configuration, not motion onset","Humans, even babies, perceive causality when one shape moves briefly and linearly after another. Motion timing is crucial in this and causal impressions disappear with short delays between motions. However, the role of temporal information is more complex: it is both a cue to causality and a factor that constrains processing. It affects ability to distinguish causality from non causality, and social from mechanical causality. Here we study both issues with 3- to 7-year-olds and adults who saw two computer-animated squares and chose if a picture of mechanical, social or non-causality fit each event best. Prior work fit with the standard view that early in development, the distinction between the social and physical domains depends mainly on whether or not the agents make contact, and that this reflects concern with domain specific motion onset, in particular, whether the motion is self-initiated or not. The present experiments challenge both parts of this position. In Experiments 1 and 2, we showed that not lust spatial, but also animacy and temporal information affect how children distinguish between physical and social causality. In Experiments 3 and 4 we showed that children do not seem to use spatio-temporal information in perceptual causality to make inferences about self- or other-initiated motion onset. Overall, spatial contact may be developmentally primary in domain-specific perceptual causality in that it is processed easily and is dominant over competing cues, but it is not the only cue used early on and it is not used to infer motion onset. Instead, domain-specific causal impressions may be automatic reactions to specific perceptual configurations, with a complex role for temporal information.","Schlottmann, A.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00365,1855
5192,Time and temperature sensitivity of the Hybrid III neck,"The Hybrid III (HIII) dummy is one of the most widely used anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) in the world, and researchers have found a variety of uses for it outside of its original purpose as an automotive crash test dummy. These expanded roles have introduced situations outside the dummy's original design parameters, where a number of tests must be run in relatively rapid succession or where it may not be possible to control the temperature of the test environment.Objective: This study has 2 aims. The first is to determine how the duration of the time interval between tests affects the axial compression performance of the HIII neck. The second is to quantify the effect of temperature on the neck's compressive stiffness through a range of temperatures relevant to indoor or outdoor testing.Methods: To characterize the effects of different test conditions, a series of high-rate axial compressive tests was run on a 50th percentile male HIII neck component in a materials testing machine. Between-test recovery intervals were varied from 2h to 1min, and temperature conditions of 0, 12.5, 25, and 37.5 degrees C were tested.Results: Though the duration of the recovery interval had little impact on the recorded force (less than 1%), the component did exhibit considerable strain creep over the course of the test. Temperature had a strong influence on the compressive stiffness of the component. Compared to the stiffness at 25 degrees C (near room temperature), the stiffness of the neck at 37.5 degrees C fell by 15%; at 0 degrees C, the stiffness more than doubled.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that though the duration of the recovery interval between tests has a small influence on neck stiffness, temperature effects should not be overlooked because they influence neck compressive stiffness considerably. The relationship between recorded force and temperature is well represented by exponential decay models. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring and controlling for temperature effects during all HIII testing.","Schmidt, A. L.",0,10.1080/15389588.2018.1480832,1856
5197,Mind your Ps and Qs! How polite instructions affect learning with multimedia,"The present study examined the role of politeness in instructions during learning with a multimedia web page. By incorporating former studies of the politeness effect, this study provides new insights into a possible operationalization of politeness for instructional messages. Based on a two-sided view (direct vs. polite), one hundred and twenty German upper secondary school students learned all about attribution theories while clicking through a learning web page where only instructional pages differed. The students were randomly assigned to one cell of a 2 (direct vs. polite) x 2 (on-screen vs. auditory) between-subjects factorial design. Results confirm the politeness effect for retention and transfer performances, showing large effect sizes. Students reported significantly higher scores on interest, probability of success, and learning assistance in the polite treatment group while scores on directness, restriction of freedom, extraneous cognitive load, and mental effort are significantly lower, however, no interaction was found for modality and politeness. Additionally, polite variations were not assessed as social cues. For this, a new term of cultural cues in multimedia learning is proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Considered individually, folk biological categories, biological anomalies and monsters, as well as human categories represent individual cultural products of human categorization. Instead, we suggest that the uncanny valley might reflect a primary response to unfamiliar or covert categories. In the absence of having prior knowledge of an individual or group, the relative distinctiveness of a category, due to a lower frequency of exposure, will produce negative affect—an inversion of the mere-exposure effect. The deceptive simplicity of learning mechanisms can lead to important individual and social consequences. If the uncanny valley and its relation to negative affect is a result of frequency of exposure, then its amelioration can be facilitated by increasing the frequency of the target stimuli within the environment. The few studies that have considered the relationship between familiarity, discriminability, and affect need to be complimented with more research that systematically manipulates the features of the ontological categories used for comparison.

5205,An Empirical Study of a Pedagogical Agent as an Adjunct to an eHealth Self-Management Intervention: What Modalities Does It Need to Successfully Support and Motivate Users?,"Prior research has shown that the more patients know about their disease, health, and lifestyle the better the health outcomes are. Patients who are suffering from either a physical disease with mental consequences or from mental illnesses can contribute to their own feeling of mental well-being by following evidence-based online, self-guided therapeutic interventions. These self-guided therapeutic interventions during which there is no contact with a care provider have shown high effectiveness. However, users (patients) of self-guided eHealth interventions have difficulties fulfilling the entire trajectory as is mirrored in high non-adherence rates. Users have reported a need for support, that is traditionally provided by human care providers. This study investigates the opportunities from within the technology to increase its support level toward the user. We deployed a pedagogical agent acting as an adjunct to a self-guided positive psychology psycho-education intervention. This agent provided instructions and user support in between and explicitly not during the online learning modules as to mitigate the risk of distraction. By setting up a between-subjects design and deploying three versions of a pedagogical agent (also known as Embodied Conversational Agent), varying the features of animation, speech, and visibility we investigated whether users felt more supported than by a fourth text-only control condition. All four conditions provided similar task-related support and emotion-related support to the user. Our results showed that our pedagogical agent made users feel guided and supported with respect to fulfilling their tasks. However, no effects were found of emotion-related support resulting in higher user motivation and an improved learning experience. Significant effects of visibility and voice were found, but animation of our pedagogical agent had no effect. On the feedback outcome variable, we found a gender effect. Male participants graded the visible Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) higher than female participants and graded the non-visible ECA lower than female participants. In our view, ECA's should not necessarily be deployed with the ambition to compete with the profound human potential to deliver support and guidance. Exploring ECA capabilities merits further attention, from the stance that the technology itself can support users and potentially make them adhere.","Scholten, M. R.",1,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01063,1860
5208,,"Background: Web-based mental health interventions have evolved from innovative prototypes to evidence-based and clinically applied solutions for mental diseases such as depression and anxiety. Open-access, self-guided types of these solutions hold the promise of reaching and treating a large population at a reasonable cost. However, a considerable factor that currently hinders the effectiveness of these self-guided Web-based interventions is the high level of nonadherence. The absence of a human caregiver apparently has a negative effect on user adherence. It is unknown to what extent this human support can be handed over to the technology of the intervention to mitigate this negative effect. Objective: The first objective of this paper was to explore what is known in literature about what support a user needs to stay motivated and engaged in an electronic health (eHealth) intervention that requires repeated use. The second objective was to explore the current potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to provide this support. Methods: This study reviews and interprets the available literature on (1) support within eHealth interventions that require repeated use and (2) the potential of ECAs by means of a scoping review. The rationale for choosing a scoping review is that the subject is broad, diverse, and largely unexplored. Themes for (1) and (2) were proposed based on grounded theory and mapped on each other to find relationships. Results: The results of the first part of this study suggest the presence of user needs that largely remain implicit and unaddressed. These support needs can be categorized as task-related support and emotion-related support. The results of the second part of this study suggest that ECAs are capable of engaging and motivating users of information technology applications in the domains of learning and behavioral change. Longitudinal studies must be conducted to determine under what circumstances ECAs can create and maintain a productive user relationship. Mapping the user needs on the ECAs’ capabilities suggests that different kinds of ECAs may provide different solutions for improving the adherence levels. Conclusions: Autonomous ECAs that do not respond to a user’s expressed emotion in real time but take on empathic roles may be sufficient to motivate users to some extent. It is unclear whether those types of ECAs are competent enough and create sufficient believability among users to address the user’s deeper needs for support and empathy. Responsive ECAs may offer a better solution. However, at present, most of these ECAs have difficulties to assess a user’s emotional state in real time during an open dialogue. By conducting future research with relationship theory–based ECAs, the added value of ECAs toward user needs can be better understood.

Participants from a community sample (N?=?422; mean age?=?29 years; mean relationship duration?=?4.8 years) encountered three attachment-related key scenes in a VSE: a separation with a subsequent reunion, a conflict, and an illness. In these scenarios, participants gave instructions to the main character (the protagonist), who had a romantic relationship with one of the other agents (the virtual spouse). Recorded were numerous behaviors as well as emotions participants ascribed to the protagonist. Generally, participants' attachment styles correlated as predicted with their behavior toward the virtual spouse, with beta s up to.42. Thus, the study demonstrates that internal working models are transferred to the virtual relationship. This approach opens new ways to investigate attachment-related behavior by using VSEs that allow experimental variations of the virtual partner's reactions and other situational variables.","Schonbrodt, F.

Several knowledge gaps are identified: motivational interviewing and small talk must be translated to control rules for this coach, a formal model of participant emotional states is needed to allow the coach to parse the learner's emotional state, and various sensors must be used to let the coach detect and act on this state. We use the situated Cognitive Engineering (sCE) method to update an existing foundation of knowledge with emotional models, motivational interviewing, and small talk theory, technology, and a new exercise in the volunteer work domain. We use this foundation to create a design specification for an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) coach that provides cognitive, affective, and social learning support for this exercise. A prototype is created, and compared to a prototype that only provides cognitive support in a within-and between-subjects experiment. Results show that both prototypes work as expected: learners interact with the coach and complete all exercises. Almost no significant differences are found between the two prototypes, indicating that the affective and social support were not effective as designed. Potential improvements are provided for future work. Results also show significant differences between two subgroups of low-literate participants, and between men and women, reinforcing the importance of using individualized support measures with this demographic.","Schouten, D.

Since the virtual world created by this game is formulated around of a series of events, the five elements of dramatistic theory – act, agent, agency, purpose and scene – are also present in the medium. In this paper, the game is broken down along the lines of each of the five pentadic elements. These elements are then used to build a chart that defines the descriptive grammar of this game. Based on this information the most influential and dominant ratios between the elements are defined. It is argued that the most dominant pentadic element in FFXIV:ARR is purpose. This causes all the other dramatistic elements to become subordinate. The designers of this game use the economy of the virtual world to give purpose to the arguments the game presents to the player.","Schricker, Michael",0,,1864
5219,Building Autonomous Sensitive Artificial Listeners,"This paper describes a substantial effort to build a real-time interactive multimodal dialogue system with a focus on emotional and nonverbal interaction capabilities. The work is motivated by the aim to provide technology with competences in perceiving and producing the emotional and nonverbal behaviors required to sustain a conversational dialogue. We present the Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL) scenario as a setting which seems particularly suited for the study of emotional and nonverbal behavior since it requires only very limited verbal understanding on the part of the machine. This scenario allows us to concentrate on nonverbal capabilities without having to address at the same time the challenges of spoken language understanding, task modeling, etc. We first report on three prototype versions of the SAL scenario in which the behavior of the Sensitive Artificial Listener characters was determined by a human operator. These prototypes served the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of the SAL scenario and allowed us to collect data required for building system components for analyzing and synthesizing the respective behaviors. We then describe the fully autonomous integrated real-time system we created, which combines incremental analysis of user behavior, dialogue management, and synthesis of speaker and listener behavior of a SAL character displayed as a virtual agent. We discuss principles that should underlie the evaluation of SAL-type systems. Since the system is designed for modularity and reuse and since it is publicly available, the SAL system has potential as a joint research tool in the affective computing research community.","Schroder, M.",0,10.1109/t-affc.2011.34,1865
5234,Mistaking Minds and Machines: How Speech Affects Dehumanization and Anthropomorphism,"Treating a human mind like a machine is an essential component of dehumanization, whereas attributing a humanlike mind to a machine is an essential component of anthropomorphism. Here we tested how a cue closely connected to a person's actual mental experience-a humanlike voice-affects the likelihood of mistaking a person for a machine, or a machine for a person. We predicted that paralinguistic cues in speech are particularly likely to convey the presence of a humanlike mind, such that removing voice from communication (leaving only text) would increase the likelihood of mistaking the text's creator for a machine. Conversely, adding voice to a computer-generated script (resulting in speech) would increase the likelihood of mistaking the text's creator for a human. Four experiments confirmed these hypotheses, demonstrating that people are more likely to infer a human (vs. computer) creator when they hear a voice expressing thoughts than when they read the same thoughts in text. Adding human visual cues to text (i.e., seeing a person perform a script in a subtitled video clip), did not increase the likelihood of inferring a human creator compared with only reading text, suggesting that defining features of personhood may be conveyed more clearly in speech (Experiments 1 and 2). Removing the naturalistic paralinguistic cues that convey humanlike capacity for thinking and feeling, such as varied pace and intonation, eliminates the humanizing effect of speech (Experiment 4). We discuss implications for dehumanizing others through text-based media, and for anthropomorphizing machines through speech-based media.","Schroeder, J.",0,10.1037/xge0000214,1866

In this study, the influence of a pedagogical agent's presence in an instructional video was compared to a video that did not contain a pedagogical agent. The results indicated no significant differences on a multiple choice learning outcome measure or on a perceived mental effort measure that was rated both after the instructional sequence and after completion of the post-test. In addition, no significant differences were found between groups in relation to their training efficiency or instructional efficiency.

Pedagogical agents have shown promise for improving learning and connections with learning materials within video-based instruction, and research has shown that agent design choices can influence how agents are perceived by learners. However, it is unclear the effect that the pacing of the video could have on the way the agent is perceived by the learner. The pacing of the learning environment refers to the amount of control a learner has over their learning experience. The question of how much control to provide the learner, in what situations, and for whom, is a persisting question in the literature. Using a three-group randomized experimental procedure, our analyses revealed that providing the learners with increased control of their learning experience was not associated with more positive perceptions of the agent. These results, although preliminary due to the dearth of literature in the area, suggest that learner control may not be an important factor in how pedagogical agents are perceived.","Schroeder, N.

Researchers are beginning to understand the conditions in which pedagogical agents can enhance learning, but many questions still remain. Namely, the field has few options in terms of measurement instruments, and limited research has investigated the influence of pedagogical agent persona, or the way the agent is perceived by students, on learning outcomes. In this study, we re-examine the Agent Persona Instrument (API) using confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch methods. We then examine the influence of agent persona on learning outcomes using path analysis. The results confirmed the four factor structure of the instrument, and the fit of items with the Rasch model demonstrates construct validity in our context. However, the analyses indicated that revisions to the instrument are warranted. The path analysis revealed that affective interaction significantly influenced information usefulness variables, however perceptions measured by the API had no significant impact on learning outcomes. Suggestions for revising the API are provided. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Schroeder, N. L.",0,10.1016/j.compedu.2017.02.015,1873

In this classroom-based study, we used a two group randomized experimental design to examine the efficacy of an instructional video that incorporates a human hand demonstrating and modeling how to solve frictional inclined plane problems compared to an identical video that did not include the human hand. The results show that the learners who viewed the video without the human hand present performed significantly better on a learning test and experienced a significantly better training efficiency than the learners who viewed the video with the human hand present. Meanwhile, those who learned with the human hand present in the instructional video rated the instructor as being more humanlike and engaging. The results have implications for both theory and practice. Implications for those designing instructional videos are discussed, as well as the limitations of the current study.","Schroeder, N.

5254,The influence of learners' perceptions of virtual humans on learning transfer,"Virtual humans are often integrated into novel multimedia learning environments. However, little is known about learner's perceptions of the agents or the relationship between the perceptions and learning. In this study, the authors revise the Agent Persona Instrument, a measurement tool designed to examine how learners perceive pedagogical agents. The factor structure of the revised instrument was evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. Next, k-means clustering was used to examine how participants' ratings on the instrument cluster into groups based on their perceptions of the virtual human. After describing the qualities of the clusters within the data, linear regression was used to examine to what extent the cluster membership influenced participant's scores on a transfer test of learning. The results indicated that cluster membership only explained a small amount of variance in transfer test scores. This study provides a revised instrument for measuring pedagogical agent persona. It implemented a novel method for investigating perceptions of pedagogical agents using k-means clustering which was able to identify two unique groups of participants based on their perceptions of the agent. Finally, it presents empirical results indicating that learner's perceptions of the agent had a small influence on their learning outcome scores.","Schroeder, N.

5259,,"Virtual humans and other virtual agents are becoming more common in our everyday lives. Whether in the form of phone-based personal assistants or automated customer service systems, these technologies have begun to touch more of our activities. This research aims to understand how this technology affects the way we interact with our computer systems. Using a chat bot, I studied the way a conversational computer system affects the way people interact with and perceive automated interviewing systems in two different contexts. Study 1 examines the impact of a conversational agent on behavior during deception. It found that a conversational agent can have a powerful impact on people's perception of the system, resulting in individuals viewing the system as much more engaging and human. The conversational agent further results in a suppression of deception-related cues consistent with a more human-like interaction. Study 2 focuses on the effect of a conversational agent on socially desirable responding. Results of this study indicate that a conversational agent increases social desirability when the topic of the interview is sensitive, but has no effect when the questions are non-sensitive. The results of these two studies indicate that a conversational agent can change the way people interact with a computer system in substantial and meaningful ways. These studies represent a step toward understanding how conversational agents can shape the way we view and interact with computers.","Schuetzler, Ryan M.",0,,1876
5260,The influence of conversational agent embodiment and conversational relevance on socially desirable responding,"Conversational agents (CM) are becoming an increasingly common component in a wide range of information systems. A great deal of research to date has focused on enhancing traits that make CM more humanlike. However, few studies have examined the influence such traits have on information disclosure. This research builds on self-disclosure, social desirability, and social presence theories to explain how CA anthropomorphism affects disclosure of personally sensitive information. Taken together, these theories suggest that as CM become more humanlike, the social desirability of user responses will increase. In this study, we use a laboratory experiment to examine the influence of two elements of CA design-conversational relevance and embodiment on the answers people give in response to sensitive and non-sensitive questions. We compare the responses given to various CM to those given in a face-to-face interview and an online survey. The results show that for sensitive questions, CAs with better conversational abilities elicit more socially desirable responses from participants, with a less significant effect found for embodiment. These results suggest that for applications where eliciting honest answers to sensitive questions is important, CAs that are ""better"" in terms of humanlike realism may not be better for eliciting truthful responses to sensitive questions.","Schuetzler, R.

5264,The effect of conversational agent skill on user behavior during deception,"Conversational agents (CM) are an integral component of many personal and business interactions. Many recent advancements in CA technology have attempted to make these interactions more natural and human-like. However, it is currently unclear how human-like traits in a CA impact the way users respond to questions from the CA. In some applications where CAs may be used, detecting deception is important. Design elements that make CA interactions more human-like may induce undesired strategic behaviors from human deceivers to mask their deception. To better understand this interaction, this research investigates the effect of conversational skill-that is, the ability of the CA to mimic human conversation-from CAs on behavioral indicators of deception. Our results show that cues of deception vary depending on CA conversational skill, and that increased conversational skill leads to users engaging in strategic behaviors that are detrimental to deception detection. This fading suggests that for applications in which it is desirable to detect when individuals are lying, the pursuit of more human-like interactions may be counter-productive.","Schuetzler, R.

5267,,"An Embodied Conversation Agent (ECA) is a computer interface designed to simulate human face-to-face conversation with its users, through the production of synthesized or prerecorded speech combined with an humanoid embodiment: a representation, either physical or visual, of a body capable of producing some portion of the nonverbal behaviors associated with speech, such as mouth movements, eye movements, head movements, hand gestures, facial expressions, and body posture. A key research problem in the design and implementation of realistic ECAs is generating the range of verbal and nonverbal behavior present in human conversation with appropriate frequency, timing, and quality. ECAs have been used in a variety of applications, motivated by their potential to leverage the affordances of face-to-face conversation to build trust and engagement with users, and their learnability given their use of universally understood communicative cues. Many applications, including education and counseling, are examples of long-term interaction; where an effective agent must have many conversations, over a long period of time, while building rapport with its users. However, prior work on realistic conversational behavior for ECAs has focused heavily on single conversations, isolated from any larger context. To the extent that human conversational behavior is not fixed and unchanging across multiple conversations with the same conversation partner, this approach risks producing ECAs with behavior that becomes increasingly unrealistic in long-term interaction. In this thesis, I present an approach to designing ECAs with realistic verbal and nonverbal behavior in long-term interaction. Based on a longitudinal corpus of health behavior change counseling dialogue, containing multiple conversations between several counselor-client dyads, I construct a series of statistical models demonstrating systematic changes in human conversational behavior across multiple conversations; these changes are predicted both by the interaction history of a dyad, and by the strength or quality of their interpersonal relationship. Based on these findings, I present a model and implementation of verbal and nonverbal behavior generation for ECAs which reproduces some of the observed behavior patterns. Finally, I present a longitudinal randomized controlled evaluation study demonstrating that the resulting model of behavior generation, implemented in an ECA that acts as a virtual health behavior change counselor, produces measurable improvements in user-agent interpersonal bond in long-term interaction.","Schulman, Daniel",0,,1879
5268,,"The advent of faculty development centers that focus on the improvement of teaching skills and better understanding of student learning concepts dates back to the 1960s. These centers were initiated from a realization that the effectiveness of a faculty member resulted from growth and maturity over time and that certain support systems were necessary for this evolution to take place. Teaching and Learning Centers (TLCs) have traditionally focused on direct contact with faculty in an effort to improve teaching skills and transfer knowledge about student learning. TLCs have been charged with keeping up with the latest teaching trends and acting as a catalyst to bring about needed change, moving the faculty and the institution from old pedagogical models to new ones. Over a fifty-year time span, TLCs on college campuses have grown in total number. However, some centers have disappeared due to budget cuts, while others have been changed to reflect different visions and missions. For TLCs to survive and prosper in the changing higher education environment, it is important for them to identify and promote the ""value"" they provide to various stakeholders. This article examines the nature of that value and focuses on a concept borrowed from the business world, specifically, ""cocreation of value"" (CCV). By having a better understanding of value and how to cocreate it with various stakeholder groups, it is argued that TLCs can best deliver on their promise of helping the maturation process of faculty and realize their potential to serve as needed agents of change in higher education.","Schumann, David W.",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tl.20043,1880
5271,How Cognitive Models of Human Body Experience Might Push Robotics,"In the last decades, cognitive models of multisensory integration in human beings have been developed and applied to model human body experience. Recent research indicates that Bayesian and connectionist models might push developments in various branches of robotics: assistive robotic devices might adapt to their human users aiming at increased device embodiment, e.g., in prosthetics, and humanoid robots could be endowed with human-like capabilities regarding their surrounding space, e.g., by keeping safe or socially appropriate distances to other agents. In this perspective paper, we review cognitive models that aim to approximate the process of human sensorimotor behavior generation, discuss their challenges and potentials in robotics, and give an overview of existing approaches. While model accuracy is still subject to improvement, human-inspired cognitive models support the understanding of how the modulating factors of human body experience are blended. Implementing the resulting insights in adaptive and learning control algorithms could help to taylor assistive devices to their user's individual body experience. Humanoid robots who develop their own body schema could consider this body knowledge in control and learn to optimize their physical interaction with humans and their environment. Cognitive body experience models should be improved in accuracy and online capabilities to achieve these ambitious goals, which would foster human-centered directions in various fields of robotics.","Schurmann, T.",0,10.3389/fnbot.2019.00014,1881
5275,,"Nearly one in three students in the United States today is negatively impacted by bullying. Teachers can play a critical role in stopping bullying-related violence, but many struggle with how to engage students in difficult conversations. Traditional classroom-based pedagogy used to teach communication skills (e.g., modeling & role-play) is inefficient and limited in scope. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have resulted in the development of virtual pedagogical agents designed to simulate authentic conversations and can be leveraged to teach vital communication skills. This exploratory study examines the effectiveness of a ""virtual role-play"" (VRP) tool developed to help teacher candidates effectively respond to classroom bullying by providing them with opportunities to engage in repeated, authentic practice conversations. We hypothesized that practice in simulated conversations provided by VRP would improve teacher candidates' communication skills by improving their fluency in responding to classroom bullying. Our findings revealed that the repeated practice afforded by VRP improved candidates' fluency by helping them focus on more refined word choice, reducing their reliance on written notes, and improving their nonverbal skills. Implications regarding use of VRP to prepare candidates to communicate in bullying situations are discussed.","Schussler, Deborah",0,,1882

For sensorimotor recruitment, we tested having toddlers use dolls as agents and compared this strategy with having toddlers observe another person enact verbs with dolls. For comparison learning, we compared providing pairs of: (a) training scenes in which animate objects with similar body-shapes maintained agent/patient roles with (b) scenes in which objects with dissimilar body-shapes switched agent/patient roles.

5287,Is there an uncanny valley of virtual animals? A quantitative and qualitative investigation,"Approaching a high degree of realism, android robots, and virtual humans may evoke uncomfortable feelings. Due to technologies that increase the realism of human replicas, this phenomenon, which is known as the uncanny valley, has been frequently highlighted in recent years by researchers from various fields. Although virtual animals play an important role in video games and entertainment, the question whether there is also an uncanny valley for virtual animals has been little investigated. This paper examines whether very realistic virtual pets tend to cause a similar aversion as humanlike characters. We conducted two empirical studies using cat renderings to investigate the effects of realism, stylization, and facial expressions of virtual cats on human perception. Through qualitative feedback, we gained deeper insight into the perception of realistic computer-generated animals. Our results indicate that depicting virtual animal-like characters at realism levels used in current video games causes negative reactions just as the uncanny valley predicts for humanlike characters. We conclude design implication to avoid that sensation and suggest that virtual animals should either be given a completely natural or a stylized appearance. We propose to further examine the uncanny valley by the inclusion of artificial animals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Schwind, V.",0,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.11.003,1885
5292,,"This thesis has made advances in Distributed Self-Healing Security Systems (DSHSS) -- a tool for the future to defend against the problems faced by industrial automation computer networks, such as critical national infrastructure (CNI), Industrial Control System (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), caused by computer malware and cyber attacks (Ch.2). Based on principles of an holistic view of the biological immune system (Ch.3) and recent Artificial Immune System (AIS) research (Ch.4), CARDINAL-Vanilla -- a self-healing and collaborative host-based security architecture has been designed (Ch.5) for application into real-world ICS and SCADA networks. Using a novel evaluation framework for DSHSS (Ch.6) the architecture has been assessed by 'immunisation rate' scores, to measure self-healing performance and resource feasibility, under rigorous virtual and real-world enterprise networks experiment conditions. These empirical studies (Ch.7 and Ch.8) identified that the CARDINAL-Vanilla module dispatch algorithm scores significantly worse than a near-optimal engineered dispatch algorithm; however the performance score difference is not important for a real-life application. In addition, the engineered dispatch algorithm is impossible to apply directly to real-world systems. The dispatch heuristics of CARDINAL-Vanilla are interesting to apply if the mult-agent system architecture's memory overhead can be reduced to and modelled as mathematical approximate equations. A comprehensive theoretical DSHSS architecture (Ch.9) to address the cyber attack problems identified (Ch.2) using a reinforcement classification pipeline, role switching and additional hardware to integrate into industrial networks is proposed as the future theme for DSHSS.","Scully, Peter Matthew David",0,,1886
5293,Changing stigmatizing attitudes to mental health via education and contact with embodied conversational agents,"Educating society concerning stigmatized conditions, such as the eating disorder Anorexia Nervosa (AN), aims to change attitudes that will encourage individuals with AN to recognize their condition and decide to seek help. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) may play an important role in bringing about changes in attitude and behavior because they potentially allow tailored but anonymous, free and convenient access and can deliver the information in a conversational way that overcomes health literacy barriers. In this first study we compare the use of an ECA with a video to deliver two strategies (education and contact) to address stigma around the mental health condition of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Our results with 245 participants show that both media (ECA and video) aided recognition of AN and produced significant changes in positive volitional stigma and negative volitional stigma but not in traditional stigma (desire for social distance), with some notable differences based on gender. Baseline data was used in place of a control group and the sample population was undergraduate Psychology students due to higher incidences of AN in this population. Further validation is needed involving a control group and testing on populations other than Psychology students. Nevertheless, these initial results encourage our future work to build tailored ECAs to challenge particular beliefs to support a wide range of educational interventions to change behaviors and improve decision-making relating to health and wellbeing.

5295,How do facilitation interventions foster learning? The role of evaluation and coordination as causal mediators in idea convergence,"Teams need to co-construct meaning to establish shared understanding of crowdsourced ideas. This is challenging because team members are often faced with an excessive amount of ideas, they have no access to the ideator to clarify ideas, have limited meeting duration, and do not necessarily share a common working history. Facilitation interventions can aid the co-construction of meaning. However, it is uncertain if facilitation interventions that were successful in traditional convergence settings can be applied to convergence with crowdsourced ideas and what mechanisms can explain the positive association between facilitation interventions and co-creation of meaning. In this study, I tested three facilitation techniques and the mediating role of evaluation and coordination in a laboratory experiment involving 199 participants. The participants were given an IT-supported convergence task with crowdsourced ideas. The findings show that facilitated teams receiving high attention guidance and discussion encouragement outperform non-facilitated teams and that evaluation and coordination are the mechanisms through which these effects come about. The findings are beneficial for the design of conversational agents in convergence settings and for team leaders who want to establish shared understanding in convergence settings with crowdsourced ideas.","Seeber, I.",1,10.1016/j.chb.2018.11.033,1888
5296,,"This study aims to advance learning outdoors with mobile devices. As part of the ongoing Tree Investigators design-based research study, this research investigated a mobile application to support observation, identification, and explanation of the tree life cycle within an authentic, outdoor setting. Recognizing the scientific and conceptual complexity of this topic for young children, the design incorporated technological and design scaffolds within a narrative-based learning environment. In an effort to support learning, 14 participants (aged 5-9) were guided through the mobile app on tree life cycles by a comic-strip pedagogical agent, “Nutty the Squirrel”, as they looked to explore and understand through guided observational practices and artifact creation tasks. In comparison to previous iterations of this DBR study, the overall patterns of talk found in this study were similar, with perceptual and conceptual talk being the first and second most frequently coded categories, respectively. However, this study coded considerably more instances of affective talk. This finding of the higher frequency of affective talk could possibly be explained by the relatively younger age of this iteration’s participants, in conjunction with the introduced pedagogical agent, who elicited playfulness and delight from the children. The results also indicated a significant improvement when comparing the pretest results (mean score of .86) with the posttest results (mean score of 4.07, out of 5). Learners were not only able to recall the phases of a tree life cycle, but list them in the correct order. The comparison reports a significant increase, showing evidence of increased knowledge and appropriation of scientific vocabulary. The finding suggests the narrative was effective in structuring the complex material into a story for sense making. Future research with narratives should consider a design to promote learner agency through more interactions with the pedagogical agent and a conditional branching scenario framework to further evoke interest and engagement.","Seely, Brian J.",1,,1889
5297,The effect of contextualized conversational feedback in a complex open-ended learning environment,"Betty's Brain is an open-ended learning environment in which students learn about science topics by teaching a virtual agent named Betty through the construction of a visual causal map that represents the relevant science phenomena. The task is complex, and success requires the use of metacognitive strategies that support knowledge acquisition, causal map construction, and progress monitoring. Previous research has established that middle school students struggle at such tasks without proper scaffolding and feedback. In Betty's Brain, this feedback is provided by Betty and Mr. Davis, another virtual agent designed to provide guidance and suggestions as students work. This paper discusses our implementation of contextualized conversational (CC) feedback, and then presents the results of an experimental study exploring the effects of this feedback in two 8th-grade science classrooms. The results illustrate some advantages of the CC feedback in comparison with a baseline dialogue mechanism that presents similar strategies in a non-conversational, non-contextualized form. While both groups showed significant pre-to-post test learning gains, the difference in learning gains between the groups was not statistically significant. However, students who received CC feedback more often performed actions in accordance with the advised strategies, and they created higher quality causal maps.","Segedy, J.

5300,,"Today, the Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most important emerging technologies. Applicable to several fields, it has the potential to strongly influence people’s lives. “Things” are mostly embedded machines, and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications are used to exchange information. The main aspect of this type of communication is that a “thing” needs a mechanism to uniquely identify other “things” without human intervention. For this purpose, trust plays a key role. Trust can be incorporated in the smartness of “things” by using mobile “agents”. From the study of the IoT ecosystem, a new threat against M2M communications has been identified. This relates to the opportunity for an attacker to employ several forged IoT-embedded machines that can be used to launch attacks. Two “things-aware” detection mechanisms have been proposed and evaluated in this work for incorporation into IoT mobile trust agents. These new mechanisms are based on observing specific thing-related behaviour obtained by using a characterisation algorithm. The first mechanism uses a range of behaviours obtained from real embedded machines, such as threshold values, to detect whether a target machine is forged. This detection mechanism is called machine emulation detection algorithm (MEDA). MEDA takes around 3 minutes to achieve a detection accuracy of 79.21%, with 44.55% of real embedded machines labelled as belonging to forged embedded machines. These results indicated a need to develop a more accurate and faster detection method. Therefore, a second mechanism was created and evaluated. A dataset composed of behaviours from real, virtual and emulated embedded systems that can be part of the IoT was created. This was used for both training and testing classification methods. The results identified Random Forest (RF) as the most efficient method, recognising forged embedded machines in only 5 seconds with a detection rate of around 99.5%. It follows that this solution can be applied in real IoT scenarios with critical conditions. In the final part of this thesis, an attack against these new mechanisms has been proposed. This consists of using a modified kernel of a powerful machine to mimic the behaviour of a real IoT-embedded machine, referred to as a fake timing attack (FTA). Two metrics, mode and median from ping response time, have been found to effectively detect this attack. The final detection method involves combining RF and k-Nearest Neighbour to successfully detect forged embedded machines and FTA in only 40 seconds, with an overall detection performance (ODP) of 99.9% and 93.70% respectively. This method also was evaluated using behaviours from embedded machines that were not present in the training set. The results from that evaluation demonstrate that the proposed solution can detect embedded machines unknown to the method, both real and virtual, with an ODP of 99.96% and 99.92% respectively. In summary, a new algorithm able to detect forged embedded machines easily, quickly and with very high accuracy has been developed. The proposed method addresses the challenge of securing present and future M2M-embedded machines with power-constrained resources and can be applied to real IoT scenarios.","Selis, Valerio",1,,1891
5301,Using agent transparency to support situation awareness of the Autonomous Squad Member,"Agent transparency has been proposed as a solution to the problem of facilitating operators' situation awareness in human-robot teams. Sixty participants performed a dual monitoring task, monitoring both an intelligent, autonomous robot teammate and performing threat detection in a virtual environment. The robot displayed four different interfaces, corresponding to information from the Situation awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) model. Participants' situation awareness of the robot, confidence in their situation awareness, trust in the robot, workload, cognitive processing, and perceived usability of the robot displays were assessed. Results indicate that participants using interfaces corresponding to higher SAT level had greater situation awareness, cognitive processing, and trust in the robot than when they viewed lower level SAT interfaces. No differences in workload or perceived usability of the display were detected. Based on these findings, we observed that transparency has a significant effect on situation awareness, trust, and cognitive processing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Selkowitz, A.

5310,,"The current work consists of a series of three integrated essays and focuses on leadership and team performance from a multi-level perspective and incorporates various degrees of team virtuality. It also introduces network level of analysis constructs as boundary conditions for leadership emergence and team performance and places a focus on the relationships among actors/entities. In terms of methodological rigor, it incorporates explicit levels of analysis and discusses isomorphism, discontinuities or uniqueness of constructs across levels. The first essay builds a general interactionist multi-level framework of leadership and team performance with general and specific hypotheses, and the latter two essays provide partial tests of it. Teams are presented on a continuum of virtuality and specific hypotheses are put forth for how several performance antecedents at the individual level and team level can have higher or lower impact on the outcome of interest depending on team type (high virtuality vs. low virtuality). Network-level constructs are presented as moderators for the relationship between antecedents at the four traditional levels of analysis (i.e., individual, dyad, team/group, collective/organization) and team performance. The second essay consists of agent based simulation models of leadership and team performance in face-to-face vs. virtual teams, implemented using the Python programming language. The third essay empirically tests, in two different types of teams (high team virtuality vs. low team virtuality), the leadership emergence and team performance models simulated in the second essay. Teams in a real rather than simulated setting are used Findings indicate that at the individual level, conscientiousness and self-efficacy are the strongest predictors of team performance and that a high density of network ties strengthens the relationship between self-efficacy and leadership emergence. At the team level, team efficacy mediates the relationship between team cognitive ability, cohesion and trust as independent variables and team performance as a dependent variable, and under a high leader centrality condition the relationship becomes stronger for cohesion and trust. The degree of virtuality was also found to significantly influence the relationship between cohesion and team efficacy.

We offer a multi-level model analyzing the roles of degree of team virtuality and density of social network ties as boundary conditions on leadership emergence, viewed as a fundamentally social-cognitive process. Using agent-based modeling and simulations, our results suggest that virtuality moderates the relationships between cognitive ability, extraversion, and self-efficacy (as independent variables) and leadership emergence (as dependent variable); and density of network ties serves as a moderator for the associations of cognitive ability and self-efficacy with leadership emergence. Subsequent quasi-experimental and experimental tests support the role of density of network ties as a moderator for the association of extraversion with leadership emergence. Implications of these findings and future paths for research bridging the fields of leadership, team virtuality and social networks are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

5321,VOX system: a semantic embodied conversational agent exploiting linked data,"In the last few years, the use of ontologies has spread thanks to the irruption of the Semantic Web. They have become a crucial tool in information systems as they explicitly state the meaning of information, making it possible to share it and to achieve higher levels of interoperability. However, being knowledge representation models as they are, other fields can take advantage of their characteristics to extend their capabilities. In particular, in the context of Embodied Conversational Agents, they can be used to provide them with semantic knowledge and, therefore, enhance their intellectual skills. In this paper, we propose an approach to explore the synergies between these technologies. Thus, we have developed a multimodal ECA that exploits the knowledge provided by the Linked Data initiative to help users in their search information tasks. Based on a semantic-guided keyword search, our approach is flexible enough to: 1) deal with different Linked Data repositories and 2) handle different search/knowledge domains in a multilingual way. To illustrate the potential of our approach, we have focused on the case of DBpedia, as it mirrors the information stored in the Wikipedia, providing a semantic entry to it.","Seron, F.

5323,Note Onset Deviations as Musical Piece Signatures,"A competent interpretation of a musical composition presents several non-explicit departures from the written score. Timing variations are perhaps the most important ones: they are fundamental for expressive performance and a key ingredient for conferring a human-like quality to machine-based music renditions. However, the nature of such variations is still an open research question, with diverse theories that indicate a multi-dimensional phenomenon. In the present study, we consider event-shift timing variations and show that sequences of note onset deviations are robust and reliable predictors of the musical piece being played, irrespective of the performer. In fact, our results suggest that only a few consecutive onset deviations are already enough to identify a musical composition with statistically significant accuracy. We consider a mid-size collection of commercial recordings of classical guitar pieces and follow a quantitative approach based on the combination of standard statistical tools and machine learning techniques with the semi-automatic estimation of onset deviations. Besides the reported results, we believe that the considered materials and the methodology followed widen the testing ground for studying musical timing and could open new perspectives in related research fields.","Serra, J.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0069268,1899
5326,The (in)visibility of gender knowledge in the Physical Activity and Sport Science degree in Spain,"This paper draws on research that aimed to explore the construction of gender relations in sport and physical education (PE) through a national study of Spanish university degree curricula. Spain is a useful case study through which to explore gender knowledge within sport and PE degrees, because, unlike many other countries, it has a common, national curriculum framework for its Physical Activity and Sport Science (PASS) degrees. In addition, it has recently passed a new law concerning the introduction of gender knowledge in higher education (HE). Drawing on Bernstein's (1990) framework of the pedagogic device, this paper examines how this HE gender policy becomes recontextualised as universities and lecturers interpret and translate this into the pedagogical texts that make up the PASS curricula. Purposive sampling was used to select 16 of the 37 universities offering PASS degrees in 2012/2013. The research analysed 16 PASS documents at the degree level and 763 individual subject handbooks. Using discourse analysis, the results showed where and how gender knowledge was incorporated and the extent to which the topic was presented coherently throughout the documents. The analysis revealed five categories of the (in)visibility of gender knowledge within the universities' instructional discourse. Gender knowledge is largely ignored in PASS curricular documentation, appearing, at best, in highly superficial ways. Despite a national policy requirement on universities to incorporate gender knowledge, this study shows how recontextualisation processes within specific universities' pedagogic devices operate to marginalise such perspectives within PASS curricula. The research also revealed the significance of individual agents committed to gender equity being situated, and having influence, throughout the pedagogic device. The paper concludes that without a much wider, critical engagement in knowledge about gender equity, PASS degrees will continue to reproduce rather than disrupt the gender relations that have traditionally characterised the field.","Serra, P.",0,10.1080/13573322.2016.1199016,1900
5332,,"This study focused on the facial expressions that children exhibit while trying to deceive a virtual agent. An interactive lie elicitation game was developed to record children’s facial expressions during deceptive and truthful utterances. Our participants did this task either alone or in the presence of peers. A manual method and an automatic recognition approach were used to examine facial expressions and facial action units (AUs). Results show that the facial expressions of deceivers differ from those of truth-tellers: most clearly, they try to cover their lie as they smile significantly more often than truthful children. Moreover, co-presence enhances children’s facial expressive behavior and the number of deceptive cues. To understand whether such features serve as cues for deception detection, using data from children playing alone or together with another child, a perception test was carried out to examine observers’ ability to distinguish young deceivers from truth-tellers. Results show that observers found it easier to discriminate between deceivers and truth-tellers who had played the game in the co-present condition. Our research thus shows that virtual agents can be used as tools to elicit lies in a playful manner, which would be relevant for developmental, educational and behavioral analyses of deceit in growing children.

5336,Kids See Human Too: Adapting an Individual Differences Measure of Anthropomorphism for a Child Sample,"The study of anthropomorphism in adults has received considerable interest with the development of the Individual Differences in Anthropomorphism Questionnaire (IDAQ; Waytz, Cacioppo, & Epley, 2010). Anthropomorphism in childrenits development, correlates, and consequencesis also of significant interest, yet a comparable measure does not exist. To fill this gap, we developed the IDAQ-Child Form (IDAQ-CF) and report on 2 studies. In Study 1A, adults (N = 304) were administered the IDAQ and IDAQ-CF to directly assess comparability between the measures. In Study 1B, an additional 350 adults were administered the IDAQ-CF to confirm that the new measure had the same underlying structure as the original IDAQ when the measures were not administered together. In Study 2, children (N = 90) in 3 age groups5, 7, and 9 years oldwere administered the IDAQ-CF and an Attribution Interview, which probed their conceptions of a robot and puppet. Results indicated the IDAQ-CF a) is comparable to the original IDAQ in adult (Studies 1A and 1B) and child (Study 2) samples, and b) predicts children's tendency to attribute animate characteristics to inanimate entities (Study 2). This research provides strong evidence that the IDAQ-CF is an effective adaptation of the original IDAQ for use with children.","Severson, R. L.",0,10.1080/15248372.2014.989445,1902
5338,Imagining Others' Minds: The Positive Relation Between Children's Role Play and Anthropomorphism,"Children's role playing, whether personifying toys or imagining invisible friends, involves imagining others' minds and internal states. Similarly, anthropomorphism - the attribution of internal states to non-human others (e.g., animals, inanimate nature, or technologies) - also involves imagining others' minds and internal states. We propose that the imaginative process of simulating and projecting internal states is common to both role play and anthropomorphism. The current study investigated the relation between children's role play and anthropomorphism. Ninety children (5, 7, and 9 years) were administered Individual Differences in Anthropomorphism Questionnaire - Child Form (IDAQ-CF), comprised of the technology-inanimate nature and animal subscales, and the Role Play Scale, which assessed (a) impersonation of animals, people, and/or machines and (b) imaginary companions (ICs), including invisible friends and personified toys. Results indicated that the imaginative act of impersonating an animal, person, and/or machine was positively related to anthropomorphism, and specifically anthropomorphism of inanimate nature and technology. Second, anthropomorphism of animals was highest amongst children with invisible ICs, followed by those with toy ICs and those who impersonated. Finally, children who frequently engaged with an invisible ICs more readily anthropomorphized in general and technology and inanimate nature in particular relative to all other children. Results are discussed in terms of the differing degrees of imagination involved in anthropomorphism of animals versus technology and inanimate nature.","Severson, R.

5340,"Actors, Avatars and Agents: Potentials and Implications of Natural Face Technology for the Creation of Realistic Visual Presence","We are on the cusp of creating realistic, interactive, fully rendered human faces on computers that transcend the ""uncanny valley,"" widely known for capturing the phenomenon of ""eeriness"" in faces that are almost, but not fully realistic. Because humans are hardwired to respond to faces in uniquely positive ways, artificial realistic faces hold great promise for advancing human interaction with machines. For example, realistic avatars will enable presentation of human actors in virtual collaboration settings with new levels of realism; artificial natural faces will allow the embodiment of cognitive agents, such as Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri, putting us on a path to create ""artificial human"" entities in the near future. In this conceptual paper, we introduce natural face technology (NFT) and its potential for creating realistic visual presence (RVP), a sensation of presence in interaction with a digital actor, as if present with another human. We contribute a forward-looking research agenda to information systems (IS) research, comprising terminology, early conceptual work, concrete ideas for research projects, and a broad range of research questions for engaging with this emerging, transformative technology as it becomes available for application. By doing so, we respond to calls for ""blue ocean research"" that explores unchartered territory and makes a novel technology accessible to IS early in its application. We outline promising areas of application and foreshadow philosophical, ethical, and conceptual questions for IS research pertaining to the more speculative phenomena of ""living with artificial humans.""","Seymour, M.",0,10.17705/1jais.00515,1904
5343,,"This thesis presents the research undertaken to develop a novel approach towards the development of a text-based Conversational Natural Language Interface to Databases, known as ANEESAH. Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIDBs) are computer applications, which replace the requirement for an end user to commission a skilled programmer to query a database by using natural language. The aim of the proposed research is to investigate the use of a Natural Language Interface to Database (NLIDB) capable of conversing with users to automate the query formulation process for database information retrieval. Historical challenges and limitations have prevented the wider use of NLIDB applications in real-life environments. The challenges relevant to the scope of proposed research include the absence of flexible conversation between NLIDB applications and users, automated database query building from multiple dialogues and flexibility to sustain dialogues for information refinement. The areas of research explored include; NLIDBs, conversational agents (CAs), natural language processing (NLP) techniques, artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge engineering, and relational databases. Current NLIDBs do not have conversational abilities to sustain dialogues, especially with regards to information required for dynamic query formulation. A novel approach, ANEESAH is introduced to deal with these challenges. ANEESAH was developed to allow users to communicate using natural language to retrieve information from a relational database. ANEESAH can interact with the users conversationally and sustain dialogues to automate the query formulation and information refinement process. The research and development of ANEESAH steered the engineering of several novel NLIDB components such as a CA implemented NLIDB framework, a rule-based CA that combines pattern matching and sentence similarity techniques, algorithms to engage users in conversation and support sustained dialogues for information refinement. Additional components of the proposed framework include a novel SQL query engine for the dynamic formulation of queries to extract database information and perform querying the query operations to support the information refinement. Furthermore, a generic evaluation methodology combining subjective and objective measures was introduced to evaluate the implemented conversational NLIDB framework. Empirical end user evaluation was also used to validate the components of the implemented framework. The evaluation results demonstrated ANEESAH produced the desired database information for users over a set of test scenarios. The evaluation results also revealed that the proposed framework components can overcome the challenges of sustaining dialogues, information refinement and querying the query operations.","Shabaz, Khurim",0,,1905
5344,,"Drinking water distribution systems are critical infrastructure systems, providing potable water to a large population of consumers from centralized sources. Distribution systems may be vulnerable to contamination events, and water utilities are responsible for managing threats and for allocating resources to protect a community from probable events. Developing threat management plans relies on the simulation of hydraulics and water quality transport in the pipe network, and conventional hydraulic simulation models treat demands as static and exogenous to the pipe network. The public health consequences of an outbreak or attack, however, do not depend on the characteristics of the pipe network and contaminant intrusion alone. Instead, the decisions and behaviors of human actors as they interact with the pipe network can influence event consequences, including the number of exposed consumers and the propagation of a contaminant plume. Utility managers may implement response actions to alert consumers and change hydraulic operations of pumps, valves, and fire hydrants. Consumers who become aware of a threat may select protective actions that change their water demands from typical demand patterns. Consequently, the movement of the contaminant plume in the pipe network may shift from the expected trajectory that is predicted when demands are exogenous inputs, which may alter public health impacts. This research develops a sociotechnical model to integrate agent-based models of consumers and utility managers with an engineering water distribution system model. The simulation approach captures the dynamics among consumers, utility managers, media, and the water distribution system for predicting contaminant transport and public exposure. Consumers are modeled as agents that have behavioral rules for drinking water; traveling within a network; becoming exposed through ingesting contaminant; exchanging information with other consumers about the event; receiving and complying with warnings from water utilities; and reducing demands. Consumer behaviors are modeled using results from surveys that were conducted to assess consumer response to water notices in two communities. The sociotechnical model is coupled with optimization methodologies to develop mitigation strategies to protect consumers. A variable-length genetic algorithm is developed to route siren vehicles to warn the public. A noisy genetic algorithm is applied to develop sensor-hydrant decision trees that provide real-time guidance to flush the contaminant for decision-makers who prefer to use risky, risk-averse, or adaptive decision-making approaches. The sociotechnical model is used to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies that combine response actions, including warning consumers and flushing contaminants by opening hydrants. Strategies are evaluated based on their performance to remove contaminant and protect consumers. The simulation-optimization framework is tested by simulating realistic contamination scenarios for a virtual city and water distribution system.","Shaffiee, Michael Ehsan",0,,1906
5345,Agent-based modeling and evolutionary computation for disseminating public advisories about hazardous material emergencies,"In the event of a large-scale disaster, an important aspect of humanitarian logistics is the distribution of information or warnings to the affected population. This research develops the problem formulation and solution approach for a specific routing for relief problem, in which warnings should be disseminated to an affected community, using public announcement systems mounted on emergency vehicles. The problem statement is formulated to maximize the number of individuals of a community who are protected. An evolutionary algorithm framework is developed by coupling an agent-based model with a variable-length genetic algorithm to route emergency vehicles. The dynamics of interactions among consumers, emergency vehicles, and the spatiotemporal trajectory of the hazard are simulated using an agent-based modeling approach, and a variable-length genetic algorithm approach selects routes to warn a maximum number of consumers before they are affected by the emergency. The example that is explored in this research is contamination of a water distribution network. A fleet of emergency vehicles is equipped with public address systems and is deployed to warn consumers to stop using contaminated water. The framework is demonstrated for an illustrative virtual city, Mesopolis. The results of the evolutionary algorithm framework are compared with two conventional routing optimization approaches, including a covering tour problem approach and a manual routing approach, for four contamination scenarios. The evolutionary algorithm can be applied to route emergency service vehicles to broadcast information for other emergencies, such as flash flooding, hazardous materials incidents, and severe weather.

5347,Development of a virtual power market model to investigate strategic and collusive behavior of market players,"In this paper, a virtual power market model is proposed to investigate the behavior of power market players from regulator's point of view. In this approach, strategic players are modeled in a multi-agent environment. These agents which are virtual representative of actual players forecast the prices and participate in the markets, exactly the same as real world situation. In addition, the role of ISO is encountered by using security constraint unit commitment (SCUC) and security constraint economic dispatch (SCED) solutions. Moreover, the interaction between market players is modeled using a heuristic dynamic game theory algorithm based on the supply function equilibria (SFE). In addition to the collusive behavior, using the proposed model, the short-term strategic behavior of players, which their effects will appear in long-term, can be simulated. The proposed model enables the market regulators to make decision before implementing new market rules with the confidence of their results. To represent the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study including wind power plants is considered and the impact of various market rules on players' behavior is simulated and discussed. Numerical studies indicate that simulating the strategic and collusive behavior prior to any change in the market rules is necessary. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, a virtual electricity market (VEM) model is proposed based on multi-agent systems to investigate the behaviour of market players from the regulator's viewpoint. In addition to the tacit collusive behaviour of market players, the potential of explicit collusions is also considered. Moreover, three indices are proposed for ex-ante assessment of the market power. The proposed indices not only recognise the market power potential but also express the reasons for the market power. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed based on the VEM to select the optimal rule, regulation and market structure, in order to maximise the market efficiency. In order to represent the effectiveness of the proposed method, several case studies are considered and the impacts of various market rules on market behaviour are simulated and discussed.","Shafie-khah, M.",0,10.1049/iet-gtd.2015.0981,1909
5353,Modeling of interactions between market regulations and behavior of plug-in electric vehicle aggregators in a virtual power market environment,"A market regulator is considered to increase the market efficiency and hence several regulations are tried to achieve this target. In many of such regulations, special conditions of renewable energies have been introduced. Accordingly, it is observed that some changes in regulations may have indirect undesirable effects on involved companies. In this paper, effects of the changes in market regulations on the behavior of both plug-in electric vehicle owners and their aggregators have been studied. A hybrid method is proposed to simulate the behavior of the market players from both regulator and aggregator's point of views. In addition, behavior of electric vehicle owners has been modeled considering type of the contract with aggregator. The result shows that a clever aggregator can convert some threats to changes in market regulations and there have been opportunities to increase the profit, enhanced the costumers and even the market efficiency.

5357,,"As outlined by many of the social and political movements happening around us today, now more than ever, youth need to be critically conscious of their world in order to navigate it successfully. The Toronto District School Board, where Armen Shahnazarian teaches uses the hybrid model of culturally responsive and relevant pedagogy (CRRP), based on frameworks put forth by Gloria Ladson-Billings (1995) and Geneva Gay (2000), not only to assist with academic achievement, but to also help facilitate critical consciousness. During the 2015-2016 school year, Shahnazarian held the position of Student Work Study Teacher (SWST). As a provincial initiative, SWSTs are assigned to schools where students are not achieving according to Ontario Ministry of Education standards. Part of Shahnazarian's role was to collaborate with teachers to develop inquiries through pedagogical documentation, for instance by capturing student learning through products, observational notes, photos, videos, and interviews. Stemming from this process, Shahnazarian engaged in a professional learning inquiry with one of the collaborating teachers to increase student engagement in a 9th grade academic English class. Since the school board requires its use, Shahnazarian chose to focus on CRRP (Toronto District School Board, 2013), in particular its emphasis on critical consciousness, to work towards this goal. This article describes this process, and puts forth a call to educators to create opportunities for students to engage with critical consciousness raising, and to consider Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) methods as a tool to help them in doing so. Critical consciousness allows students to become active agents by connecting their in-class learning to their day-to-day lives. As a result, students begin to develop the ability to recognize systemic oppression and to offer potential ways in which it may be eliminated.","Shahnazarian, Armen",0,,1911
5358,Feeling our way to machine minds: People's emotions when perceiving mind in artificial intelligence,"It is now common for people to encounter artificial intelligence (AI) across many areas of their personal and professional lives. Interactions with AI agents may range from the routine use of information technology tools to encounters where people perceive an artificial agent as exhibiting mind. Combining two studies (useable N = 266), we explore people's qualitative descriptions of a personal encounter with an AI in which it exhibits characteristics of mind. Across a range of situations reported, a clear pattern emerged in the responses: the majority of people report their own emotions including surprise, amazement, happiness, disappointment, amusement, unease, and confusion in their encounter with a minded AI. We argue that emotional reactions occur as part of mind perception as people negotiate between the disparate concepts of programmed electronic devices and actions indicative of human-like minds. Specifically, emotions are often tied to AIs that produce extraordinary outcomes, inhabit crucial social roles, and engage in human-like actions. We conclude with future directions and the implications for ethics, the psychology of mind perception, the philosophy of mind, and the nature of social interactions in a world of increasingly sophisticated AIs.","Shank, D.

Because of this growth in coding within Java Applications, computer scientists have been increasingly interested in correlating execution data and performance. Collection of execution data about a running Java Application is referred to as Tracing. Tracing the Java code execution is most effectively done by source code instrumentation and bytecode instrumentation. This project illustrates the use of ExecTracer as a bytecode instrumentation tool to trace Java code execution. ExecTracer uses the ASM bytecode manipulation framework to manipulate bytecode and Java Agent is used to perform on the fly bytecode manipulation, otherwise known as Dynamic Instrumentation. Java Agent utilizes the Instrumentation Application Program Interface (API) that provides alteration for the existing bytecode loaded in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). ExecTracer performs Instrumentation on the running Java Application and logs execution trace information. Trace results from ExecTracer on several Java Applications shows excellent accuracy about instructions executed, execution frequency, and percentage coverage. The execution trace information provided by ExecTracer can be used for code coverage analysis during testing phase or for monitoring the performance of the Java Application after deployment, thereby aiding in selecting better code refactoring techniques and reduce code complexity.","ShanmugaVelayutham, ArunKumar",0,,1913
5364,,"Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is an emerging medical imaging modality. Due to its high sensitivity and ability to model physiological function, it is effective in identifying active regions that may be associated with different types of tumour. Increasing numbers of patient scans have led to an urgent need for the development of new efficient data analysis system to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of disease and save decent amount of the processing time, as well as the automatic detection of small lesions. In this research, an automated intelligent system for oncological PET volume analysis has been developed. Experimental NEMA (national electrical manufacturers association) IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) body phantom data set, Zubal anthropomorphic phantom data set with simulated tumours, clinical data set from patient with histologically proven non-small cell lung cancer, and clinical data sets from seven patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma have been utilised in this research. The initial stage of the developed system involves different thresholding approaches, and transforming the processed volumes into the wavelet domain at different levels of decomposition by deploying Haar wavelet transform. K-means approach is also deployed to classify the processed volume into a distinct number of classes. The optimal number of classes for each processed data set has been obtained automatically based on Bayesian information criterion. The second stage of the system involves artificial intelligence approaches including feedforward neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, self organising map, and fuzzy C-means. The best neural network design for PET application has been thoroughly investigated. All the proposed classifiers have been evaluated and tested on the experimental, simulated and clinical data sets. The final stage of the developed system includes the development of new optimised committee machine for PET application and tumour classification. Objective and subjective evaluations have been carried out for all the systems outputs, they show promising results for classifying patient lesions. The new approach results have been compared with all of the results obtained from the investigated classifiers and the developed committee machines. Superior results have been achieved using the new approach. An accuracy of 99.95% is achieved for clinical data set of patient with histologically proven lung tumour, and an average accuracy of 98.11% is achieved for clinical data set of seven patients with laryngeal tumour.","Sharif, Mhd Saeed",0,,1914
5365,Should we welcome robot teachers?,"Current uses of robots in classrooms are reviewed and used to characterise four scenarios: (s1) Robot as Classroom Teacher; (s2) Robot as Companion and Peer; (s3) Robot as Care-eliciting Companion; and (s4) Telepresence Robot Teacher. The main ethical concerns associated with robot teachers are identified as: privacy; attachment, deception, and loss of human contact; and control and accountability. These are discussed in terms of the four identified scenarios. It is argued that classroom robots are likely to impact children's' privacy, especially when they masquerade as their friends and companions, when sensors are used to measure children's responses, and when records are kept. Social robots designed to appear as if they understand and care for humans necessarily involve some deception (itself a complex notion), and could increase the risk of reduced human contact. Children could form attachments to robot companions (s2 and s3), or robot teachers (s1) and this could have a deleterious effect on their social development. There are also concerns about the ability, and use of robots to control or make decisions about children's behaviour in the classroom. It is concluded that there are good reasons not to welcome fully fledged robot teachers (s1), and that robot companions (s2 and 3) should be given a cautious welcome at best. The limited circumstances in which robots could be used in the classroom to improve the human condition by offering otherwise unavailable educational experiences are discussed.","Sharkey, A. J.

First, we provide detailed statistics on the scale and funding of US drone operations, noting a rapid acceleration of its adoption by the military. This is then situated within an overarching narrative of the logic of targeting. Second, we study a legal document called the Frontier Crimes Regulation of 1901 that defines the relationship of FATA to the rest of Pakistan as an exceptional place. In the third section, we argue that the drone is a political actor with a fetishized existence, and this enables it to violate sovereign Pakistani territory. In this sense, the continued violence waged by robots in Pakistan's tribal areas is a result of the deadly interaction between law and technology. The paper concludes by noting the proliferation of drones in everyday life.","Shaw, I. G. R.",0,10.1111/j.1467-8330.2011.00940.x,1918
5370,,"This study investigates service workers’ experiences of managing their emotions and how they make sense of these in relation to their perceived well-being. It responds to calls within the sociology of service work literature for a more definitive focus upon the dynamic complexity of service agents’ ‘emotional self-management’ and their self-care across, in addition to within, specific occupational contexts. The still novel qualitative methodology, interpretative phenomenological analysis (‘IPA’) was adopted because of its emphasis upon gathering experiential data from a first person viewpoint. This choice of IPA was innovative, not only because of its virtual invisibility in service research to date, but also because it was methodologically augmented using artefact elicitation technique. A purposive, non-random, sample of twelve participants was drawn, six from each of two specific occupational groups; air cabin crew and nurses, with respondents participating in a series of in-depth, loosely structured interviews over an extended timeframe. The findings revealed that three key relationships lay at the heart of how participants made sense of their emotional experiences; service agents’ themselves, their interaction with working colleagues and those whom they served. Relationships were played out within dynamic climates of authenticity, falseness, loyalty or betrayal and often interpreted by respondents in terms of their inherent degrees of truth, trust, dignity and pride. This study contributes to contextual and theoretical understanding by offering fresh insights on service agents’ emotional experiences as mediating influences in their socially constructed sense of selves and their well-being. This is one of very few studies which emphasise idiographic contexts within the broader patterns of worker–customer relations, transcending the traditionally delineated occupational boundaries of nursing and commercial service work. New knowledge has been created by considering individuals’ feelings about their work in this way thus prompting a reconsideration of emotion effort in terms of its complexity, challenge and occupational context.","Sheehan, Conor",0,,1919
5371,,"Sophisticated humanoid robots have recently moved from the laboratory and research settings to the home environment. Some models are now marketed to families with children, and are designed to engage children in increasingly social and potentially moral interactions. The purpose of this study is to investigate—when children interact with a commercially available humanoid robot and witness a human causing a harm to the robot—whether children conceptualize the robot as being an entity that deserves moral consideration: what is referred to in this study as having moral standing. Participants included 120 children in 2 age groups (8-9 and 14-15). To assess the effects of the robot’s physical embodiment on participants’ conceptions of the robot’s moral standing, 30 participants from each age group (gender balanced) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions and interacted with either a humanoid robot or an analogous virtual agent. In each condition, the interaction culminated in a confederate hitting the robot/virtual agent with a book. Each participant was then engaged in a semi-structured interview that ascertained their judgments and reasoning regarding the robot/virtual agent and three comparison entities. Results show that the majority of the participants judged the confederate hitting the robot as a violation of moral obligation, and many brought the concept of artificial emotion to bear in their reasoning. Participants were significantly more likely to judge it a violation of moral obligation to hit the robot than the virtual agent. Moreover, the 8- to 9-year-olds were significantly more likely than the 14- to 15-year-olds to judge it a violation of moral obligation to hit either the robot or the virtual agent. Finally, participants’ conceptions of the robot’s moral standing largely showed a unique composition of moral features when compared to those of the comparison entities. Discussion addresses the broader implications of these findings and future directions for research are offered.","Shen, Solace",0,,1920

Research Design: Twenty-one optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters were positioned evenly throughout a juvenile anthropomorphic phantom head designed to record the distribution of the absorbed radiation dose to different radiosensitive organs. The phantom was subjected to imaging via three CBCT scanners (I-CAT Platinum, Kodak 9000, Instrumentarium OP300) and four periapical films in accordance with the parallax method. The scans were conducted with and without leaded glasses and thyroid shield. Averaged radiation readings were then converted to effective doses using the tissue-weighting factors of the ICRP’s recommendations. Results: The radiation doses from the Kodak 9000 (27 μSv) and Instrumentarium OP300 (34 μSv) CBCT scans, with leaded glasses and thyroid shield, were less than that of the Gendex periapical films (40 μSv) taken in maxillary bilateral canine impaction cases. In maxillary-mandibular bilateral canine impactions, the Kodak 9000 CBCT (27 μSv), with protective shielding, had lower radiation dosage than the Gendex periapical films (46 μSv). In mandibular bilateral impaction cases, periapical films (6 μSv) still provided less radiation exposure than all CBCT machines tested. In all three cases, the I-CAT Platinum CBCT machine, with or without shielding, resulted in higher radiation dose levels than the Gendex periapical films. While there was a significant dose reduction using protective shielding for all the Instrumentarium and Kodak 9000 CBCT scans and the maxillary-mandibular scan of the I-CAT Platinum CBCT, no dose reduction was found for the periapicals taken with the Gendex intraoral machine. Conclusions: A clinical recommendation can be made for the use of small volume CBCT for localization of maxillary and maxillary-mandibular bilateral impacted canine cases. Dose reduction using protective shielding is recommended.","Sheth, Sonam",0,,1921
5373,,"Human vision is enabled by a cascade of visual processes in the brain. On the other hand, deep neural networks have also enabled computer vision to recognize images to a human-like level. Bearing on this similarity, it has recently attracted interests in using deep neural networks for modeling the human visual cortex with fMRI imaging. Studies have shown convolutional neural networks (CNNs) predicted the cortical activity during subjects viewing natural images. Besides, CNNs revealed the spatial hierarchy of visual processing in the cortex. Yet, neither the brain nor our visual world is static. Therefore, we acquired fMRI data during subjects watching natural movies. We used both a CNN, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) extended upon the CNN, for modeling and understanding the workings of the visual cortex during natural vision. Using neural encoding as the common metric, we found that these models predicted widespread cortical activity. Moreover, the RNN, exploiting temporal structures, was superior to the CNN in a number of aspects. It not only predicted more about the cortical activity and mapped the spatial hierarchy, but also reported the temporal hierarchy in the visual processing for the first time. Our results cast light on the future studies of systems neuroscience using computational models.","Shi, Junxing",0,,1922
5374,Social conditioning and extinction paradigm: a translational study in virtual reality,"In human beings, experiments investigating fear conditioning with social stimuli are rare. The current study aims at translating an animal model for social fear conditioning (SFC) to a human sample using an operant SFC paradigm in virtual reality. Forty participants actively (using a joystick) approached virtual male agents that served as conditioned stimuli (CS). During the acquisition phase, unconditioned stimuli (US), a combination of an air blast (5 bar, 10 ms) and a female scream (95 dB, 40 ms), were presented when participants reached a defined proximity to the agent with a contingency of 75% for CS+ agents and never for CS agents. During the extinction and the test phases, no US was delivered. Outcome variables were pleasantness ratings and physiological reactions in heart rate (HR) and fear-potentiated startle. Additionally, the influence of social anxiety, which was measured with the Social Phobia Inventory scale, was evaluated. As expected after the acquisition phase the CS+ was rated clearly less pleasant than the CS. This difference vanished during extinction. Furthermore, the HR remained high for the CS+, while the HR for the CS was clearly lower after than before the acquisition. Furthermore, a clear difference between CS+ and CS after the acquisition indicated successful conditioning on this translational measure. Contrariwise no CS+/CS- differences were observed in the physiological variables during extinction. Importantly, at the generalization test, higher socially fearful participants rated pleasantness of all agents as low whereas the lower socially fearful participants rated pleasantness as low only for the CS+. SFC was successfully induced and extinguished confirming operant conditioning in this SFC paradigm. These findings suggest that the paradigm is suitable to expand the knowledge about the learning and unlearning of social fears. Further studies should investigate the operant mechanisms of development and treatment of social anxiety disorder.","Shiban, Y.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00400,1923
5378,The appearance effect: Influences of virtual agent features on performance and motivation,"Background: Anthropomorphic (human-like) agents are commonly applied in e-learning as tutors for students, but we still do not know which particular features of an agent contribute to an enhancement of learning and motivation. Method: In this study a sample of university students was offered online learning cases as exam preparation aid and students were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The first group was tutored by a virtual male agent, the second by a virtual female agent. The cases of the third group were not assigned with an agent. We investigated if and under which circumstances a virtual tutor influences the students' exam performance, interest in the course material and their enjoyment during learning. Results: While the female agent (rated as young and attractive) had a positive impact on the interest in the course material, the male agent (rated as old and less attractive) had no positive influence at all on motivation or performance of the students on the exam. Conclusions: Appearance features of tutoring agents in e-learning independently influence the student's motivation and performance. Thus, interest can be manipulated by different aspects of the agent dependent on the primary goal while the agents have no effect on performance. We therefore suggest implementing personalized tutors in e-learning tutorials; however, we recommend more research examining the underlying mechanisms behind the positive effects on interest and look for ways to transfer them to performance.

If social choice functions do not satisfy incentive compatibility, full implementation is unattainable via existing approaches. For each story, we construct a direct mechanism that relies on the planner's private information. We provide a sufficient condition on players' beliefs regarding the state under which every player has a unique rationalizable action, namely, telling the truth. Thus, in these stories, the planner's information can bypass the lack of incentive compatibility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Shimoji, M.",0,10.1016/j.geb.2015.03.007,1925
5387,User value design for cloud courseware system,"A cloud learning environment enables an enriched learning experience compared to conventional methods of learning. Employing a value-sensitive approach, we undertook theoretical and empirical analyses to explore the values that influence potential users' adoption of cloud courseware, by integrating cognitive motivations and user values as primary determining factors. We found that users' intentions and behaviours are largely influenced by their perceptions of what is valuable about the cloud courseware in terms of sociability, learnability, and usability. These evaluations were found to be significant antecedents of cloud-computing intentions. This study makes a contribution to theory development as our model extends existing technology acceptance models and can be used to design user interfaces and promote the acceptance of cloud computing. For practical applications, the study findings can be used by industries promoting cloud services to increase user acceptance by addressing user values and incorporating them into cloud-computing design.","Shin, D.

Recuperating Subjectivity through Posthuman Spirituality in ""Readymade Bodhisattva""","Can an inorganic substrate such as an artificially intelligent android achieve Nirvana? Born free of the mortal coil and its toils, what is there for such an entity to awaken from, and to what end? Pak Song-hwan's Readymade Bodhisattva (2004) interrogates this question and destabilizes the last bastion of existential aura our kind still holds dear to heart: spirituality. Reading the enlightened robot as an inverted image of the human subject, this essay explores a way out of anthropocentric ontology. I claim that the interactions between various parties of disparate ontological and social strata in the story show that the uncanny alterity of our own simulations is none other than our mirror images and suggest that what we deem to be the essence of our being may in fact be irreconcilably alien to who we are.

5389,,"Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits, emotions and intentions to non-human entities. The inverse process of anthropomorphism is dehumanization in which individuals treat humans like animals or objects. Two studies were conducted to investigate whether there are relationships between loneliness, anthropomorphism, and dehumanization. Study 1 (N = 91) employed the UCLA loneliness scale in order to examine the extent to which subjective experiences of loneliness related to the tendency to describe nonhuman agents (i.e., animal, computer) with humanlike characteristics. Participants attributed more humanlike capacities to nonhuman agents with increasing levels of self-rated loneliness. Study 2 (N = 70) induced the emotion of loneliness using an experimental writing task and examined whether there were significant differences in anthropomorphism and dehumanization between the experimental condition of loneliness and the control condition. Results found participants tended to perceive nonhuman agents to be more humanlike in the condition of loneliness than in the control condition. In addition, there was a stronger tendency of dehumanization toward other humans in the condition of loneliness than in the control condition. This implies that anthropomorphism is related to sociality motivation, which is the need for social connection through establishing bonds with nonhumans, and may result in the dehumanization of other humans.

5391,The uncanny valley: No need for any further judgments when an avatar looks eerie,"Considering that a 3D scanning technology allows to create avatars that embody more authentic and rich information about its users, it could be expected that enhancing avatar realism will increase the accuracy of thin slice judgments of the person represented by the avatar. However, previous studies suggest that the objective realism of avatars may not always lead to positive outcomes, and the activation of negative affect and the aversive motivational system through the uncanny valley effects may rather harm the accuracy of thin-slice judgments by making people distance themselves from available information in avatars. To validate this speculation, a 2 (Realism: Cartoonish vs. Hyper-realistic) x 2 (Animacy: Still vs. Animate) between-subjects experiment (N = 134) was conducted. In support of our prediction, results from an online experiment confirmed that hyper-realistic and animate avatars can induce a greater feeling of eeriness as compared to cartoonish and still avatars. This feeling of eeriness, evoked by the uncanny valley effects, suppressed the amount of information processing oriented for thin-slice judgments, and subsequently decreased the accuracy of extraversion and agreeableness judgments. Further theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.","Shin, M.",0,10.1016/j.chb.2019.01.016,1929
5394,Can knowledge be more accessible in a virtual network?: Collective dynamics of knowledge transfer in a virtual knowledge organization network,"Virtual knowledge organizations (VKOs) produce and embrace priceless, and often, unique knowledge assets within the boundary of each virtual community. An important question is how do we maximize the benefits from these valuable assets at the entire VKO network level? Relying on the graph theory, this study is to investigate how the structure of virtual knowledge networks formed by knowledge agents and knowledge profile of each VKO influence the dynamics of knowledge transfer in a virtual knowledge organization network (VKON). We develop a network model through which knowledge will be efficiently disseminated when knowledge agents are uniformly distributed across the network. Using this model's intrinsic capability to assess global effects of local transformations in a network, we found that VKON complexity, a measure for efficiency of knowledge transfer, is optimized when a new knowledge agent is placed between two communities with the minimum knowledge transfer capacity. The results of this study will help understand the inter-community knowledge transfer dynamics in virtual knowledge community networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Shin, S.

5396,,"This paper describes how audio and visual stimuli during a robot’s hug change its perceived impressions and stress-buffering effects. In human science literature, the perceived gender influences the impressions of touch interactions, including hugs. In this study we investigate whether the perceived gender of an interacting agent controlled by audio-visual stimuli affects the influence of positive hugs like a stress-buffering effect. We used a system called Metahug that integrates a robot and a virtual reality application and prepared both female- and male-appearance agents and experimentally investigated the audio-visual effects for human–robot hug interaction. Our results showed that the robot’s hug impressions were significantly different based on the agents’ genders. Moreover, the participants reported significantly lower tension in a stressful task when they hugged an opposite-gender-appearance agent compared to a same-gender-appearance agent. Our results suggest that the Metahug system can change both the impressions of a robot’s hug and stress-buffering effects of the hug by altering the audio and visual stimuli of the virtual reality application.

5398,,"""Large-Scale Multimedia Retrieval"" (LSMR) is the task to fast analyze a large amount of multimedia data like images or videos and accurately find the ones relevant to a certain semantic meaning. Although LSMR has been investigated for more than two decades in the fields of multimedia processing and computer vision, a more interdisciplinary approach is necessary to develop an LSMR system that is really meaningful for humans. To this end, this paper aims to stimulate attention to the LSMR problem from diverse research fields. By explaining basic terminologies in LSMR, we first survey several representative methods in chronological order. This reveals that due to prioritizing the generality and scalability for large-scale data, recent methods interpret semantic meanings with a completely different mechanism from humans, though such humanlike mechanisms were used in classical heuristic-based methods. Based on this, we discuss ""human-machine cooperation,"" which incorporates knowledge about human interpretation into LSMR without sacrificing the generality and scalability. In particular, we present three approaches to human-machine cooperation (""cognitive,"" ""ontological,"" and ""adaptive""), which are attributed to cognitive science, ontology engineering, and metacognition, respectively. We hope that this paper will create a bridge to enable researchers in different fields to communicate about the LSMR problem and lead to a ground-breaking next generation of LSMR systems.","Shirahama, Kimiaki",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.7771/1932-6246.1173,1932
5401,Perceived animacy influences the processing of human-like surface features in the fusiform gyrus,"While decades of research have demonstrated that a region of the right fusiform gyrus (FG) responds selectively to faces, a second line of research suggests that the FG responds to a range of animacy cues, including biological motion and goal-directed actions, even in the absence of faces or other human-like surface features. These findings raise the question of whether the FG is indeed sensitive to faces or to the more abstract category of animate agents. The current study uses fMRI to examine whether the FG responds to all faces in a category-specific way or whether the FG is especially sensitive to the faces of animate agents. Animate agents are defined here as intentional agents with the capacity for rational goal-directed actions. Specifically, we examine how the FG responds to an entity that looks like an animate agent but that lacks the capacity for goal-directed rational action. Region-of-interest analyses reveal that the FG activates more strongly to the animate compared with the inanimate entity, even though the surface features of both animate and inanimate entities were identical. These results suggest that the FG does not respond to all faces in a category-specific way, and is instead especially sensitive to whether an entity is animate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite this view, both regions activate in response to both stimulus categories and to a range of other stimuli, such as goal-directed actions, suggesting that these regions respond to characteristics of animate agents more generally. Here we propose a neural model for animacy detection composed of processing streams that are initially differentially sensitive to cues signaling animacy, but that ultimately act in concert to support reasoning about animate agents. We use dynamic causal modeling, a measure of effective connectivity, to demonstrate that the directional flow of information between the FG and pSTS is initially dependent on the characteristics of the animate agent presented, a key prediction of our proposed network for animacy detection.","Shultz, S.",0,10.1093/scan/nsu028,1934
5407,,"The purpose of this qualitative case study was to describe seven elementary teachers' conceptions of environmental literacy in relationship to a tall grass prairie restoration project and to explore ways in which the tall grass prairie restoration project for third grade contributed to enhancing educational learning experiences. The research questions were: 1. What are teachers' conceptions of environmental literacy for third grade students? 2. How does the prairie restoration trip contribute to teachers' capacity to teach for environmental literacy of third grade students? 3. What is the pedagogical value of the prairie restoration project? The theoretical frameworks underpinning this study were David Sobel's (1996) model for developmental progression in children's relationships with nature, and the North American Environmental Education Association's (2011) framework for environmental literacy. The first assertion derived from thematic data analysis of interviews, field trip observations, classroom observations, and artifacts was, The participating teachers' visions of environmental literacy for third grade students included components that spanned across a developmentally appropriate progression from cultivating empathy for living things, to fueling discovery of nature, to fostering a sense of responsibility toward the natural world . Components of environmental literacy described by teachers included being at ease in the natural environment, appreciation and respect, wonder and curiosity, awareness and interdependence, sense of agency, responsibility and service, and environmental knowledge. The second assertion stemming from thematic data analysis was, The prairie restoration project and related curriculum have pedagogical value that included and exceeded addressing state science standards. In addition to addressing state science standards identified by teachers, the curriculum related to the prairie restoration project served as an agent of curricular cohesion to integrate a variety of subject areas, developed scientific ways of thinking, provided life experience for children, and fostered authentic learning experiences through concrete connections. It also provided a means to enhance the presence of science and social studies in elementary curriculum. Themes emerging from qualitative data analysis resonated with Sobel's model of progressive stages in children's relationships with nature, and resulted in a tool potentially useful for design of elementary curriculum aimed at developing environmental literacy.","Shume, Teresa Jayne",0,,1935

A total of 153 students attending a junior high school in the southwestern United States were the participants for this study. Prior to the beginning of the study, students were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups who used a Navajo language computer-based program that contained a combination of static pedagogical agent (included and excluded) and gamification practice (included and excluded). There were two criterion measures in this study, a vocabulary acquisition posttest and a survey designed both to measure students’ attitudes toward the program and to measure cognitive load. Anecdotal observations of students’ interactions were also examined. Results indicated that there were no significant differences in posttest scores among treatment conditions; students were, however, generally successful in learning the Navajo vocabulary terms. Participants also reported positive attitudes toward the Navajo language content and gamification practice and expressed a desire to see additional content and games during activities of this type. These findings provide evidence of the impact that computer-based training may have in teaching students an indigenous second language. Furthermore, students seem to enjoy this type of language learning program. Many also indicated that, while static agent was not mentioned, gamification practice may enhance students’ attitudes in such instruction and is an area for future research. Language learning programs could include a variety of gamification practice activities to assist student to learn new vocabulary.

Recent studies have suggested that depression can result from failed emotion regulation under limited cognitive resources. In this work, we demonstrate how reappraisal can fail under high levels of stress and limited cognitive resources using an agent-based simulation. Further, we explored the effectiveness of reappraisal under different conditions.

This research focuses on human-robot interaction using a mechanoid robot that does not possess any anthropomorphic facial features for conveying gestures. Another feature of this research is the use of human-like smooth motion of this mechanoid robot in contrast to the traditional trapezoidal velocity profile for its communication. For conveying gestures, the connection between motion of robot and perceived emotions is established by varying the velocity and acceleration of the mechanoid structure. The selected motion parameters are changed systematically to observe the variation in perceived emotions. The perceived emotions have been further investigated using three different emotional behavior models: Russell's circumplex model of affect, Tellegen-Watson-Clark model and PAD model. Results obtained show that the designated motion parameters are linked with the change of emotions. Moreover, the emotions perceived by the user are same through all three models, validating the reliability of all the three emotional scale models and also of the emotions perceived by the user.","Sial, S.

5419,,"The independent style of scanning and payment at self-service checkouts (SCOs) has resulted in areas for concern. The reduction of employee involvement may reduce the social presence perceived at a SCO. Social presence is when a user experiences the perception that there is another intelligence or entity within their environment (Short, William & Christie, 1976). If customers are not influenced by the social presence of the employees at a SCO then it may affect their behaviour. Using a mixed methods approach, with a combination of qualitative and quantitative data gathering, this thesis investigated dishonest behaviours at self-service checkouts and the effects of a social presence on consumer behaviour. The overreaching research question then guiding this dissertation is: What effect does a social presence have on thefts at self-service checkouts and can social presence be effectively implemented via technology' Three exploratory qualitative (Studies 1–3) and two empirical studies (Studies 4–5) were conducted to investigate issues surrounding thefts at SCO with reference to social presence. Study 1 consisted of in-depth observations of customers within supermarkets to gain an understanding of everyday behaviours associated with self-service checkouts. Both customers and staff seemed to be frustrated at the amount of times the technology did not work properly and the customer would appear disadvantaged when they required assistance. With an understanding of the salient factors and behaviours associated with self-service checkouts, Study 2 then explored SCO staff perceptions of thefts at self-service checkouts (Creighton et al., 2015). Qualitative semi-structured interviews were used to investigate the perceived influence of social presence at self-service checkouts by staff and its perceived effect on dishonest customer behaviour. Twenty-six self-service checkout staff took part in a series of semi-structured interviews to describe customer behaviours with self-service. With respect to actual physical social presence, such as the recognised presence of an employee, staff reported that more customer thefts occurred when the self-service checkouts were busy and their social presence was reduced. To further explore social presence within a retail environment and validate the perceptions from SCO Staff, Study 3 investigated the role of the security guard in terms of their social presence and explored their perceptions of thefts at self-service checkouts. Interviews with 6 security guards were conducted to determine factors surrounding theft as their role is to monitor this type of dishonest behavior. There was an overall agreement from security guards that there were more thefts at self-service checkouts when the store was busy and that there were more thefts at self-service checkouts overall, compared to traditional manned checkouts. The first empirical study (Study 4), consisting of 2 Experiments, considered the effects of a social presence within a self-service checkout interface on user behaviour. This study examined whether a social presence in the form of a computer designed onscreen agent at a simulated SCO, with design features varying in 'humanness', i.e. agents that displayed more or less-human-like features (eyes in Experiment 1, and human shapes in Experiment 2), would have an effect on opportunistic behaviour (cheating) in a simulated checkout scenario. Ninety-one participants interacted with a simulated SCO while their eye movements were tracked via a Tobii TX300 eye-tracker. Hypotheses that predicted a social presence would receive attention and result in fewer instances of theft when integrated within an interface were supported, suggesting that implementing an agent designed to suggest some level of humanness e.g. with eyes, within a SCO interface may reduce levels of theft as customers are likely to notice it. However, Study 4 showed mixed results for the effects of varying agent appearance alone. Research has shown that social presence can also be induced by varying agent behaviour (Burg","Siebenaler, Susan",0,,1942
5420,"An in Silico, Biomarker-Based Method for the Evaluation of Virtual Neuropsychiatric Drug Effects","The recent explosion in neuroscience research has markedly increased our understanding of the neurobiological correlates of many psychiatric illnesses, but this has unfortunately not translated into more effective pharmacologic treatments for these conditions. At the same time, researchers have increasingly sought out biological markers, or biomarkers, as away to categorize psychiatric illness, as these are felt to be closer to underlying genetic and neurobiological vulnerabilities. While biomarker-based drug discovery approaches have tended to employ in vivo (e.g., rodent) or in vitro test systems, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential of computational, or in silico, methodologies. Here we describe such a methodology, using as an example a biophysically detailed computational model of hippocampus that is made to generate putative schizophrenia biomarkers by the inclusion of a number of neuropathological changes that have been associated with the illness (NMDA system deficit, decreased neural connectivity, hyperdopaminergia). We use the specific inability to attune to gamma band (40 Hz) auditory stimulus as our illness biomarker. We expose this system to a large number of virtual medications, defined by systematic variation of model parameters corresponding to five cellular-level effects. The potential efficacy of virtual medications is determined by a wellness metric (WM) that we have developed. We identify a number of virtual agents that consist of combinations of mechanisms, which are not simply reversals of the causative lesions. The manner in which this methodology could be extended to other neuropsychiatric conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism, and fragile X syndrome, is discussed.","Siekmeier, P.

5421,,"A large number of cellular level abnormalities have been identified in the hippocampus of schizophrenic subjects. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain how these pathologies interact at a system level to create clinical symptoms, and this has hindered the development of more effective antipsychotic medications. Using a 72-processor supercomputer, we created a tissue level hippocampal simulation, featuring multicompartmental neuron models with multiple ion channel subtypes and synaptic channels with realistic temporal dynamics. As an index of the schizophrenic phenotype, we used the specific inability of the model to attune to 40 Hz (gamma band) stimulation, a well-characterized abnormality in schizophrenia. We examined several possible combinations of putatively schizophrenogenic cellular lesions by systematically varying model parameters representing NMDA channel function, dendritic spine density, and GABA system integrity, conducting 910 trials in total. Two discrete ""clusters"" of neuropathological changes were identified. The most robust was characterized by cooccurring modest reductions in NMDA system function (-30%) and dendritic spine density (-30%). Another set of lesions had greater NMDA hypofunction along with low level GABA system dysregulation. To the schizophrenic model, we applied the effects of 1,500 virtual medications, which were implemented by varying five model parameters, independently, in a graded manner; the effects of known drugs were also applied. The simulation accurately distinguished agents that are known to lack clinical efficacy, and identified novel mechanisms (e.g., decrease in AMPA conductance decay time constant, increase in projection strength of calretinin-positive interneurons) and combinations of mechanisms that could re-equilibrate model behavior. These findings shed light on the mechanistic links between schizophrenic neuropathology and the gamma band oscillatory abnormalities observed in the illness. As such, they generate specific falsifiable hypotheses, which can guide postmortem and other laboratory research. Significantly, this work also suggests specific non-obvious targets for potential pharmacologic agents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Siekmeier, Peter J.",0,,1944
5423,Second Life as a support element for learning electronic related subjects: A real case,"Looking for more active and motivating methodological alternatives from the students' perspective, which promote analysis and investigation abilities that make the student a more participative agent and some learning processes are facilitated, a practical study was conducted in the University of La Sabana (Chia, Colombia), in Computing Engineering (INF) and Agroindustrial Production Engineering (IPA) academic programs under the guiding question: Is Second Life an attractive tool for students, does it increment motivation, promote participation and facilitate learning processes in electronic related subjects in Engineering degrees? Second Life (SL) platform was then used as a traditional on-site class complement in electronic related subjects. A follow up was conducted with several groups during a year and a half, some students followed the subject with the traditional on-site methodology and others did it following a mixed methodology that combined traditional on-site lessons with virtual sessions trough SL, making a comparison and applying a quantitative as well as a qualitative methodology for the information analysis and recollection. After the specified study period it was found that using SL as part of the methodology, increments motivation toward electronic related subjects, and promotes participation and investigation, due to the fact that this tool makes learning possible in a funnier, more interactive and deeper way than if it had been taught in a master class. Having real-time access from a virtual classroom to all types of audiovisual information, helps more senses get involved in the learning process, making it more effective; nevertheless a weakness was detected related to the attention and concentration: students tend to get distracted, because their classroom is the computer and from there they have access not only to the many worlds of SL but to all the social networks and the Internet in general.

5426,Home sweet virtual home: The use of virtual and augmented reality technologies in high involvement purchase decisions,"Purpose Digital technologies have made it possible for organizations to enhance service delivery and provide consumers a way to experience a product or service before even seeing it in person. Prior work has validated consumer purchase decision-making models like the Engel, Kollat and Blackwell (EKB) model in digital and multi-channel purchase environments. This research aims to explore the various impacts of digital technologies, specifically virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) features, on the different stages of the EKB model in a high involvement purchase decision context. In addition, the use of such technologies is examined as a competitive advantage for sales agents. Design/methodology/approach An in-depth market analysis of VR and AR technologies related to residential real estate is conducted. Then the research questions are analyzed through detailed feedback gathered from 33 prospective home-buyers and realtors in the USA. Findings Insights from buyers and sales agents (realtors in the context of this research) suggest that VR and AR technologies can enhance consumer information search and expedite the time consumers spend evaluating purchase alternatives. As these technologies advance in their customization features, they may also increase the conversion between alternative evaluation and purchase, but only if they are realistic and provide high quality experiences. Finally, digital technologies are viewed as becoming a necessity in high involvement sales contexts, suggesting that additional features or innovative ways to use these technologies may serve as sources of competitive advantage for sales agents. Originality/value This is one of the first research studies to explore the perceived impacts of VR and AR technologies on the stages of the EKB model consumer decision model. It builds on prior work and offers direction for future research.","Sihi, D.",0,10.1108/jrim-01-2018-0019,1946
5427,Miniatures and Animism: The Communicative Role of Inka Carved Stone Conopa,"Andean offerings use miniaturization and synecdoche to enact connections within a relational animism (where people, places, and things participate in an interactive network), allowing the person preparing the offering to make material links between them and more distant, nonhuman entities. Catholic priests working in the Andes during the Spanish colonial period tried to eradicate these practices in which small objects called conopa were used. Conopa included unmodified stones and carved stone figurines, which were understood to be active agents that helped those who were preparing offerings to communicate with animate locales in the landscape. An analysis of Inka and colonial period stone conopa carved in the form of camelids reveals that some of them were produced in an organized system of manufacture under the auspices of the Inka state. This contributes to a discussion of how Andean household rituals have adapted in response to distinct social, economic, and political contexts.","Sillar, B.",0,10.1086/689294,1947
5428,,"This study employed a survey design (N = 119) of special education teachers in order to conceptualize teacher motivations for technology use in the classroom. This study looked specifically at interactive technologies, namely interactive whiteboards and computer tablets. Survey measures included teacher attitudes towards technology, teacher preparation, and teacher level of innovativeness. Further, teacher level of anthropomorphism was also examined. Additionally, this study sought to break down teacher perceptions of interactive technologies to better understand the specific motivations for their use in the classroom. Results indicate that first, overall attitudes toward technology is significantly related to overall technology use. Second, teacher motivations ended up being a simple construct of benefits. Teachers do not think about interactive technologies in a complex way, rather there is a perceived benefit that pushes teachers to use them. Teacher motivations were broken into the following dimensions, perceived educational benefit, requirement, and personal benefit. Third, anthropomorphism is significantly related to overall attitudes toward technology. There was no relationship between anthropomorphism and overall technology use or teacher preparation and overall technology use.","Silva, Erin Ruth",0,,1948
5429,Combining intention and emotional state inference in a dynamic neural field architecture for human-robot joint action,"We report on our approach towards creating socially intelligent robots, which is heavily inspired by recent experimental findings about the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying action and emotion understanding in humans. Our approach uses neuro-dynamics as a theoretical language to model cognition, emotional states, decision making and action. The control architecture is formalized by a coupled system of dynamic neural fields representing a distributed network of local but connected neural populations. Different pools of neurons encode relevant information in the form of self-sustained activation patterns, which are triggered by input from connected populations and evolve continuously in time. The architecture implements a dynamic and flexible context-dependent mapping from observed hand and facial actions of the human onto adequate complementary behaviors of the robot that take into account the inferred goal and inferred emotional state of the co-actor. The dynamic control architecture was validated in multiple scenarios in which an anthropomorphic robot and a human operator assemble a toy object from its components. The scenarios focus on the robot's capacity to understand the human's actions, and emotional states, detect errors and adapt its behavior accordingly by adjusting its decisions and movements during the execution of the task.","Silva, R.",0,10.1177/1059712316665451,1949
5434,,"Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) potentially represent a way to deliver services to the public that would previously have require human staff. Making an ECA available online allows out-of-hours access to information and services, as well as allowing users to access the information anywhere there is an internet connection. As handheld devices grow in popularity and become the primary source of internet connection for many users, it is necessary to examine whether an ECA is appropriate for use on a handheld device, and what factors affect its usability. Over the course of four experiments this research examines how using a handheld device is different from using a PC, how an ECA should be presented on a handheld device, how using an ECA service in a public space affects the experience, and how an ECA should interact with users. It was determined that the usability of an ECA service is not affected by the device on which it is experienced, that on smaller screens or in demanding environments the ECA should be emphasised, and that text should be included in an ECA service as long as the ECA remains intermittently visible. It was also found that usability results from the laboratory can be generalised to the real world, that ECA services are appropriate for all ages and genders, that incorporating disclosure elements into an ECA service is a beneficial feature, and that while financial topics are appropriate to be discussed with an ECA, they are best kept to general rather than personal information. The following chapters present the necessary literary background to the field, before covering each experiment individually, and finally presenting detailed conclusions about the usability of ECAs on handheld devices.","Simmons, Carl Benjamin",0,,1950
5435,CONAIM: A Conscious Attention-Based Integrated Model for Human-Like Robots,"Understanding consciousness is one of the most fascinating challenges of our time. From ancient civilizations to modern philosophers, questions have been asked on how one is conscious of his/her own existence and about the world that surrounds him/her. Although there is no precise definition for consciousness, there is an agreement that it is strongly related to human cognitive processes such as attention, a process capable of promoting a selection of a few stimuli from a huge amount of information that reaches us constantly. In order to bring the consciousness discussion to a computational scenario, this paper presents conscious attention-based integrated model (CONAIM), a formal model for machine consciousness based on an attentional schema for human-like agent cognition that integrates: short-and long-term memories, reasoning, planning, emotion, decision-making, learning, motivation, and volition. Experimental results in a mobile robotics domain show that the agent can attentively use motivation, volition, and memories to set its goals and learn new concepts and procedures based on exogenous and endogenous stimuli. By performing computation over an attentional space, the model also allowed the agent to learn over a much reduced state space. Further implementation under this model could potentially allow the agent to express sentience, self-awareness, self-consciousness, autonoetic consciousness, mineness, and perspectivalness.","Simoes, A.

5438,,"In American high schools, the practice of poetry analysis as a study of language art has declined. Outworn methods have contributed to the trend away from close interactions with the text, to the unfortunate end that millennial high school students neither understand nor enjoy poetry. Digital technology coupled with principles of translation offers a dynamic interpretive model that has the potential to engage high school students in constructive experiences with the high art. Until now, most applications of new technology to literature have served archival or big data purposes. This project proposes that the scientific as well as creative use of the computer also can enhance the reading of a single poem by an individual or small group. Exposing the deficiencies of current pedagogy and considering the promise of emerging non-traditional approaches, it argues for change. The impact of new media on culture and language justifies the digitization of a poem as a linguistic artifact and redefines close reading in digital terms. However, to simply generate data leaves readers unsatisfied. Translation bridges the gap between the scientific and humanistic environments as it allows not only for the microscopic observation of a poem’s technical components but also for the means of associative, collaborative, and inventive thinking about the poem. In digital experiments with Arthur Rimbaud’s “Vowels,” the project traces associations among the poem’s aural, visual, verbal, spatial, and chronological agents. To synthesize and visualize the data, it utilizes electronic mechanisms to create new associations in the reconstruction of the poem in verbal and multimedia translations. This remaking of the poem powerfully and respectfully connects the reader to the original text. The systematic introduction of this method into the study of poetry in high school could, in pleasant and personally meaningful ways, restore to students their literary heritage. The proposal is not without its challenges as resources to experiment with curriculum upgrades are limited and resistance to change is strong. Nevertheless, Remaking Poems contends that developing digital methodologies is not merely intriguing. It is essential to this generation’s obligation to share the soul of its culture with the next.","Simpson, Amy Beth",0,,1952
5439,PROBOGOTCHI: A NOVEL EDUTAINMENT DEVICE AS A BRIDGE FOR INTERACTION BETWEEN A CHILD WITH ASD AND THE TYPICALLY DEVELOPED SIBLING,"There has been a considerable transformation in game preferences of children with the rapid development of information and communication technology. Computer games became the mostly preferred spare time activity for children of different ages. Several studies found that technology, ranging from computer applications to social robots, can act as a mediator to improve interaction for children with social impairments. The contribution presented is an intermediate step which combines the embodiment with tangible and intuitive interaction that social robots can offer and an affordable and autonomous solution as a computer game. Probogotchi is a way to play an educational computer game, where children have to interact with a toy equipped with sensors connected to a PC. The control architecture is built around an artificial homeostatic system for social agents and is set to simulate pet-like behavior, resulting in a dependency on the user's interactions. As such, affective human-computer interaction is achieved. The homeostatic regulation is an autonomous system that uses input stimuli from a tactile and object identification system to detect certain actions originating from the user. If an action is triggered, it will influence the internal needs that are subsequently translated into an emotional state. This emotional state is communicated back to the user by a virtual model showing the corresponding facial expression. For the evaluation section, a preliminary study using Probogotchi as a bridge for interaction between a child with ASD and his typically developed sibling is for the first time described. Quantitative data and qualitative observations are presented. The paper concludes with a focus on the technical limitations and also on future developments and implications for the clinical use of Probogotchi game for children with autism.","Simut, R.",0,,1953
5447,,"The use of virtual doctors is increasing; yet, we have not fully studied their impact and how they are perceived by the public, especially by digitally-marginalized users such as older adults. We also do not know how virtual doctors compare to other technology-mediated alternatives, like traditional telemedicine. More broadly, the factors leading to older users’ adoption of virtual doctors are not well understood. In other similar fields, users’ perceptions of early generations of conversational interfaces have been extensively studied. This raises the question of how virtual agents’ fidelity (e.g. video vs. speech-only) and agency (e.g. human vs. machine) influence confidence, comfort, and ease of use in target groups like older adults. To fill these knowledge gaps, I have conducted a mixed-methods study with older adults in which they engaged with different versions of telemedicine setups. The versions varied along the dimensions of fidelity (e.g. video vs. speech-only) and agency (e.g. human vs. machine). Analysis of interview and survey data shows that older adults were most confident and comfortable with speech-only machine-powered interfaces for general healthcare information, and with video-based link with human doctors for specific healthcare information. The findings also show that in order for virtual doctor systems to be accepted by older adults, they need to do the following: complement older adults’ visits to their existing doctors, fit their existing information practices for gathering healthcare information, and have perceived value compared to their currently available alternatives.","Sin, Jaisie Gi-Zin",0,,1954
5448,,"This thesis theorizes and investigates Reflexive Networking, an innovative conceptual model for online healthcare continuing professional development (CPD) to improve impact on practice and patient care. Recently, financial pressures and the rise of the Internet have triggered a massive growth in online CPD globally. This shift assumes that online CPD causes behavior change and improves practice and care. Normative research on the impact of online CPD has mostly been in the form of positivist or realistic experiments. The evidence shows, however, that current online CPD models are failing. Because they do not affect the agency of professionals constrained by existing and new online structures, these models do not improve impact on practice and patient care. This design failure impels this thesis. I conceptualise online CPD as a dynamic process from Bourdieu’s sociological perspective on practice. Changing practice is an emergent outcome of the actions of various agents interacting across structures. I propose using technologies and pedagogies to enhance professionals’ capacity for agency and improve impact. This thesis critically and realistically evaluates the hypothesised model through an exploratory single case study with a commercial CPD provider. To test the intervention, a tutor delivered an online CPD programme to a small group of 7 doctors distributed across the UK. They had 4 facilitated online discussions over 2 months using a virtual classroom. I interpret data sets from online observations, interviews, and a before/after agency questionnaire-scale into a scientific narrative, with a touch of irony, to enable readers to understand if, how and why the process improves impact. The analysis suggests that in this case, participants’ capacity for agency increased by 13.4%. Participants were more likely to consider changing practice by discussing cases, exploring treatment options, and sharing information, opinions and advice on a targeted topic. Interpreting these findings, the more the process - including the technology – builds symbolic capital and exchanges social and cultural capital that counts as learning, the more likely busy professionals are to spend time online meshing scientific knowledge from clinical guidelines with their judgement and prior experiences, to produce practical knowledge on improving practice and patient care. Effective online CPD programmes should employ technologies and pedagogies strategically to design Reflexive Networking processes across organizations, time and distance and redirect the fields of healthcare and online CPD to deliver on ideals of evidence-based medicine. As one-off one-size-fits-all online CPD approaches such as communities of practice and e-learning modules do not affect the relative allocation of power (capitals) between professionals, educators and managers, they are disempowering. Rebooting Bourdieu for the Internet era disrupts structural boundaries and makes visible the hitherto invisible dimensions of agency for changing behaviour and practice, contributing a theoretically informed practical model to solve an urgent problem in healthcare human resource management. At a time when universal access to healthcare remains a hopeless goal, the dominant biomedical culture that has perverted online CPD to transmit knowledge and skills must be fought. Valuing ethical social relations and moral interactions is critical to produce pleasurable conformity as practice. Future researchers will craft self-regulating Reflexive Networking experiences in various CPD contexts to liberate educators and empower all practitioners - particularly those denied access in remote locations – to learn collaboratively across structures and continuously evaluate improvements in impact on practice and patient care.","Singh, Gurmit",0,,1955
5449,A Micro-Level Data-Calibrated Agent-Based Model: The Synergy between Microsimulation and Agent-Based Modeling,"Artificial life (ALife) examines systems related to natural life, its processes, and its evolution, using simulations with computer models, robotics, and biochemistry. In this article, we focus on the computer modeling, or soft, aspects of ALife and prepare a framework for scientists and modelers to be able to support such experiments. The framework is designed and built to be a parallel as well as distributed agent-based modeling environment, and does not require end users to have expertise in parallel or distributed computing. Furthermore, we use this framework to implement a hybrid model using microsimulation and agent-based modeling techniques to generate an artificial society. We leverage this artificial society to simulate and analyze population dynamics using Korean population census data. The agents in this model derive their decisional behaviors from real data (microsimulation feature) and interact among themselves (agent-based modeling feature) to proceed in the simulation. The behaviors, interactions, and social scenarios of the agents are varied to perform an analysis of population dynamics. We also estimate the future cost of pension policies based on the future population structure of the artificial society. The proposed framework and model demonstrates how ALife techniques can be used by researchers in relation to social issues and policies.","Singh, K.",0,10.1162/ARTL_a_00260,1956
5454,Friendship with a robot: Children's perception of similarity between a robot's physical and virtual embodiment that supports diabetes self-management,"Objective: The PAL project develops a conversational agent with a physical (robot) and virtual (avatar) embodiment to support diabetes self-management of children ubiquitously. This paper assesses 1) the effect of perceived similarity between robot and avatar on children's' friendship towards the avatar, and 2) the effect of this friendship on usability of a self-management application containing the avatar (a) and children's motivation to play with it (b). Methods: During a four-day diabetes camp in the Netherlands, 21 children participated in interactions with both agent embodiments. Questionnaires measured perceived similarity, friendship, motivation to play with the app and its usability. Results: Children felt stronger friendship towards the physical robot than towards the avatar. The more children perceived the robot and its avatar as the same agency, the stronger their friendship with the avatar was. The stronger their friendship with the avatar, the more they were motivated to play with the app and the higher the app scored on usability. Conclusion: The combination of physical and virtual embodiments seems to provide a unique opportunity for building ubiquitous long-term child-agent friendships. Practice implications: an avatar complementing a physical robot in health care could increase children's motivation and adherence to use self-management support systems. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

5461,Topological spatial relations for active visual search,"If robots are to assume their long anticipated place by humanity's side and be of help to us in our partially structured environments, we believe that adopting human-like cognitive patterns will be valuable. Such environments are the products of human preferences, activity and thought; they are imbued with semantic meaning. In this paper we investigate qualitative spatial relations with the aim of both perceiving those semantics, and of using semantics to perceive. More specifically, in this paper we introduce general perceptual measures for two common topological spatial relations, ""on"" and ""in"", that allow a robot to evaluate object configurations, possible or actual, in terms of those relations. We also show how these spatial relations can be used as a way of guiding visual object search. We do this by providing a principled approach for indirect search in which the robot can make use of known or assumed spatial relations between objects, significantly increasing the efficiency of search by first looking for an intermediate object that is easier to find. We explain our design, implementation and experimental setup and provide extensive experimental results to back up our thesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

5464,Real-Time Coordination in Human-Robot Interaction Using Face and Voice,"When humans interact and collaborate with each other, they coordinate their turn-taking behaviors using verbal and nonverbal signals, expressed in the face and voice. If robots of the future are supposed to engage in social interaction with humans, it is essential that they can generate and understand these behaviors. In this article, I give an overview of several studies that show how humans in interaction with a humanlike robot make use of the same coordination signals typically found in studies on human-human interaction, and that it is possible to automatically detect and combine these cues to facilitate real-time coordination. The studies also show that humans react naturally to such signals when used by a robot, without being given any special instructions. They follow the gaze of the robot to disambiguate referring expressions, they conform when the robot selects the next speaker using gaze, and they respond naturally to subtle cues, such as gaze aversion, breathing, facial gestures, and hesitation sounds.","Skantze, G.",0,,1959
5465,Capitalist exploitation without capitalist production: The consequences of imperfect contracting,"On the basis of a static general equilibrium analysis premised on frictionless exchange conditions in competitive markets, John Roemer's General Theory of Exploitation and Class challenges the canonical Marxian account of capitalist exploitation by arguing that unequal distribution of economically scarce productive assets suffices to enable the exploitation of labor by capital. Marxian critics have dismissed Roemer's characterization partly on the presumption that capitalist exploitation requires direct capitalist control of the labor process, but offer no rigorous theoretical or empirical basis for this categorical claim. This paper seeks to advance the debate by considering conditions enabling equilibrium exploitation in capital-labor transactions for which workers control the production process and, as a consequence, capital suppliers cannot directly observe either labor effort or the product of that effort. The formal argument of the paper is animated by reference to the historical literature on proto-industrial forms such as the Kauf (artisanal) and Verlag (putting-out) systems of production, as well as Marx's own analysis of pre-industrial capital relations in drafts of Capital preceding his publication of Volume I.","Skillman, G.",0,10.1177/0951629813511551,1960
5466,Embodied VR environment facilitates motor imagery brain-computer interface training,"Motor imagery (MI) is the predominant control paradigm for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). After sufficient effort is invested to the training, the accuracy of commands mediated by mental imagery of bodily movements grows to a satisfactory level. However, many issues with the MI-BCIs persist; e.g., low bit transfer rate, BCI illiteracy, sub-optimal training procedure. Especially the training process for the MI-BCIs requires improvements. Currently, the training has an inappropriate form, resulting in a high mental and temporal demand on the users (weeks of training are required for the control). This study aims at addressing the issues with the MI-BCI training. To support the learning process, an embodied training environment was created. Participants were placed into a virtual reality environment observed from a first-person view of a human-like avatar, and their rehearsal of MI actions was reflected by the corresponding movements performed by the avatar. Leveraging extension of the sense of ownership, agency, and self-location towards a non-body object (principles known from the rubber hand illusion and the body transfer illusions) has already been proven to help in producing stronger EEG correlates of Ml. These principles were used to facilitate the MI-BCI training process for the first time. Performance of 30 healthy participants after two sessions of training was measured using an on-line BCI scenario. The group trained using our embodied VR environment gained significantly higher average accuracy for BCI actions (58.3%) than the control group, trained with a standard MI-BCI training protocol (52.9%).

5468,,"The case of legislation to ban female genital mutilation (FGM) embodies the characteristics of world polity. Sierra Leone is the only country in Africa that has no formal state policy on FGM, a human rights violation that is practiced among all women initiated into the secret society, as a rite of passage ritual. Constituting a special case in the world model, the lack of anti-FGM legislation in Sierra Leone embodies the failure of the world polity's uniformity. This research uses empirical evidence to document mechanisms employed by the decision makers in a peripheral country to reproduce the international culture at the national level. Using ethnographic data obtained on two research trips at the Parliament of Sierra Leone, the study maps out mechanisms employed by the decision makers to reproduce international culture at the national level. Conversational interviews with Parliamentarians, and observations constitute the empirical evidence that explains the reproduction of resistance against international norms. Institutionalized at the local level, FGM is a ritual of initiation into the female secret society, Bondo. I argue that institutionalization of FGM at the local level enables the members of Sierra Leonean Parliament to effectively avoid passing anti-FGM legislation. Replacing the symbol of the diamond with the Bondo mask of the female secret society as an identifier of Sierra Leonean cultural unity, decision-makers attempt to overcome the challenges of a fragmented post-conflict society by actively constructing the new national collective identity of Sierra Leone. FGM sustains a relatively conflict-free religiously and ethnically stable African nation, constructed as a powerful symbol in the post-conflict democracy. Secret Society women, agents from international non-governmental organizations and the political climate of Sierra Leone influence the ability of MPs to avoid criminalizing FGM. A cultural symbol used to recreate tradition, FGM is at the center of the much needed collective national identity actively constructed in the post-conflict state.","Smart, Nina",0,,1962
5469,,"Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) seek to provide a more natural means of interaction for a user through conversation. ECA build on the dialogue abilities of spoken dialogue systems with the provision of a physical or virtual avatar. The rationale for this Thesis is that an ECA should be able to support a form of conversation capable of understanding both the content and affect of the dialogue and providing a meaningful response. The aim is to examine the cognitive aspects of ECA attempting such conversational dialogue in order to augment the abilities of dialogue management. The focus is on the provision of cognitive functions, outside of dialogue control, for managing the relationship with the user including the user’s emotional state. This will include a definition of conversation and an examination of the cognitive mechanisms that underpin meaningful conversation. The scope of this Thesis considers the development of a Companion ECA, the ‘How Was Your Day’ (HWYD) Companion, which enters into an open conversation with the user about the events of their day at work. The HWYD Companion attempts to positively influence the user’s attitude to these events. The main focus of this Thesis is on the Affective Strategy Module (ASM) which will attend to the information covering these events and the user’s emotional state in order to generate a plan for a narrative response. Within this narrative response the ASM will embed a means of influence acting upon the user’s attitude to the events. The HYWD Companion has contributed to the work on ECA through the provision of a system engaging in conversational dialogue including the affective aspects of such dialogue. This supports open conversation with longer utterances than typical task-oriented dialogue systems and can handle user interruptions. The main work of this Thesis provides a major component of this overall contribution and, in addition, provides a specific contribution of its own with the provision of narrative persuasion.","Smith, Cameron G.",0,,1963
5470,,"This thesis explores how a computer could facilitate emotional support, focusing on the user group of informal carers. Informal carers are people who provide regular mental or physical assistance to another person, who could not manage without them, without formal payment. They save the UK £132 billion per year. However, many carers find themselves isolated by their caring commitments and may suffer from mental and physical health problems. Good emotional support can help reduce the negative effects of stress. We explore how an Intelligent Virtual Agent (IVA) could provide suitable emotional support to carers; how this emotional support should be adapted to the situation and personality of the carer; and how to add emotional context to support messages. To do this, we create a corpus of emotional support messages of different types and devise an algorithm that selects which type of emotional support to use for different types of stress. We investigate whether to adapt emotional support to personality, developing a novel method of measuring personality using sliders. We explore the identity of the support-giver and find that this affects the perceived supportiveness of an emotional support message. We investigate how emoticons add emotional context to messages, developing a proposed set of emoticons that depict core emotions that people use online. We find that gift emoticons can be used to enhance emotional support messages by representing an effort to 'cheer up' the carer. Finally, we explore how emotional support messages could be used by an IVA in six interviews with carers. Overall, we find that an IVA that helps a carer keep in contact with their personal social network and offers emotional support messages would be well-received by carers, but further work needs to be done to implement it within the framework of existing social media.","Smith, Kirsten Ailsa",0,,1964
5471,,"One of the biggest challenges for social robotics is identifying a set of robot features that help improve cognitive performance in human-robot interaction (HRI). Social facilitation is the concept that a person’s performance on a task differs when someone else is present, even if they observer is merely present and not interacting with the person. Performance on vigilance tasks, which are highly cognitive in nature, has been positively impacted by the presence of other humans and even some non-human robots, though the aspects of humanness that allowed for social facilitation had not been investigated. This series of studies examines whether non-human robot agents of varying degrees of humanness can produce a social facilitation effect during a social vigilance task. It was hypothesized that performance with the agents would linearly improve with increasing levels of humanness within the agents, as increased humanness would increase the likelihood of a social facilitation effect. Four experiments were conducted to test this paradigm. Experiment 1, the primary experiment, investigated whether manipulating the level of humanness in agents produced a social facilitation effect that would impact performance on an abbreviated social vigilance task. Results revealed there was no direct linear decrease in the vigilance decrement corresponding with the increasing humanness, but instead equal performance with all the agents except for the humanoid (70% human/30% robot), which resulted in a significant vigilance decrement. Experiments 2-4 were follow-up control experiments to test different aspects of the perceptions of humanness in the agents and its impact, primarily done to investigate the peculiar effects of the humanoid agent, which were hypothesized to either be due to a delayed disengagement or to a cognitive conflict. Experiment 2 tested whether there was an attentional capture of the humanoid agent due to a threat-related delayed disengagement using an objective eye-tracking task. This was done to find out if that agent was capturing attention in a way what would delay subsequent eye movements during a task and was selected due to the manner in which the agents and stimuli were presented during the vigilance task. It was hypothesized that the humanoid agent would result in a significantly higher delayed disengagement than the other agents, which would have accounted for the vigilance decrement with that agent. Results showed there was a delayed disengagement with the humanoid agent, but it was not significantly different from the delayed disengagement with the other agents. Experiment 3 tested whether there was a cognitive conflict resulting from a task-irrelevant but still automatic classification of the agent. The classification of the agents via indirect Likert-scale subjective ratings of select humanness factors (Experiment 3A) and direct human vs non-human classification (Experiment 3B); these experiments were conducted to gain understanding about the subjective perceptions of humanness within the agents, which may be contributing to a conflict of cognitive processing during the vigilance task. This was supported, with the humanoid agent being the only agent to receive ambiguous subjective ratings, ambiguous forced-choice classification, and have significantly higher classification times, all signs of a cognitive conflict occurring with that agent. Experiment 4 tested whether the cognitive conflict found in Experiment 3 has a causal effect on the humanoid agent’s vigilance decrement from Experiment 1. Using the subjective rating task from Experiment 3A as an agent pre-exposure manipulation before re-running the vigilance task of Experiment 1, we were able to test the hypothesis that if the cognitive conflict could be resolved before the vigilance task, the vigilance decrement would be reduced or eliminated. This hypothesis was supported and the humanoid agent had results similar to the other agents along the spectrum.

5472,,"This theory-to-practice qualitative narrative study uses Freire’s (2005, 2011) ideas of pedagogical love to create a Freirean critical social justice approach (FCSJEA). This approach serves as a framework for comparisons, analysis, and discussions of emic themes from the study’s eight participants’ narratives, to etic elements of the study’s Freirean model. The purpose of these comparisons are to determine whether or not, and to what extent, parallels, areas of conversion, or areas of divergence exist between both as well as for identifying possibilities for theory-to-practice applications for this model in P-12 curriculum development, instruction, and learning in contemporary U.S. settings. The study utilizes a methodological bricolage that blends Stake’s (1995) qualitative instrumental design with the qualitative narrative approach found in Clandinin and Connolly (2000) and others. A criterion-based purposeful sampling determined selection of included participants. Findings indicate that the Freirean model offers a useful theory-to-practice approach for transformative P-12 education. There are two sets of recommendations. The first involves a need for scholarly theory-to-practice research similar to this study. This should include diverse participant pools and multiple voices including students, parents and caregivers, teachers, policymakers, school leaders, as well as all other interested parties. The second set of recommendations calls for teachers, all educators, curriculum workers, and education policy makers to utilize Freire’s language of humanization education as starting points for transformative P-12 educational actions. These recommendations call on each of us to become morphogenetic change agents as described by Freire, this study, and Archer’s (1995, 2013a, 2013b, 2016) change process.

5473,,"The navigation of multiple mobile robots or virtual agents through environments containing static and dynamic obstacles to specified goal locations is an important problem in mobile robotics, many video games, and simulated environments. Moreover, technological advances in mobile robot hardware and video games consoles have allowed increasing numbers of mobile robots or virtual agents to navigate shared environments simultaneously. However, coordinating the navigation of large groups of mobile robots or virtual agents remains a difficult task. Kinematic and dynamic constraints and the effects of sensor and actuator uncertainty exaggerate the challenge of navigating multiple physical mobile robots, and video games players demand plausible motion and an ever increasing visual fidelity of virtual agents without sacrificing frame rate. We present new methods for navigating multiple mobile robots or virtual agents through shared environments, each using formulations based on velocity obstacles. These include algorithms that allow navigation through environments in two-dimensional or three-dimensional workspaces containing both static and dynamic obstacles without collisions or oscillations. Each mobile robot or virtual agent senses its surroundings and acts independently, without central coordination or inter-communication with its neighbors, implicitly assuming the neighbors use the same navigation strategy based on the notion of reciprocity. We use the position, velocity, and physical extent of neighboring mobile robots or virtual agents to compute their future trajectories to avoid collisions locally and show that, in principle, it is possible to theoretically guarantee that the motion of each mobile robot or virtual agent is smooth. Moreover, we demonstrate direct, collision-free, and oscillation-free navigation in experiments using physical iRobot Create mobile robots, simulations of multiple differential-drive robots or simple-airplanes, and video games levels containing hundreds of virtual agents.","Snape, Jamie R.",0,,1967
5474,An Abrupt Transformation of Phobic Behavior After a Post-Retrieval Amnesic Agent,"BACKGROUND: Although disrupting the process of memory reconsolidation has a great potential for clinical practice, the fear-amnesic effects are typically demonstrated through Pavlovian conditioning. Given that older and stronger memories are generally more resistant to change, we tested whether disrupting reconsolidation would also diminish fear in individuals who had developed a persistent spider fear outside the laboratory. METHODS: Spider-fearful participants received a single dose of 40 mg of the noradrenergic beta-blocker propranolol (n = 15), double-blind and placebo-controlled (n = 15), after a short 2-min exposure to a tarantula. To test whether memory reactivation was necessary to observe a fear-reducing effect, one additional group of spider-fearful participants (n = 15) received a single dose of 40 mg propranolol without memory reactivation. RESULTS: Disrupting reconsolidation of fear memory transformed avoidance behavior into approach behavior in a virtual binary fashion-an effect that persisted at least 1 year after treatment. Interestingly the beta-adrenergic drug did initially not affect the self-declared fear of spiders but instead these reports followed the instant behavioral transformation several months later. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in sharp contrast with the currently pharmacological and cognitive behavioral treatments for anxiety and related disorders. The beta-adrenergic blocker was only effective when the drug was administered upon memory reactivation, and a modification in cognitive representations was not necessary to observe a change in fear behavior. A new wave of treatments that pharmacologically target the synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory seems to be within reach.","Soeter, M.",0,10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.04.006,1968
5476,,"In this dissertation, an approach on whole body motion optimization is presented for humanoid vehicle-handling task. To achieve this goal, the author built a reinforcement-learning-agent based trajectory-optimization framework. The framework planned and optimized a guideline input trajectory with respect to various kinematic and dynamic constraints. A path planner module designed an initial suboptimal motion. Reinforcement learning was then implemented to optimize the trajectories with respect to time-varying constraints at the body and joint level. The cost functions in the body level calculated a robot's static balancing ability, collisions and validity of the end-effector movement. Quasi-static balancing and collisions were computed from kinematic models of the robot and the vehicle. Various costs such as joint angle and velocity limits were computed in the joint level. Energy consumption such as torque limit obedience was also checked at the joint level. Such physical limits of each joint ensured both spatial and temporal smoothness of the generated trajectories. Keeping overall structure of the framework, cost functions and learning algorithm were selected adaptively based on the requirements of given tasks. After the optimization process, experimental tests of the presented approach are demonstrated through simulations using a virtual robot model. Verification-and-validation process then confirmed the efficacy of the optimized trajectory approach using the robot's real physical platform. For both test and verification process, different types of robot and vehicle were used to prove potentials for extension of the trajectory-optimization framework.","Sohn, Kiwon",0,,1969
5477,,"Emotion modeling is a multi-disciplinary problem that has managed to attract a great deal of research work spanned to a wide spectrum of scholarly areas starting at humanistic science fields passing through applied sciences and engineering and arriving at health care and wellbeing. Emotion research under the umbrella of IT and Computer Science was extensively successful with a handful of achievements especially in the last two decades. Affective Computing is an IT originated systematic research area that strives to best model emotions in a way that fits the needs for computer applications enriched with affective component. A comprehensive Affective Computing based system is made of three major components: a component for emotion detection, a component for emotion modeling, and finally a component to generating affective responses in artificial agents. The major focus of this dissertation is on developing efficient computational models for emotions. In fact most of the research works presented in this dissertation were focused on a sub problem of emotion modeling known as emotion regulation at which we strive to model the dynamics of changes in the emotional response levels of individuals as a result of the overt or covert situational changes. In this dissertation, several emotion related problems were addressed. Modeling the dynamics for emotion elicitation from a pure appraisal approach, investigating individualistic differences in emotional processes, and modeling emotion contagion as a type of social contagion phenomena are a few to name from those conducted research works. The main contribution of this dissertation was to propose a new computational model for the problem of emotion regulation that is based on Affect Control Theory. The new approach utilized a hybrid appraisal-dimensional architecture. By using a fuzzy modeling approach, the natural fuzziness in perceiving, representing and expressing emotions was effectively and efficiently addressed. Furthermore, the combination of automata framework with the concept of bipolar emotional channels used at the heart of the modeling processes of the proposed model has further contributed to promote the behavior of the model in order to exhibit an accepted degree of human-like affective behavior.","Soleimani, Ahmad",0,,1970
5478,,"Teachers are the most important agents in shaping education for students and to bring change and innovation in educational practices. There is a lack of knowledge about how teachers learn and transfer their knowledge into practice in the classrooms. Teacher educators have repeatedly argued that classroom management is a critical pedagogical skill that teachers must master in order to maximize classroom interaction. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of how lower secondary school teachers learn and improve classroom interaction in the context of an educational intervention. Three aspects of classroom interaction are addressed: emotional support, classroom organization and instructional support. The sample contained 81 teachers from 14 Norwegian lower secondary schools reporting, through digital logs, on learning experiences with respect to classroom interaction. Moreover, they reported on the types of learning activities they undertook. Findings indicated that teachers' improvement in classroom interaction was, to a large extent, dependent on their own, or their colleagues' strong knowledge of classroom interaction. The results of the study add to our understanding of teachers' knowledge and skills within classroom interaction and how teachers can improve their knowledge, e.g., through reflection on situations in the classroom. Still, the authors suggest a stronger emphasis on the integration of research based knowledge and teacher learning strategies to support teachers to reach their full teaching potential.","Solheim, Ksenia",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10833-018-9333-4,1971
5481,,"The purpose of this doctoral project was to develop, assess, and implement new phantoms, image quality metrics, analysis techniques, and modeling tools that are appropriate for image quality assessment of modern clinical X-ray computed tomography (CT) systems. The project developed image quality assessment methods in the context of three distinct paradigms, (a) uniform phantoms, (b) textured phantoms, and (c) clinical images. The work in this dissertation used the “task-based” definition of image quality. That is, image quality was broadly defined as the effectiveness by which an image can be used for its intended task. Under this definition, any assessment of image quality requires three components: (1) A well defined imaging task (e.g., detection of subtle lesions), (2) an “observer” to perform the task (e.g., a radiologists or a detection algorithm), and (3) a way to measure the observer’s performance in completing the task at hand (e.g., detection sensitivity/specificity). A task-based image quality paradigm was implemented using a novel multi-sized phantom platform (with uniform background) developed specifically to assess modern CT systems (Mercury Phantom, v3.0, Duke University). A comprehensive evaluation was performed on a state-of-the-art CT system (SOMATOM Definition Force, Siemens Healthcare) in terms of noise, resolution, and detectability as a function of patient size, dose, tube energy (i.e., kVp), automatic exposure control, and reconstruction algorithm (i.e., Filtered Back-Projection– FPB vs Advanced Modeled Iterative Reconstruction– ADMIRE). A mathematical observer model (i.e., computer detection algorithm) was implemented and used as the basis of image quality comparisons. Based on those results, the dose reduction potential of ADMIRE was further assessed specifically for the task of detecting small (<=6 mm) low-contrast (<=20 HU) lesions. Using the same image data as the previous study, a number of different mathematical observer models were implemented to assess which models would result in image quality metrics that best correlated with human detection performance. The models included naïve simple metrics of image quality such as contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and more sophisticated observer models such as the non-prewhitening matched filter observer model family and the channelized Hotelling observer model family. Two textured phantoms (classified as gross texture and fine texture) and a uniform phantom of similar size were built and imaged on a SOMATOM Flash scanner (Siemens Healthcare). Images were reconstructed using FBP and a Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction (SAFIRE). Using an image subtraction technique, quantum noise was measured in all images of each phantom. Two anthropomorphic textured phantoms were designed to mimic lung vasculature and fatty soft tissue texture. The phantoms (along with a corresponding uniform phantom) were fabricated with a multi-material 3D printer and imaged on the SOMATOM Flash scanner. Scans were repeated a total of 50 times in order to get ensemble statistics of the noise. A novel method of estimating the noise power spectrum (NPS) from irregularly shaped ROIs was developed. A series of new phantoms were designed specifically to measure low-contrast detectability in the presence of background texture. The textures used were optimized to match the texture in the liver regions actual patient CT images using a genetic algorithm. The so called “Clustured Lumpy Background” texture synthesis framework was used to generate the modeled texture. The final trajectory of this project aimed at developing methods to mathematically model lesions, as a means to help assess image quality directly from patient images. The mathematical modeling framework is first presented. The models describe a lesion’s morphology in terms of size, shape, contrast, and edge profile as an analytical equation. The models can be voxelized and inserted into patient images to create so-called “hybrid” images. These hybrid images can then be use","Solomon, Justin Bennion",0,,1972
5482,,"Learning-by-teaching has been identified as one of the more effective approaches to learning. Recently, educational researchers have investigated virtual environments in order to utilize the learning-by-teaching pedagogy. In a face-to-face learning-by-teaching situation, the role of the learners is to teach their peers or instructors. In virtual environments, learners take an active role by teaching a computer agent, which is referred to as Teachable Agent (TA). Although the current TA systems have shown their effectiveness on students' learning, there are some challenges associated with learner-computer interaction methods. One of the most popular interaction methods between the learner and the system is a concept map approach. The learner teaches TA by creating information structures by drawing and editing their concept map. However, the learner can teach TA rather constrained topics, such as concept-related materials or causal effects. It is difficult for TA systems to be utilized in different types of learning along with concept-related areas. Therefore, new approaches or methods for communication between a human learner and TA systems are required. This project aims to suggest a virtual learning-by-teaching environment. A communication method (i.e., a symbol manipulation approach) was adopted in this system. The method facilitates the interaction between the learner and the computer agent, specifically for K-12 students' mathematics learning. The design and development process is described, and future research areas are discussed.","Song, Donggil",1,,1973
5483,Participation in Online Courses and Interaction With a Virtual Agent,"Online learning environments could be well understood as a multifaceted phenomenon affected by different aspects of learner participation including synchronous/asynchronous interactions. The aim of this study was to investigate learners' participation in online courses, synchronous interaction with a conversational virtual agent, their relationships with learner performance, and the participation/interaction factor identification. To examine learner participation, we collected learning management system (LMS) log data that included the frequency and length of course access, discussion board postings, and final grades. To examine synchronous learner interaction, we collected learners' conversation logs from the conversational agent. We calculated the quantity and quality of discussion postings and conversations with the agent. The results showed that the frequency and length of course access, the quantity and quality of discussion postings, and the quality of conversation with the agent were significantly associated with the learner achievement. This study also identified two factors that comprise online learning participation and interaction: interaction quality and LMS-oriented interaction.","Song, D.",0,,1974
5486,,"Due to their energy efficiency, heterogeneous Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs) are widely deployed as the engines for modern-day smart devices. As smart devices prevail, heterogeneous MPSoCs have become ubiquitous in our daily lives. These MPSoCs typically integrate a diverse collection of cores, including real-time agents such as the GPU, the DSP and video codec, as well as general-purpose cores such as the CPU. Different from traditional multi-core processors where memory sharing is mostly handled by the cache hierarchy, a heterogeneous system mainly uses DRAM as the medium for data sharing. That makes the memory subsystem, including networks-on-chip (NoC), last-level caches and memory controllers, a frequently shared resource among heterogeneous cores. As traffic streams travel through the shared memory subsystem, memory interference is inevitable, which is even worsened by their disparate traffic patterns. As a result, the memory subsystem plays a crucial role in heterogeneous systems and has tremendous impact on system performance. In particular, the design goal of the memory subsystem is two-fold: delivering end-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) to heterogeneous cores and improving memory efficiency in DRAM. In this dissertation, we explore several design aspects of the memory subsystem for heterogeneous MPSoCs. First, we propose a self-aware resource allocation framework to enable distributed performance monitoring, priority-based adaptation and instant memory response. The proposed framework meets a diverse range of QoS demands from real-time cores. It can also configure itself in runtime to accommodate best-effort cores and real-time cores that are particularly prone to QoS failure. In the rest of the dissertation, we further look into each major memory fabric. We present the single-tier virtual queuing memory controller that maintains a single tier of request queues and employs an efficacious scheduler that considers both QoS requirements and DRAM bank states. Then we study the orchestration between last-level cache controller and memory scheduler to improve memory visibility and avoid unnecessary precharges and row activations in DRAM. At last, we introduce a locality-aware NoC router to prevent row-buffer locality dilution while providing QoS-aware service to heterogeneous cores.","Song, Yang",0,,1975

5491,Decentralized control of units in smart grids for the support of renewable energy supply,"Due to the significant environmental impact of power production from fossil fuels and nuclear fission, future energy systems will increasingly rely on distributed and renewable energy sources (RES). The electrical feed-in from photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind energy converters (WEC) varies greatly both over short and long time periods (from minutes to seasons), and (not only) by this effect the supply of electrical power from RES and the demand for electrical power are not per se matching. In addition, with a growing share of generation capacity especially in distribution grids, the top-down paradigm of electricity distribution is gradually replaced by a bottom-up power supply. This altogether leads to new problems regarding the safe and reliable operation of power grids. In order to address these challenges, the notion of Smart Grids has been introduced. The inherent flexibilities, i.e. the set of feasible power schedules, of distributed power units have to be controlled in order to support demand-supply matching as well as stable grid operation. Controllable power units are e.g. combined heat and power plants, power storage systems such as batteries, and flexible power consumers such as heat pumps. By controlling the flexibilities of these units we are particularly able to optimize the local utilization of RES feed-in in a given power grid by integrating both supply and demand management measures with special respect to the electrical infrastructure. In this context, decentralized systems, autonomous agents and the concept of self-organizing systems will become key elements of the ICT based control of power units. In this contribution, we first show how a decentralized load management system for battery charging/discharging of electrical vehicles (EVs) can increase the locally used share of supply from PV systems in a low voltage grid. For a reliable demand side management of large sets of appliances, dynamic clustering of these appliances into uniformly controlled appliance sets is necessary. We introduce a method for self-organized clustering for this purpose and show how control of such clusters can affect load peaks in distribution grids. Subsequently, we give a short overview on how we are going to expand the idea of self-organized clusters of units into creating a virtual control center for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP) offering products at a power market. For an efficient organization of DVPPs, the flexibilities of units have to be represented in a compact and easy to use manner. We give an introduction how the problem of representing a set of possibly 10100 feasible schedules can be solved by a machine-learning approach. In summary, this article provides an overall impression how we use agent based control techniques and methods of self-organization to support the further integration of distributed and renewable energy sources into power grids and energy markets.

This phenomenon was investigated here with the presence of artificial agents, that is, humanoid robots inthe context of the well-known Stroop task requiring attentional control for successful performance. We expected and found beneficial effects of robotic presence (compared with isolation) on standard Stroop performance and response conflict resolution (a specific component of Stroop performance) exclusively when roboticpresence triggered anthropomorphic inferences based on prior verbal interactions with the robot (a social robot condition contrasted with the presence of the same robot without any prior interactions). Participants' anthropomorphic inferences about the social robot actually mediated its influence on attentional control, indicating the social nature of this influence. These findings provide further reasons to pay special attention to human-robot interactions and open new avenues of research in social robotics.","Spatola, N.",1,10.1007/s12369-018-00511-w,1978
5503,Technologies for intentional learning: Beyond a cognitive perspective,"The concept of intentional learning is well established in the educational community. Intentional learning implies that there is a recognized learning goal and that those involved are rational agents who can make choices with regard to achieving that goal. There are typically two different kinds of people involved in a learning situation-learners and those supporting learners (teachers, tutors, trainers, intelligent pedagogical agents, etc.). It is important to recognize that the goals of learners and those who are designated to support them may differ. Optimal learning occurs when such differences are minimized. A second well-established concept in education is that of engagement. Educational research has established time-on-task as a significant predictor of learning-the more time that a student spends on a learning task, the more likely that student is to master that task. More recently, this concept has been expanded to include initiating and sustaining engagement along with motivation and volition. According to the widely accepted constructivist epistemology, a person creates internal representations (a cognitive activity) to make sense of things that the person experiences, especially things that are new or puzzling in some way. In this paper, we review the logical landscape of the cognitive perspective of intentional learning and argue that it is incomplete without also taking into consideration a more holistic account of human learning that includes noncognitive aspects involved in human experience, somewhat akin to embodied cognition. Our review provides reminders of research-based principles that can inform technology-enhanced efforts to support intentional learning and promote engagement. We conclude with a framework for integrating technologies that are likely to engage learners taking into account a variety of learning goals, situations, and learners. This review is preliminary and intended to suggest areas worth investigating to elaborate a more complete picture of how best to promote and support intentional learning and active learner engagement using available technologies.","Spector, J.

5505,Brokering and bridging knowledge in health and physical education: a critical discourse analysis of one external provider's curriculum,"Background: There has been a proliferation of external agencies knocking on the door' of, and being welcomed into, Health and Physical Education (HPE). This opens HPE up to new products, partners, and services. Although scholarship on the practice of outsourcing HPE is steadily growing in quantity and in scope, there is a significant gap in the literature around how external providers (or outsourcers) of HPE interpret the curriculum, and how this translates into certain kinds of products and services.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to critically analyse one external provider's interpretations of the curriculum and of the roles of key pedagogical agents and stakeholders (e.g. HPE teachers and students), as well as their translation of these interpretations into particular kinds of products and services. This is achieved through a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of Tennis Australia's Tennis in Secondary School (TSS) Program teacher resources and interviews with key employees of Tennis Australia.Methods: The larger study from which this paper draws is a network ethnography of the external provision of HPE. TSS was selected as a case study in the initial web-audit undertaken as part of this network ethnography. The criteria which resulted in the selection of TSS as a case study were: the utilisation of educational language within product descriptions or marketing, provision of services to a significant number of schools, and a rationale for services that included a contribution to HPE. A CDA was undertaken on the TSS advertising, product materials, teacher resources, and the transcripts of semi-structured interviews conducted with three employees of the organisation.Findings: Tennis Australia markets an explicit alignment between their TSS Program and the Australian Curriculum: HPE (AC:HPE). For example, teacher resources are structured to include a Learning Intention' (i.e. a curriculum content descriptor); Focus Questions and Teaching Points' (i.e. pedagogical styles); and Success Criteria' (i.e. self-described assessment criteria'). Significantly, however, there were several tensions and gaps in their interpretations and understandings of the AC:HPE and their approaches to pedagogy and assessment within the subject.Conclusion: External agencies, such as Tennis Australia, are becoming increasingly sophisticated at marketing their products in relation to HPE curricula. Rather than divesting or relieving teachers of curriculum decision-making and design responsibility, however, we argue that these efforts from external agencies mean that now, more than ever, teachers need to recognise, articulate, and enact their pedagogical and curriculum expertise. This will allow teachers to better broker, bridge, and translate knowledge and ensure that HPE remains an educative experience.","Sperka, L.",0,10.1080/17408989.2017.1406465,1980
5508,The cradle of social knowledge: Infants' reasoning about caregiving and affiliation,"Considerable research has examined infants' understanding and evaluations of social agents, but two questions remain unanswered: First, do infants organize observed social relations into larger structures, inferring the relationship between two social beings based on their relations to a third party? Second, how do infants reason about a type of social relation prominent in all societies: the caregiving relation between parents and their babies? In a series of experiments using animated events, we ask whether 15- to 18-month-old infants infer that two babies who were comforted by the same adult, or two adults who comforted the same baby, will affiliate with one another. We find that infants make both of these inferences, but they make no comparable inferences when presented with the same visible events with voices that specify a peer context, in which one adult responds to another laughing adult. Thus, infants are sensitive to at least one aspect of caregiving and organize relations between infants and adults into larger social structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

5511,,"This thesis proposes the design of cybernetic frameworks that attempt to explore architecture as ecology of interacting systems that move beyond the fixed and finite tendencies of the past towards spatial environments that are adaptive, emotive and behavioural. Environments within this framework are attempts to construct interaction scenarios that enable agency, curiosity and play, forging intimate exchanges that are participatory and evolving over time. Interaction understood as the evolving relationships between things allows a generative and time-based framework to explore space as a model of interfacing that shifts the tendencies of passive occupancy towards an active ecology of interacting agents. The work argued here moves away from known models that reinforce habitual responses within architecture, towards an understanding of adaptive systems that are active agents for communication and exploration. Architecture within the context of this thesis is explored as a medium for spatial interfacing. Design is thus considered as durational, realtime and anticipatory exploring human human, human machine, and machine machine communication. The challenge posed is how designers can construct environments that are shared, enable curiosity, evolve and allow for complex interactions to arise through human and non-human agency. Attention thus is placed on behavioural features that afford conversational rich exchanges between participants and system, participants with other participants and or systems with other systems. This evolving framework demands that design systems have the capacity to participate and enable new forms of communication. Beyond conventional models that are reactive in their definition of interaction, architecture here moves towards features that are life-like, machine learned, and emotively communicated. The thesis demonstrates and articulates concepts of participation and behaviour through authored prototypes and real-time experiments. Behaviour is not relegated to a generative process in the design phase; rather it is time-based and conversational constantly constructing models of and for communication.","Spyropoulos, Theodore",0,,1983
5512,,"Automated planning addresses the problem of generating a sequence of actions that enable a set of agents to achieve their goals.This work investigates two important topics from the field of automated planning, namely model-lite planning and multi-agent planning. For model-lite planning, I focus on a prominent model named Annotated PDDL and it's related application of robust planning. For this model, I try to identify a method of leveraging additional domain information (available in the form of successful plan traces). I use this information to refine the set of possible domains to generate more robust plans (as compared to the original planner) for any given problem. This method also provides us a way of overcoming one of the major drawbacks of the original approach, namely the need for a domain writer to explicitly identify the annotations. For the second topic, the central question I ask is ""under what conditions are multiple agents actually needed to solve a given planning problem?"" To answer this question, the multi-agent planning (MAP) problem is classified into several sub-classes and I identify the conditions in each of these sub-classes that can lead to required cooperation (RC). I also identify certain sub-classes of multi-agent planning problems (named DVC-RC problems), where the problems can be simplified using a single virtual agent. This insight is later used to propose a new planner designed to solve problems from these subclasses. Evaluation of this new planner on all the current multi-agent planning benchmarks reveals that most current multi-agent planning benchmarks only belong to a small subset of possible classes of multi-agent planning problems.","Sreedharan, Sarath",0,,1984
5513,,"In many large cities around the world, public transit networks have been carrying an ever-increasing burden of commuters. This has resulted in large movements of crowds in major transit hubs, and high levels of congestion in systems running near or at capacity. In such situations, service disruptions can negatively impact service and transit users well after they are resolved. Currently, transit agencies handle these disruption situations in an ad-hoc fashion. This is due to the lack of a tool capable of analyzing the network-level impacts of response strategies, especially with performance sufficient to handle large-scale systems. Existing tools are limited in their ability to accurately simulate all dynamic facets of the transit network, or model the behaviour of passengers following disruption events. As a result, they do not adequately capture the two-way interaction between crowds and mass transit service, or the complexities of train operation. This dissertation presents Nexus, an innovative crowd dynamics and transit network simulation platform, that enables full simulation of all actors in the transit system and integrated dynamic transit assignment, while being both flexible and scalable to handle large-scale networks. Instead of developing new simulators for surface transit, trains and stations, Nexus enables interfacing of existing simulators together to form a network. An agent-based framework was overlaid to allow for responsive agents, while a virtual communication system permitted on-the-fly modifications to transit service operation. With crowd behaviour in stations key to network performance, new models were constructed to better explain passenger behaviour at two critical locations. First, discrete choice models were developed of passenger choice of stairs versus escalators. Second, a simulation-based model of passenger behaviour on train platforms was developed using a diffusion-inspired approach and accounting for preferred waiting locations. Field data collected across several Toronto subway stations informed both models. Finally, a proof-of-concept case study was conducted on the Toronto transit network. The impact of disruptions of various lengths at a key platform in the network was examined, and an illustrative example was conducted to show how the system could be used to test strategies to reduce impact on transit passengers.","Srikukenthiran, Sivakrishna",0,,1985
5514,,"Neural seq2seq models are widely used to generate dialogue using variations of RNN Encoder-Decoder architecture with maximum likelihood estimation as objective function. Advances in this architecture include introducing reinforcement learning to tune network parameters. This research focuses on generating affective responses in an attempt to create conversational agent that cater to emotional context of conversation. We propose a novel approach using bidirectional RNN Encoder-Decoder seq2seq model with attention mechanism and maximum mutual information as initial objective function combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL). We train our own word2vec embeddings with appended valence, arousal and dominance scores as input. We use an AlphaGo-style strategy by initializing RL system with general response policy learnt from our seq2seq model, which is then tuned using policy gradient method. The internal rewards are Ease of Answering, Semantic Coherence and Emotional Intelligence, incorporated by minimizing affective dissonance between the source and the generated response. We use a two-part training scheme, where we train a separate external reward analyzer to predict the reward using human feedback and then use RL system on predicted rewards to maximize the expected rewards (both internal and external). We use two different datasets namely Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus and Yelp Restaurant Review to train two different models and the affective responses generated by our models are tabulated. We use the standard evaluation metrics like BLEU, Perplexity and ROUGE-L along with the human evaluation to evaluate our models.","Srinivasan, Vidhushini",0,,1986
5515,Evaluation of Head Gaze Loosely Synchronized With Real-Time Synthetic Speech for Social Robots,"This study demonstrates that robots can achieve socially acceptable interactions using loosely synchronized head gaze-speech acts. Prior approaches use tightly synchronized head gaze-speech, which requires significant human effort and time to manually annotate synchronization events in advance, restricts interactive dialog, or requires that the operator acts as a puppeteer. This paper describes how autonomous synchronization of head gaze can be achieved by exploiting affordances in the sentence structure and time delays. A 93-participant user study was conducted in a simulated disaster site. The rescue robot ""Survivor Buddy"" generated head gaze for a victim management scenario using a 911 dialog. The study used pre- and postinteraction questionnaires to compare the social acceptance level of loosely synchronized head gaze-speech against tightly synchronized head gaze-speech (manual annotation) and no head gaze-speech conditions. The results indicated that for attributes of Self-Assessment Manikin, i.e., Arousal, Robot Likeability, Human-Like Behavior, Understanding Robot Behavior, Gaze-Speech Synchronization, Looking at Objects at Appropriate Times, and Natural Movement, the loosely synchronized head gaze-speech is similar to tightly synchronized head gaze-speech and preferred to the no head gaze-speech case. This study contributes to a fundamental understanding of the role of social head gaze in social acceptance for human-machine interaction, how social gaze can be produced, and promotes practical implementation in social robots.","Srinivasan, V.",0,10.1109/thms.2014.2342035,1987
5518,,"Emotions are one of the most proactive topics in psychology, a basis of forceful conversation and divergence from the earliest philosophers and other thinkers to the present day. Human emotion classification using different machine learning techniques is an active area of research over the last decade. This investigation discusses a new approach for virtual agents to better understand and interact with the user. Our research focuses on deducing the belief state of a user who interacts with a single agent using recognized emotions from the text/speech based input. We built a customized decision tree with six primary states of emotions being recognized from different sets of inputs. The belief state at each given instance of time slice is inferred by drawing a belief network using the different sets of emotions and calculating state of belief using a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) based solver. Hence the existing POMDP model is customized in order to incorporate emotion as observations for finding the possible user intentions. This helps to overcome the limitations of the present methods to better recognize the belief state. As well, the new approach allows us to analyze human emotional behaviour in indefinite environments and helps to generate an effective interaction between the human and the computer.","Sriram, Sivaraman",0,,1988

This essay explores how a doing gender approach might be useful for analyzing the interactive dimensions of gender play in the rich communicative environments of MMOs. Specifically, this essay explores how players do (or do not) hold one another accountable to sex category membership through their interactions, in so doing either reproducing or resisting normative forms of gender. A doing gender approach, I argue, holds out the promise of being held accountable to a different set of rules for doing genderof doing gender differently or, in a more utopian sense, perhaps doing away with it altogether.","Stabile, C.",0,10.1177/1527476413488457,1989
5520,Older People's Prior Robot Attitudes Influence Evaluations of a Conversational Robot,"As the population ages, healthcare robots may helpmeet increasing demands for mental and physical health services. However more understanding is required of how to make robots acceptable to older people. This study aimed to assess how older peoples' robot attitudes and drawings were related to their reactions to a conversational robot. We also assessed whether altering the robot's virtual face affected peoples' responses. Twenty participants aged over 55 conversed with a Peoplebot robot for 30 min. During the interaction the robot displayed six different face conditions on its monitor in a randomized order. The six robot conditions varied on two dimensions; (i) facial appearance (humanlike, machinelike, or no face), and (ii) robot gender. Measures included the robot attitudes scale, drawings of a robot's face prior to the interaction, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and evaluations of the robot. Results suggest participants did not evaluate the robot's six face displays conditions differently. However, there was a trend for men to evaluate the robot more highly than women did. Participants' positive attitudes towards robots before the robot interactions were associated with positive robot evaluations after the interactions. Larger drawings were associated with higher systolic BP after interacting with the robot. These findings suggest that, at least in the short-term, people's pre-existing mental models of robots may be more important for acceptance than the human or machinelikeness, or even the presence of a robot's virtual face. More research is needed on gender differences in reactions to eldercare robots. Compared with creating different robot faces to meet individual preferences, promoting positive attitudes towards robots may be a cost-effective method of promoting robot acceptance. Drawings of robots may be a useful, more implicit way of assessing anxiety towards robots in potential users.","Stafford, R. Q.",0,10.1007/s12369-013-0224-9,1990
5524,A nudge in a healthier direction: How environmental cues help restrained eaters pursue their weight-control goal,"Losing weight is a goal for many people, but it is hard to pursue. However, dieting cues in the environment hold promise for improving individuals' eating behavior. For example, exposure to thin, humanlike sculptures by the artist Alberto Giacometti has been found to promote healthy snack choices at a vending machine. Whether health- or weight-related processes drive such effects has not yet been determined. However, a detailed understanding of the content-related drivers of environmental cues' effects provides the first indications regarding a cue's possible use. Therefore, two laboratory studies were conducted. They examined the Giacometti sculptures' effects on unhealthy and healthy food intake (Study 1) and on the completion of weight- and health-related fragmented words (Study 2). Study 1 indicated that the sculptures are weight-related by showing that they reduced food intake independent of food healthiness. Furthermore, the ""Giacometti effect"" was moderated by restrained eating. Restrained eaters, who are known for their weight-control goal, ate less after having been exposed to the thin sculptures. The results of Study 2 pointed in the same direction. Restrained eaters completed more weight-related words after being exposed to the sculptures. Overall, these studies suggest that the thin sculptures are primarily weight-related cues and particularly helpful for restrained eaters. Environmental weight-control cues such as the Giacometti sculptures could act as a counterforce to our obesogenic environment and help restrained eaters pursue their weight-control goal. In this way, they could nudge food decisions in a healthier direction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Stampfli, A. E.",0,10.1016/j.appet.2016.11.037,1991
5527,,"Purpose: (Project 1): Increased interest in the Radiation Oncology Physics community regarding sensitivity of pre-treatment IMRT/VMAT QA to delivery errors has led to the development of DVH based analysis for pre-treatment QA. This paradigm shift necessitates a change in the acceptance criteria and action tolerance for QA. Here we present a knowledge based technique to objectively compare degradations in the DVH to the range from prior clinically accepted plans after adapting to the new patient's anatomy. We apply this knowledge based method to low risk prostate radiotherapy. (Project 2): To address many of the physics challenges associated with single isocenter radiosurgery for multiple intracranial metastases (SIRMIT). Because the Varian High Definition MLC has variable leaf width with thicker leaves located >4cm from the isocenter (0.5cm vs. 0.25cm), this raises the question of whether the dose falloff and plan quality is inferior for targets located distal from the isocenter (>4cm). We hypothesize that such an effect will be greater for smaller targets, and we test this hypothesis and evaluate various isocenter placement strategies including one that favors placement of smaller targets closer to the isocenter. Methods and Materials: (Project 1): DVHs for relevant organs at risk from a population of prior patients' plans were adapted using a machine learning algorithm to establish the DVH range specific to the patient's anatomy. The population of prior plans consisted of 198 (for OARs) and 40 (for PTVs) prostate cancer patients that had previously been planned and treated using IMRT. We then applied this technique to evaluate for single arc VMAT plans the clinical effect of six types of delivery errors: systematic offsets in a single centrally located MLC leaf; systematic leaf bank offsets, random normally distributed fluctuations in MLC position, systematic lag in gantry angle of the MLCs behind their intended position(s), fluctuations in dose rate, and delivery of each VMAT arc with a constant rather than a variable dose rate. (Project 2): 11 SIRMIT plans with the isocenter placed at the PTV centroid were retrospectively analyzed to determine the relationship between relevant dosimetric indices and distance from the isocenter (e.g. relative tumor volume). We investigated three isocenter placement strategies for four prior SIRMIT patients that had larger variations in target volume; these strategies include (1) centroid, (2) Eclipse's built-in method, and (3) an ""inverse center of mass"" (ICM) method that weights the isocenter placement more heavily towards smaller lesions. Three VMAT SIRMIT plans were prepared with and without avoiding entrance / exit geometry through the eyes. Dose was calculate within the TPS and measured on an anthropomorphic phantom using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dosimeters. Results: (Project 1): QUANTEC suggests V75Gy dose limits of 15% for the rectum and 25% for the bladder, however the knowledge based constraints were more stringent: 8.48±2.65% for the rectum and 4.90±1.98% for the bladder. 19±10mm single leaf and 1.9±0.7mm single bank offsets resulted in rectum DVHs worse than 97.7% (2σ) of clinically accepted plans; all other errors fell within the clinically acceptable (2σ) rectum range. PTV degradations fell outside of the acceptable range for 0.6±0.3mm leaf offsets, 0.11±0.06mm bank offsets, 0.6±1.3mm of random noise, and 1.0±0.7° of gantry-MLC lag. (Project 2): Values of conformity and gradient fall-off tended to be of higher quality for larger tumors (>1cc) close to isocenter. Moving the isocenter towards smaller tumors (ICM isocenter placement) yielded increased conformity and decreased gradient indices for these metastases. However, we observed a greater decrease in conformity and increase in gradient indices for larger lesions. Considering arc geometry entrance and avoidance angles for the eyes reduces lens dose from around 0.5-2.3Gy to ≤0.1Gy for a 20Gy SIRMIT plan.

5528,,"There have been numerous attempts to develop 3D virtual agents by applying evolutionary processes to populations that exist in a realistic physical simulation. Whilst often contributing useful knowledge, no previous work has demonstrated the capacity to evolve a sequence of increasingly complex behaviours in a single, unified system. This thesis has this demonstration as its primary aim. A rigorous exploration of one aspect of incremental artificial evolution was carried out to understand how subtask presentations affect the whole-task generalisation performance of evolved, fixed-morphology 3D agents. Results from this work led to the design of an environment–body–control architecture that can be used as a base for evolving multiple behaviours incrementally. A simulation based on this architecture with a more complex environment was then developed and explored. This system was then adapted to include elements of physical manipulation as a first step toward a fully physical virtual creature environment demonstrating advanced evolved behaviours. The thesis demonstrates that incremental evolutionary systems can be subject to problems of forgetting and loss of gradient, and that different complexification strategies have a strong bearing on the management of these issues. Presenting successive generations of the population to a full range of objective functions (covering and revisiting the range of complexity) outperforms straightforward linear or direct presentations, establishing a more robust approach to the evolution of naturalistic embodied agents. When combining this approach with a bespoke control architecture in a problem requiring reactive and deliberative behaviours, we see results that not only demonstrate success at the tasks, but also show a variety of intricate behaviours being used. This is the first ever example of the simultaneous incremental evolution in 3D of composite behaviours more complex than simple locomotion. Finally, the architecture demonstrably supports extension to manipulation in a feedback control task. Given the problem-agnostic controller architecture, these results indicate a system with potential for discovering yet more advanced behaviours in yet more complex environments.","Stanton, Adam James",0,,1993
5529,"If I am free, you can't own me: Autonomy makes entities less ownable","Although people own myriad objects, land, and even ideas, it is currently illegal to own other humans. This reluctance to view people as property raises interesting questions about our conceptions of people and about our conceptions of ownership. We suggest that one factor contributing to this reluctance is that humans are normally considered to be autonomous, and autonomy is incompatible with being owned by someone else. To investigate whether autonomy impacts judgments of ownership, participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk read vignettes where a person paid for an entity (Experiments 1 and 3) or created it (Experiment 2). Participants were less likely to judge that the entity was owned when it was described as autonomous compared with when it was described as non-autonomous, and this pattern held regardless of whether the entity was a human or an alien (Experiments 1 and 3), a robot (Experiments 2 and 3), or a human-like biological creation (Experiment 2). The effect of autonomy was specific to judgments of whether entities were owned, and it did not influence judgments of the moral acceptability of paying for and keeping entities (Experiment 3). These experiments also found that judgments of ownership were separately impacted by ontological type, with participants less likely to judge that humans are owned compared with other kinds of entities. A fourth experiment tested a further prediction of the autonomy account, and showed that participants are more likely to view a person as owned if he willingly sells himself. Together these findings show that attributions of autonomy constrain judgments of what can be owned. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Starmans, C.",0,10.1016/j.cognition.2015.11.001,1994
5531,"'A guy in my position is a government target ... You got to be extra, extra careful': Participation and strategies in crime talk in The Sopranos","This article reflects the trend within the stylistics of drama towards the analysis of film and television discourse by examining dialogue from HBO's popular organised crime drama The Sopranos. A major theme of the series focuses on the consistent attempts of the authorities to bring Soprano gang members to justice for their crimes. To gather evidence, investigators rely on electronic surveillance and surreptitious listening devices worn by collaborating witnesses who agree to testify for the government against their former associates. FBI agents are additional participants in recorded conversations and they perform a range of discourse roles in these encounters. Cooperating witnesses employ a range of conversational strategies to accommodate FBI eavesdroppers', whilst the major criminal characters adopt tactics of conversational vigilance in their crime talk'. Gangsters exercise a level of caution in their interactions which has important implications for conversational cooperation. This article will use Goffman's (1981) participation framework to analyse how recorded crime talk is affected by the presence of investigating authorities and cooperating witnesses. The divergent conversational intentions of targets and cooperators also affect adherence to Grice's (1975) conversational maxims. These seminal models will be applied to selective dialogue extracts from The Sopranos in order to demonstrate that criminal topics of conversation can have a significant effect on the structure and strategies of interactions in a television drama. Characters employ conversational caution when addressing incriminating acts which they consider it unwise to discuss explicitly. In many cases the external television audience is accommodated by being shown these crimes whilst internal overhearers are frustrated by the tactical vigilance adopted in characters' talk.","Statham, S.",0,10.1177/0963947015605442,1995
5532,The influence of speaker gaze on listener comprehension: Contrasting visual versus intentional accounts,"Previous research has shown that listeners follow speaker gaze to mentioned objects in a shared environment to ground referring expressions, both for human and robot speakers. What is less clear is whether the benefit of speaker gaze is due to the inference of referential intentions (Staudte and Crocker, 2011) or simply the (reflexive) shifts in visual attention. That is, is gaze special in how it affects simultaneous utterance comprehension? In four eye-tracking studies we directly contrast speech-aligned speaker gaze of a virtual agent with a non-gaze visual cue (arrow). Our findings show that both cues similarly direct listeners' attention and that listeners can benefit in utterance comprehension from both cues. Only when they are similarly precise, however, does this equality extend to incongruent cueing sequences: that is, even when the cue sequence does not match the concurrent sequence of spoken referents can listeners benefit from gaze as well as arrows. The results suggest that listeners are able to learn a counter-predictive mapping of both cues to the sequence of referents. Thus, gaze and arrows can in principle be applied with equal flexibility and efficiency during language comprehension. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These dynamics give rise to cognitive events, the nature of which is revealed with detailed micro level qualitative analyses which, in turn, unveil unique cognitive trajectories in a problem landscape. The article presents and exemplifies a method for doing so, the Cognitive Event Analysis. This method is based on a ""probatonic principle"" that prompts cognitive scientists to pay close attention to fine-grained particulars in human behaviour.

Linking situational control and human uniqueness concerns to the aversion against autonomous technology","As artificial intelligence advances towards unprecedented levels of competence, people's acceptance of autonomous technology has become a hot topic among psychology and HCI scholars. Previous studies suggest that threat perceptions-regarding observers' immediate physical safety (proximal) as well as their more abstract concepts of human uniqueness (distal)-impede the positive reception of self-controlled digital systems. Developing a Model of Autonomous Technology Threat, we propose both of these threat forms as common antecedents of users' general threat experience, which ultimately predicts reduced technology acceptance. In a laboratory study, 125 participants were invited to interact with a virtual reality agent, assuming it to be the embodiment of a fully autonomous personality assessment system. In a path analysis, we found correlational support for the proposed model, as both situational control and human uniqueness attitudes predicted threat experience, which in turn connected to stronger aversion against the presented system. Other potential state and trait influences are discussed.","Stein, J. P.",0,10.1016/j.chb.2019.01.021,1998
5540,Venturing into the uncanny valley of mind The influence of mind attribution on the acceptance of human-like characters in a virtual reality setting,"For more than 40 years, the uncanny valley model has captivated researchers from various fields of expertise. Still, explanations as to why slightly imperfect human-like characters can evoke feelings of eeriness remain the subject of controversy. Many experiments exploring the phenomenon have emphasized specific visual factors in connection to evolutionary psychological theories or an underlying categorization conflict. More recently, studies have also shifted away focus from the appearance of human-like entities, instead exploring their mental capabilities as basis for observers' discomfort. In order to advance this perspective, we introduced 92 participants to a virtual reality (VR) chat program and presented them with two digital characters engaged in an emotional and empathic dialogue. Using the same prerecorded 3D scene, we manipulated the perceived control type of the depicted characters (human controlled avatars vs. computer-controlled agents), as well as their alleged level of autonomy (scripted vs. self-directed actions). Statistical analyses revealed that participants experienced significantly stronger eeriness if they perceived the empathic characters to be autonomous artificial intelligences. As human likeness and attractiveness ratings did not result in significant group differences, we present our results as evidence for an ""uncanny valley of mind"" that relies on the attribution of emotions and social cognition to non-human entities. A possible relationship to the philosophy of anthropocentrism and its ""threat to human distinctiveness"" concept is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Stein, J.

While this is understandable, it has blinded scholars to profound changes. I argue that what has changed most since the end of apartheid is the relationship between policing and political order. During the late apartheid era, the structure and ethos of the South African Police was animated by the task of containing an insurgency. In the democratic era, policing is increasingly animated by the task of managing conflict in the ruling party. The difference is profound and the implications ripple right to the edges of the police organization, fashioning the manner in which street life is policed and impinging on the functioning and the durability of the detective service. The article concludes by arguing that instruments used in the past survive only when agents in the present find them useful, and that accounts of continuity need to train their analytical attention on the politics of the here and now.","Steinberg, J.",0,10.1093/afraf/adu004,2000

This paper sheds light on the interpersonal relations process in virtual environments from the specific perspective of the choice of upward influence (UI) tactics. We suggest that virtual work settings may impact the UI tactic selected, as well as the communication medium used to enact it. In particular, we study whether the types of UI strategies found in physical environments are relevant in virtual work contexts. This research also analyzes the UI process in virtual work settings, as well as the role of communication media in that process. Results based on the qualitative analysis of the content of 14 interviews suggest that there is an influence tactic specific to virtual work relations. That tactic might be called intermediation and consists of finding an intermediary who is well connected to the target and can help define the best approach for the agent. In addition, workers often split their influence attempts into a two-step strategy in order to achieve better results, taking advantage of the capabilities of the media available for that purpose.

Understanding online human behavior and its relevance beyond the digital boundaries is still an open challenge.

We provide evidence that information flow and collective attention are often driven by a special class of highly influential users, that we name ""augmented humans"", who exploit thousands of automated agents, also known as bots, for enhancing their online influence. We show that augmented humans generate deep information cascades, to the same extent of news media and other broadcasters, while they uniformly infiltrate across the full range of identified groups. Digital augmentation represents the cyber-physical counterpart of the human desire to acquire power within social systems.","Stella, M.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0214210,2002
5548,When humanoid robots become human-like interaction partners: Corepresentation of robotic actions,"In human–human interactions, corepresenting a partner's actions is crucial to successfully adjust and coordinate actions with others. Current research suggests that action corepresentation is restricted to interactions between human agents facilitating social interaction with conspecifics. In this study, we investigated whether action corepresentation, as measured by the social Simon effect (SSE), is present when we share a task with a real humanoid robot. Further, we tested whether the believed humanness of the robot's functional principle modulates the extent to which robotic actions are corepresented. We described the robot to participants either as functioning in a biologically inspired human-like way or in a purely deterministic machine-like manner. The SSE was present in the human-like but not in the machine-like robot condition. These findings suggest that humans corepresent the actions of nonbiological robotic agents when they start to attribute human-like cognitive processes to the robot. Our findings provide novel evidence for top-down modulation effects on action corepresentation in human–robot interaction situations.

5575,Joint Simon effects for non-human co-actors,"Social interactions with non-biological agents and interactions with technical devices have become increasingly important over the last years. Recent studies investigating the interactions between humans and non-human agents showed rather inconsistent results. While the joint Simon effect (cSE) was found to be absent for non-human co-actors like virtual wooden hands, other studies showed pronounced cSEs when the co-actor was a real event-producing object. However, an often overlooked difference between these studies is the way these co-actors delivered response events. Studies replacing the co-actor by event-producing objects used a continuous response mode, while in studies using wooden hands, the co-actor always produced action effects in a task-related, turn-taking mode. In a series of four experiments, we systematically tested the effects of the response mode on the size of the cSE. The cSE was larger when the co-actor produced events in a turn-taking response mode than in a continuous response mode. Furthermore, we consistently found reliable cSEs for different kinds of virtual non-human co-actors (including a Japanese waving cat, scrambled patterns, and a wooden hand), and found no difference in the size of the cSE between human and non-human co-actors. We discuss possible mechanisms explaining why a cSE might be present or absent when sharing tasks with virtual non-human co-actors.","Stenzel, A.",0,10.3758/s13414-015-0994-2,2004

5578,,"Newton's laws are difficult both for teachers and students at all levels. This is still the case despite a long history of critique of the laws as presented in the classroom. For example, more than 50 years ago Eisenbud and Weinstock proposed reformulations of the laws that put them on a sounder, more logically consistent base than is presented in many textbooks without resorting to ""intuitional or anthropomorphic contrivances."" In 1990, Arnold Arons wrote that ""the Law of Inertia and the concept of force have, historically, been two of the most formidable stumbling blocks for students."" One might imagine, therefore, that by 2012 remedial strategies would have resolved these difficulties, but there is little evidence that the problem has been satisfactorily addressed. Diagnostic tools such as the Force Concept Inventory have cast light on areas of difficulty; remedial strategies have included historical approaches, computer simulations, analogical approaches, and many more. Nevertheless, papers on the subject are still being published. Textbook descriptions of the laws have also contributed to the problem: in general the topic is presented with little discussion and the third law in particular is often given cursory treatment. This paper addresses the introduction of the laws in the classroom, especially the order in which they are customarily presented, and discusses particular issues attached to the third law that constitute major impediments to understanding. We have devised a six-hour workshop, for middle-school teachers and senior students, that has achieved some success in enhancing understanding of Newton's laws by adopting a different order of presentation of the laws from that traditionally given in physics texts. Our approach is deliberately intuitional and experiential, as we believe the ideas need to be felt or owned by students before introducing them to a more rigorous formalism.","Stocklmayer, Sue",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.4752043,2006
5581,Seat belt pre-pretensioner effect on child-sized dummies during run-off-road events,"Objective: Run-off-road events occur frequently and can result in severe consequences. Several potential injury-causing mechanisms can be observed in the diverse types of run-off-road events. Real-world data show that different types of environments, such as rough terrain, ditch types, and whether multiple events occur, may be important contributing factors to occupant injury. Though countermeasures addressing front seat occupants have been presented, studies on rear seat occupant retention in situations such as run-off-road events are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the seat belt pre-pretensioner effect on rear-seated child-sized anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) during 2 different types of run-off-road events.Methods: The study was carried out using 2 test setups: a rig test with a vehicle rear seat mounted on a multi-axial robot simulating a road departure event into a side ditch and an in-vehicle test setup with a Volvo XC60 entering a side ditch with a grass slope, driving inside the ditch, and returning back to the road from the ditch. Potential subsequent rollovers or impacts were not included in the test setups. Three different ATDs were used. The Q6 and Q10 were seated on an integrated booster cushion and the Hybrid III (HIII) 5th percentile female was positioned directly on the seat. The seat belt retractor was equipped with a pre-pretensioner (electrical reversible retractor) with 3 force level settings. In addition, reference tests with the pre-pretensioner inactivated were run. Kinematics and the shoulder belt position were analyzed.Results: In rig tests, the left-seated ATD was exposed to rapid inboard lateral loads relative to the vehicle. The displacement for each ATD was reduced when the pre-pretensioner was activated compared to tests when it was inactivated. Maximum inboard displacement occurred earlier in the event for all ATDs when the pre-pretensioner was activated. Shoulder belt slip-off occurred for the Q6 and Q10 in tests where the pre-pretensioner was inactivated. During in-vehicle tests, the left-seated ATD was exposed to an inboard movement when entering the road again after driving in the ditch. The maximum inboard head displacement was reduced in tests where the pre-pretensioner was activated compared to tests in which it was inactivated.Conclusions: During both test setups, the activation of the pre-pretensioner resulted in reduced lateral excursion of the Q6, Q10, and HIII 5th percentile female due to the shoulder belt remaining on the shoulder and supporting the side of the lower torso. The results provide new insights into the potential benefits of using a pre-pretensioner to reduce kinematic responses during complex run-off-road events through supporting the seat belt to remain on the shoulder. This study addresses potential countermeasures to improve real-world protection of rear-seated children, and it provides a broader perspective including the influence of precrash kinematics.","Stockman, I.",0,10.1080/15389588.2017.1312000,2007
5584,,"In this paper we introduce a game-based approach for Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Skills assessment and provide preliminary evidence from a validation pilot study. To date, educational assessments have focused more heavily on the concrete, and accessible aspects of CPS with a diminished representation of the social aspects of CPS. We addressed this issue through the integration of our CPS construct into the game-based assessment “Circuit Runner” in which participants interact with a virtual agent to solve a series of challenges in a first-person maze environment (von Davier, 2017). Circuit Runner provides an environment that allows for controlled interdependence between a user and a virtual agent that facilitates the demonstration of the broad range of cognitive and social skills required for effective CPS. Tasks are designed to incorporate telemetry-based (e.g., log file, clickstream, interaction-based) and item response data to provide a more comprehensive measure of CPS skills. Our study included 500 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk, who completed Circuit Runner, pre- and post-game surveys, and a CPS situational judgment test (CPS-SJT). These elements, in conjunction with the game-play, allowed for an expanded exploration of CPS skills with different modalities and types of instruments. The findings support and extend efforts to provide a stronger theoretical and empirical foundation for insights regarding CPS as a skillset, as well as the design of scalable game-based CPS assessments.

5588,Telling physical education teacher education tales through pedagogical case studies,"This paper analyses two pedagogical case studies (PCS) from a multidisciplinary perspective to highlight the problems of theoretical knowledge in tertiary physical education teacher education (PETE) programmes, school-based physical education (PE) practice and continuous professional learning (CPL) in PE. We argue that a critical view of tertiary PETE and PE teacher educator CPL practice or practices is particularly important if PETE programmes want to develop future PE and current teacher practitioners who are transformative agents. In setting up the pedagogical case study accounts, we recall common conversations about the bodies of knowledge in tertiary PETE programmes that have been positioned as problematic. The accounts highlight the existence of an artificial divide between PE educators as theory generators and both pre-service PE teachers and school-based PE practitioners as theory appliers. We suggest that part of the reason why this divide exists can be attributed to a general misunderstanding of theoretical and practical knowledge that have been wrongly compartmentalised into 'theory' and 'practice', and hence erroneously taught as isolated entities without any connection or direct link with each other, or the former considered to be less relevant and perhaps even irrelevant in practice.","Stolz, S.

Design/methodology/approach - The formal interview took place in front of an audience at the Strong Structuration Theory and Management Research workshop at IAE de Paris, Universite Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne, on 10 May 2016. A recording was made, transcribed, and then edited. Elements from a recorded lecture on the same day are also included. A conversational format is retained to enhance the sense of interdisciplinary dialogue that characterises the research project. Findings - The use of SST as a conceptual methodology is explained, and the use of agent's conduct and agent's context analyses is elucidated providing pointers regarding how accounting research can be developed further by basing the analysis in an understanding of the status and adequacy of knowledge on which people act to produce and reproduce structure. Originality/value - The value of the interview is to provide insights into the process of empirical research and conceptualisation, which are likely to be particularly helpful for early career researchers.","Stones, R.",0,10.1108/aaaj-07-2016-2626,2010
5592,"Complexity thinking in PE: game-centred approaches, games as complex adaptive systems, and ecological values","Background: This article draws on the literature relating to game-centred approaches (GCAs), such as Teaching Games for Understanding, and dynamical systems views of motor learning to demonstrate a convergence of ideas around games as complex adaptive learning systems. This convergence is organized under the title 'complexity thinking' and gives rise to a comprehensive model of game-based learning that addresses theoretical and practitioner considerations relevant to researchers and teachers. Complexity thinking is also partnered with an ecological integration value orientation to reinforce the dominant purposes of game-based learning in physical education. Key concepts: The study of game-based learning from a complexity thinking perspective relies on the foundational alignment of game characteristics with those of complex learning systems. Both complex learning systems and games are (a) comprised of co-dependent agents, (b) self-organizing, (c) open to disturbance, (d) sites of co-emergent learning, (e) open to varying experiences or interpretations of time, and (f) able to evolve their structures in response to feedback. Considering games as learning systems opens the door to consideration of the system being as sustainable and adaptable as it can. Sustainability, adaptation potential, and engagement levels emerge from the 'game as learning system' discussion in order to provide insight into the functioning of the game. High levels of engagement and sustainability are the presented goals for teachers working from a complexity thinking perspective. A number of key concepts from systems literature, such as attractors, affordances, attunement, and disturbances, are discussed as identifiable and manipulatable dimensions of game-based learning. Implications for the PE profession: Physical educators are well positioned to notice learning as it emerges and to construct environments that focus learning without forcing learning. Complexity thinking concepts such as flow, coupling, engagement, attractors, affordances, attunement, and disturbance, in combination with the pedagogical principles advocated by GCAs, provide a robust set of analytical and teaching tools. It is to be hoped that a deepening of understanding of how game forms and game play lead to learning during games will improve the quality of learning experiences in games and foster increasing and prolonged engagement by students.","Storey, B.",0,10.1080/17408989.2011.649721,2011
5594,"Conversation, responsibility, and autism spectrum disorder","In this paper, I present a challenge for Michael McKenna's conversational theory of moral responsibility. On his view, to be a responsible agent is to be able to engage in a type of moral conversation. I argue that individuals with autism spectrum disorder present a considerable problem for the conversational theory because empirical evidence on the disorder seems to suggest that there are individuals in the world who meet all of the conditions for responsible agency that the theory lays out but who are nevertheless not responsible agents. Attending to the moral psychology of such individuals will, I think, help shed light on an important gap in the conversational theory.","Stout, N.",0,10.1080/09515089.2016.1207240,2012
5595,,"Towards facilitating their reception by and communication with human interactants, robots intended for social contexts are often designed with explicit humanlike attributes. However, observation of an “uncanny valley” – a phenomenon in which certain humanlike entities provoke aversion – has lead some to caution against this practice. Substantial evidence supports both of these contrasting perspectives on the anthropomorphic design of social robots. Yet, owing to outstanding empirical limitations and theoretical disputes, the uncanny valley – the nature of its effects, the underlying mechanisms, and even its existence – remains poorly understood. Across three experiments, we thus explored the relationship between human similarity and people’s aversion towards robots via manipulation of the agents’ appearances for both robots (Studies 1–3) and human individuals (Study 3). Here, not only do we establish an uncanny valley in the design space of existing social robots, but moreover, we demonstrate that this valley provokes avoidance (Studies 1–3). Countering a common critique, our findings additionally suggest that the valley is robust to exposure (Studies 2–3). Specifically, while pre-exposure influences participants’ aversion, it did not attenuate participants’ aversion towards valley agents (Study 2). Similarly, we found no meaningful relationship between pre-existing attitudes towards robots and participants’ aversive responding (Study 3). Further manipulation of the agents’ appearances (Study 3) suggests, instead, that this valley effect is driven by inconsistent realism and category uncertainty. Specifically, in contrast to encounters with humanlike but prototypic agents, encounters with agents with salient atypicalities (e.g., a robot with highly humanlike head), as well as difficult-to-categorize agents (e.g., an android robot), elicited significant aversion. The present findings further our understanding of the complex – but impactful – relationship between human similarity and aversion towards robots, while also identifying additional research questions for future exploration.","Strait, Megan K.",0,,2013
5596,Understanding the Uncanny: Both Atypical Features and Category Ambiguity Provoke Aversion toward Humanlike Robots,"Robots intended for social contexts are often designed with explicit humanlike attributes in order to facilitate their reception by (and communication with) people. However, observation of an ""uncanny valley"" -a phenomenon in which highly humanlike entities provoke aversion in human observers-has lead some to caution against this practice. Both of these contrasting perspectives on the anthropomorphic design of social robots find some support in empirical investigations to date. Yet, owing to outstanding empirical limitations and theoretical disputes, the uncanny valley and its implications for human-robot interaction remains poorly understood. We thus explored the relationship between human similarity and people's aversion toward humanlike robots via manipulation of the agents' appearances. To that end, we employed a picture-viewing task (N-agents = 60) to conduct an experimental test (N-participants = 72) of the uncanny valley's existence and the visual features that cause certain humanlike robots to be unnerving. Across the levels of human similarity, we further manipulated agent appearance on two dimensions, typicality (prototypic, atypical, and ambiguous) and agent identity (robot, person), and measured participants' aversion using both subjective and behavioral indices. Our findings were as follows: (1) Further substantiating its existence, the data show a clear and consistent uncanny valley in the current design space of humanoid robots. (2) Both category ambiguity, and more so, atypicalities provoke aversive responding, thus shedding light on the visual factors that drive people's discomfort. (3) Use of the Negative Attitudes toward Robots Scale did not reveal any significant relationships between people's pre-existing attitudes toward humanlike robots and their aversive responding-suggesting positive exposure and/or additional experience with robots is unlikely to affect the occurrence of an uncanny valley effect in humanoid robotics. This work furthers our understanding of both the uncanny valley, as well as the visual factors that contribute to an agent's uncanniness.","Strait, M. K.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01366,2014

The capability to comprehend and produce language in a 'human-like' manner represents a powerful tool for the autonomous interaction of robots with human beings, for better understanding situations and exchanging information during the execution of tasks that require cooperation. In this work, we present a robotic model for grounding abstract action words (i.e. USE, MAKE) through the hierarchical organization of terms directly linked to perceptual and motor skills of a humanoid robot. Experimental results have shown that the robot, in response to linguistic commands, is capable of performing the appropriate behaviors on objects. Results obtained in case of inconsistency between the perceptual and linguistic inputs have shown that the robot executes the actions elicited by the seen object.","Stramandinoli, F.",0,10.1007/s10514-016-9587-8,2015
5606,An anthropomorphic method for number sequence problems,"Number sequence problems appear frequently in IQ tests, where the task is to extrapolate finite sequences of integers. This paper presents a computational method for solving number sequence problems appearing in IQ tests. The assumption that these problems are solvable by humans is actively exploited to keep the computational complexity manageable. The method combines elements of artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology and is referred to as anthropomorphic because it makes use of a model of human reasoning. This model features a set of cognitive resources, a repertoire of patterns that encode integer sequences, and a notion of bounded computation for decoding patterns. The model facilitates the search for patterns matching a given integer sequence by quickly discarding many patterns on the grounds that they are too demanding to decode. The computational method was implemented as a computer program called Asolver and then tested against the programs Mathematica and Maple. On the number sequence problems of the IQ test PJP, Asolver scored above IQ 140, whereas the other programs scored below IQ 100. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

5609,An anthropomorphic method for progressive matrix problems,"Progressive matrix problems are frequently used in modern IQ tests. In a progressive matrix problem, the task is to identify the missing element that completes the pattern of a pictorial matrix. We present a method for solving progressive matrix problems. The method is not limited to problems that are on the multiple choice format, which makes it potentially useful for solving real-world pattern discovery problems that do not come with predefined answer alternatives. The method is anthropomorphic in the sense that it uses certain problem solving strategies that were reported by high-achieving human solvers. We also describe a computer program implementing this method. The computer program was tested on the sets C, D, and E of Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test and it produced correct solutions for 28 of the 36 problems considered. This score corresponds roughly to an IQ of 100. Finally, we conclude that it is possible to solve progressive matrix problems without analyzing potential answer alternatives and discuss some implications of this finding. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

5612,MultiSense-Context-Aware Nonverbal Behavior Analysis Framework: A Psychological Distress Use Case,"During face-to-face interactions, people naturally integrate nonverbal behaviors such as facial expressions and body postures as part of the conversation to infer the communicative intent or emotional state of their interlocutor. The interpretation of these nonverbal behaviors will often be contextualized by interactional cues such as the previous spoken question, the general discussion topic or the physical environment. A critical step in creating computers able to understand or participate in this type of social face-to-face interactions is to develop a computational platform to synchronously recognize nonverbal behaviors as part of the interactional context. In this platform, information for the acoustic and visual modalities should be carefully synchronized and rapidly processed. At the same time, contextual and interactional cues should be remembered and integrated to better interpret nonverbal (and verbal) behaviors. In this article, we introduce a real-time computational framework, MultiSense, which offers flexible and efficient synchronization approaches for context-based nonverbal behavior analysis. MultiSense is designed to utilize interactional cues from both interlocutors (e.g., from the computer and the human participant) and integrate this contextual information when interpreting nonverbal behaviors. MultiSense can also assimilate behaviors over a full interaction and summarize the observed affective states of the user. We demonstrate the capabilities of the new framework with a concrete use case from the mental health domain where MultiSense is used as part of a decision support tool to assess indicators of psychological distress such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this scenario, MultiSense not only infers psychological distress indicators from nonverbal behaviors but also broadcasts the user state in real-time to a virtual agent (i.e., a digital interviewer) designed to conduct semi-structured interviews with human participants. Our experiments show the added value of our multimodal synchronization approaches and also demonstrate the importance of MultiSense contextual interpretation when inferring distress indicators.","Stratou, G.",0,10.1109/taffc.2016.2614300,2018
5614,The Subject and the World: Educational challenges,"The paper explores the notion of the subject' in the context of education as an alternative to more limited concepts such as the student or learner. Drawing on the thought of Cornelius Castoriadis, the subject under consideration is a conscious, self-reflective subject that organizes and modifies itself in relation to a world of significations. Through the capacity for conscious self-modification, the subject becomes a self-reflective agent in a socially instituted world of significations. For Castoriadis, this kind of subjectivity is not readily available in every kind of social organization; rather, it is a possible product of a society that has instituted itself explicitly or autonomously. This socially instituted reflexivity is for Castoriadis historically associated with democracy, politics and philosophy. In the second part, the discussion is extended to the non-human realm and the world of the living being. Here, too, meaningor proto-meaning in the case of the living beingis a constituent in the formation of a world. In this discussion, where Francisco Varela is an important source, concepts such as meaning, signification, normativity and purpose are introduced in the natural sciences, or rather, the sciences of human and non-human nature. The aim of the paper is twofold: on the one hand, to introduce pedagogical reflections into discussions about human on non-human nature; and, on the other, to develop a richer conceptual repertoire for exploring educational phenomena than what is immediately available. An important background, in both cases, is the possibility of ecological crisis, which poses new problems for educators.","Straume, I. S.",0,10.1080/00131857.2014.951596,2019
5615,A robotics-based approach to modeling of choice reaching experiments on visual attention,"The paper presents a robotics-based model for choice reaching experiments on visual attention. In these experiments participants were asked to make rapid reach movements toward a target in an odd-color search task, i.e., reaching for a green square among red squares and vice versa (e.g., Song and Nakayama, 2008). Interestingly these studies found that in a high number of trials movements were initially directed toward a distractor and only later were adjusted toward the target. These ""curved"" trajectories occurred particularly frequently when the target in the directly preceding trial had a different color (priming effect). Our model is embedded in a closed-loop control of a LEGO robot arm aiming to mimic these reach movements. The model is based on our earlier work which suggests that target selection in visual search is implemented through parallel interactions between competitive and cooperative processes in the brain (Heinke and Humphreys, 2003; Heinke and Backhaus, 2011). To link this model with the control of the robot arm we implemented a topological representation of movement parameters following the dynamic field theory (Erlhagen and Schoener, 2002). The robot arm is able to mimic the results of the odd-color search task including the priming effect and also generates human-like trajectories with a bell-shaped velocity profile. Theoretical implications and predictions are discussed in the paper.","Strauss, S.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00105,2020
5617,The Social Perception of Humanoid and Non-Humanoid Robots: Effects of Gendered and Machinelike Features,"Previous research has shown that features of synthetic robot faces suggesting social categories produce predictable and consequential social judgments. Artificial robot faces that are feminine (versus masculine) and humanlike (versus machinelike) have been shown to be judged as warmer and to produce relatively higher levels of comfort, resulting in positive evaluations and a greater desire for engagement. Two studies pursued these questions using images of real robots. In Study 1, images of existing robots were used to manipulate gendered features and machineness. Study 2 used an assortment of images of real robots including non-humanoid exemplars that vary naturally in gendered features and machineness. Consistent results emerged from the two studies. In both studies, robots were evaluated more positively and produced a greater desire for contact to the degree that they were seen as humanlike and feminine. These results attest to the importance of social factors in predicting responses to robots. Implications for robot design and future research are discussed.","Stroessner, S.

But is this still the case when deceivers interact with a virtual avatar? The present research investigated whether the mere ""belief"" that the virtual avatar is computer or human operated forms a crucial factor for eliciting physiological cues to deception. Participants were interviewed about a transgression they had been seduced to commit, by a human-like virtual avatar. In a between-subject design, participants either deceived or told the truth about this transgression. During the interviews, we measured the physiological responses assessing participants' electrodermal activity (FDA). In line with our hypothesis, FDA differences between deceivers and truth tellers only were significant for participants who believed they interacted with a human operated (compared to a computer operated) avatar. These results have theoretical as well as practical implications which we will discuss.","Strofer, S.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00545,2022

This study explored the effects of using transparent whiteboards, which allow the instructor to stand behind a transparent glass board and face the students to write and draw while providing a concurrent explanation of the material. Specifically, the affordances of transparent whiteboard lessons might better follow design principles of multimedia learning and foster social agency compared to conventional whiteboard lessons, thereby promoting learning. In two experiments, college students viewed a 20-min Organic Chemistry video lecture with the instructor using either a conventional whiteboard or a transparent whiteboard. Results indicated that students who viewed transparent whiteboard lessons performed better on immediate posttests (Experiment 1 and 2) at interpreting the configuration of spatial diagrams and at explaining key concepts. Students viewing transparent whiteboard lessons also reported more positive ratings of their lecture experience. However, Experiment 2 indicated that the benefits of learning from transparent whiteboards did not persist on a delayed posttest.

We tested whether instructor presence is better afforded through methods that increase students' access to the instructor's eye gaze, thereby enhancing learning through increased social agency. Specifically, we compared the eye-gaze behavior of college students who viewed an organic chemistry video lecture with the instructor using either a conventional whiteboard or a transparent whiteboard. These lecture methods differ in the degree to which they allow students to view the instructor's eye gaze. Using eye-tracking methods, we compared students' attention to the instructor's head during direct gaze events (i.e., when the instructor looked into the camera) and gaze guidance events (i.e., when the instructor looked at the whiteboard), and to the written and drawn information on the whiteboard. Results show that students who viewed a transparent whiteboard lecture attended more to the instructor and less to the material drawn on the board than students who viewed a conventional whiteboard lecture. The transparent group also performed equivalently to the conventional group on learning performance. Overall, this study demonstrates that the instructor's presence can compete with words and visuals drawn on the board by the instructor for students' attention.","Stull, A.

5637,,"This study is concerned with the concept of autonomy in intercultural language learning, understood here as the capacity to take responsibility for one’s own language and intercultural development. It examines how such autonomy can be developed among international students in the foreign language classroom as a means of helping this student group to maximise the potential for language and intercultural development that study abroad offers. To investigate this issue, a qualitative case study was designed which involved 30 international students learning English in a higher education institution in Ireland over a period of one semester. The research drew on a variety of methods, including classroom observations, focus group and individual interviews as well as documents. The data were analysed by means of a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software called NVivo8. The results suggest that it is possible to implement an approach to learner autonomy that not only gives justice to its multifaceted nature, but also incorporates the concept of intercultural competence. More specifically, it is argued that international students should be given the opportunity to manage their intercultural language learning, develop metacognitive knowledge in relation to this process, work collaboratively with others to develop intercultural interdependence and realise their potential as agents for change. Furthermore, the study highlights the relevance of tools, activities and approaches that can be used by the teacher to support the development of autonomy in intercultural language learning. These include: an interculturally enhanced version of the European Language Portfolio, reflection, collaborative learning and a critical pedagogical approach. While the potential and merit of the above are highlighted, their weaknesses, as viewed from an international student perspective, are also discussed. In addition, learner-related factors that may adversely affect student engagement with this approach are also analysed. Finally, drawing on the case study findings, the study suggests a set of criteria that need to be met if foreign language courses are to develop autonomy in intercultural language learning among this student population.","Sudhershan, Aleksandra",0,,2026
5638,,"Negotiation mechanism using conversational agents (chatbots) has been used in Open Learner Models (OLM) to enhance learner model accuracy and provide opportunities for learner reflection. Using chatbots that allow for natural language discussions has shown positive learning gains in students. Traditional OLMs assume a learner to be able to manage their own learning and already in an appropriate affective/behavioral state that is conducive for learning. This paper proposes a new perspective of learning that advances the state of the art in fully-negotiated OLMs by exploiting learner’s affective & behavioral states to generate engaging natural language dialogues that train them to enhance their metacognitive skills. In order to achieve this, we have developed the NDLtutor that provides a natural language interface to learners. Our system generates context-aware dialogues automatically to enhance learner participation and reflection. This paper provides details on the design and implementation of the NDLtutor and discusses two evaluation studies. The first evaluation study focuses on the dialogue management capabilities of our system and demonstrates that our dialog system works satisfactorily to realize meaningful and natural interactions for negotiation. The second evaluation study investigates the effects of our system on the self-assessment and self-reflection of the learners. The results of the evaluations show that the NDLtutor is able to produce significant improvements in the self-assessment accuracy of the learners and also provides adequate support for prompting self-reflection in learners.

Questions are believed to play a crucial role in a variety of cognitive faculties, including comprehension and reasoning. Available research suggests that learning how to ask good questions should be taught at an early age but all ages benefit from question generation training. Sadly, consistent with the research coming out of self-regulation, it is well documented that the ideal scenario of a curious question asker does not match reality. Students are unspectacular at monitoring their own knowledge deficits and their question generation is both infrequent and unsophisticated. Given that many teachers and school districts do not have the resources to provide individualized question training to students, the current study sought to explore the benefits of using animated pedagogical agents to teach question asking skills in a relatively short amount of time (approximately 25 minutes).

5645,,"The purpose of this thesis is to make advances in the design of humanoid bipedal running robots. We focus on achieving dynamic running locomotion because it is one metric by which we can measure how far robotic technologies have advanced, in relation to existing benchmarks set by humans and other animals. Designing a running human-inspired robot is challenging because human bodies are exceptionally complex mechanisms to mimic. There are only a few humanoid robots designed specifically for running and the existing robots are either constrained to a plane, do not yet exhibit human-like motion, or are unstable. One aspect of bipedal running dynamics that could be understood better, and could improve the performance of these robots, is the role of foot placement in the transverse plane, via rotation of the hip, in the sagittal and coronal planes. To achieve this objective, I have developed and studied a running simulation, designed and built a bipedal running robot, and then conducted an experimental study on the effects of step width on overall whole-body locomotion dynamics. The planar running simulation investigates foot placement in the sagittal plane, by changing the angle of the hip at the beginning of each stance phase. The model effectively mimics a human-like response to a horizontal or vertical velocity disturbance while running. This is achieved by implementing a controller which changes the hip angle at touch down and by using the energy of the system as control feedback. This controller effectively reduces the time required to recover from a perturbation, reduces the overall energy expended recovering from a perturbation, and allows the legged model to function at significantly lower torque values. The bipedal running robot is designed as a research platform for systematic investigation of key mechanisms and control methods, in order to progressively move towards a more biologically accurate and stable running robot. The result of this design is a simple, lightweight, and powerful research platform which can easily be expanded on in order to systematically study the effects of individual parameters. The step width study investigates the effects of step width in the coronal plane on a 3D 1DOF per leg bipedal running gait. The results of this study help to confirm biological hypothesis on how stable running is achieved and suggests the next steps in moving towards a more biologically correct 3D running robot. A range of step widths were found for which stable locomotion existed, where stability is empirically assessed by checking if a run surpasses 20 steps. The smallest step width studied exhibited unstable rolling behavior, which confirms previous theory stating that dimensionless inertia, a function of step width and mass moment of inertia, effects roll stability. Similarly, yaw stability was observed to increase with wider step widths. The inability to stabilize roll and yaw for narrow step widths is consistent with biological studies where roll and yaw stability are thought to be mainly achieved by active use of the upper body. The widest step width studied exhibited unstable behavior in pitch. Pitching could be significantly impacted by lateral ground reaction forces, the distance from the hip to the center of mass, and changes in the relative magnitudes of roll, pitch, and yaw inertias. It was found that lateral ground reaction forces increase and the vertical distance from hip to center of mass decreases with increasing step width. Further, the magnitude of yaw inertia gets closer to that of pitch. The convergence of these factors suggest that a presently unidentified coupling in roll, pitch, and yaw occurs that yields the observed behavior for wide step widths.","Sullivan, Timothy",0,,2029
5646,Minimal Human Design Approach for sonzai-kan Media: Investigation of a Feeling of Human Presence,"Even though human-like robotic media give the feeling of being with others and positively affect our physical and mental health, scant research has addressed how much information about a person should be reproduced to enhance the feeling of a human presence. We call this feeling sonzai-kan, which is a Japanese phrase that means the feeling of a presence. We propose a minimal design approach for exploring the requirements to enhance this feeling and hypothesize that it is enhanced if information is presented from at least two different modalities.

5651,Resilience Evaluation Framework for Integrated Civil Infrastructure-Community Systems under Seismic Hazard,"Seismic resilience of civil infrastructure systems is an essential property of modern communities. In this paper, an agent-based modeling framework to evaluate the seismic resilience of an integrated system consisting of the community and its civil infrastructure systems is proposed. Specifically, an agent-based model of the recovery process of civil infrastructure systems is incorporated into a previously developed compositional supply/demand seismic-resilience quantification framework. The proposed model represents the behavior of the operators of civil infrastructure systems as they strive to recover their functionality in the aftermath of an earthquake as well as their mutual interactions and interactions with the community to which they provide services. A case study of the seismic resilience of a virtual system consisting of electric power supply system, transportation system, and the community (EPSS-TS-community system) is conducted using the proposed framework. A parametric investigation is carried out to examine the effect of different earthquake magnitude scenarios as well as different behaviors of the involved agents and their interaction on the seismic resilience of the EPSS-TS-community system. It was demonstrated that the proposed agent-based modeling approach is effective in representing the interactions among different participants in the recovery process. It was also revealed that timely and well-planned intervention in the recovery process can be very effective in alleviating the postearthquake lack of resilience resulting from the insufficient supply of civil infrastructure services to meet the community's demands. Therefore, the proposed framework could be employed to formulate the recovery trajectory of the intertwined sociotechnical system subjected to different earthquake scenarios. The interplay among different agents, as well as the interdependence among civil infrastructure systems, is found to profoundly shape the recovery path for this integrated EPSS-TS-community system.","Sun, L.",0,10.1061/(asce)is.1943-555x.0000492,2031
5654,Optimal profit sharing mechanisms with type-dependent outside options,"This study considers a principal using a profit sharing mechanism to select one among multiple agents with type-dependent outside options to operate a project. Under mild conditions, we fully characterize revenue-maximizing profit sharing mechanisms. Moreover, we show that if the monotonicity of the virtual valuation holds, then optimal sharing mechanisms can be implemented by the first- and second-price share auctions with an optimally chosen reserve price. We further find that the principal's expected revenue improves as outside options diminish and break-even shares become less responsive. When outside options are linear in types, full surplus extraction is obtained. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Sun, W. Q.",0,10.1016/j.jmateco.2017.12.007,2032
5657,,"Analysis of facial expressions is an active topic of research with many potential applications, since the human face plays a significant role in conveying a person’s mental state. Due to the practical values it brings, scientists and researchers from different fields such as psychology, finance, marketing, and engineering have developed significant interest in this area. Hence, there are more of a need than ever for the intelligent tool to be employed in the emotional Human-Computer Interface (HCI) by analyzing facial expressions as a better alternative to the traditional devices such as the keyboard and mouse. The face is a window of human mind. The examination of mental states explores the human’s internal cognitive states. A facial emotion recognition system has a potential to read people’s minds and interpret the emotional thoughts to the world. High rates of recognition accuracy of facial emotions by intelligent machines have been achieved in existing efforts based on the benchmarked databases containing posed facial emotions. However, they are not qualified to interpret the human’s true feelings even if they are recognized. The difference between posed facial emotions and spontaneous ones has been identified and studied in the literature. One of the most interesting challenges in the field of HCI is to make computers more human-like for more intelligent user interfaces. In this dissertation, a Regional Hidden Markov Model (RHMM) based facial emotion recognition system is proposed. In this system, the facial features are extracted from three face regions: the eyebrows, eyes and mouth. These regions convey relevant information regarding facial emotions. As a marked departure from prior work, RHMMs for the states of these three distinct face regions instead of the entire face for each facial emotion type are trained. In the recognition step, regional features are extracted from test video sequences. These features are processed according to the corresponding RHMMs to learn the probabilities for the states of the three face regions. The combination of states is utilized to identify the estimated emotion type of a given frame in a video sequence. An experimental framework is established to validate the results of such a system. RHMM as a new classifier emphasizes the states of three facial regions, rather than the entire face. The dissertation proposes the method of forming observation sequences that represent the changes of states of facial regions for training RHMMs and recognition. The proposed method is applicable to the various forms of video clips, including real-time videos. The proposed system shows the human-like capability to infer people’s mental states from moderate level of facial spontaneous emotions conveyed in the daily life in contrast to posed facial emotions. Moreover, the extended research work associated with the proposed facial emotion recognition system is forwarded into the domain of finance and biomedical engineering, respectively. CEO’s fear facial emotion has been found as the strong and positive predictor to forecast the firm stock price in the market. In addition, the experiment results also have demonstrated the similarity of the spontaneous facial reactions to stimuli and inner affective states translated by brain activity. The results revealed the effectiveness of facial features combined with the features extracted from the signals of brain activity for multiple signals correlation analysis and affective state classification.","Sun, Yanjia",0,,2033
5658,Cheery companions or serious assistants? Role and demeanor congruity as predictors of robot attraction and use intentions among senior citizens,"Using a robot designed for senior citizens in a retirement home setting, an experiment (N=51) was conducted to investigate whether variations in the role (companion vs. assistant) and social demeanor (playful vs. serious) of a robot influence senior citizens' perceptions of the robot's social attractiveness, intelligence, anxiety, and eeriness. Results show that assistant robots are perceived as more socially attractive and intelligent when their demeanor is playful rather than serious. In addition, companion robots are evaluated as less anxious and less eerie when their personality is serious rather than playful. Finally, companion robots with a serious demeanor have a positive indirect effect on robot use intentions via heightened perceptions of intelligence and social attractiveness, while assistant robots with a playful demeanor have a positive indirect effect on intentions via lower perceptions of anxiety. The implications of our findings for human-robot interaction and the design of socially assistive robotics are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Sundar, S.

While AARON has been hailed as one of the most creative AI programs, Cohen consistently rejects the claims of machine creativity. Questioning the possibility for AI to model human creativity, Cohen suggests in so many words that the human mind takes a different route to creativity, a route that privileges the relational, rather than the computational, dimension of cognition. This unique perspective on the tangled web of mind, machine, and creativity is explored by an application of three relational models of the mind to an analysis of Cohen's talks and writings, which are available on his website: .","Sundararajan, L.",0,10.1002/jocb.44,2035
5663,Designing engaging intelligent tutoring systems in an age of cognitive computing,"Advances in human computer interaction (HCI) are enabling increasingly more human-like interactions with computers. In this position paper, we explore the impact of several such advances in HCI on the design of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), with the hypothesis that such systems may drive deeper engagement and hence improve learning outcomes. Researchers have made claims regarding learning gains resulting from self-explanations, frequent addressing of errors and impasses, rich natural language understanding and dialog, appropriate degree of interactivity, and use of multiple representations. However, many studies on current ITSs that have embodied one or more of the above features are showing little to no discernible impact on learning. This is possibly partly due to the poor user experience. Our tutoring system is aimed at addressing learning challenges for K-12 students, by integrating a suite of differentiating technologies around interactivity, dialog, automated question generation, and learning analytics. In this paper, we first review learning theories and insights gleaned from prior research on ITSs that have inspired our design. We then describe the functional architecture of our tutoring system, followed by a preliminary report on the status of the prototype currently being built.","Sundararajan, S.

5665,Where will the triangle look for it? Attributing false beliefs to a geometric shape at 17 months,"Prior research on implicit mind-reading skills has focussed on how infants anticipate other persons actions. This study investigated whether 11- and 17-month-olds spontaneously attribute false beliefs (FB) even to a simple animated geometric shape. Infants were shown a triangle chasing a disk through a tunnel. Using an eye-tracker, we found that 17-month-olds in a change-of-location true belief (TB) task anticipated that the triangle would search for the disk in the correct place while in a FB test they anticipated that it would search for it in the wrong, belief congruent place. These results suggest that 17-month-olds psychological-reasoning system is applied to the actions of unfamiliar agents and it is employed to anticipate agents actions even in the absence of any morphological features that are typical of natural agents. These findings provide support for theoretical accounts that emphasize continuity in the development of theory of mind core concepts and belief reasoning skills.","Surian, L.",0,10.1111/j.2044-835X.2011.02046.x,2037
5667,,"In Japan, children's transition between kindergarten and elementary school is often rough. Because this difficulty may stem in part from differences in teachers' beliefs about how young children should be educated, I examined kindergarten and elementary-school teachers’ views. I began by reanalyzing data from Akita et al (2007), who asked 57 kindergarten teachers and 60 elementary-school teachers to rate the contribution of six videotaped activities (three in a kindergarten, three in an elementary school) to children’s physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. Kindergarten teachers are inclined to view each activity as affecting multiple domains of development; elementary-school teachers, a single domain. Attuning measurement to what Stephenson (1953, p. 48) termed “ intra-individual ‘significance’,” I recalibrated teachers' 24 questionnaire responses into self-normed, within-person Z scores, distilling the relative importance that each teacher attached to each item. I then calculated the Euclidean distance in these 24 dimensions between each pair of teachers—resulting distances being small for similarly responding teachers. Information in this array of paired teachers proved amenable to simplification by Monotonic Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to two inferred continuums: (1) preferences for intrinsically motivating, self-initiated activity ( Intrinsic Framing) versus activity spurred by external agents—peer group, teachers, society, or curriculum (Extrinsic Framing), and (2) the visibility with which a teacher exercises power—ranging from deliberate passivity to encourage children's initiatives or discreet social engineering (Low Profile) to obvious activity either alongside children as a knowledgeable partner or above children as a lecturer, coach, or tour guide (High Profile). Crossing these two MDS-inferred dimensions, I identified, recruited, and interviewed four groups of teachers who differed discernibly in pedagogical beliefs. Intrinsically-Framing, Low-Profile teachers emphasized child-centeredness, children's autonomy, and hope. Intrinsically-Framing, High-Profile teachers were cheerleaders of children's social interaction. Extrinsically-Framing, Low-Profile teachers emphasized group-oriented goals and activities and preferred to discreetly coordinate children's social interactions. Extrinsically-Framing, High-Profile teachers preferred skill-oriented teaching and teacher-directedness. Both kindergarten and elementary-school teachers see school culture as the most salient influence on their educational thinking, frequently citing instances where interactions with colleagues—both formal occasions (vigorous discussion during lesson-study projects) and informal interactions—sparked change.","Suzuki, Masatoshi Jimmy",0,,2038
5668,"Yokai Monsters at Large: Mizuki Shigeru's Manga, Transmedia Practices, and (Lack of) Cultural Politics","This study engages in a discussion of yokai (preternatural monsters in Japanese folklore) characters in Mizuki Shigeru's manga and their transmedia expansion not as an expression of Japanese cultural tradition, but as an outcome of transmedia adaptation practices (known as ""media mix"" in Japan) in the modern period by creators, media companies, and other social agents. This study argues that recent Japanese transmedia practices are principally propelled by the specific style of character drawing found in the manga medium and the character-centric multimedia production scheme, which makes manga(-originated) characters-including yokai characters-versatile for moving across different media platforms. Although transmedia practices can enhance the potential for producing synergies among previously discrete cultural industries and media companies to attain more profits, such a close relationship undermines the autonomy of each media industry, company, and other actors, which can attenuate social critique or cultural politics previously exercised through storytelling in manga, including Mizuki's yokai works. By analyzing the transmedia practices that have used Mizuki's yokai manga as ""original"" sources, this article addresses what has been gained and lost when yokai are migrated into different media platforms.","Suzuki, S.",0,,2039
5669,Motion planning strategies in human control of non-rigid objects with internal degrees of freedom,"The paper deals with modeling of human-like reaching movements in dynamic environments. A simple but not trivial example of reaching in a dynamic environment is the rest-to-rest manipulation of a multi-mass flexible object with the elimination of residual vibrations. Two approaches to the prediction of reaching movements are formulated in position and force actuation settings. In the first approach, either the position of the hand or the hand force is specified by the lowest order polynomial satisfying the boundary conditions of the reaching task. The second approach is based on the minimization of either the hand jerk or the hand force-change, with taking into account the dynamics of the flexible object. To verify the resulting four mathematical models, an experiment on the manipulation of a ten-masses flexible object of low stiffness is conducted. The experimental results show that the second approach gives a significantly better prediction of human movements, with the minimum hand force-change model having a slight but consistent edge over the minimum hand jerk one.","Svinin, M.",0,10.1016/j.humov.2018.12.004,2040
5673,Emotional State Classification in Patient-Robot Interaction Using Wavelet Analysis and Statistics-Based Feature Selection,"service robots are expected to be used in tasks involving direct interaction with patients. Consequently, there is a need to design nursing robots with the capability to detect and respond to patient emotional states and to facilitate positive experiences in healthcare. The objective of this study was to develop a new computational algorithm for accurate patient emotional state classification in interaction with nursing robots during medical service. A simulated medicine delivery experiment was conducted at two nursing homes using a robot with different human-like features. Physiological signals, including heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR), as well as subjective ratings of valence (happy-unhappy) and arousal (excited-bored) were collected on elderly residents. A three-stage emotional state classification algorithm was applied to these data, including: 1) physiological feature extraction; 2) statistical-based feature selection; and 3) a machine-learning model of emotional states. A pre-processed HR signal was used. GSR signals were nonstationary and noisy and were further processed using wavelet analysis. A set of wavelet coefficients, representing GSR features, was used as a basis for current emotional state classification. Arousal and valence were significantly explained by statistical features of the HR signal and GSR wavelet features. Wavelet-based de-noising of GSR signals led to an increase in the percentage of correct classifications of emotional states and clearer relationships among the physiological response and arousal and valence. The new algorithm may serve as an effective method for future service robot real-time detection of patient emotional states and behavior adaptation to promote positive healthcare experiences.","Swangnetr, M.",0,10.1109/tsmca.2012.2210408,2041
5675,,"An increase of attention towards our nation’s civic participation downturn has brought the concept of civic engagement to the forefront of young people’s lives. Traditional teaching of long-standing democratic processes via education institutes have begun to evolve in how youth can participate civically, impacting social change within their communities. Civics instruction and learning implemented through a progressive pedagogical approach encompasses a greater focus on student-centered instruction, brings relevance to national history, as well as the historical ideals of democracy, and transposes this knowledge unto communities of today. Thus, youth may no longer be considered passive agents within the realm of social change, as they can experience empowerment when working with educators and the greater community. Current civic participation among young people across the United States, however, seems to be paving the way for civic disengagement. Drawing on the progressive education literature and statistical data on civic engagement and youth (particularly in the U. S. and Arizona), this study addresses the need for a civics-based progressive educational shift within the Arizona school system and other educational institutions. In addition to further outlining the need to cultivate civic engagement pedagogies amongst youth today, this thesis explores the construct of Arizona’s Excellence in Civic Engagement Program, which the Arizona Department of Education, in partnership with various community organizations, has established and implemented as a research-based, free standing (separate from state standards) youth civic engagement program. Three participating schools’ program applications are analyzed in regard to the inclusion of democratic ideals and themes, including how these schools enable students to become civically engaged, both within the school setting and greater community. I argue that for the future of this state, nation, and world, young people must be exposed to and engaged with participative opportunities and the civic education interconnectivity in their communities. This study examines the civics-based, progressive education themes needed in schools and educational institutions in order to empower Arizona’s youth and increase efforts to impact social change through civic education.","Swanholm, Tara",0,,2042

I conduct an interface analysis that investigates the semiotic and material aspects of the interface in terms of technological and cultural affordances, finding that gender and race function as crucial infrastructural elements that frame the search process and results as more explicitly ideological rather than instrumental. This research contributes to understanding the broader implications of anthropomorphization as a design strategy, blending concerns of technology design and cultural beliefs about gender and race.","Sweeney, Miriam E.",0,,2043
5677,Avatars in Pain: Visible Harm Enhances Mind Perception in Humans and Robots,"Previous research has shown that when people read vignettes about the infliction of harm upon an entity appearing to have no more than a liminal mind, their attributions of mind to that entity increased. Currently, we investigated if the presence of a facial wound enhanced the perception of mental capacities (experience and agency) in response to images of robotic and human-like avatars, compared with unharmed avatars. The results revealed that harmed versions of both robotic and human-like avatars were imbued with mind to a higher degree, irrespective of the baseline level of mind attributed to their unharmed counterparts. Perceptions of capacity for pain mediated attributions of experience, while both pain and empathy mediated attributions of abilities linked to agency. The findings suggest that harm, even when it appears to have been inflicted unintentionally, may augment mind perception for robotic as well as for nearly human entities, at least as long as it is perceived to elicit pain.","Swiderska, A.",0,10.1177/0301006618809919,2044
5679,Understanding when students are active-in-thinking through modeling-in-context,"Learning-in-action depends on interactions with learning content, peers and real world problems. However, effective learning-in-action also depends on the extent to which students are active-in-thinking, making meaning of their learning experience. A critical component of any technology to support active thinking is the ability to ascertain whether (or to what extent) students have succeeded in internalizing the disciplinary strategies, norms of thinking, discourse practices and habits of mind that characterize deep understanding in a domain. This presents what we call a dilemma of modeling-in-context: teachers routinely analyze this kind of thinking for small numbers of students in activities they create or customize for the needs of their students; however, doing so at scale and in real-time requires some automated processes for modeling student work. Current techniques for developing models that reflect specific pedagogical activities and learning objectives that a teacher might create require either more expertise or more time than teachers have. In this paper, we examine a theoretical approach to addressing the problem of modeling active thinking in its pedagogical context that uses teacher-created rubrics to generate models of student work. The results of this examination show how appropriately constructed learning technologies can enable teachers to develop custom automated rubrics for modeling active thinking and meaning-making from the records of students' dialogic work. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Many immersive educational technologies, such as digital games and simulations, enable students to take consequential action in a realistic context and to interact with peers, mentors and pedagogical agents. Such technologies help students to be active-in-thinking: engaging deeply with, reflecting on and otherwise making meaning of their learning experience. There are now many immersive educational technologies with integrated authoring tools that enable teachers to customize the learning experience with relative ease, reducing barriers to adoption and improving student learning. Educational technologies that support learning-in-action typically contain student models that operate in real-time to control the behavior of pedagogical agents, deliver just-in-time interventions, select an appropriate content or otherwise measure and promote active thinking, but these student models may not work appropriately if teachers customize the learning experience. Much as there are authoring tools that allow teachers to customize the curriculum of a given learning technology, there is a need for authoring tools that allow teachers to customize the associated student models as well. What this paper adds This paper presents a novel, rubric-based approach to develop automated student models for new activities that teachers develop in digital learning environments that promote active thinking. Our approach combines machine learning techniques with teacher expertise, allowing teachers to participate in the design of automated student models of active thinking that with further development could be scaled by leveraging their skills in rubric development. Our results show that a rubric-based approach can outperform a machine learning approach in this context. More importantly, in some cases, the rubric-based approach can produce reliable automated models based on the information that a teacher can easily provide. Implications for practice and/or policy If integrated into authoring tools, the rubric-based approach could allow teachers to participate in the design of automated models for educational technologies customized to their instructional needs. Through this design process, teachers could develop a better understanding of how the automated modeling system works, which in turn could increase the adoption of educational technologies that promote active thinking. Because the rubric-based approach enables teachers to identify key connections among concepts relevant to the pedagogical context, rather than eneral concepts or linguistic features, it is more likely to facilitate targeted feedback to help promote the development of active thinking.","Swiecki, Z.",0,10.1111/bjet.12869,2045
5684,,"Species distribution modelling methods are used for a variety of applications including: to assess current patterns of biodiversity, to make predictions about the impacts of environmental and climate change, and to assist in conservation planning. However, important factors are often neglected both in the pre-processing of data (e.g. ignoring sampling bias), and in the construction of models (e.g. ignoring ecological processes). In terms of the pre-processing of data, recent improvements in distance sampling methods are used to convert count data to abundance estimates, utilising both distance and habitat data from a previously conducted bird count survey. Biotic interactions are studied using MaxEnt and pairs of virtual species; a novel iterative method is demonstrated, using each species prediction as a subsequent variable for the partner species. Population dynamics and dispersal are studied using RangeShifter, a recently developed individual-based model. A number of climate change adaptation actions are applied to a section of UK landscape data, and the range shifting ability of a set of focal species is measured. Many previous studies have predicted climate change impacts on species; some have started to incorporate simple measures of dispersal ability. This work demonstrates the importance of considering both dispersal and population dynamics when predicting the future distributions of species and assessing their ability to track climate change. Finally, dynamic feedbacks between species and their environment are studied by coupling RangeShifter with CRAFTY, a recently developed agent-based model of land-use dynamics. Socio-ecological system dynamics are crucial in determining species distributions, but have rarely been studied as a truly coupled system. The coupled model presented here is the first of its kind, modelling both animals and land-use agents at an individual level. A case study is presented, demonstrating the feedback mechanisms that exist between pollinators and farms that rely on them, and the potential risk posed by agricultural intensification.","Synes, Nicholas William",0,,2046
5685,There's More to Humanity Than Meets the Eye: Differences in Gaze Behavior Toward Women and Gynoid Robots,"Based on evolutionary psychological theories, numerous eye-tracking studies have demonstrated how people visually perceive a potential mate in order to efficiently estimate the person's mate value. Companies are currently working on sexualized robots that provide numerous human-like visual cues which foster the visual resemblance to humans. To gain more elaborated knowledge on how people react to sexualized robots compared with humans, the present study empirically investigated whether heterosexual males transfer deep-rooted evolutionary psychological processes of mate perception to human-like and machine-like sexualized robots. Moreover, we aimed to learn more about the processes of orienting responses toward human and non-human stimuli and about potential predictors of visual attention to robots. Therefore, we conducted an eyetracking study in which 15 heterosexual men, 12 homosexual men, and 18 heterosexual women were confronted with stimuli showing women, human-like gynoid robots and machine-like gynoid robots. For the sample as a whole, there was no difference in the amount of time spent looking at the human and non-human breasts. However, the results for the heterosexual males supported the assumption that human breasts attract more visual attention than do the breast areas of human-like and machine-like robots. The pelvic region yielded an unexpected gaze pattern, as all participants spent more time looking at the robotic pelvic area than at the human one, with more visual attention paid to the machine-like robots than to the human-like robots. The results of the viewing times toward the head revealed that all participants had a stronger need to gain visual information about the human head in comparison to the robotic heads, underlining the importance of authenticity in terms of emotions and motivations that can only be decoded in humans. Moreover, the study showed that individuals more frequently switched their visual attention toward different body parts of the robots in comparison to the female stimuli, implying that non-human sexualized representations evoked a higher need for visual exploration.","Szczuka, J.

The current study examined the developmental origins of this understanding using a manual-search individuation task with 13-month-old infants. Subjects observed semi-transparent objects that looked and behaved like animate agents placed into box that they could reach but not see into. Across trials infants observed objects with either the same- or different-colored insides placed into the box. We found that infants used internal property differences more than external property differences to determine how many agents were involved in the event. A second experiment confirmed that this effect was specific to the domain of animate entities. These results suggest that infants are biased to see an agent's 'insides' as more important for determining its identity over time than its outside properties.,"Taborda-Osorio, H.",0,10.1016/j.cognition.2018.01.016,2048
5689,,"How can physics teachers help students develop consistent problem solving techniques for both simple and complicated physics problems, such as those that encompass objects undergoing multiple forces (mechanical or electrical) as individually portrayed in free-body diagrams and/or phenomenon involving multiple objects, such as Doppler effect reflection applications in echoes and ultrasonic cardiac monitoring for sound, or police radar for light? These problems can confuse novice physics students, and to sort out problem parts, the suggestion is made here to guide the student to personify self as the object in question, that is, to imagine oneself as the object undergoing outside influences such as forces and then qualify and quantify those for the problem at hand. This personification does NOT, as according to the three traditional definitions of the term (animism, anthropomorphism and teleology), empower the object to act, but instead just to detect its environment. By having students use their imagination to put themselves in the place of the object, they can ""sense"" the influences the object is experiencing to analyze these individually, hopefully reducing the student's feeling of being overwhelmed with information, and also imbuing the student with a sense of having experienced the situation. This can be especially useful in problems that involve both multiple forces AND multiple objects (for example, Atwood's machine), since objects acted upon need to be considered separately and consecutively, with the idea that one cannot be two objects at once. This personification technique, documented to have been used by both Einstein and Feynman, is recommended here for secondary-school teen and university-level adult learners with discussions on specific physics and astronomy classroom strategies.","Tabor-Morris, A.

5691,A virtual environment for the formulation of policy packages,"The interdependence and complexity of socio-technical systems and availability of a wide variety of policy measures to address policy problems make the process of policy formulation difficult. In order to formulate sustainable and efficient transport policies, development of new tools and techniques is necessary. One of the approaches gaining ground is policy packaging, which shifts focus from implementation of individual policy measures to implementation of combinations of measures with the aim of increasing efficiency and effectiveness of policy interventions by increasing synergies and reducing potential contradictions among policy measures. In this paper, we describe the development of a virtual environment for the exploration and analysis of different configurations of policy measures in order to build policy packages. By developing systematic approaches it is possible to examine more alternatives at a greater depth, decrease the time required for the overall analysis, provide real-time assessment and feedback on the effect of changes in the configurations, and ultimately form more effective policies. The results from this research demonstrate the usefulness of computational approaches in addressing the complexity inherent in the formulation of policy packages. This new approach has been applied to the formulation of policies to advance sustainable transportation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Taeihagh, A.",0,10.1016/j.tra.2013.10.017,2051

VRE elicited significant distress in all three scenarios. Although within-scenario distress habituation was not observed, between-scenario habituation was partially supported. An increase in distress during the second scenario indicated that three consecutive speech performances were critical in achieving habituation.

Here, we propose a model in which haptic information, provided by touch and proprioception(2), enables interacting individuals to estimate the partner's movement goal and use it to improve their own motor performance. We use an empirical physical interaction task(3) to show that our model can explain human behaviours better than existing models of interaction in literature(4-8). Furthermore, we experimentally verify our model by embodying it in a robot partner and checking that it induces the same improvements in motor performance and learning in a human individual as interacting with a human partner. These results promise collaborative robots that provide human-like assistance, and suggest that movement goal exchange is the key to physical assistance.","Takagi, A.",0,10.1038/s41562-017-0054,2053
5705,,"Internal (neuronal) representations in the brain are modified by our experiences, and this phenomenon is not unique to sensory and motor systems. Here, we show that different impressions obtained through social interaction with a variety of agents uniquely modulate activity of dorsal and ventral pathways of the brain network that mediates human social behavior. We scanned brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 16 healthy volunteers when they performed a simple matching-pennies game with a human, human-like android, mechanical robot, interactive robot, and a computer. Before playing this game in the scanner, participants experienced social interactions with each opponent separately and scored their initial impressions using two questionnaires. We found that the participants perceived opponents in two mental dimensions: one represented “mind-holderness” in which participants attributed anthropomorphic impressions to some of the opponents that had mental functions, while the other dimension represented “mind-readerness” in which participants characterized opponents as intelligent. Interestingly, this “mind-readerness” dimension correlated to participants frequently changing their game tactic to prevent opponents from envisioning their strategy, and this was corroborated by increased entropy during the game. We also found that the two factors separately modulated activity in distinct social brain regions. Specifically, mind-holderness modulated activity in the dorsal aspect of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal and posterior paracingulate cortices, while mind-readerness modulated activity in the ventral aspect of TPJ and the temporal pole. These results clearly demonstrate that activity in social brain networks is modulated through pre-scanning experiences of social interaction with a variety of agents. Furthermore, our findings elucidated the existence of two distinct functional networks in the social human brain. Social interaction with anthropomorphic or intelligent-looking agents may distinctly shape the internal representation of our social brain, which may in turn determine how we behave for various agents that we encounter in our society.

5716,Impact of stimulus uncanniness on speeded response,"In the uncanny valley phenomenon, the causes of the feeling of uncanniness as well as the impact of the uncanniness on behavioral performances still remain open. The present study investigated the behavioral effects of stimulus uncanniness, particularly with respect to speeded response. Pictures of fish were used as visual stimuli. Participants engaged in direction discrimination, spatial cueing, and dot-probe tasks. The results showed that pictures rated as strongly uncanny delayed speeded response in the discrimination of the direction of the fish. In the cueing experiment, where a fish served as a task-irrelevant and unpredictable cue for a peripheral target, we again observed that the detection of a target was slowed when the cue was an uncanny fish. Conversely, the dot-probe task suggested that uncanny fish, unlike threatening stimulus, did not capture visual spatial attention. These results suggested that stimulus uncanniness resulted in the delayed response, and importantly this modulation was not mediated by the feelings of threat.","Takahashi, K.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00662,2055
5721,The effect of behavioral synchrony with black or white virtual agents on outgroup trust,"Trust toward outgroup members is generally lower than it is toward ingroup members. Behavioral synchrony with virtual outgroup characters has been identified as a means of improving attitudes toward racial outgroup members, but this effect has not been tested for outgroup trust. We tested the effect of synchrony with an ingroup/outgroup virtual agent on a behavioral measure of outgroup trust. An experiment used an online economic game to obtain pretest and posttest measures of trust. In between these measures, participants played a dance video game on Xbox Kinect. They were randomly assigned to either an ingroup or outgroup agent (black or white) partner. Game score served as a continuous measure of synchrony with the agent. Regression analysis revealed that agent race moderated synchrony's effect on change in outgroup trust. Increased synchrony with an outgroup agent led to increased outgroup trust. Conversely, increased synchrony with an ingroup agent led to decreased outgroup trust. Findings are discussed with respect to implications for using virtual interactions to build outgroup trust in the real world. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet the work of philosophical conceptualization and critical analysis of networked museological practices still remains to be taken up satisfactorily, what with a pervasive tendency to conflate networks with decentralized/non-hierarchical organizations on the one hand, and the absence of a robust ontology, and a rigorous account of historical agents and their memory-making activities in prevailing theories of networks on the other. This article recruits DeLanda's assemblage theory' and Deleuze's Bergsonism to explain how cultural memory-making assemblages work across the internet's many social networks. It also portrays the affordances of networks for museological practices, delineating a space of possibilities for cultural memory-making by way of contemporary examples.","Tan, L.",0,10.1177/1367877912460615,2057
5732,iSocioBot: A Multimodal Interactive Social Robot,"We present one way of constructing a social robot, such that it is able to interact with humans using multiple modalities. The robotic system is able to direct attention towards the dominant speaker using sound source localization and face detection, it is capable of identifying persons using face recognition and speaker identification and the system is able to communicate and engage in a dialog with humans by using speech recognition, speech synthesis and different facial expressions. The software is built upon the open-source robot operating system framework and our software is made publicly available. Furthermore, the electrical parts (sensors, laptop, base platform, etc.) are standard components, thus allowing for replicating the system. The design of the robot is unique and we justify why this design is suitable for our robot and the intended use. By making software, hardware and design accessible to everyone, we make research in social robotics available to a broader audience. To evaluate the properties and the appearance of the robot we invited users to interact with it in pairs (active interaction partner/observer) and collected their responses via an extended version of the Godspeed Questionnaire. Results suggest an overall positive impression of the robot and interaction experience, as well as significant differences in responses based on type of interaction and gender.","Tan, Z.

5739,Effect of intermittent feedback control on robustness of human-like postural control system,"Humans have to acquire postural robustness to maintain stability against internal and external perturbations. Human standing has been recently modelled using an intermittent feedback control. However, the causality inside of the closed-loop postural control system associated with the neural control strategy is still unknown. Here, we examined the effect of intermittent feedback control on postural robustness and of changes in active/passive components on joint coordinative structure. We implemented computer simulation of a quadruple inverted pendulum that is mechanically close to human tiptoe standing. We simulated three pairs of joint viscoelasticity and three choices of neural control strategies for each joint: intermittent, continuous, or passive control. We examined postural robustness for each parameter set by analysing the region of active feedback gain. We found intermittent control at the hip joint was necessary for model stabilisation and model parameters affected the robustness of the pendulum. Joint sways of the pendulum model were partially smaller than or similar to those of experimental data. In conclusion, intermittent feedback control was necessary for the stabilisation of the quadruple inverted pendulum. Also, postural robustness of human-like multi-link standing would be achieved by both passive joint viscoelasticity and neural joint control strategies.","Tanabe, H.",0,10.1038/srep22446,2059
5743,Embodied conversational agents for multimodal automated social skills training in people with autism spectrum disorders,"Social skills training, performed by human trainers, is a well-established method for obtaining appropriate skills in social interaction. Previous work automated the process of social skills training by developing a dialogue system that teaches social communication skills through interaction with a computer avatar. Even though previous work that simulated social skills training only considered acoustic and linguistic information, human social skills trainers take into account visual and other non-verbal features. In this paper, we create and evaluate a social skills training system that closes this gap by considering the audiovisual features of the smiling ratio and the head pose (yaw and pitch). In addition, the previous system was only tested with graduate students; in this paper, we applied our system to children or young adults with autism spectrum disorders. For our experimental evaluation, we recruited 18 members from the general population and 10 people with autism spectrum disorders and gave them our proposed multimodal system to use. An experienced human social skills trainer rated the social skills of the users. We evaluated the system's effectiveness by comparing pre- and post-training scores and identified significant improvement in their social skills using our proposed multimodal system. Computer-based social skills training is useful for people who experience social difficulties. Such a system can be used by teachers, therapists, and social skills trainers for rehabilitation and the supplemental use of human-based training anywhere and anytime.","Tanaka, H.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0182151,2060
5747,,"Training a new therapist is both expensive and time consuming. The process requires tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of expert instruction. Additionally, it can require paying for standardized patients or exposing clients to trainees who lack basic skills. What feedback therapists do receive is often distal to their actual work with the client, further impeding the development of competence. In this study, we addressed these problems in training mental health providers by developing and testing a computerized standardized patient that offers feedback to therapists in real time. As an initial pilot, we conducted a randomized trial in which 151 nontherapists interacted with a text-based conversational agent that was trained on an archive of 2,354 psychotherapy transcripts. Half of participants received immediate feedback on their utilization of specific counseling skills, while the other half only received initial education on what the specific skills are and encouragement to use them. The group receiving feedback used significantly more reflections and overall listening skills compared to the control group, both while receiving feedback and after the feedback was removed.","Tanana, Michael J.",0,,2061
5748,Development and Evaluation of ClientBot: Patient-Like Conversational Agent to Train Basic Counseling Skills,"Background: Training therapists is both expensive and time-consuming. Degree-based training can require tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of expert instruction. Counseling skills practice often involves role-plays, standardized patients, or practice with real clients. Performance-based feedback is critical for skill development and expertise, but trainee therapists often receive minimal and subjective feedback, which is distal to their skill practice. Objective: In this study, we developed and evaluated a patient-like neural conversational agent, which provides real-time feedback to trainees via chat-based interaction. Methods: The text-based conversational agent was trained on an archive of 2354 psychotherapy transcripts and provided specific feedback on the use of basic interviewing and counseling skills (ie, open questions and reflections-summary statements of what a client has said). A total of 151 nontherapists were randomized to either (1) immediate feedback on their use of open questions and reflections during practice session with ClientBot or (2) initial education and encouragement on the skills. Results: Participants in the ClientBot condition used 91% (21.4/11.2) more reflections during practice with feedback (P<.001) and 76% (14.1/8) more reflections after feedback was removed (P<.001) relative to the control group. The treatment group used more open questions during training but not after feedback was removed, suggesting that certain skills may not improve with performance-based feedback. Finally, after feedback was removed, the ClientBot group used 31% (32.5/24.7) more listening skills overall (P<.001). Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that practice and feedback can improve trainee use of basic counseling skills.","Tanana, M. J.",0,10.2196/12529,2062
5753,,"In recent clinical studies, the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors to modulate the immune system in metastatic melanoma patients has shown a great response rate. However, there are still subsets of patients which are only partially responsive or non-responsive towards this cutting-edge immunotherapy. This unpredictable therapeutic response has caused a set-back to treating this deadly disease. A phosphatase, Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 2 (PTPN2) has been implicated in reducing tumor cells responses to immunotherapy; deletion of PTPN2 in tumor cells positively influenced the efficacy of immunotherapy by increasing interferon-γ-mediated effects on antigen presentation and growth suppression. By employing a virtual high throughput screening (vHTS) and computer-aided structure-drug design, PTPN2 inhibitors were designed and synthesized. Ten small molecule inhibitors of PTPN2 were analyzed in murine melanoma models and three inhibitors, ID_5, ID_7, and ID_9, were found to have potent activity against PTPN2. Ptpn2 inhibition by these lead compounds induced the intracellular Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling pathway. Furthermore, these inhibitors enhanced Stat1 phosphorylation, defining the underlying mechanism of inhibitors in Interferon signaling. Additional cell viability assays, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis, and western blotting of rationally designed Ptpn2 inhibitors demonstrated their in vitro anti-melanoma cancer activities with no apparent toxicity in murine cell lines. While further investigations are needed using in vivo models, these data altogether indicate that Ptpn2 small molecule inhibitors are novel agents that may enhance therapeutic responses in melanoma cancer which are resistant to currently available immunotherapies.","Tang, Rachel",0,,2063
5755,Intrinsic motivation and mental replay enable efficient online adaptation in stochastic recurrent networks,"Autonomous robots need to interact with unknown, unstructured and changing environments, constantly facing novel challenges. Therefore, continuous online adaptation for lifelong-learning and the need of sample-efficient mechanisms to adapt to changes in the environment, the constraints, the tasks, or the robot itself are crucial. In this work, we propose a novel framework for probabilistic online motion planning with online adaptation based on a bio-inspired stochastic recurrent neural network. By using learning signals which mimic the intrinsic motivation signal cognitive dissonance in addition with a mental replay strategy to intensify experiences, the stochastic recurrent network can learn from few physical interactions and adapts to novel environments in seconds. We evaluate our online planning and adaptation framework on an anthropomorphic KUKA LWR arm. The rapid online adaptation is shown by learning unknown workspace constraints sample-efficiently from few physical interactions while following given way points. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

5758,,"Understanding intentionality, i.e. coding the object directedness of agents towards objects, is a fundamental component of Theory of Mind abilities. Yet it is unclear how it is perceived and coded in different species. In this thesis, we present a series of comparative studies to explore human adults' and Capuchin monkeys' ability to infer intentional objects from actions. First we studied whether capuchin monkeys and adult humans infer a potential object from observing an object-directed action. With no direct information about the goal-object, neither species inferred the object from the action. However, when the object was revealed, the monkeys retrospectively encoded the directedness of the object-directed action; unexpectedly, in an adapted version of the task adult humans did not show a similar ability. We then adapted another paradigm, originally designed by Kovács et al (2010), to examine whether the two species implicitly register the intentional relation between an agent and an object. We manipulated an animated agent and the participants' belief about a ball's presence behind a hiding screen. We found no evidence showing that humans or monkeys coded object-directedness or belief. More importantly, we failed to replicate the original results from Kovács et al's study, and through a series of follow up studies, we questioned their conclusions regarding implicit ToM understanding. We suggested that, instead of implicit ToM, results like Kovacs et al's might be interpreted as driven by “sub-mentalizing” processes, as suggested by Heyes (2014). We conclude that so called ‘implicit ToM' may be based upon the computation of intentional relations between perceived agents and objects. But, these computations might present limitations, and some results attributed to implicit ToM may in fact reflect “sub-mentalizing” processes.","Tao, Ruoting",0,,2065
5759,,"JDTic is a KOR selective antagonist belonging to the trans (3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine scaffold, which is known as an opioid antagonist pharmacophore for all receptors. A pharmacophore has been designed based on the crystalline structure of JDTic inside the KOR. In this study, by screening in silico over 1.9 million commercially available small molecules, we report a new class of MOR and KOR antagonist ligands which is representative of the successful outcome of virtual high throughput screening (HTS). To create these we applied a combination docking method that integrates ligand and receptor centric virtual screening search techniques in order to screen libraries of commercial compounds. Compound (1) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of specific [3H]-U69,593 (KOR) binding with a Ki value of 445 nM. Compound (1) also inhibited specific [3H]-DAMGO (MOR) with Ki values 44 nM, while no binding affinity toward DOR was observed. To characterize the relative efficacy and potency of compound (1), it was assayed in a GTPγ[35S]S functional assays. Compound 1 was tested for its ability to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding mediated by the KOR and MOR. Compound (1) showed no activation of the G protein (i.e., was an antagonist) for both KOR and MOR in a GTPγS assay compared to full agonists U69,593 (KOR) and DAMGO (MOR). Antagonism was confirmed by running GTPγS assays with a fixed amount of agonist against a dilution series of compound (1) and known opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride. Both compound (1) and naloxone were able to antagonize 20 nM U69,593 (KOR) or 200 nM DAMGO (MOR) agonist activity, with IC50 values of 511.2+/-175.3 nM and 3.229+/- 0.942 nM, respectively, for KOR, and 774.9+/-107.3 nM and 11.78+/-1.70 nM, respectively, for MOR. We developed an efficient six-step synthesis of a compound 1 starting from dimethyl itaconate utilizing a sequence of cyclization, reduction and coupling reactions. We also developed an easy derivatization approach utilizing convergent analog synthesis to study SAR around the lead structure. Further SAR optimization led to the discovery of several low nanomolar binding affinity antagonists with preference for one of the opioid receptors. This new series of compounds can be further evaluated in in-vivo models to develop future drug candidates. Radioligand binding assays for opioid and cannabinoid receptors have been a useful tool for the discovery of novel agents. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the Russian Sage Perovskia atriplicifolia resulted in the isolation of four known flavonoid derivatives, 5-hydroxy-3’,4’,6,7-tetramethoxy flavone (1), 5,7-dihydroxy-3’,4’,6,-trimethoxy flavone (2), 5-hydroxy-4’,6,7-trimethoxy flavone (3) and 5,7-dihydroxy-4’,6-dimethoxy flavone (4). The structures of these compounds were established on the basis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis and mass spectrometric data. Compound 1, 3, 4 showed displacement of radioligand for the δ opioid receptor with IC50 values ranging from 6.1 to 49.5 μM. These studies have important implications in understanding non-nitrogenous δ opioid receptor ligands.","Tarawneh, Amer H.",0,,2066
5761,Can the use of cognitive and metacognitive self-regulated learning strategies be predicted by learners' levels of prior knowledge in hypermedia-learning environments?,"Research on self-regulated learning (SRL) in hypermedia-learning environments is a growing area of interest, and prior knowledge can influence how students interact with these systems. One hundred twelve (N = 112) undergraduate students' interactions with MetaTutor, a multi-agent, hypermedia-based learning environment, were investigated, including how prior knowledge affected their use of SRI. strategies. We expected that students with high prior knowledge would engage in significantly more cognitive and metacognitive SRL strategies, engage in different sequences of SRL strategies, spend more time engaging in SRL processes, and visit more pages that were relevant to their sub-goals than students with low prior knowledge. Results showed significant differences in the total use of SRL strategies between prior knowledge groups, and more specifically, revealed significant differences in the use of each metacognitive strategy (e.g., judgment of learning), but not each cognitive strategy (e.g., taking notes) between prior knowledge groups. Results also revealed different sequences of use of SRL strategies between prior knowledge groups, and that students spent different amounts of time engaging in SRI. processes; however, all students visited similar numbers of relevant pages. These results have important implications on designing multi-agent, hypermedia environments; we can design pedagogical agents that adapt to students' learning needs, based on their prior knowledge levels.

5765,Automatic Conversational Scene Analysis in Children with Asperger Syndrome/High-Functioning Autism and Typically Developing Peers,"Individuals with Asperger syndrome/High Functioning Autism fail to spontaneously attribute mental states to the self and others, a life-long phenotypic characteristic known as mindblindness. We hypothesized that mindblindness would affect the dynamics of conversational interaction. Using generative models, in particular Gaussian mixture models and observed influence models, conversations were coded as interacting Markov processes, operating on novel speech/silence patterns, termed Steady Conversational Periods (SCPs). SCPs assume that whenever an agent's process changes state (e. g., from silence to speech), it causes a general transition of the entire conversational process, forcing inter-actant synchronization. SCPs fed into observed influence models, which captured the conversational dynamics of children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome/High Functioning Autism, and age-matched typically developing participants. Analyzing the parameters of the models by means of discriminative classifiers, the dialogs of patients were successfully distinguished from those of control participants. We conclude that meaning-free speech/silence sequences, reflecting inter-actant synchronization, at least partially encode typical and atypical conversational dynamics. This suggests a direct influence of theory of mind abilities onto basic speech initiative behavior.","Tavano, A.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0085819,2068

In this work we propose a novel approach called PATDS (Performance Analysis of Training through Data-Farming Simulations) in which a simulated agent as a virtual copy of a human trainee is constructed and tested in all circumstances to provide feedback and decision support for another round of human learning. PATDS includes the analysis of behavior demonstrated by the trainee in simulations and the identification of relevant behavior patterns; that is, strategies. The identified patterns are in turn used to model a surrogate agent of the trainee. The created agent is then evaluated with data-farming experiments on a variety of simulation parameters to estimate the key weaknesses in its behavior and the overall performance. In subsequent rounds of training, the trainee improves the behavior based on the identified weaknesses and strategic decision recommendations; a new surrogate agent is designed adding new skills from the trainee until the desired overall performance is achieved. We evaluated the proposed approach on two asymmetric urban-terrain threat scenarios where a squad of security forces interacts with hostile crowds. We demonstrate that the data-farming-based evaluation in the complete simulation parameter space is beneficial for improving the trainees' capabilities.","Tavcar, A.",1,10.1016/j.engappai.2018.07.001,2069

In this study, we investigate the impact of an agile conversational agent that triggers student dialogue by making interventions based on the academically productive talk framework. An experimental activity in the context of a university course involved 72 undergraduate students who discussed online in dyads. Two conditions were compared: (a) dyads who received agent interventions while working on a learning task (treatment) and (b) dyads who worked on the same task without any agent interference (control). Utilizing a concept map created by the course instructor, the conversational agent delivered unsolicited interventions that encouraged treatment students to build on their prior knowledge, linking their current contributions to the main domain principles discussed during the course. Study findings indicate that the agent intervention mode substantially improved both individual and group learning outcomes. Evidence suggests that the agent effect on learning performance was mediated by students' explicit reasoning, which was also found to be enhanced in the treatment condition.","Tegos, S.",1,,2072
5780,Promoting academically productive talk with conversational agent interventions in collaborative learning settings,"Research on computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and conversational pedagogical agents has strongly emphasized the value of providing dynamic dialogue support for learners working together to accomplish a certain task. Recently, on the basis of the classroom discourse framework of Academically Productive Talk (APT), a flexible form of conversational agent support has emerged employing APT-based intervention methods so as to stimulate pedagogically beneficial conversational interactions among learning partners. This paper investigates the impact of an APT-based Linking Contributions (LC) intervention mode implemented by a conversational agent in the context of a collaborative activity in higher education. This type of agent interventions encourages students to explicitly externalize their reasoning on important domain concepts building upon the contributions of their partners. Forty-three (43) students collaborated in small groups using a prototype CSCL system to accomplish three different tasks in the domain of Multimedia Learning. Groups were randomly assigned to the treatment or the control condition. In the treatment condition, a conversational agent participated in students' dialogues making LC mode interventions. In the control condition, students discussed without the agent intervening. The results of the study illustrated that the students in the treatment condition engaged in a more productive dialogue demonstrating increased explicit reasoning throughout the collaborative activity. Furthermore, it was shown that the students in the treatment condition outperformed the control students in various measures on knowledge acquisition. Evidence also suggests that students' enhanced learning performance was mediated by the positive effect of the agent intervention mode on students' argumentation. Overall, this study provides insights into how the use of a configurable conversational agent displaying unsolicited LC interventions during students' discourse can be beneficial to collaborative learning.

5783,Conversational agents for academically productive talk: a comparison of directed and undirected agent interventions,"Conversational agents that draw on the framework of academically productive talk (APT) have been lately shown to be effective in helping learners sustain productive forms of peer dialogue in diverse learning settings. Yet, literature suggests that more research is required on how learners respond to and benefit from such flexible agents in order to fine-tune the design of automated APT intervention modes and, thus, enhance agent pedagogical efficacy. Building on this line of research, this work explores the impact of a configurable APT agent that prompts peers to build on prior knowledge and logically connect their contributions to important domain concepts discussed in class. A total of 96 computer science students engaged in a dialogue-based activity in the context of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) university course. During the activity, students worked online in dyads to accomplish a learning task. The study compares three conditions: students who collaborated without any agent interference (control), students who received undirected agent interventions that addressed both peers in the dyad (U treatment), and students who received directed agent interventions addressing a particular learner instead of the dyad (D treatment). The results suggest that although both agent intervention methods can improve students' learning outcomes and dyad in-task performance, the directed one is more effective than the undirected one in enhancing individual domain knowledge acquisition and explicit reasoning. Furthermore, findings show that the positive effect of the agent on dyad performance is mediated by the frequency of students' contributions displaying explicit reasoning, while most students perceive agent involvement favorably.","Tegos, S.",0,10.1007/s11412-016-9246-2,2074

5790,,"In this dissertation, I present a data-driven approach to the generation of novel iconic gestures for virtual humans and embodied conversational agents. In most previous approaches to iconic gesture generation, agents are limited to drawing upon a finite set of prerecorded or ""canned"" animation, also known as a gestionary. Annotating these animations with semantic information allows for the generation of coordinated language and gesture (Cassell, Stone, & Yan, 2000), but following the gestionary approach means that new visuo-spatial information cannot be depicted without hand-crafting new animations or recording them with motion capture technology. The work presented here is based on the Image Description Feature (IDF) approach. IDFs are a level of visuo-spatial meaning that mediates between representations of meaning for language (semantics) and the form of iconic gestures, represented as sets of morphological features (Kopp, Tepper, & Cassell, 2004; Tepper, Kopp, & Cassell, 2004). This theoretical framework allows for a compositional approach to gesture generation, wherein new iconic gestures can be constructed from partial gesture specifications, expressed as mappings between IDFs and gesture form features. To identify these form-meaning mappings in empirical data, I designed a study to elicit a high number of iconic gestures in natural conversation. Implementing this design resulted in the construction of a new video corpus of dialogues between 22 participants, annotated using an original coding scheme with information on the form of 2,275 gestures and the IDFs they depict. Through a novel application of techniques from machine learning and data mining, I found a range of frequently occurring patterns in gesture features used to depict IDFs. These patterns, learned from the data using decision tree and classification rule induction algorithms, were then applied directly to the problem of generating iconic gestures in an extension of the NUMACK architecture (Kopp, Cassell, Tepper, Ferriman, & Striegnitz, 2008). Lastly, I designed and conducted a study to evaluate the efficacy of the gestures generated by the model. The results of this evaluation study show that participants consistently rate these generated gestures higher than baseline gestures in terms of naturalness and clarity, and that the participants understood the intended IDFs depicted by the generated gestures.","Tepper, Paul A.",0,,2076
5791,Mind-Reading and Behavior-Reading against Agents with and without Anthropomorphic Features in a Competitive Situation,"Humans use two distinct cognitive strategies separately to understand and predict other humans' behavior. One is mind-reading, in which an internal state such as an intention or an emotional state is assumed to be a source of a variety of behaviors. The other is behavior-reading, in which an actor's behavior is modeled based on stimulus-response associations without assuming internal states behind the behavior. We hypothesize that anthropomorphic features are key for an observer switching between these two cognitive strategies in a competitive situation. We provide support for this hypothesis through two studies using four agents with different appearances. We show that only a human agent was thought to possess both the ability to generate a variety of behaviors and internal mental states, such as minds and emotions (Study 1). We also show that humans used mixed (opposing) strategies against a human agent and exploitative strategies against the agents with mechanical appearances when they played a repeated zero-sum game (Study 2). Our findings show that humans understand that human behavior is varied; that humans have internal states, such as minds and emotions; that the behavior of machines is governed by a limited number of fixed rules; and that machines do not possess internal mental states. Our findings also suggest that the function of mind-reading is to trigger a strategy for use against agents with variable behavior and that humans exploit others who lack behavioral variability based on behavior-reading in a competitive situation.","Terada, K.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01071,2077
5793,Architecture and interaction protocol for pedagogical-empathic agents in 3D virtual learning environments,"This paper proposes an interaction design architecture and an interaction protocol for the construction of pedagogical agents acting in distributed 3D learning environments. Agents designed based on the proposed architecture are able to interact verbally, non-verbally or both with the students, combining empathic and pedagogical behavioral parameters in order to support students during online educational activities. The representation of the agent results from both pedagogical and emotional factors and is related with the learning environment and its technology. The agent logic is based on three types of the learning environment's events: (a) emotional events, (b) pedagogical events and (c) events that are triggered by the environment itself. The proposed architecture is validated through the implementation of an autonomous pedagogical-empathic agent in the virtual environment of OpenSim. The agent observes students' anxiety during the learning process and reacts when their anxiety level is considered high.","Terzidou, T.",0,10.1007/s11042-018-5942-4,2078
5796,Agent Supported Serious Game Environment,"This study proposes and applies a novel concept for an AI enhanced serious game collaborative environment as a supplementary learning tool in tertiary education. It is based on previous research that investigated pedagogical agents for a serious game in the OpenSim environment. The proposed AI features to support the serious game are the following: a) a pedagogical game agent, b) non-playing characters, c) chat bots, and d) a game interface called ""Progress Map"". This study aims to explore whether the utilization of AI features in game based collaborative learning in a tertiary education course can positively affect students' attitudes towards the course and educational games, students' game performance, as well as the students' perception of their learning environment. Summarizing, even though the intelligent game environment does not affect students' attitudes, neither towards the course nor towards the educational games, it has a positive impact on the performance of the teams and so it can be considered useful in collaborative game based learning. Moreover, the intelligent game environment improves the cohesiveness in the classroom after the completion of the game activity in terms of helping, supporting, and becoming connected to each-other.","Terzidou, T.",1,10.1109/tlt.2016.2521649,2079
5800,The effect of emotional feedback on behavioral intention to use computer based assessment,"This study introduces emotional feedback as a construct in an acceptance model. It explores the effect of emotional feedback on behavioral intention to use Computer Based Assessment (CBA). A female Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) with empathetic encouragement behavior was displayed as emotional feedback. More specifically, this research aims at investigating the effect of Emotional Feedback on Behavioral Intention to Use a CBA system, Perceived Playfulness, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Content and Facilitating Conditions. An appropriate survey questionnaire was completed by 134 students. Results demonstrate that Emotional Feedback has a direct effect on Behavioral Intention to Use a CBA system and on other crucial determinants of Behavioral Intention. Finally, the proposed acceptance model for computer based assessment extended with the Emotional Feedback variable explains approximately 52% of the variance of Behavioral Intention.

5803,Toward dynamic pain expressions in avatars: Perceived realism and pain level of different action unit orders,"The facial expression of pain can be decomposed in three sets of Action Units (AUs), the smallest discriminating facial movements: Brow lowering (B), Nose wrinkling + Upper lip raising (N), and Orbit tightening + Eyelid closure (O). This study compared the perception of realism and pain level from different onset orders of AUs in avatars. Seven videos of facial expressions of pain were created with four different avatars (2 women): six sequential onsets combining the three sets of AUs and one synchronized onset. 45 healthy adults (22 women; aged 23.6 +/- 5.2 years) rated the realism of facial movements, and the level of intensity and unpleasantness of perceived pain. A more realistic expression was associated with the onset of O before or at the same time as N, a more intense expression was associated when B occurred last, and a higher level of unpleasantness was associated with the onset of N before B. Therefore, the sequence ONB yielded the highest ratings on both measures of realism and pain levels. These findings describe the perceived content of different orders of facial movements that could contribute to the creation of realistic pain-expressing virtual agents designed to study human-computer interactions.","Tessier, M.

5807,"The Impact of Computerized Agents on Immediate Emotions, Overall Arousal and Bidding Behavior in Electronic Auctions","The presence of computerized agents has become pervasive in everyday live. In this paper, we examine the impact of agency on human bidders' affective processes and bidding behavior in an electronic auction environment. In particular, we use skin conductance response and heart rate measurements as proxies for the immediate emotions and overall arousal of human bidders in a lab experiment with human and computerized counterparts. Our results show that computerized agents mitigated 1) the intensity of bidders' immediate emotions in response to discrete auction events, such as submitting a bid and winning or losing an auction, and 2) the bidders' overall arousal levels during the auction. Moreover, agency affected bidding behavior and its relation to overall arousal: whereas overall arousal and bids were negatively correlated when competing against human bidders, we did not observe this relationship for computerized agents. In other words, lower levels of agency yield less emotional behavior. The results of our study have implications for the design of electronic auction platforms and markets that include both human and computerized actors.","Teubner, T.",0,,2082
5810,,"Levels of literacy and the variance in them, continue to be a problem in the world. These problems are ubiquitous in the sense that they change form from developing to developed regions, but do not seize to exist. For example, while teacher absenteeism is a fairly large problem in the developing world, student motivation can pose challenges in the developed world. Prior research has demonstrated that games can serve as an efficient medium in bridging these literacy gaps, generating student motivation (or engagement) not just in short term but also in the long term. This dissertation is dedicated to the investigation and application of spoken language technology to language acquisition contexts in the developed world. We explore the broader research question in two major contexts. Firstly, lack of proper English pronunciations is a major problem for immigrant population in developed countries like U.S. This poses various problems, including a barrier to entry into mainstream society. Therefore, the first part of the dissertation involves exploration of speech technologies merged with activity-based and arcade-based games to do pronunciation feedback for Hispanic children. This also involves using linguistic theory to determine computational criteria for intelligibility in speech and computational adaptations to reflect them. We also present results from a 3-month long evaluation of this system. Secondly, a large body of research has shown that the literacy gap between children is well-established before formal schooling begins, and predicts academic performance throughout primary, middle and secondary school. Therefore, in the second part of the dissertation we explore natural interactions for preschoolers that would engage them in game-like activities that involve short follow-up conversations. We explore the design and implementation of a conversational agent called Spot, that acts as a question-answering companion for preschool children. We present a month long study with 20 preschoolers with some insight on the potential, efficiency and usage of such a system. We end with a discussion on computational complexities in building Spot, and rules that it uses to work around speech recognition and natural language understanding errors.","Tewari, Anuj",0,,2083
5811,,"Whilst there has been a substantial amount of research into the uncanny valley, defining research that contextualises a character as they would normally be viewed remains an unexplored area. Often previous research focused solely on realistic render styles giving characters an unfair basis that tended towards the realistic, thus facilitating only one mode of animation style: realism. Furthermore, characters were not contextualized because researchers often used footage from previous productions. These characters also differed in quality as various artists worked on different productions. This research considers characterisation as three key components, the aesthetic, the behaviour and the contextualisation. Attempts were made to develop a greater understanding of how these components contribute to the appeal of a character within the field of 3D computer animation. Research consisted of two experiments. Both experiments were conducted using an online survey method. The first experiment used five different characters ranging from realistic to abstract. Each character displayed three different behaviours and the characters were contextualized within a six panel narrative. Data obtained from the first experiment was used to refine the second experiment. A further experiment was conducted to further define how combinations of different behaviours and the context containing a character affected the subject’s perception. The second experiment used three different character types and the characters were contextualized within a video stimulus. Findings from the first experiment indicated a strong relationship between character type and context. Interest with the various characters changed depending on adaptions to either the behaviour of the said character or the contextualisation. Certain character types based on appearance where better suited to different contexts than others. An abstract character was more likely to be perceived positively by the subject in a surprising context stipulated by the behaviour of the character and form of the narrative sequence. Other characters such as one based around an inanimate object found a greater positive reception with the subjects under sad contextual constraints rather than happy or surprise. The first experiment took into account various independent variables obtained from the subject and aimed to draw parallels if found between these variables and the subjects perception of a given character be it positive or negative. However, these variables namely gender, nationality and age had no effect on the subject’s perception. In the second experiment, it was found that in order for the realistic human character to be perceived more positively, the behaviour needed to match the context. When a mismatch occurred the subjects began to perceive the character more negatively. The cartoon character was however not affected by the mismatch of behaviour and context. The experiment was further expanded when two different character types were compared committing negative actions and having negative actions inflicted upon them and what effect it had on the subjects perception. It was found that a cartoon character committing a negative action was perceived positively whilst a human character committing the same act was perceived negatively. However, when a negative action was inflicted on these same characters, subjects were more concerned for the human character than the cartoon character. Results from both experiments confirm the idea that various characters are perceived very differently by the viewers and come with predefined notions within the viewer of how they should behave. What is expected of one character type is not acceptable for another character type. Cartoon characters can get away with bizarre behaviour. A real human character may have some sort of novel unusual behaviour, whilst a realistic CG human character is assessed on how realistically (normally) it behaves.

5812,Folk-Psychological Interpretation of Human vs. Humanoid Robot Behavior: Exploring the Intentional Stance toward Robots,"People rely on shared folk-psychological theories when judging behavior. These theories guide people's social interactions and therefore need to be taken into consideration in the design of robots and other autonomous systems expected to interact socially with people. It is, however, not yet clear to what degree the mechanisms that underlie people's judgments of robot behavior overlap or differ from the case of human or animal behavior. To explore this issue, participants (N = 90) were exposed to images and verbal descriptions of eight different behaviors exhibited either by a person or a humanoid robot. Participants were asked to rate the intentionality, controllability and desirability of the behaviors, and to judge the plausibility of seven different types of explanations derived from a recently proposed psychological model of lay causal explanation of human behavior. Results indicate: substantially similar judgments of human and robot behavior, both in terms of (1a) ascriptions of intentionality/controllability/desirability and in terms of (1b) plausibility judgments of behavior explanations; (2a) high level of agreement in judgments of robot behavior -(2b) slightly lower but still largely similar to agreement over human behaviors; (3) systematic differences in judgments concerning the plausibility of goals and dispositions as explanations of human vs. humanoid behavior. Taken together, these results suggest that people's intentional stance toward the robot was in this case very similar to their stance toward the human.","Thellman, S.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01962,2085
5815,,"The field of neurorobotics is still in its infancy; however, its intersecting motivations are not. On the one hand, theories of neuroscience that require immersion in the real-world can be embedded in mobile agents creating complex patterns of activity believed to be a requirement for understanding higher-order neural function. On the other, the cognitive capabilities of humans remain unparalleled by artificial agents. Emulating biology is one strategy for creating more capable artificial intelligence. Despite these strong motivations for creating neurorobotic entities technological hurdles still remain at all levels. This thesis presents two different contributions to the field of neurorobotics. The first is aimed at reducing the complexity of coupling spiking neural models with virtual agents. This is accomplished through a set of tools that act to abstract the neuroscience details from roboticists and the mechanical details away from the neuroscientists. The second contribution provides an example of how higher-level cognitive theories of speech processing can be integrated into the neurorobotics paradigm. Extracting the emotional content of a speaker, independent of what is being spoken, is a daily act for most people. The neural basis for this ability remains illusive, however cognitive models have been realized. This class of models can be integrated with the biologically realistic neural simulations in a complementary way to expand the capabilities of a neurorobotic system.","Thibeault, Corey M.",0,,2086

Embedding R into Net Logo allows the use of advanced statistical analyses, specific statistical distributions, and advanced tools for visualization from within Net Logo programs. Embedding Net Logo into R makes it possible to design simulation experiments and all settings for analysing model output from the outset, using R, and then embed Net Logo programs in this virtual laboratory.

5819,,"For this master's thesis, a unique set of cognitive prompts, designed to be delivered through a teachable robotic agent, were developed for students using Tangible Activities for Geometry (TAG), a tangible learning environment developed at Arizona State University. The purpose of these prompts is to enhance the affordances of the tangible learning environment and help researchers to better understand how we can design tangible learning environments to best support student learning. Specifically, the prompts explicitly encourage users to make use of their physical environment by asking students to perform a number of gestures and behaviors while prompting students about domain-specific knowledge. To test the effectiveness of these prompts that combine elements of cognition and physical movements, the performance and behavior of students who encounter these prompts while using TAG will be compared against the performance and behavior of students who encounter a more traditional set of cognitive prompts that would typically be used within a virtual learning environment. Following this study, data was analyzed using a novel modeling and analysis tool that combines enhanced log annotation using video and user model generation functionalities to highlight trends amongst students.","Thomas, Elissa",0,,2088
5820,,"Simulating real-life light in a virtual world is computationally very expensive even in a limited capacity. The quality of images synthesized using computer graphics algorithms for offline rendering used in movies has increased significantly over the years. Real-time applications such as games still rely on non-physics based approximation methods for computing light to meet the time budget to render a frame. The demand for higher quality graphics for more realism in games is high which requires a better approximation technique. Acceleration data structures are used for speed up the rendering process by skipping the unwanted parts of the virtual scene for light calculations. Even with such structures rendering can take a very long time depending on the size of the 3D scene. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown great success in image processing problems. Although neural networks are extensively used for training AI agents and other parts of a game, only a handful of research exists in the 3D rendering space. In this work, I explore deep learning based approaches to 1) approximate indirect illumination and soft shadow from image space buffers, and 2) build acceleration structure for faster rendering. I also show evaluations of these networks to get insights about their performance and limitations.","Thomas, Manu Mathew",0,,2089
5821,Reconsidering the Safety in Numbers Effect for Vulnerable Road Users: An Application of Agent-Based Modeling,"Objective: Increasing levels of active transport provide benefits in relation to chronic disease and emissions reduction but may be associated with an increased risk of road trauma. The safety in numbers (SiN) effect is often regarded as a solution to this issue; however, the mechanisms underlying its influence are largely unknown. We aimed to (1) replicate the SiN effect within a simple, simulated environment and (2) vary bicycle density within the environment to better understand the circumstances under which SiN applies. Methods: Using an agent-based modeling approach, we constructed a virtual transport system that increased the number of bicycles from 9% to 35% of total vehicles over a period of 1,000 time units while holding the number of cars in the system constant. We then repeated this experiment under conditions of progressively decreasing bicycle density. Results: We demonstrated that the SiN effect can be reproduced in a virtual environment, closely approximating the exponential relationships between cycling numbers and the relative risk of collision as shown in observational studies. The association, however, was highly contingent upon bicycle density. The relative risk of collisions between cars and bicycles with increasing bicycle numbers showed an association that is progressively linear at decreasing levels of density. Conclusions: Agent-based modeling may provide a useful tool for understanding the mechanisms underpinning the relationships previously observed between volume and risk under the assumptions of SiN. The SiN effect may apply only under circumstances in which bicycle density also increases over time. Additional mechanisms underpinning the SiN effect, independent of behavioral adjustment by drivers, are explored.","Thompson, J.",0,10.1080/15389588.2014.914626,2090
5824,"Genetics with Jean: the design, development and evaluation of an affective tutoring system","This paper details the design, development and evaluation of an affective tutoring system (ATS)-an e-learning system that detects and responds to the emotional states of the learner. Research into the development of ATS is an active and relatively new field, with many studies demonstrating promising results. However, there is often no practical way to apply these findings in real-world settings. The ATS described in this paper utilizes a generic affective application model to infer and appropriately respond to the learner's affective state. This approach brings several advantages, notably the potential direct support for re-use and retrospective addition of affect sensing functionality into existing e-learning software. Skin conductivity and heart rate variability measurements were used to infer affective activation and valence. The evaluation involved an experiment in which the effectiveness of the fully functional ATS was compared with that of a nonaffective version, and was conducted with 40 adult participants. The evaluation of the effectiveness of this tutoring system showed that measurable improvements in perceived learning may be obtained with a modest level of software development.","Thompson, N.",1,10.1007/s11423-016-9470-5,2091

5827,Virtual Practices and Migration Plans: a Qualitative Study of Urban Young Adults,"The paper develops our understanding of how the Internet is integrated into migration processes and influences plans and decisions to move, drawing on in-depth interviews with urban young adults planning to move. Our analysis is based on people's own experiences and perceptions, focusing on the pre-migrant phase of interregional migration. Theoretically, the decision to move is an ongoing process and practice in which Internet use is increasingly prominent. Internet-based information is assumed to increasingly be supporting and transforming individual migration plans. Results indicate that Internet use is integrated into most respondents' migration practices and is perceived as a necessity when accessing information about jobs, education, housing, and destinations. Its role varies between migration process phases, that is inspiration, screening and sorting, practical and emotional preparation, and post-processing after settlement. In the inspiration phase, Internet-based information builds migrant awareness of new opportunities in unfamiliar places, permitting larger and more distant geographical areas to be considered. The Internet is not perceived as a driving force per se, but instead a supportive agent. Internet use is believed to encourage individual interest in migration, transforming the overall meaning of migration and reducing the perceived friction of distance.

5829,,"Music's narrative qualities have received extended analytical scrutiny in recent years. Less attention has been focused on the characters that inhabit those narratives - the agents or personae within the stories music tells. This thesis synthesises and extends existing literature on musical agency in order to forge a new, analytically productive approach to the critical analysis of instances of agency in twentieth-century British cello music. Through analysis of Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto (1919), Benjamin Britten's Symphony for Cello and Orchestra (1963), John Tavener's The Protecting Veil (1987), Jonathan Harvey's Advaya (1994), Richard Ayres's No, 30 (NONcerto for Orchestra, Cello and High Soprano) (2001, rev. 2003), and Harrison Birtwistle's Tragoedia (1965), this thesis proposes a framework for sustained analysis of musical agency. Theorising the manner in which listeners construct virtual subjectivities in musical works, this thesis proposes a new approach to musical agency in which the subjective and embodied agential responses of listeners are privileged. Focus is directed towards exploring the manner in which musical representations of voice, gesture and volition engage the embodied agency of listeners through mandatory, virtually-mandatory and elective means. It is argued that listeners' subjective and embodied agential responses enable the attribution of virtual agents to musical works. These virtual agents can then partake in agential narratives for suitably inclined listeners. The thesis thereby hypothesises the existence of intra-agency: a conceptual space that blends the various agencies - composer, performer, persona, listener and context - at play in a musical work.","Thumpston, Rebecca Mary",0,,2094
5830,Perception of Social Interactions for Spatially Scrambled Biological Motion,"It is vitally important for humans to detect living creatures in the environment and to analyze their behavior to facilitate action understanding and high-level social inference. The current study employed naturalistic point-light animations to examine the ability of human observers to spontaneously identify and discriminate socially interactive behaviors between two human agents. Specifically, we investigated the importance of global body form, intrinsic joint movements, extrinsic whole-body movements, and critically, the congruency between intrinsic and extrinsic motions. Motion congruency is hypothesized to be particularly important because of the constraint it imposes on naturalistic action due to the inherent causal relationship between limb movements and whole body motion. Using a free response paradigm in Experiment 1, we discovered that many naive observers (55%) spontaneously attributed animate and/or social traits to spatially-scrambled displays of interpersonal interaction. Total stimulus motion energy was strongly correlated with the likelihood that an observer would attribute animate/social traits, as opposed to physical/mechanical traits, to the scrambled dot stimuli. In Experiment 2, we found that participants could identify interactions between spatially-scrambled displays of human dance as long as congruency was maintained between intrinsic/extrinsic movements. Violating the motion congruency constraint resulted in chance discrimination performance for the spatially-scrambled displays. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that scrambled point-light dancing animations violating this constraint were also rated as significantly less interactive than animations with congruent intrinsic/extrinsic motion. These results demonstrate the importance of intrinsic/extrinsic motion congruency for biological motion analysis, and support a theoretical framework in which early visual filters help to detect animate agents in the environment based on several fundamental constraints. Only after satisfying these basic constraints could stimuli be evaluated for high-level social content. In this way, we posit that perceptual animacy may serve as a gateway to higher-level processes that support action understanding and social inference.","Thurman, S.

Prior research has suggested that embodied systems may ameliorate BCI end-user's experience and accuracy in controlling external devices. Along these lines, we developed an immersive P300-based BCI application with a head-mounted display for virtual-local and robotic-remote social interactions and explored in a group of healthy participants the role of proprioceptive feedback in the control of a virtual surrogate (Study 1). Moreover, we compared the performance of a small group of people with spinal cord injury (SCI) to a control group of healthy subjects during virtual and robotic social interactions (Study 2), where both groups received a proprioceptive stimulation. Our attempt to combine immersive environments, BCI technologies and neuroscience of body ownership suggests that providing realistic multisensory feedback still represents a challenge. Results have shown that healthy and people living with SCI used the BCI within the immersive scenarios with good levels of performance (as indexed by task accuracy, optimizations calls and Information Transfer Rate) and per-ceived control of the surrogates. Proprioceptive feedback did not contribute to alter performance measures and body ownership sensations. Further studies are necessary to test whether sensorimotor experience represents an opportunity to improve the use of future embodied BCI applications.","Tidoni, E.",0,10.1109/tnsre.2016.2626391,2096
5844,A Therapy System for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Using a Virtual Agent and Virtual Storytelling to Reconstruct Traumatic Memories,"Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is well treatable, many people do not get the desired treatment due to barriers to care (such as stigma and cost). This paper presents a system that bridges this gap by enabling patients to follow therapy at home. A therapist is only involved remotely, tomonitor progress and serve as a safety net. With this system, patients can recollect their memories in a digital diary and recreate them in a 3D WorldBuilder. Throughout the therapy, a virtual agent is present to inform and guide patients through the sessions, employing an ontology-based question module for recollecting traumatic memories to further elicit a detailed memory recollection. In a usability study with former PTSD patients (n = 4), these questions were found useful for memory recollection. Moreover, the usability of the whole system was rated positively. This system has the potential to be a valuable addition to the spectrum of PTSD treatments, offering a novel type of home therapy assisted by a virtual agent.","Tielman, M.

5849,Design and Evaluation of Personalized Motivational Messages by a Virtual Agent that Assists in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Therapy,"Background: Systems incorporating virtual agents can play a major role in electronic-mental (e-mental) health care, as barriers to care still prevent some patients from receiving the help they need. To properly assist the users of these systems, a virtual agent needs to promote motivation. This can be done by offering motivational messages. Objective: The objective of this study was two-fold. The first was to build a motivational message system for a virtual agent assisting in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) therapy based on domain knowledge from experts. The second was to test the hypotheses that (1) computer-generated motivating messages influence users' motivation to continue with therapy, trust in a good therapy outcome, and the feeling of being heard by the agent and (2) personalized messages outperform generic messages on these factors. Methods: A system capable of generating motivational messages was built by analyzing expert (N=13) knowledge on what types of motivational statements to use in what situation. To test the 2 hypotheses, a Web-based study was performed (N=207). Participants were asked to imagine they were in a certain situation, specified by the progression of their symptoms and initial trust in a good therapy outcome. After this, they received a message from a virtual agent containing either personalized motivation as generated by the system, general motivation, or no motivational content. They were asked how this message changed their motivation to continue and trust in a good outcome as well as how much they felt they were being heard by the agent. Results: Overall, findings confirmed the first hypothesis, as well as the second hypothesis for the measurefee/ing of being heard by the agent. Personalization of the messages was also shown to be important in those situations where the symptoms were getting worse. In these situations, personalized messages outperformed general messages both in terms of motivation to continue and trust in a good therapy outcome. Conclusions: Expert input can successfully be used to develop a personalized motivational message system. Messages generated by such a system seem to improve people's motivation and trust in PTSD therapy as well as the user's feeling of being heard by a virtual agent. Given the importance of motivation, trust, and therapeutic alliance for successful therapy, we anticipate that the proposed system can improve adherence in e-mental therapy for PTSD and that it can provide a blueprint for the development of an adaptive system for persuasive messages based on expert input.","Tielman, M.

5852,Considering patient safety in autonomous e-mental health systems - detecting risk situations and referring patients back to human care,"Background: Digital health interventions can fill gaps in mental healthcare provision. However, autonomous e-mental health (AEMH) systems also present challenges for effective risk management. To balance autonomy and safety, AEMH systems need to detect risk situations and act on these appropriately. One option is sending automatic alerts to carers, but such 'auto-referral' could lead to missed cases or false alerts. Requiring users to actively self-refer offers an alternative, but this can also be risky as it relies on their motivation to do so. This study set out with two objectives. Firstly, to develop guidelines for risk detection and auto-referral systems. Secondly, to understand how persuasive techniques, mediated by a virtual agent, can facilitate self-referral. Methods: In a formative phase, interviews with experts, alongside a literature review, were used to develop a risk detection protocol. Two referral protocols were developed - one involving auto-referral, the other motivating users to self-refer. This latter was tested via crowd-sourcing (n = 160). Participants were asked to imagine they had sleeping problems with differing severity and user stance on seeking help. They then chatted with a virtual agent, who either directly facilitated referral, tried to persuade the user, or accepted that they did not want help. After the conversation, participants rated their intention to self-refer, to chat with the agent again, and their feeling of being heard by the agent. Results: Whether the virtual agent facilitated, persuaded or accepted, influenced all of these measures. Users who were initially negative or doubtful about self-referral could be persuaded. For users who were initially positive about seeking human care, this persuasion did not affect their intentions, indicating that a simply facilitating referral without persuasion was sufficient. Conclusion: This paper presents a protocol that elucidates the steps and decisions involved in risk detection, something that is relevant for all types of AEMH systems. In the case of self-referral, our study shows that a virtual agent can increase users' intention to self-refer. Moreover, the strategy of the agent influenced the intentions of the user afterwards. This highlights the importance of a personalised approach to promote the user's access to appropriate care.","Tielman, M. L.",0,10.1186/s12911-019-0796-x,2099
5857,How should a virtual agent present psychoeducation? Influence of verbal and textual presentation on adherence,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With the rise of autonomous e-mental health applications, virtual agents can play a major role in improving trustworthiness, therapy outcome and adherence. In these applications, it is important that patients adhere in the sense that they perform the tasks, but also that they adhere to the specific recommendations on how to do them well. One important construct in improving adherence is psychoeducation, information on the why and how of therapeutic interventions. In an e-mental health context, this can be delivered in two different ways: verbally by a (virtual) embodied conversational agent or just via text on the screen. The aim of this research is to study which presentation mode is preferable for improving adherence. METHODS: This study takes the approach of evaluating a specific part of a therapy, namely psychoeducation. This was done in a non-clinical sample, to first test the general constructs of the human-computer interaction. We performed an experimental study on the effect of presentation mode of psychoeducation on adherence. In this study, we took into account the moderating effects of attitude towards the virtual agent and recollection of the information. Within the paradigm of expressive writing, we asked participants (n = 46) to pick one of their worst memories to describe in a digital diary after receiving verbal or textual psychoeducation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that both the attitude towards the virtual agent and how well the psychoeducation was recollected were positively related to adherence in the form of task execution. Moreover, after controlling for the attitude to the agent and recollection, presentation of psychoeducation via text resulted in higher adherence than verbal presentation by the virtual agent did.","Tielman, M.

5862,Mere observation of body discontinuity affects perceived ownership and vicarious agency over a virtual hand,"The mental representation of one's body typically implies the continuity of its parts. Here, we used immersive virtual reality to explore whether mere observation of visual discontinuity between the hand and limb of an avatar could influence a person's sense of ownership of the virtual body (feeling of ownership, FO) and being the agent of its actions (vicarious agency, VA). In experiment 1, we tested whether placing different amounts of visual discontinuity between a virtual hand and limb differently modulate the perceived FO and VA. Participants passively observed from a first-person perspective four different versions of a virtual limb: (1) a full limb; a hand detached from the proximal part of the limb because of deletion of (2) the wrist; (3) the wrist and forearm; (4) and the wrist, forearm and elbow. After observing the static or moving virtual limb, participants reported their feeling of ownership (FO) and vicarious agency (VA) over the hand. We found that even a small visual discontinuity between the virtual hand and arm significantly decreased participants' FO over the hand during observation of the static limb. Moreover, in the same condition, we found that passive observation of the avatar's actions induced a decrease in both FO and VA. We replicated the same results in a second study (experiment 2) where we investigated the modulation of FO and VA by comparing the visual body discontinuity with a condition in which the virtual limb was partially occluded. Our data show that mere observation of limb discontinuity can change a person's ownership and agency over a virtual body observed from a first-person perspective, even in the absence of any multisensory stimulation of the real body. These results shed new light on the role of body visual continuity in modulating self-awareness and agency in immersive virtual reality.","Tieri, G.",0,10.1007/s00221-015-4202-3,2101
5866,,"Those designing realistic, human-like, virtual characters for video games are seeking to suspend disbelief for the viewer by creating characters that are believably human. However, despite increasing sophistication in performance capture animation techniques and 3D modelling software, viewers are still aware of disparities between a character's realistic, human-like appearance and their behavioural fidelity. Those characters that differ from the human norm in their appearance and. behaviour risk falling into the 'Uncanny Valley' (Mori, 1970), a hypothetical place where objects regarded as frightening or repulsive are placed. Through a series of empirical studies, I have contributed to filling an evident gap in the literature on how the uncanny may be controlled by manipulating aspects of facial expression and speech in character design. The results from my initial empirical investigation lead to a new standpoint as to possible psychological factors that contribute to the cause of the Uncanny Valley based on the idea that aberrant facial expression in a character may lead to a perception of a lack of empathy in that character. The findings are not only applicable to characters featured in video games, but also those featured in animation and in virtual simulations beyond the domain of entertainment, such as healthcare and education. v","Tinwell, Angela",0,,2102
5868,Perception of psychopathy and the Uncanny Valley in virtual characters,"Virtual characters with a realistic, human-like appearance are increasingly being used in video games and animation. However, increased realism does not necessarily imply increased acceptance and factors such as aberrant facial expression may evoke the Uncanny Valley phenomenon. In humans, personality traits such as anger, callousness, coldness, dominance, being unconcerned, and untrustworthiness are associated with psychopathy; a visual facial marker of this condition being a lack of visible response in the eye region to emotive situations. As such, the present study investigated if inadequate upper facial animation in human-like virtual characters evoked the uncanny due to a perception of psychopathic traits within a character. The results revealed that virtual characters that showed a lack of a startle response to a scream sound were regarded as most uncanny and perceptions of personality traits associated with psychopathy were a strong predictor of reported uncanniness but, that other negative personality traits not associated with psychopathy were not. The study presents possible psychological drivers of uncanniness to inform designers why a lack of detail in a character's upper face when portraying a startle response may evoke perception of specific negative personality traits in a character, to help control the uncanny in character design.

5871,Children's perception of uncanny human-like virtual characters,"The Uncanny Valley phenomenon predicts that humans will be less accepting, to the point of rejection, of synthetic agents with a human-like appearance. This is due to a perception of a strangeness or difference in how those characters look and behave from the human norm. Virtual characters with a human-like appearance are increasingly being used in children's animation and video games. While studies have been conducted in adult perception of the Uncanny Valley in human-like virtual characters, little work exists that explores children's perception of ""uncanniness"" in human-like virtual characters. Sixty-seven children between 9 and 11 years of age rated humans and human-like virtual characters showing different facial expressions for perceived strangeness, friendliness, and human-likeness. The results showed that children do experience uncanniness in human-like virtual characters, perceived as stranger, less friendly, and less human-like than humans. This perception of the uncanny was exaggerated further in human-like characters with aberrant facial expression. That is, when showing a startled expression and/or happiness with a lack of movement in the upper face including the eyes, eyebrows, and forehead. The possible implications of including human-like virtual characters in animation and video games for this age group are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

5873,,"This design-based study describes the implementation and evaluation of a technology framework to support smart classrooms and Distributed Technology Enhanced Learning (DTEL) called SAIL Smart Space (S3). S3 is an open-source technology framework designed to support students engaged in inquiry investigations as a knowledge community. To evaluate the effectiveness of S3 as a generalizable technology framework, a curriculum named PLACE (Physics Learning Across Contexts and Environments) was developed to support two grade-11 physics classes (n = 22; n = 23) engaged in a multi-context inquiry curriculum based on the Knowledge Community and Inquiry (KCI) pedagogical model. This dissertation outlines three initial design studies that established a set of design principles for DTEL curricula, and related technology infrastructures. These principles guided the development of PLACE, a twelve-week inquiry curriculum in which students drew upon their community-generated knowledge base as a source of evidence for solving ill-structured physics problems based on the physics of Hollywood movies. During the culminating smart classroom activity, the S3 framework played a central role in orchestrating student activities, including managing the flow of materials and students using real-time data mining and intelligent agents that responded to emergent class patterns. S3 supported students’ construction of knowledge through the use individual, collective and collaborative scripts and technologies, including tablets and interactive large-format displays. Aggregate and real-time ambient visualizations helped the teacher act as a wondering facilitator, supporting students in their inquiry where needed. A teacher orchestration tablet gave the teacher some control over the flow of the scripted activities, and alerted him to critical moments for intervention. Analysis focuses on S3’s effectiveness in supporting students’ inquiry across multiple learning contexts and scales of time, and in making timely and effective use of the community’s knowledge base, towards producing solutions to sophisticated, ill defined problems in the domain of physics. Video analysis examined whether S3 supported teacher orchestration, freeing him to focus less on classroom management and more on students’ inquiry. Three important outcomes of this research are a set of design principles for DTEL environments, a specific technology infrastructure (S3), and a DTEL research framework.","Tissenbaum, Michael",0,,2105

Unfortunately, classroom environments have not generally evolved to support students in the new modes of collaboration, idea sharing, and inquiry that characterize many of our research-based innovations. Responding to this challenge, our research was conducted by a multi-disciplinary design team including educational researchers, a high school physics teacher, and technology designers. We embarked on a series of design-based research projects to investigate a smart classroom infrastructure that scaffolds students and teachers in new forms of collaboration and inquiry, including a substantive role for large projected displays and small touch surfaces, as well as a dependency on students’ physical location within the room. This paper describes our designs, including: (1) the role of large displays for communicating aggregate and ambient information, (2) the role of real-time communication between students, (3) the application of intelligent software agents to enact real-time pedagogical logic, (4) support for learning across contexts, and (5) orchestration of inquiry roles, materials and environments. These designs are particularly relevant for the Learning Sciences community, as they offer insight into how the orchestrated classroom can support new forms of collaborative, cooperative and collective inquiry.

5877,,"This thesis is both an empirical and a theoretical study of how imperfect information affects economic decision making and how to measure those effects. The first chapter describes a new method for testing and measuring moral hazard in insurance contracts for which panel data is available. The method is able to measure moral hazard separately from adverse selection. It uses the variation in risk over different objects with different levels of insurance owned by the same person to isolate the average effect that insurance coverage has on precautionary effort. The method requires relatively weak symmetry between the items and applies to a large variety of standard contracts. The second chapter builds on the first chapter by utilizing the time dimension of panel data to measure moral hazard. I discuss how many every-day contracts imply different incentives to reduce risks at different times over the span of the contract. These differences can be used to measure how sophisticated agents are in allocating precautionary effort over time. I also discuss how the method presented in this chapter can be combined with the method from first chapter to obtain an identification strategy that is highly robust to alternative explanations. I apply each of my methods to a detailed insurance data set of virtual space ship insurance from a large virtual world called EVE Online and find strong evidence of moral hazard. The third chapter (with Nemanja Antić) is a theoretical study of an alternating offers bargaining model where the players have private information about their own deadline after which they have to accept any non-negative offer. Such situations arise, for example, when a firm is bargaining with its employees and both sides are facing fixed costs and finite budgets. We show that the game has an intuitive screening equilibrium with delay. The equilibrium is wasteful in the strict sense that both players would prefer to commit to reveal their private information if such commitment device was available. The equilibrium highlights the potential benefits from third-party arbitration assuming that it helps players to commit to revealing private information.","Tolvanen, Juha",0,,2108

MacDorman and Entezari for the first time and from a relatively large-size sample, empirically investigate the relationship between individual traits and uncanny-valley sensitivity. MacDorman and Entezari claim that ""the uncanny valley cannot be fully explained solely by a general cognitive theory"" because of its ""characteristic eerie feeling associated with human-looking entities that incorporate non-human features"" and MacDorman and Entezari propose, in accordance with previous studies led by MacDorman, ""to identify this feeling with specific biological adaptations for threat avoidance rooted in the fear and disgust systems"". Although MacDorman and Entezari are able to show that eight of the nine tested traits have a significant positive correlation with android eerie ratings, they are forced to admit that: ""we have not made a comparison with domains that induce cognitive dissonance without eeriness and a reduction in warmth"". In this commentary, the authors attempt to show how a more accurate association of Mori's uncanny valley with Jentsch's and Freud's uncanny concept could help to better understand the complex cognitive and emotional nature of sensitivity to Mori's uncanny valley; and thus to overcome the prevailing opposition between a purely cognitive approach to the uncanny, which the authors recently tried to defend, and the emotional and instinctive approach to this phenomenon, as analyzed by MacDorman and Entezari .

5880,Anthropomorphism and service humanoid robots: an ambiguous relationship,"Purpose - So-called humanoid robots, among a large class of service robots, are designed to work in close harmony with humans. Their anthropomorphism and its consequences have, however, been little studied. The purpose of this paper is to tackle this question by differentiating the psychological meaning of anthropomorphism from its technical meaning, understood as a human-like device. The author shows that the former generates salient projections which can be interpreted with respect to Mori's uncanny valley. The role of the task is highlighted with a theoretical attempt to integrate the robot as a social player into a Heider balance-theory inspired model. This psychological anthropomorphism, however, must be compared with technical anthropomorphism, which leads to underlining present-day difficulties in designing highly human-like functional machines with, as a consequence, running the risk of giving them the delusion of a human behaviour that they are not able to realize. Design/methodology/approach - This is a theoretical paper aimed to highlight a double meaning of anthropomorphism for humanoid robots and its consequences. Findings - Task-based interpretation of the Mori's uncanny valley and link between psychological anthropomorphism and technical anthropomorphism. Originality/value - The originality of the approach consists in applying to the humanoid robot a double approach of anthropomorphism. The first one corresponds to the classical psychological meaning producing peculiar anthropomorphic projections on a non-human being, while the second corresponds to the technical realization of a human-like machine dedicated to be integrated into a human environment.","Tondu, B.",0,10.1108/01439911211268840,2111
5882,,"Trust and speech are both essential aspects of human interaction. On the one hand, trust is necessary for vocal communication to be meaningful. On the other hand, humans have developed a way to infer someone’s trustworthiness from their voice, as well as to signal their own. Yet, research on trustworthiness attributions to speakers is scarce and contradictory, and very often uses explicit data, which do not predict actual trusting behaviour. However, measuring behaviour is very important to have an actual representation of trust. This thesis contains 5 experiments aimed at examining the influence of various voice characteristics — including accent, prosody, emotional expression and naturalness — on trusting behaviours towards virtual players and robots. The experiments have the ""investment game""—a method derived from game theory, which allows to measure implicit trustworthiness attributions over time — as their main methodology. Results show that standard accents, high pitch, slow articulation rate and smiling voice generally increase trusting behaviours towards a virtual agent, and a synthetic voice generally elicits higher trustworthiness judgments towards a robot. The findings also suggest that different voice characteristics influence trusting behaviours with different temporal dynamics. Furthermore, the actual behaviour of the various speaking agents was modified to be more or less trustworthy, and results show that people’s trusting behaviours develop over time accordingly. Also, people reinforce their trust towards speakers that they deem particularly trustworthy when these speakers are indeed trustworthy, but punish them when they are not. This suggests that people’s trusting behaviours might also be influenced by the congruency of their first impressions with the actual experience of the speaker’s trustworthiness — a ""congruency effect"". This has important implications in the context of Human–Machine Interaction, for example for assessing users’ reactions to speaking machines which might not always function properly. Taken together, the results suggest that voice influences trusting behaviour, and that first impressions of a speaker’s trustworthiness based on vocal cues might not be indicative of future trusting behaviours, and that trust should be measured dynamically.","Torre, Ilaria",0,,2112
5883,Moving Agent Pedestrians Through Space and Time,"The choreography of pedestrian movement is important to many domains of interest, particularly in the geographical sciences. Agent-based models have become a popular tool for simulating movement, allowing experimentation with scenarios in computer models that might not be amenable to real-world investigation. The fidelity of agent-based movement models is naturally most acute when the models driving their synthetic characters reproduce the geography of their behaviors appropriately: by placing people in the right places, at the right times, doing the right things, in the right contexts. Most simulation environments for moving agent pedestrians, however, rely on simple, abstract physical heuristics to drive synthetic characters and they focus on generating plausible coarse-grained movement patterns, which might not always map to real-world pedestrian behavior. Moreover, existing approaches often produce serious mechanical artifacts in simulation. I contend that agent-based models of pedestrian movement can benefit more fully from a comprehensive infusion of realistic movement behavior and I present the case for, and proven usefulness of, a geographic engine for driving synthetic actors in simulation. Whereas many existing approaches use particle physics, my approach is sourced in theory and observation, modeling lower, medium-, and higher level behavioral geographies for perceiving and sorting objects, route planning and wayfinding, orientation and locomotion, physical steering, mediating interactions, and determining the space and time for scheduling and realizing activities, with the results that the scheme that I present can automatically generate realistic-looking and realistic-behaving synthetic pedestrians for experimentation.","Torrens, P.

5887,,"Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of the plague, is one of the deadliest pathogens to have ever afflicted mankind, wiping out a major portion of the population of Europe. Y. pestis, like many other virulent pathogens, has evolved various factors allowing it to successfully invade human hosts by evading the host immune systems. As part of this survival mechanism a subset of these pathogens, including the predominantly extracellular pathogen Y. pestis, have developed mechanisms to survive in macrophages. A novel rip operon (r equired for intracellular proliferation) was discovered to be essential for the survival and replication of Y. pestis in activated macrophages. Conservation of this rip operon among other macrophage-residing pathogens such as Burkholderia and Salmonella species suggests that this previously uncharacterized pathway is also required for the survival of these pathogens. The rip operon encodes three proteins RipA, RipB, and RipC, which are believed to possess a metabolic role. The X-ray crystal structures of both RipA and RipC have been solved. The RipA structure belongs to the typical Family I CoA transferases albeit displaying a unique tetrameric state. Biochemical analysis suggests that RipA is a butyryl-CoA transferase and we hypothesize that the end product of the rip operon is butyrate, a known anti-inflammatory, previously observed to lower NO levels in macrophages. RipC is a homotrimer with a monomeric structure that consists of a (β/&agr;)8 TIM-barrel fold. The presence of the trimer was confirmed in solution by size-exclusion chromatography, with a possible role for the unresolved C-terminal domain in capping the adjacent monomer. Sequence and structure comparisons with homologous proteins also suggest RipC is a putative CoA or CoA-derivative binding protein, although no function was determined. Extensive analyses of RipA function and possible CoA transferase activity were carried out. First, a gating mechanism for CoA binding mediated by a flexible G(V/I)G loop was examined through structural characterization and molecular dynamic simulations of wildtype (WT)-RipA. An acyl-group binding pocket was also identified in WT-RipA through molecular dynamics and docking with additional mutational studies suggesting a role in acyl-CoA specificity. These mutational studies also yielded unique crystal structures revealing important conformational changes orchestrated by the conserved acyl-group binding pocket phenylalanine, F85, and the G(V/I)G loop, which are implicated in protecting reaction intermediates within the CoA transferase pathway. Furthermore, mutations at the catalytic glutamate and the flexible G(V/I)G loop also revealed their requirement for function. In our efforts towards identifying a broad-spectrum antibacterial therapeutic, we illustrate the optimization of an ensemble-based virtual screening protocol utilizing differential scanning fluorimetry binding data for RipA. To discriminate the competitive inhibitors from the pool of binders, we developed an inhibition assay, and reported a single weak, dose-dependent competitive inhibitor. Thus, the results of this molecular study of Y. pestis RipA provide a structural platform for rational inhibitor design, which may lead to a greater understanding of the role of RipA in this unique virulence pathway","Torres, Rodrigo",0,,2115
5889,The Theory of Neural Cognition Applied to Robotics Invited Review Article,"The Theory of neural Cognition (TnC) states that the brain does not process information, it only represents information (i.e., it is 'only' a memory). The TnC explains how a memory can become an actor pursuing various goals, and proposes explanations concerning the implementation of a large variety of cognitive abilities, such as attention, memory, language, planning, intelligence, emotions, motivation, pleasure, consciousness and personality. The explanatory power of this new framework extends further though, to tackle special psychological states such as hypnosis, the placebo effect and sleep, and brain diseases such as autism, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. The most interesting findings concern robotics: because the TnC considers the cortical column to be the key cognitive unit (instead of the neuron), it reduces the requirements for a brain implementation to only 160,000 units (instead of 86 billion). A robot exhibiting human-like cognitive abilities is therefore within our reach.","Touzet, C. F.",0,10.5772/60693,2116
5890,,"Choosing the right or the best option is often a demanding and challenging task for the user (e.g., a customer in an online retailer) when there are many available alternatives. In fact, the user rarely knows which offering will provide the highest value. To reduce the complexity of the choice process, automated recommender systems generate personalized recommendations. These recommendations take into account the preferences collected from the user in an explicit (e.g., letting users express their opinion about items) or implicit (e.g., studying some behavioral features) way. Such systems are widespread; research indicates that they increase the customers' satisfaction and lead to higher sales. Preference handling is one of the core issues in the design of every recommender system. This kind of system often aims at guiding users in a personalized way to interesting or useful options in a large space of possible options. Therefore, it is important for them to catch and model the user's preferences as accurately as possible. In this thesis, we develop a comparative preference-based user model to represent the user's preferences in conversational recommender systems. This type of user model allows the recommender system to capture several preference nuances from the user's feedback. We show that, when applied to conversational recommender systems, the comparative preference-based model is able to guide the user towards the best option while the system is interacting with her. We empirically test and validate the suitability and the practical computational aspects of the comparative preference-based user model and the related preference relations by comparing them to a sum of weights-based user model and the related preference relations. Product configuration, scheduling a meeting and the construction of autonomous agents are among several artificial intelligence tasks that involve a process of constrained optimization, that is, optimization of behavior or options subject to given constraints with regards to a set of preferences. When solving a constrained optimization problem, pruning techniques, such as the branch and bound technique, point at directing the search towards the best assignments, thus allowing the bounding functions to prune more branches in the search tree. Several constrained optimization problems may exhibit dominance relations. These dominance relations can be particularly useful in constrained optimization problems as they can instigate new ways (rules) of pruning non optimal solutions. Such pruning methods can achieve dramatic reductions in the search space while looking for optimal solutions. A number of constrained optimization problems can model the user's preferences using the comparative preferences. In this thesis, we develop a set of pruning rules used in the branch and bound technique to efficiently solve this kind of optimization problem. More specifically, we show how to generate newly defined pruning rules from a dominance algorithm that refers to a set of comparative preferences. These rules include pruning approaches (and combinations of them) which can drastically prune the search space. They mainly reduce the number of (expensive) pairwise comparisons performed during the search while guiding constrained optimization algorithms to find optimal solutions. Our experimental results show that the pruning rules that we have developed and their different combinations have varying impact on the performance of the branch and bound technique.","Trabelsi, Walid",0,,2117
5891,,"Kidney disease and toxicity is increasingly being tied to mitochondrial dysfunction. Cheminformatic modeling and high-throughput phenotypic screens can discover discrete subsets of selective ligands that correlate with mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) and accelerate recovery from acute kidney injury (AKI). Serotonergic (5-HT) stimulation has been shown to cause MB. Subtype specific ligands for 5-HT1F and 5-HT2A/C receptors show increased uncoupled oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Our overall goal, in a screening assay, is to discover small molecules that increase MB to be used as drugs in the treatment of diseases that exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction. To achieve this goal we created pharmacophore models of these ligands to virtually explore new chemical space in large chemical libraries to narrow the list of compounds tested to a tractable number. 4394 compounds were identified for 5-HTIF from a 1.6 M compound library and 112 for 5-HT2A/C from a 50,000 compound library. These compounds were screened for mitochondrial biogenesis and identified with chemotypes generated by computational approaches including pharmacophore and ligand-receptor docking. Additionally, pharmacophores and ligand-receptor docking provided increased correlation with biological activity compared to chemotypes generated by the much more commonly used Tanimoto Coefficient (TC). These descriptive and predictive models were then used to probe vast amounts of virtual small molecule chemical space to discover novel scaffolds for mitochondria) biogenesis within virtual compound databases, and these compounds were then validated in renal proximal tubule cells (RPTCs) using a respirometry assay. Two compounds identified by the 5-HT1F pharmacophore and 5 compounds identified by the 5-HT2A/C pharmacophore were found to be biogenic in the RPTCs and result in MB. The compounds found with the 5HT2A/C pharmacophore were then evaluated for receptor internalization and calcium flux to show receptor specificity. Novel predictive models and experimental therapeutics identified here, will allow for continued identification of pharmacologic agents that cause MB which will bring the reality of new therapeutics for kidney disease one step closer to the clinic.","Trager, Richard Edwin, III",0,,2118
5892,Modeling Sustainability Transitions on Complex Networks,"There has been renewed interest in sociotechnical systems in the context of transitioning to a more sustainable society. While gains have been made in the qualitative understanding of sustainable transitions and sociotechnical systems, these approaches have not been well-operationalized. Given the importance of meeting future energy and environmental policy targets, there is need to develop predictive techniques and more robust methods to quantify and analyze sociotechnical systems undergoing rapid change and uncertainty due to sustainability pressures. Sustainability transitions depend on large-scale diffusion of technological and behavioral innovations on physical and virtual networked systems. Transitions can therefore be viewed as a subclass of diffusion phenomenon and subject to a range of mathematical and computational methods. We review, categorize, and critically assess methodological and theoretical approaches that integrate different aspects of sustainability, innovation, and complexity. We argue that these approaches should be adapted to improve our understanding of the behavior and dynamics of a broad range of sociotechnical systems to meet sustainability objectives. We therefore also make the conceptual link between complexity and sustainability as complimentary fields of research to inform policy and decision making to achieve more sustainable outcomes.

5893,Simulating complex social behaviours of virtual agents through case-based planning,"In commercial video games and simulations, non-player characters are capable of quite complex behaviour. Very often though, each class of non-player characters (that we further call virtual agents) is manually programmed or scripted. This means that instead of possessing some level of intelligence, allowing the agent to decide dynamically on the actions it needs to perform, we supply the agent with a list of possible situations that may arise in the game. For each such situation, we give the agent a pre-programmed script that tells it how to behave. Producing such scripts for every role an agent might play in a game or simulation is a very costly exercise. This may be acceptable in commercial game development, where budgets for modern games are sometimes comparable to budgets of Hollywood movies, but not adequate for research simulations and indie games. In this paper, we discuss how indie games and research simulations can be enriched with the sophisticated social behaviour of virtual agents in a semi-automatic manner through the use of Al planning. By supplying agents with roles and developing a computational model of their needs, we can use Al planning (also known as dynamic planning) to increase the complexity of agent behaviour dramatically and at the same time achieve a high degree of automation and reduce the development costs. Al planning is gaining popularity in games development, but it is often discarded due to performance issues. We will show how to improve the performance of planning process through the use of dynamic institutions and case-based planning. We will illustrate the aforementioned ideas on an example of developing a Virtual Reality simulation of everyday life in Ancient Mesopotamia. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

5895,Displaying and Regulating Different Social Response Patterns: A Computational Agent Model,"Differences in social responses of individuals can often be related to differences in functioning of certain neurological mechanisms. This paper presents a computational agent model capable of showing different types of social response patterns based on such mechanisms, adopted from theories on mirror neuron systems, emotion integration, emotion regulation, and empathy. The presented agent model provides a basis for humanlike social response patterns of virtual agents in the context of simulation-based training (e.g. for training of physicians or therapists), gaming, or for agent-based generation of virtual stories.","Treur, J.",0,10.1007/s12559-013-9233-0,2121
5896,Note-taking within MetaTutor: interactions between an intelligent tutoring system and prior knowledge on note-taking and learning,"Hypermedia learning environments (HLE) unevenly present new challenges and opportunities to learning processes and outcomes depending on learner characteristics and instructional supports. In this experimental study, we examined how one such HLE-MetaTutor, an intelligent, multi-agent tutoring system designed to scaffold cognitive and metacognitive self-regulated learning (SRL) processes-interacts with learner's prior domain knowledge to affect their note-taking activities and subsequent learning outcomes. Sixty (N = 60) college students studied with MetaTutor for 120 min and took notes on hypermedia content of the human circulatory system. Log-files and screen recordings of learner-system interactions were used to analyze notes for several quantitative and qualitative variables. Results show that most note-taking was a verbatim copy of instructional content, which negatively related to the post-test measure of learning. There was an interaction between prior knowledge and pedagogical agent scaffolding, such that low prior knowledge students took a greater quantity of notes compared to their high prior knowledge counterparts, but only in the absence of MetaTutor SRL scaffolding; when agent SRL scaffolding was present, the note-taking activities of low prior knowledge students were statistically equivalent to the number of notes taken by their high prior knowledge counterparts. Theoretical and instructional design implications are discussed.","Trevors, G.",1,10.1007/s11423-014-9343-8,2122
5899,,"Analyzing large trajectory sets enables deeper insights into multiple real-world problems. For example, animal migration data, multi-agent analysis, and virtual entertainment can all benefit from deriving conclusions from large sets of trajectory data. However, the analysis is complicated by several factors when using traditional analytic techniques. For example, directly visualizing the trajectory set results in a multitude of lines that cannot be easily understood. Statistical analysis methods and non-direct visualization techniques (e.g., parallel coordinates) produce conclusions that are non-intuitive and difficult to understand. By using two complementary processes—clustering and visualization—a new approach is developed to analyzing large trajectory sets. First, clustering techniques are developed and refined to group related trajectories together. From these similar sets, a trajectory composition visualization is created and implemented that clearly depicts the cluster characteristics including application-specific attributes. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two separate and distinct types of data sets resulting in actionable conclusions. The first application, multi-agent analysis, represents a rich, spatial data set. When analyzed using this approach, deficiencies in the underlying artificial intelligence algorithms can be determined leading to improved agent performance. Student course-grade history analysis, the second application, requires adapting the approach for a non-spatial data set. However, the results enable a clear understanding of which courses are most critical in a student's career and which student groups require assistance to succeed. This research contributes to methods for trajectory clustering, techniques for large-scale visualization of trajectory data, and processes for analyzing student data.","Trimm, David Alan",0,,2123
5900,Using Eye Tracking to Identify Faking Attempts During Penile Plethysmography Assessment,"Penile plethysmography (PPG) is considered the most rigorous method for sexual interest assessment. Nevertheless, it is subject to faking attempts by participants, which compromises the internal validity of the instrument. To date, various attempts have been made to limit voluntary control of sexual response during PPG assessments, without satisfactory results. This exploratory research examined eye-tracking technologies' ability to identify the presence of cognitive strategies responsible for erectile inhibition during PPG assessment. Eye movements and penile responses for 20 subjects were recorded while exploring animated human-like computer-generated stimuli in a virtual environment under three distinct viewing conditions: (a) the free visual exploration of a preferred sexual stimulus without erectile inhibition; (b) the viewing of a preferred sexual stimulus with erectile inhibition; and (c) the free visual exploration of a non-preferred sexual stimulus. Results suggest that attempts to control erectile responses generate specific eye-movement variations, characterized by a general deceleration of the exploration process and limited exploration of the erogenous zone. Findings indicate that recording eye movements can provide significant information on the presence of competing covert processes responsible for erectile inhibition. The use of eye-tracking technologies during PPG could therefore lead to improved internal validity of the plethysmographic procedure.","Trottier, D.",0,10.1080/00224499.2013.832133,2124
5904,"New Wine, Old Wineskins: Authorship and Digitalizing Nigerian Oral Poetry through New Media Technologies","Much of Nigerian oral poetry, especially the musical genre, has been increasingly reduced to digital formats through the instrumentality of new media technologies. This transformation has,however, not been sufficiently acknowledged in oral literary researches and discourses. This alternative existence acquired by the oral forms manifests itself in digital technological modes like CDs, VCDs, DVDs, digital radio and television and the internet which assure them of longevity. This paper, therefore, engages Nigerian oral poetry and its inscription in digital processes using new media technologies. In particular, it negotiates the trajectory of transforming primary orality to secondary and tertiary orality through which oral performances like songs have acquired new modes of existence and meanings by way of recordings and digitalization using the new media. Many of these poetic forms have travelled through historical time to the postmodern moment as migrant metaphors and have become stored in digital forms thus making them new wine though preserved in the old wineskins of the poets and new media processes. Using an emergent generation of Nigerian popular poets and musical artistes, the paper problematizes the episteme of authorship. It interrogates the very idea of authorship in the contested and interstitial space of communal and individual authorship in the digital age where the term has undergone radical destabilisation. Who owns the oral forms, for instance? Is it the so-called anonymous composer in traditional society, the collector or recorder who mediates the creative process and becomes a surrogate agent, or the contemporary artist who is heir to this timeless tradition of oral intellection through performances that are digitalized and stored in retrieval systems, or is it a virtual community of authors, or a hybrid of all of these? The paper concludes that digital technologies are a means of preserving these oral forms and endowing them with vitality and enduring relevance to meet the immediacy and urgency of postmodern societal needs in Nigeria.","Tsaaior, J.

5905,Child Perception of Humanoid Robot Appearance and Behavior,"This study investigated children's attitudes toward humanoid robots that exhibit various anthropomorphic appearances and behaviors. A total of 578 children aged from 8 to 14 years were recruited to evaluate humanoid robots depicted either in still images (N = 267) or videos (N = 311). The results showed that the degree of anthropomorphism affected children's attitudes toward the robots. An uncanny valley was observed in this study, indicating that children prefer robots created with a moderate level of human likeness over those that have a highly human-like appearance but remain distinguishable from humans. A striking finding was that moving robots exhibiting social cues moderate the uncanny valley plot, thus contradicting Mori's uncanny valley hypothesis, which posits that emotional responses are greater for moving robots than for static robots. In addition, the children in this study perceived the robots as more socially and physically attractive when the robots exhibited social cues. In summary, the current results suggest that children prefer moderately realistic robots and that robot behavior is a key determinant of how children perceive robots. A moderate level of anthropomorphic appearance combined with appropriate social cues can enhance child preferences for and acceptance of robots.","Tung, F. W.",0,10.1080/10447318.2016.1172808,2126
5906,Exploring customer experiences with robotics in hospitality,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore consumer reviews with robotics based on the five dimensions for evaluating user experiences (i.e. embodiment, emotion, human-oriented perception, feeling of security and co-experience), as derived from research in human-robot interactions (HRI). Design/methodology/approach - The study first reviews the five dimensions for evaluating user experiences in HRI and then analyzes user experiences with robotics at four hotels (i.e. Yotel New York, Aloft Cupertino, Henn-na Hotel Japan and Marriott Residence Inn LAX) based on reviews on TripAdvisor, Agoda, Yelp and Booking.com. Findings - The findings highlight the influence of robotic embodiment and human-oriented perceptions on consumer experiences. The findings also suggest that users and robots can co-create novel experiences, with some guests even proactively seeking new opportunities to interact and communicate with robots to develop a certain level of relationship with them. Research limitations/implications - An understanding of user experiences from HRIs can inform future hospitality and tourism research and management. Practical implications - This study contributes to hospitality and tourism management by highlighting current practices with robotics to suggest areas of improvements for enhancing future consumer experiences. Social implications - Consumer experiences will change rapidly as hospitality and tourism management deploys robotics in the future. Originality/value - This is one of the early studies in the field to explore consumer experiences with robotics based on the five dimensions for evaluating user experiences from research in HRI. In doing so, this study provides a number of theoretical and managerial implications relevant for hospitality and tourism research and practice.","Tung, V. W. S.",0,10.1108/ijchm-06-2017-0322,2127
5908,Human-Like Motion Planning Based on Game Theoretic Decision Making,"Robot motion planners are increasingly being equipped with an intriguing property: human likeness. This property can enhance human-robot interactions and is essential for a convincing computer animation of humans. This paper presents a (multi-agent) motion planner for dynamic environments that generates human-like motion. The presented motion planner stands out against other motion planners by explicitly modeling human-like decision making and taking interdependencies between individuals into account, which is achieved by applying game theory. Non-cooperative games and the concept of a Nash equilibrium are used to formulate the decision process that describes human motion behavior while walking in a populated environment. We evaluate whether our approach generates human-like motions through two experiments: a video study showing simulated, moving pedestrians, wherein the participants are passive observers, and a collision avoidance study, wherein the participants interact within virtual reality with an agent that is controlled by different motion planners. The experiments are designed as variations of the Turing test, which determines whether participants can differentiate between human motions and artificially generated motions. The results of both studies coincide and show that the participants could not distinguish between human motion behavior and our artificial behavior based on game theory. In contrast, the participants could distinguish human motions from motions based on established planners, such as the reciprocal velocity obstacles or social forces.","Turnwald, A.",0,10.1007/s12369-018-0487-2,2128
5910,,"This article argues that to understand how new technologies and media can become co-agents in the process of pedagogical change, we first need to understand teachers' complex relationship with new technologies and media in both their personal and their professional lives. A conceptual framework is delineated for constructing a complex narrative ecology around teachers' professional and personal relationship with new technologies and media. The narrative ecology model, it is proposed, can be used to story the otherwise isolated but constituent aspects of teachers' experiences of technology. It is an approach predicated on a view of professional learning as a narrative process. The model is applied and evaluated in a fine-grained narrative case study of one student teacher's approach to the use of a virtual learning environment (VLE) in an intervention within a primary school in the United Kingdom. The findings suggest that using the narrative ecology model to story teachers' personal and professional experiences with technology brings meaning and new insights to teachers' nuanced relationships with technology, creating a site for further professional development and learning.

5911,,"As digital technologies have expanded, so have the literacy sponsors that support and shape how those technologies are used. This project focuses on one of these growing sites of sponsorship surrounding a specific health-tracking technology: wearable Fitbit devices. While much of the work on literacy sponsorship has focused on institutional sponsors as agents, I argue that the picture becomes more complicated and interesting when we place our focus on how users—often considered the sponsored—can become agents in a system that may have marginalized, excluded, or used them. Using a combination of qualitative methods, this dissertation highlights how various literacy sponsors create possibilities and constraints, how communities of users support and resist these frameworks, and how users can become digital literacy sponsors. This research maps the ecologies of sponsorship that Fitbit users engage in as both consumers and producers. The concept of “ecologies of sponsorship” is a unique contribution of this project, which expands traditional frameworks for understanding the stakeholders in literacy development to account for digital, networked environments. In addition to typical tracking practices, this research found that significant groups of users “hack” the technology to help them work toward subversive goals. Some users reject the stated purposes of health-tracking technology, instead manipulating their data to create an illusion of health. Some of these users have shared their alternative goals and tactics in online communities, which allows them to become sponsors of metistic digital literacies. Rather than transforming Fitbit technology and ideologies of health through explicit hostility or force, this research explores how users developed metistic practices to subvert health-tracking systems from within. Though this research focuses on the development of digital literacies in extra-curricular spaces, there are important implications for writing classrooms that aim to help students develop digital literacies. This research raises questions about how our classroom practices might shift if we add metistic literacies to frameworks that already support functional, critical, and rhetorical literacies. And by considering classroom-based teaching in the context of larger ecologies of sponsorship, this research highlights a need for new pedagogical practices that account for the distributed nature of technological expertise.","Tweedale, Kimberly",0,,2130

The present study investigated whether observing virtual humans engaging in a tutoring session on a difficult learning topic, rotational kinematics, with embedded positive goal-oriented dialogue would increase knowledge of the material and perpetuate a shift in an observer's goal orientation from performance avoidance goal orientation (PAVGO) to learning goal orientation (LGO). Learning gains were observed in pretest to posttest knowledge retention tests. Significant negative changes from pretest to posttest occurred across conditions for LGO. Additionally, significant increases from PAVGO pretest to posttest were observed in the control condition; however, PAVGO did not significantly change in the experimental condition.","Twyford, J.",1,10.1177/0735633116667371,2131
5914,,"Humans are able to understand meaning intuitively and generalize from a single observation, as opposed to machines which require several examples to learn and recognize a new physical expression. This trait is one of the main roadblocks in natural human-machine interaction. Particularly, in gestures which are an intrinsic part of human communication. In the aim of natural interaction with machines, a framework must be developed to include the adaptability humans portray to understand gestures from a single observation. This problem is known as one-shot gesture recognition, and it has been researched previously. Nevertheless, most approaches rely heavily on purely numerical solutions, and leave aside the mechanisms humans use to perceive and execute gestures. A framework is proposed in this dissertation to incorporate the processes associated with gesture perception and execution to the paradigm of one-shot gesture recognition. By observing how humans perceive and process gestures, we can learn how to generate ""human-like"" gestures by machines. This is achieved by employing model-based physiological constraints and quantifications of human variability to suggest how humans might replicate a particular gesture. The two approaches implemented, referred to as the forward and backward approach, rely on different aspects of human motion to generate these artificial gesture examples. The forward approach leverages spatial variability centered on the human shoulder and the reach of the hand within that work envelope. Conversely, the backward approach leverages the kinematic model of the human arm and strategies for trajectory planning such as jerk minimization and energy expenditure, commonly used to model human motion. The aforementioned approaches begin with the same subset of key points within the motion trajectory. These points have been found to correlate with fluctuations in mu power using electroencephalographic signals (EEG) during gesture observation. It was found that the executed gestures contain a bounded set of salient points within the motion trajectory that relate to neural signatures observed when passively watching gestures using EEG, referred to as the gist of the gesture. Therefore, this gist can be used to capture large variability within each gesture while keeping the main traits of the gesture class. The performance of the method is evaluated in terms of independence from the classifying method used, efficiency in terms of comparing to traditional N-shot learning approaches, and coherence in recognition among machines and humans. The obtained results show the performance of the developed framework, demonstrating independence from the selected classification strategy having used four different state-of-the-art classification algorithms. In the context of one-shot learning, the proposed framework resembles the way humans use their bodies for gesture recognition, by generating artificial gesture examples which capture human-like variation for all gesture classes.","Ubaldi, Maria Eugenia Cabrera",0,,2132
5915,A Bayesian Model of the Uncanny Valley Effect for Explaining the Effects of Therapeutic Robots in Autism Spectrum Disorder,"One of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is impaired reciprocal social interaction, especially in processing emotional information. Social robots are used to encourage children with ASD to take the initiative and to interact with the robotic tools to stimulate emotional responses. However, the existing evidence is limited by poor trial designs. The purpose of this study was to provide computational evidence in support of robot-assisted therapy for children with ASD. We thus propose an emotional model of ASD that adapts a Bayesian model of the uncanny valley effect, which holds that a human-looking robot can provoke repulsion and sensations of eeriness. Based on the unique emotional responses of children with ASD to the robots, we postulate that ASD induces a unique emotional response curve, more like a cliff than a valley. Thus, we performed numerical simulations of robot-assisted therapy to evaluate its effects. The results showed that, although a stimulus fell into the uncanny valley in the typical condition, it was effective at avoiding the uncanny cliff in the ASD condition. Consequently, individuals with ASD may find it more comfortable, and may modify their emotional response, if the robots look like deformed humans, even if they appear ""creepy"" to typical individuals. Therefore, we suggest that our model explains the effects of robot-assisted therapy in children with ASD and that human-looking robots may have potential advantages for improving social interactions in ASD.","Ueyama, Y.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0138642,2133
5916,"Staged Development of Robot Skills: Behavior Formation, Affordance Learning and Imitation with Motionese","Inspired by infant development, we propose a three staged developmental framework for an anthropomorphic robot manipulator. In the first stage, the robot is initialized with a basic reach-and-enclose-on-contact movement capability, and discovers a set of behavior primitives by exploring its movement parameter space. In the next stage, the robot exercises the discovered behaviors on different objects, and learns the caused effects; effectively building a library of affordances and associated predictors. Finally, in the third stage, the learned structures and predictors are used to bootstrap complex imitation and action learning with the help of a cooperative tutor. The main contribution of this paper is the realization of an integrated developmental system where the structures emerging from the sensorimotor experience of an interacting real robot are used as the sole building blocks of the subsequent stages that generate increasingly more complex cognitive capabilities. The proposed framework includes a number of common features with infant sensorimotor development. Furthermore, the findings obtained from the self-exploration and motionese guided human-robot interaction experiments allow us to reason about the underlying mechanisms of simple-to-complex sensorimotor skill progression in human infants.","Ugur, E.",0,10.1109/tamd.2015.2426192,2134

5924,Sustained neural activity to gaze and emotion perception in dynamic social scenes,"To understand social interactions, we must decode dynamic social cues from seen faces. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the neural responses underlying the perception of emotional expressions and gaze direction changes as depicted in an interaction between two agents. Subjects viewed displays of paired faces that first established a social scenario of gazing at each other (mutual attention) or gazing laterally together (deviated group attention) and then dynamically displayed either an angry or happy facial expression. The initial gaze change elicited a significantly larger M170 under the deviated than the mutual attention scenario. At around 400 ms after the dynamic emotion onset, responses at posterior MEG sensors differentiated between emotions, and between 1000 and 2200 ms, left posterior sensors were additionally modulated by social scenario. Moreover, activity on right anterior sensors showed both an early and prolonged interaction between emotion and social scenario. These results suggest that activity in right anterior sensors reflects an early integration of emotion and social attention, while posterior activity first differentiated between emotions only, supporting the view of a dual route for emotion processing. Altogether, our data demonstrate that both transient and sustained neurophysiological responses underlie social processing when observing interactions between others.","Ulloa, J.

5931,,"Successfully perceiving and recognizing the actions of others is of utmost importance for the survival of many species. For humans, action perception is considered to support important higher order social skills, such as communication, intention understanding and empathy, some of which may be uniquely human. Over the last two decades, neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies in primates have identified a network of brain regions in occipito-temporal, parietal and premotor cortex that are associated with perception of actions, also known as the Action Observation Network (AON). Despite growing body of literature, the functional properties and connectivity patterns of this network remain largely unknown. The goal of this dissertation is to address questions about functional properties and connectivity patterns of AON with a specific focus on whether this system shows specificity for biological agents. To this end, we collaborated with a robotics lab, and manipulated the humanlikeness of agents that perform recognizable actions by varying visual appearance and movement kinematics. We then used a range of measurement modalities including cortical EEG oscillations, event-related brain potentials (ERPs), and fMRI together with a range of analytical techniques including pattern classification, representational similarity analysis (RSA), and dynamical causal modeling (DCM) to study the functional properties, temporal dynamics, and connectivity patterns of the AON. While our findings shed light whether the human brain shows specificity for biological agents, the interdisciplinary work with robotics also allowed us to address questions regarding human factors for artificial agent design in social robotics and human-robot interaction such as uncanny valley, which is concerned with what kind of artificial agents we should design so that humans can accept them as social partners.","Urgen, Burcu Aysen",0,,2139
5932,Uncanny valley as a window into predictive processing in the social brain,"Uncanny valley refers to humans' negative reaction to almost-but-not-quite-human agents. Theoretical work proposes prediction violation as an explanation for uncanny valley but no empirical work has directly tested it. Here, we provide evidence that supports this theory using event-related brain potential recordings from the human scalp. Human subjects were presented images and videos of three agents as EEG was recorded: a real human, a mechanical robot, and a realistic robot in between. The real human and the mechanical robot had congruent appearance and motion whereas the realistic robot had incongruent appearance and motion. We hypothesize that the appearance of the agent would provide a context to predict her movement, and accordingly the perception of the realistic robot would elicit an N400 effect indicating the violation of predictions, whereas the human and the mechanical robot would not. Our data confirmed this hypothesis suggesting that uncanny valley could be explained by violation of one's predictions about human norms when encountered with realistic but artificial human forms. Importantly, our results implicate that the mechanisms underlying perception of other individuals in our environment are predictive in nature.","Urgen, B.

To this end, four different instructional materials were created. Each material was identical, with only the extent of emotional design differing. For the Neutral Design (ND) group, none of the emotional design principles were used (monochromatic grayscale). For the Colorful Design (CD) group, attention-grabbing, bright and saturated colors were added to the material. For the Anthropomorphic Design (AD) group, expressive facial expressions (anthropomorphism of lifeless objects and expressive facial expressions of human characters) were incorporated into the material. Finally, for the Anthropomorphic Design and Sound Effects (ADSE) group, interesting sound effects were also used. The study was conducted at a middle school with a group of 106 students. Positive emotions were measured using an emWave emotion detection device. Results revealed that positive emotions generally increased as the amount of emotional design features increased. However, while students who used the Colorful Design invested more mental effort compared to students who used the Neutral Design, students who used the Anthropomorphic Design and Sound Effects (ADSE) invested less mental effort compared to students who used the Colorful Design. In addition, students who used the Colorful Design outperformed students who used the Neutral Design in terms of their recall scores. No significant difference in terms of transfer of learning scores was observed across the groups.

5938,Wearable Robots in rehabilitative therapy: A step towards transhumanism or an ecological support?,"In the present paper we want to argue that Wearable Robots (i.e., technological devices used to restore the possibility of walking and re-establishing ""normal"" human life) should not necessarily be anthropomorphic, in order to respect human autonomy, freedom, and nature. Moreover, we argue that this non-anthropomorphism does not necessarily lead to transhumanism. To adequately discuss this topic, we are called to consider various aspects embedded in the question: the difference between restoring and enhancing, i.e., the difference between considering human nature as normative, or will (or wish) as the main criterion of choice; the difference between exceeding the limits of human nature (i.e., human enhancement) and restoring human functions; and, finally, the nature of the function itself. We will introduce a ""weak"" notion of autonomy and freedom, dealing with rehabilitation and motility, in order to assess the use of Wearable Robots in rehabilitative medicine. Hence we will argue that the less constraints that patients have, the freer they are. All these aspects also imply an anthropological and ecological view, since they have to do with the relationship of the human being with its environment.","Valera, L.",0,10.4013/fsu.2016.172.03,2143

Indeed, even abstract geometric shapes are readily perceived as intentional agents when they move in certain ways, and such percepts can dramatically influence behavior. In the wolfpack effect, for example, subjects maneuver a disc around a display in order to avoid several randomly moving darts. When the darts point toward the disc, subjects (falsely) perceive that the darts are chasing them, and this impairs several types of visuomotor performance. Are such effects reflexive, automatic features of visual processing? Or might they instead arise only as contingent strategies in tasks in which subjects must interact with (and thus focus on the features of) such objects? We explored these questions in an especially direct way-by embedding such displays into the background of a completely independent ""foraging"" task. Subjects now moved their disc to collect small ""food"" dots (which appeared sequentially in random locations) as quickly as possible. The darts were task-irrelevant, and subjects were encouraged to ignore them. Nevertheless, foraging was impaired when the randomly moving darts pointed at the subjects' disc, as compared to control conditions in which they were either oriented orthogonally to the subjects' disc or pointed at another moving shape-thereby controlling for nonsocial factors. The perception of animacy thus influences downstream visuomotor behavior in an automatic manner, such that subjects cannot completely override the influences of seemingly animate shapes even while attempting to ignore them.","van Buren, B.",0,10.3758/s13423-015-0966-5,2145
5947,The Role of Teachers in Task-Based Language Education,"Both in the research literature on tasks and second language learning and in the pedagogical literature on task-based language teaching (TBLT), the role of the teacher has received scant attention. In this article, the role of the teacher in TBLT is approached from three perspectives: (a) the teacher as mediator of the students' language development, contributing to the effectiveness of TBLT as a pedagogical approach to second language education; (b) the teacher as a key figure in the implementation of TBLT, and thus as a change agent in the innovation of second language education; and (c) the teacher as researcher, and thus as an active contributor to the development and further refinement of TBLT as a researched pedagogy.","Van den Branden, K.",0,10.1017/s0267190515000070,2146
5948,Do Pedagogical Agents Enhance Software Training?,"This study investigates whether a tutorial for software training can be enhanced by adding a pedagogical agent, and whether the type of agent matters (i.e., cognitive, motivational, or mixed). The cognitive agent was designed to stimulate students to process their experiences actively. The motivational agent was designed to increase perceived task relevance and self-efficacy beliefs. A mixed agent combined these features. Process and product data were recorded during and after software training of students from the upper grades of vocational education (M age = 16.2 years). Comparison of scores on performance measures during training revealed a significant advantage of working with the motivational and mixed agents for two important motivational mediators for learning (i.e., strategy systematicity and mood). All students were highly successful during training, improving from an average 30% task completion score on the pretest to a 77% posttest score. On a retention measure 3 weeks later, task completion was still at 66%. Working with the motivational and control agents yielded significantly higher retention scores, whereas working with the motivational and mixed agents led to significantly higher scores on task relevance and self-efficacy beliefs after training. The discussion reflects on the possibilities for improving the internal and external properties of the agents.","van der Meij, H.",1,10.1080/07370024.2013.789348,2147
5949,Motivating agents in software tutorials,"Pedagogical agents can provide important support for the user in human-computer interaction systems. This paper examines whether a supplementary, motivating agent in a print tutorial can enhance student motivation and learning in software training. The agent served the role of motivator, attending the students to issues of task relevance and self-efficacy. The agent was presented in the tutorial by means of images and written messages. An experiment compared the agent condition with a no-agent (control) condition. Participants were 49 students (mean age 11.3 years) from the upper grades of elementary school. Data on motivation and learning were gathered before, during and after training. The findings revealed that students in the agent condition did significantly better on skills measures during and after training (i.e., performance indicators, posttest, and retention test). In addition, marginally significant differences favoring these students were found for flow experience during training and for motivational gains on task relevance and self-efficacy after training. The design strategies of the motivating agent are considered relevant for the creation of Animated Pedagogical Agents. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

5950,Animated pedagogical agents effects on enhancing student motivation and learning in a science inquiry learning environment,"This study focuses on the design and testing of a motivational animated pedagogical agent (APA) in an inquiry learning environment on kinematics. The aim of including the APA was to enhance students' perceptions of task relevance and self-efficacy. Given the under-representation of girls in science classrooms, special attention was given to designing an APA that would appeal to the female students. A review of the literature suggested that the best design solution would be an agent who was female, young, attractive, and ""cool"". An experiment compared three conditions: agent (image and voice), voice (no image), and control (no image and no voice). The research question was whether students' motivation and knowledge changed over time as they worked in the inquiry learning environment, and whether condition and gender affected such changes. Participants were 61 third-year students (mean age 14.7 years) from a secondary school. Gender was distributed evenly within and across conditions. A significant main effect of time on self-efficacy was found, with self-efficacy beliefs increasing significantly for both boys and girls. In addition, there was a significant interaction between time, condition, and gender for self-efficacy. About halfway during training, girls' self-efficacy beliefs significantly increased in both experimental conditions and decreased in the control condition. For boys the opposite pattern was found. Girls also gave higher appraisals for the agent. Students in all three conditions realized significant knowledge gains, which did not differ by gender. The discussion critically considers the need for, and design of motivational scaffolding in inquiry learning environments.","van der Meij, H.",1,10.1007/s11423-015-9378-5,2149
5953,A test of the design of a video tutorial for software training,"The effectiveness of a video tutorial versus a paper-based tutorial for software training has yet to be established. Mixed outcomes from the empirical studies to date suggest that for a video tutorial to outperform its paper-based counterpart, the former should be crafted so that it addresses the strengths of both designs. This was attempted in the present study. Two consecutive experiments were conducted to examine the effect of tutorial type (video vs. paper based) on task relevance, self-efficacy, mood, flow and task performance. Participants were students from junior high school. Both studies reported significant, positive contributions of the tutorials to task relevance, self-efficacy, mood and flow. Both studies also found significant and substantial effects on task performance. A learning gain of about 30% was achieved in both studies. A retention task, completed only in Study 2, further revealed that the learning effect was stable. More importantly, performance on this task also indicated a significant interaction with tutorial type, favouring the video. The success of the video tutorial is ascribed to its design, which attended to and even incorporated key qualities of paper-based tutorials, while also capitalizing on the strengths of video.","van der Meij, J.",1,10.1111/jcal.12082,2150
5955,Cross-cultural assessment of automatically generated multimodal referring expressions in a virtual world,"This paper presents an assessment of automatically generated multimodal referring expressions as produced by embodied conversational agents in a virtual world. The algorithm used for this purpose employs general principles of human motor control and cooperativity in dialogues that can be parameterised so as to vary the precision of the pointing gestures and the amount of linguistic information included in the referring expressions. The study assessed how native speakers of English and Japanese perceived three different algorithmic outputs for multimodal referring behaviour in terms of understandability, human-likeness and a social practice (selling). Results show that users generally prefer mobile agents that are economical in their linguistic descriptions to stationary verbose agents. They also show the need for further calibration of the algorithm to accommodate the differences between the two groups. In addition to the detailed description of the set up and results of the study, the paper discusses implications for the design and use of agents, methodological issues that arose while conducting the cross-cultural study and directions for future work.

5960,When robots appear to have a mind: The human perception of machine agency and responsibility,"An important topic in the field of social and developmental psychology is how humans attribute mental traits and states to others. With the growing presence of robots in society, humans are confronted with a new category of social agents. This paper presents an empirical study demonstrating how psychological theory may be used for the human interpretation of robot behavior. Specifically, in this study we applied Weiner's Theory of Social Conduct as a theoretical background for studying attributions of agency and responsibility to NAO robots. Our results suggest that if a robot's failure appears to be caused by its (lack of) effort, as compared to its (lack of) ability, human observers attribute significantly more agency and, although to a lesser extent, more responsibility to the robot. However, affective and behavioral responses to robots differ in such cases as compared to reactions to human agents.","van der Woerdt, S.",0,10.1016/j.newideapsych.2017.11.001,2152

5968,Adaptive Memory Animacy Processing Produces Mnemonic Advantages,"It is adaptive to remember animates, particularly animate agents, because they play an important role in survival and reproduction. Yet, surprisingly, the role of animacy in mnemonic processing has received little direct attention in the literature. In two experiments, participants were presented with pronounceable nonwords and properties characteristic of either living (animate) or nonliving (inanimate) things. The task was to rate the likelihood that each nonword-property pair represented a living thing or a nonliving object. In Experiment 1, a subsequent recognition memory test for the nonwords revealed a significant advantage for the nonwords paired with properties of living things. To generalize this finding, Experiment 2 replicated the animate advantage using free recall. These data demonstrate a new phenomenon in the memory literature - a possible mnemonic tuning for animacy - and add to growing data supporting adaptive memory theory.","VanArsdall, J.

5972,"Animating Architecture and the Assembly of an Elite City: Birth and Dedication of Nonhuman Persons at Paquime, Chihuahua, Mexico","We discuss the role of dedication ceremonies at Paquime, Chihuahua, Mexico, using an animistic perspective involving other-than-human, spiritually potent agents who influence and are influenced by humans. Animated agents can include artifacts and architecture, which humans create through negotiating with other agents (e.g., the potter negotiates with the clay, kiln, and fire to make pottery). Dedication ceremonies in such cases help bring active agents to life and imbue them with the specific characteristics that humans want them to have. We illustrate this process using Puebloan ethnology from the North American Southwest and then explore three cases of architectural dedication at Paquime: the Mound of the Serpent, a pot under a water reservoir, and a central support post within the structure. These cases reflect the use of the architecture to help ensure access to water, which in turn helped Paquime's elites establish their city as preeminent in the region.","Vanpool, T.

Technology based interventions such as telecare offer a potential solution to meet this increase in a cost effective manner. However, there is a concern that such technologies may lead to increased social isolation. Traditional approaches towards resolving social isolation typically involve the provision of activities designed to provide social interaction. In this thesis, we investigate a novel persuasion based approach to address social isolation. To this end, we conducted a modelling study to discover effective persuasive strategies for encouraging social interaction and how to apply them. From the results of this study, we identified, defined and categorised effective persuasive strategies, grounded in theories of persuasion and behavioural change and developed a strategy selection heuristic for applying them. We investigated the perceived effectiveness of both the strategies and strategy selection heuristic and discovered conceptual differences between selecting the most suitable strategy for older adults and a wider audience. Finally, we investigated the actual effectiveness of the strategies with an observational study involving formal carers and older adults. Our results can be combined to create a persuasive virtual agent aimed to tackling social isolation amongst older adults.","Vargheese, John Paul",0,,2157
5976,,"PHelpS was a system that helped Correctional Service Canada (CSC) workers to find appropriate helpers among their peers when they were encountering problems while interacting with the CSC database. This seemingly simple system had substantial, and surprising, ramifications. Over time it transformed each of our perspectives as to the issues facing AIED. In this paper we reflect on the influence of the PHelpS peer help system on our subsequent research agenda as well as some of the broader influences of our work. In particular, we discuss a number of research projects arising out of PHelpS directly or indirectly, including the I-Help (aka iHelp) system, a peer help system that has been widely deployed in university courses; a distributed multi-agent architecture for peer help systems that uses fragmented learner modelling to support its activities; the active user modelling paradigm which views “learner model” as a computation not a knowledge structure; the ecological approach, a general architecture for learning systems in which patterns mined from learner interactions with learning objects inform pedagogical decisions; investigations, especially into privacy and reputation, arising from the large scale deployment of iHelp supported by evidence mined from iHelp data; and research into novel affective and social motivation techniques. We conclude by discussing the implications of the common perspective that has emerged from these interrelated research projects. This perspective views the goal of learning technology design to be to track learners as they carry out authentic activities, to deeply understand these learners and their learning context, and to provide just in time support for their learning.

5979,,"Rickettsiales-like prokaryote Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis (Ca. Xc), the causative agent of abalone withering syndrome (WS), has decimated abalone populations along the Pacific coast of North America. The federally endangered white abalone, (Haliotis sorenseni) are particularly susceptible to this agent and are now nearly extinct in the wild. Candidatus Xc proliferates in epithelial cells of the abalone gastrointestinal tract and causes clinical signs of starvation. The specific aims were to: (1) develop an axenic media to support the growth of Ca. Xc, (2) observe effects of reduced pathogenicity of Ca. Xc in the presence of bacteriophage in red (H. rufescens) and white abalone under conditions that previously have been shown to exacerbate withering syndrome, and (3) collect preliminary data on undergraduate student engagement with research on the abalone microbiota through a novel first-year seminar. Axenic culture of members of the Order Rickettsiales, including numerous human pathogens, has not been achieved for any species. In a related project by our collaborators, genetic analysis suggested that Ca. Xc is the most ancestral form of the Anaplasmataceae family of Rickettsiales studied to date. Accordingly, we hypothesized that Ca. Xc may require simpler culture conditions than other Rickettsiales. We attempted to culture Ca. Xc from Ca. Xc-infected red abalone gut tissue using a basal medium that supports growth of Piscirickettsia salmonis, a marine facultative intracellular pathogen of fish. Unfortunately, we were unable to observe Ca. Xc. growth even with supplementation of media with a wide variety of additives. In order to gain a better understanding on the pathogenesis of Ca. Xc in abalone, and to investigate the attenuation conferred by a recently described bacteriophage, infectious challenges were pursued at different temperatures. We hypothesized that the phage hyperparasite would reduce the pathogenicity of Ca. Xc infection in red and white abalone and in temperature regimes that have previously either slowed (cold water) or enhanced (warm water) disease progression. Red and white abalone were assigned to different seawater temperature regimens (14.0°C or 18.5°C) with and without Ca. Xc exposure all in the presence of phage. Animal health was assessed by weight and length measurements, Ca. Xc 16S rRNA gene copies in tank fecal and tissue samples by quantitative real-time PCR, histological data, and mortality rates. Using a comparative experimental design, we observed differences over time in mortality and growth rates of the two species and bacterial load by qPCR. By day 251, all of the white abalone exposed to Ca. Xc in the warm water treatment had died. A different response was observed in red abalone exposed to the same conditions, with a mortality rate of less than 10%. In comparison to historical experiments conducted prior to the presence of the phage, red abalone showed significantly improved (36%) survival rate in the presence of phage. Red abalone showed advanced infection as evidenced by high Ca. Xc gene copy numbers by tissue qPCR and large numbers of bacterial inclusions histologically but the pathogen burden seemed to have little effect on red abalone health and survival. White abalone had fewer organisms at either temperature treatment as determined by both qPCR and histology but had far greater negative health and survival outcomes. These data support the novel phage hyperparasite as a protective agent in red abalone, while white abalone remain susceptible to withering syndrome in its presence. The abalone microbiota has recently begun to be investigated in relation to WS. In an effort to engage young scientists, we undertook efforts to incorporate a microbiota study of abalone with WS into a course-based undergraduate research experience class (CURE).

Dehumanization Embedded in Organizational Practices","The present study combines dehumanization research with the concept of organizational trust to examine how employees perceive various types of maltreatment embedded within the organizational practices that form the ethical climate of an organization. With the help of grounded theory methodology, we analyzed 188 employment exit interview transcripts from an ICT subcontracting company. By examining perceived trustworthiness and perceived humanness, we found that dehumanizing employees can deteriorate trust within organizations. The violations found in the empirical material were divided into animalistic and mechanistic forms of dehumanization and linked to perceived integrity and benevolence, respectively. Based on the results, a model describing the link between dehumanization and trust is presented and discussed in relation to the ways in which perceptions of humanness become rooted in practices and affect the basic assumptions underlying (un-)ethical organizational behavior.","Vayrynen, T.",0,10.1007/s10551-015-2947-z,2160
5982,,"Technological developments in the past thirty years have transformed sequencing-based microbiology into a data-intensive field. Here, computing and efficient representations are catalyzers of insight into omnipresent and complex microbial interactions. Notably, classical ecologists have set the foundations for the way we analyze these systems, with some techniques dating back to the beginning of the twentieth century. In this thesis, we expand and where possible reuse these techniques to unravel the hidden patterns comprising the human gut microbiome. To set an appropriate motivation and context for the rest of this work, Chapter 1 reviews recent discoveries on the human microbiome and how the communities within can influence the effectiveness of therapeutic agents. Next, in Chapter 2, we introduce EMPeror, an interactive analysis and visualization tool that is crucial to the findings presented in later chapters. The following three chapters study concrete examples where the microbiome has been implicated as a driver or marker for dysbiosis. Chapter 3 describes how the microbial signature associated with Crohn's disease (CD) in humans, described in our previous work, is overlapping but distinct to that of dogs affected with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surprisingly, unlike with humans, dog fecal samples alone are strong indicators of the disease. In Chapter 4, we study IBD from a longitudinal perspective, revealing increased volatility in the gut microbiomes of subjects with IBD, a property that does not appear to be present in unaffected controls. Furthermore, we use this as a predicting feature of the disease, and improve on the classification accuracy possible through a single fecal sample. In Chapter 5, we study the effect of fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs) to treat Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and, using the techniques described in Chapter 2, we show the first animated visualization of this process, a dramatic microbial transformation as the subjects recover from all CDI symptoms. In addition, for CDI patients who also suffer from a subtype of IBD, a treatment with a FMT results in an increased number of relapses and decreased microbial diversity.

Impact on student learning, perceptions, and experiences","In this paper, I investigate the impact of non-task pedagogical agent behavior on learning outcomes, perceptions of agents' interaction ability, and learner experiences. Quasi-experimental results indicate that while the addition of non-task comments to an on-task tutorial may increase learning and perceptions of the agent's ability to interact with learners, this increase is not statistically significant. Further addition of non-task comments however, harms learning and perceptions of the agent's ability to interact with learners in statistically significant ways. Qualitative results reveal that on-task interactions are efficient but impersonal, while non-task interactions were memorable, but distracting. Implications include the potential for non-task interactions to create an uncanny valley effect for agent behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

5986,,"This dissertation is a qualitative case study designed to explore the political agency of a Los Angeles-based Latina/o immigrant parent group - ALIANZA. Utilizing a Latina/o Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) framework, this study contends that deficit characterizations of Latina/o parents operate from normalized standards of what it means to be a ""good"" parent and fail to acknowledge the educational participation of Latina/o parents as well as the institutional barriers they face in schools. It also reveals how educational policy, despite its democratic intent, can often render silent the voices of Latina/o parents in educational and civic reform efforts. To examine notions of consciousness and collective action, this study uses a Freirean pedagogical perspective that broadly guides its main inquiry. Data for this study were collected in collaboration with 15 ALIANZA parents in the form of semi-structured interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and organizational archives using a participatory action research approach grounded in Chicana feminist epistemology. Data was analyzed using critical race grounded theory that allowed this study's broader conceptual frameworks to assist in isolating emergent themes that best explain the intersecting experiences of ALIANZA parents. Findings from this study suggest that political agency was developed throughout the life histories of ALIANZA parents. Namely, three important junctures were collectively identified as important toward this end: early schooling, migrating to el norte, and encountering U.S. public schools as mothers for the first time. These formative moments became ""triggers of political agency"" for ALIANZA parents by disrupting their sense of belonging, extending their threshold of hope, and developing their consciousness as agents of change. Building and capitalizing on these lived experiences, ALIANZA further developed its members as political actors through the use of key strategies and pedagogical approaches aimed at helping them heal from past abuse and racist encounters, identifing and speaking out against injustice, and building a collective and shared political capital to leverage their voice and participate in local reform efforts. Findings from this study can serve future research and practice on building school-community partnerships in Latina/o immigrant communities and support a greater inclusion of Latina/o parents in school decision-making. Cases like ALIANZA, whose members are immigrants, many of whom are undocumented, complicate traditional notions of who can and cannot participate in creating social change. Documenting their efforts can help us further theorize about the role Latina/o undocumented immigrants can and should play in transforming schools and society.","Velez, Veronica Nelly",0,,2164
5987,Training the use of theory of mind using artificial agents,"When engaging in social interaction, people rely on their ability to reason about unobservable mental content of others, which includes goals, intentions, and beliefs. This so-called theory of mind ability allows them to more easily understand, predict, and influence the behavior of others. People even use their theory of mind to reason about the theory of mind of others, which allows them to understand sentences like Alice believes that Bob does not know about the surprise party'. But while the use of higher orders of theory of mind is apparent in many social interactions, empirical evidence so far suggests that people do not use this ability spontaneously when playing strategic games, even when doing so would be highly beneficial. In this paper, we attempt to encourage participants to engage in higher-order theory of mind reasoning by letting them play a game against computational agents. Since previous research suggests that competitive games may encourage the use of theory of mind, we investigate a particular competitive game, the Mod game, which can be seen as a much larger variant of the well-known rock-paper-scissors game. By using a combination of computational agents and Bayesian model selection, we simultaneously determine to what extent people make use of higher-order theory of mind reasoning, as well as to what extent computational agents can encourage the use of higher-order theory of mind in their human opponents. Our results show that participants who play the Mod game against computational theory of mind agents adjust their level of theory of mind reasoning to that of their computer opponent. Earlier experiments with other strategic games show that participants only engage in low orders of theory of mind reasoning. Surprisingly, we find that participants who knowingly play against second- and third-order theory of mind agents apply up to fourth-order theory of mind themselves, and achieve higher scores as a result.","Veltman, K.",0,10.1007/s12193-018-0287-x,2165
5990,"Trusting a Virtual Driver That Looks, Acts, and Thinks Like You","Objective: We examined whether participants would trust an agent that was similar to them more than an agent that was dissimilar to them. Background: Trust is an important psychological factor determining the acceptance of smart systems. Because smart systems tend to be treated like humans, and similarity has been shown to increase trust in humans, we expected that similarity would increase trust in a virtual agent. Methods: In a driving simulator experiment, participants (N = 111) were presented with a virtual agent that was either similar to them or not. This agent functioned as their virtual driver in a driving simulator, and trust in this agent was measured. Furthermore, we measured how trust changed with experience. Results: Prior to experiencing the agent, the similar agent was trusted more than the dissimilar agent. This effect was mediated by perceived similarity. After experiencing the agent, the similar agent was still trusted more than the dissimilar agent. Conclusion: Just as similarity between humans increases trust in another human, similarity also increases trust in a virtual agent. When such an agent is presented as a virtual driver in a self-driving car, it could possibly enhance the trust people have in such a car. Application: Displaying a virtual driver that is similar to the human driver might increase trust in a self-driving car.","Verberne, F. M. F.",0,10.1177/0018720815580749,2166
5993,"Blindness, Blinking and Boredom: Seeing and Being in Buddhism and Film","This essay takes up a paradoxical problem articulated by Buddhist philosopher, Nishitani Keiji: the eye does not see the eye itself. It argues that film has a therapeutic function by virtue of its ability to draw our attention to this precise aspect of our existential situation; namely, that we alternate between being in our experience and perceiving ourselves in our experience. Or, to borrow Nishitani's terms, we alternate between the act of seeing and the quest to see the eye itself. The essay explores this theme with reference to specific elements of formal cinematic language. Rather than focus on a particular film or set of films for analysis, we focus instead on how the grammar of cinematic language draws our attention to aspects of our existential situation that ordinarily escape our awareness. Insofar as this may also be a goal of Buddhist practice-that is, to expand one's ability to perceive reality for what it is, beginning with one's own experience of it-this essay highlights a few of the salient ways that perennial aspects of the human condition have been articulated through the languages of both Buddhism and film.","Verchery, L.",0,10.3390/rel9080228,2167

Using a violent computer game in a between-subjects design, male subjects were tested for the immersive impact of blood, first as an olfactory cue, and second as a mental belief, i.e. the true or false belief that one is smelling 'blood'. Lower skin conductance and game scores showed that 'blood' served as a distractor hindering the subject's spontaneous engagement. Subjects higher in dispositional aggressiveness, however, got more immersed during the 'blood' game rounds, by displaying more combativeness. We discuss our results in light of the undervalued importance of subjective realism in research on presence, and explain the relevance, of this work for applications in virtual training in the military and for clinical intervention in combat-related PTSD.

6000,,"A research gap exists with regard to the analysis of school children and adolescents' awareness on environmental issues. Current investigation analyzes data of 240 children and adolescents, aged between 8 and 14 years, within different school contexts in the mid-southern region of Brazil, on their knowledge level and moral judgment on solid wastes, river water and tree life. Whereas the exploratory research with different groups of different ages verifies the manner behavior emerges and changes, the transversal design gives an evolution aspect of data through the examination of a great number of agents. Results showed that children and adolescents have similar knowledge on the environment within different school contexts, except differences at environmental knowledge level. The latter revealed a mild broadening trend in proportion to the 8-14 years age bracket. Environmental moral judgment varied a lot, regardless of the agents' age, and failed to be related to the knowledge that children and adolescents had on the environmental themes. Schools featuring well-defined pedagogical proposals were positively salient among the others. Environmental knowledge and moral judgment on environmental issues are not determining but implied chiefly as from the age of eleven, since both are the result of the agents' social interactivity within the environment and basically require affectivity and cooperation.","Vestena, Carla Luciane Blum",0,,2170
6002,Review of <i>The book of joy: Lasting happiness in a changing world</i>,"Reviews the book, The Book of Joy: Lasting Happiness in a Changing World by Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, and Douglas Abrams (2016). Two senior leaders from different religious traditions, Tibetan Buddhism and Christianity, offer a practical and inspiring teaching on how to live with the difficulties of the human condition. Through stories about their world-changing actions, their various intensive spiritual practices, and their respect for contemporary science and other fields of knowledge they guide the reader through the complexities of finding happiness and joy in a profoundly “changing world.” One of the unexpected strengths of the book is the participation and commentary of the third cowriter, Douglas Abrams, a senior religion editor and literary agent. He not only helped a staff of more than 100 arrange and guide the dialogues but as a more secular voice also offers important observations based on psychological, physiological, and medical research bearing directly on the topics under discussion. The entire book is designed to intimately connect the message of the cowriters to the reader. The chapters are short and conversational, with disarmingly delightful, even amusing photos. After the story of the week-long meeting concludes, the book presents an extensive group of joy practices, detailing how to train the mind to deal with various universal human problems, in one’s personal life, in relationships, and community.

6015,,"Mobile technologies are increasingly rooted in society and, therefore, intuitively, teachers begin to take advantage of devices that students carry with them daily in a logic of 1:1 bring your own device (BYOD). In fact, it becomes crucial to use this media to promote/increase new pedagogical activities to motivate and challenge students to acquire and discover knowledge. This was the inspiration to create the MobiGeo, an Urban Game, for Geography teaching. The research question that guided the project was to understand whether the implementation of MobiGeo influence the process of learning geography in an outdoor education context. Data obtained allow the researchers to conclude that Urban Games are potential agents of motivation and interaction that predispose students to learn geography in informal learning environments. So, they suggest that the roles of teacher and student should not be abandoned but recycled and adapted to this new reality that requires more personalized and diverse activities of learning.

6017,,"Students in today’s digital world draw from multiple sources of information, hypertext, videos, educational software, social media, and video games to create a multimodal learning environment (Luke, 2005). In 1994, Griffiths, et al. (1994) found that the impact of information technology on oppressed cultures hampered their education when the technology was not available in their native language and culture. Students from countries that did not have the resources to develop software in their native language felt that their language and culture did not relate to the modern world. When these students arrived in the United States and found technology in English, they felt their native language was of lesser importance. Emergent bilinguals feel that educational software belongs to another culture and does not allow them to be agents in their learning. However, when they see their language embedded in the software, they engage with the software significantly more (Griffiths, 1994). Gilster (1997) defined digital literacy as “the ability to access networked computer resources and use them” (p. xii). In more recent studies digital literacy has been defined as the practice of communicating, linking, and being involved in creating new ways of mixing multimedia tools to accomplish meaning making (Jones & Hafner, 2012). Emergent bilinguals mediate the use of online translators and the translating capabilities of an intelligent tutoring system for meaning making of the English register they encounter with the software. They search for culturally relevant videos and tutorial to create a cognitive connection between the mathematical topics and their native language. This study utilized Activity Theory to explicate the complex digital practices of emergent bilinguals while engaged in an online mathematics course. This mixed methods study was conducted over four semesters at a university on the U.S.-Mexico border. Data collected from demographic survey, class forum questions, daily logs with snapshots, two self-efficacy surveys, and email as well as face-to-face interviews, was analyzed through a constant comparison method. Two tensions emerged from the findings, the importance of learning English and encountering unfamiliar Spanish dialects or translations. The results of this study demonstrated that emergent bilinguals mediated several forms of translators and culturally relevant videos for meaning making and to make cognitive connections with the topics in an online mathematics course. They further developed agency in creating an equitable educational digital space where they developed mathematical biliteracy.","Viera, Julian, Jr.",0,,2173

6020,Prediction-for-CompAction: navigation in social environments using generalized cognitive maps,"The ultimate navigation efficiency of mobile robots in human environments will depend on how we will appraise them: merely as impersonal machines or as human-like agents. In the latter case, an agent may take advantage of the cooperative collision avoidance, given that it possesses recursive cognition, i.e., the agent's decisions depend on the decisions made by humans that in turn depend on the agent's decisions. To deal with this high-level cognitive skill, we propose a neural network architecture implementing Prediction-for-CompAction paradigm. The network predicts possible human-agent collisions and compacts the time dimension by projecting a given dynamic situation into a static map. Thereby emerging compact cognitive map can be readily used as a ""dynamic GPS"" for planning actions or mental evaluation of the convenience of cooperation in a given context. We provide numerical evidence that cooperation yields additional room for more efficient navigation in cluttered pedestrian flows, and the agent can choose path to the target significantly shorter than a robot treated by humans as a functional machine. Moreover, the navigation safety, i.e., the chances to avoid accidental collisions, increases under cooperation. Remarkably, these benefits yield no additional load to the mean society effort. Thus, the proposed strategy is socially compliant, and the humanoid agent can behave as ""one of us."".","Villacorta-Atienza, J. A.",0,10.1007/s00422-015-0644-8,2176
6023,,"This dissertation proposes an approach to creating robust communication systems in wireless sensor networks, inspired by biological and ecological systems, particularly by evolutionary game theory. In this approach, a virtual community of agents live inside the network nodes and carry out network functions. The agents use different strategies to execute their functions, and these strategies are tested and selected by playing evolutionary games. Over time, agents with the best strategies survive, while others die. The strategies and the game rules provide the network with an adaptive behavior that allows it to react to changes in environmental conditions by adapting and improving network behavior. To evaluate the viability of this approach, this dissertation also describes a micro-component framework for implementing agent-based wireless sensor network services, an evolutionary data collection protocol built using this framework, ECP, and experiments evaluating the performance of this protocol in a faulty environment. The framework addresses many of the programming challenges in writing network software for wireless sensor networks, while the protocol built using the framework provides a means of evaluating the general viability of the agent-based approach. The results of this evaluation show that an evolutionary approach to designing wireless sensor networks can improve the performance of wireless sensor network protocols in the presence of node failures. In particular, we compared the performance of ECP with a non-evolutionary rule-based variant of ECP. While the purely-evolutionary version of ECP has more routing timeouts than the rule-based approach in failure-free networks, it sends significantly fewer beacon packets and incurs statistically fewer routing timeouts in both simple fault and periodic fault scenarios.","Villalon-Fonseca, Ricardo",0,,2177

Our aim is to explore earthwork iconography through the lens of Amerindian visual arts and movement. Combining ethnographic and archaeological data from the Upper Purus, Brazil, the article shows how ancient history and socio-cosmology are deeply ""written"" onto the landscape in the form of geometric earthworks carved out of the soil, which materialize interactions between nonhuman and human actors. We underline skills in visualization, imaginative practices, and movement as ways to promote well-balanced engagements with animated life forms. Here, iconography inserted in the landscape is both a form of writing and also emerges as an agent, affecting people through visual and corporal practices.","Virtanen, P.

Such understanding can help in the design of safe structures and spaces that implicitly aid humans during evacuation or other emergency situations. In particular, the role that memory plays in this process is something that is crucial to understand. In this paper, we develop a novel serious game-based experimental approach to understanding the non-randomness and the impact of memory on the human exploration process. We show that a simple memory model, with a depth of between 6 and 8 steps, is sufficient to approximate a ""human-like' level of exploration efficiency. We also demonstrate the advantages that a game-based experimental methodology brings to these kinds of experiments in the amount of data that can be collected as compared to traditional experiments. We feel that these findings have important implications for 'safety-by-design' in complex infrastructural structures.","Viswanathan, V.",0,10.3758/s13428-015-0604-1,2180

For both problems, we developed algorithms to efficiently sample reusable geometric information in the environment to enable fast online planning and replanning. For the shepherding problem, we discuss several representations and abstractions for flocks to improve scalability and robustness to uncertainty. For the visibility-based pursuit problem, we discuss several methods for space decomposition that enable fast online planning to achieve visibility objectives.

My first essay, “Automaton: Movement and Artificial/Mechanical Life” directly addresses the characteristics that define humanness, principally the Rene Descartes mind-body dichotomy, by tracing the evolution of mechanical life, predicated as much on movement as consciousness, via the construction of automata. “Dis/Playing with Dolls: Stigmatization and the Performance of Reborn Dolls” takes the discussion a step further and examines people’s reactions when objects that look human are treated like human. I compare observable behaviors of dolls owners via social mediums like videos posted on YouTube, message boards, blogs, and news sources with responses by observers of this type of doll play, and superimposing a theory of play over this interaction. Whether or not automata and reborn dolls are socially accepted as signifiers of humanness, they already exist within our social space and reality. It is the recognition and acknowledgment of their presences in our everyday life and their agency that puts them squarely in the discourse of life.","Vo, Khanh Van Ngoc",0,,2184
6040,Child-Robot Interactions for Second Language Tutoring to Preschool Children,"In this digital age social robots will increasingly be used for educational purposes, such as second language tutoring. In this perspective article, we propose a number of design features to develop a child-friendly social robot that can effectively support children in second language learning, and we discuss some technical challenges for developing these. The features we propose include choices to develop the robot such that it can act as a peer to motivate the child during second language learning and build trust at the same time, while still being more knowledgeable than the child and scaffolding that knowledge in adult-like manner. We also believe that the first impressions children have about robots are crucial for them to build trust and common ground, which would support child-robot interactions in the long term. We therefore propose a strategy to introduce the robot in a safe way to toddlers. Other features relate to the ability to adapt to individual children's language proficiency, respond contingently, both temporally and semantically, establish joint attention, use meaningful gestures, provide effective feedback and monitor children's learning progress. Technical challenges we observe include automatic speech recognition (ASR) for children, reliable object recognition to facilitate semantic contingency and establishing joint attention, and developing human-like gestures with a robot that does not have the same morphology humans have. We briefly discuss an experiment in which we investigate how children respond to different forms of feedback the robot can give.","Vogt, P.",0,10.3389/fnhum.2017.00073,2185
6045,,"Laboring Faces: Railway Portraiture and the Human Geographies of Amazonia, 1907–2017 discusses the meanings and operations of vision, the gaze, and the eye in a context shaped by hierarchies of work, gender, and race, and by the encounter with the tropical forest. It examines the photographic documentation of the construction of the Madeira-Mamoré Railway (MMR), a 200-mile line built in the Brazilian Amazon between 1907 and 1912. The more than 500 images were created by American Dana B. Merrill (1877–?), the official photographer hired by the MMR Company, who lived in the workers’ village for over one year. The dissertation is organized into five chapters, each one examining a specific group of images. Rather than following one unifying theoretical framework, the interpretation responds to specific questions posed by the images. The intersections of images and texts are fundamental for the investigation of the MMR archive. Chapter One examines Merrill’s depictions of the Madeira and Mamoré Valley. It discusses the photographer’s possible intentions, and how he responded to the limitations imposed by the physical configuration of the forest. Chapter Two examines Merrill’s photographs of his North American colleagues. It discusses how, in images and writing, these men enacted a performance of frontier life. Chapter Three looks at Merrill’s photographs of the indigenous population of the Valley. It discusses how his gaze related to the visual vocabularies of anthropology and the “Noble Savage.” The chapter also examines how Amerindians reacted to the camera. Chapter Four is a visual reading of a portrait of the steam laundry “Barbadian” team. It examines the multiple “gazes” that intersected in the MMR complex and the sitters’ efforts to control their representation. Chapter Five examines Merrill’s photographs of doctors and patients through the lens of Sigmund Freud’s concept of the uncanny. Doctors and patients occupied a marginal position in the MMR complex, a liminal zone between health and disease, death and life. I relate these ambiguous characters to uncanny images of specters, doppelgangers, and jesters. By focusing on the intersections of texts and images produced in a corporate context, my dissertation provides a critical framework for understanding how the workplace is a fertile ground for the production of narratives that consolidate, but sometimes also challenge, hierarchies of work, race, and gender.","von Hartenthal, Mariana W.",0,,2186
6046,Quantifying the Human Likeness of a Humanoid Robot,"In research of human-robot interactions, human likeness (HL) of robots is frequently used as an individual, vague parameter to describe how a robot is perceived by a human. However, such a simplification of HL is often not sufficient given the complexity and multidimensionality of human-robot interaction. Therefore, HL must be seen as a variable influenced by a network of parameter fields. The first goal of this paper is to introduce such a network which systematically characterizes all relevant aspects of HL. The network is subdivided into ten parameter fields, five describing static aspects of appearance and five describing dynamic aspects of behavior. The second goal of this paper is to propose a methodology to quantify the impact of single or multiple parameters out of these fields on perceived HL. Prior to quantification, the minimal perceivable difference, i.e. the threshold of perception, is determined for the parameters of interest in a first experiment. Thereafter, these parameters are modified in whole-number multiple of the threshold of perception to investigate their influence on perceived HL in a second experiment. This methodology was illustrated on the parameters speed and sequencing (onset of joint movements) of the parameter field movement as well as on the parameter sound. Results revealed that the perceived HL is more sensitive to changes in sequencing than to changes in speed. The sound of the motors during the movement also reduced perceived HL. The presented methodology should guide further, systematic explorations of the proposed network of HL parameters in order to determine and optimize acceptance of humanoid robots.","von Zitzewitz, J.",0,10.1007/s12369-012-0177-4,2187
6050,VIRTUAL AGORA: REPRESENTATION OF AN ANCIENT GREEK AGORA IN VIRTUAL WORLDS USING BIOLOGICALLY-INSPIRED MOTIVATIONAL AGENTS,"Populating virtual worlds with computer controlled characters is a key issue in virtual heritage applications, an argument that can also be held as valid for the majority of virtual world applications. Virtual heritage worlds usually tend to be either devoid of people, or include computer-controlled characters that function as animated props, demonstrating pre-scripted and repetitive behaviour. In more advanced approaches, digital characters in special roles, such as virtual guides, may also be situated in the virtual world. Recent virtual heritage reconstruction works seem to acknowledge the necessity of incorporating non-human controlled characters that include intelligence in order to enhance presence and provide the user with an engaging experience. This paper presents the design and development of Virtual Agora, a virtual heritage application in the Open Simulator environment aiming to replicate daily life in an ancient Greek agora using biologically-inspired motivational agents. The application follows a multi-layered motivational model for agents that includes biological, as well as psychosocial needs. Every agent possesses a set of basic attributes that relate to its biological and physical characteristics, as well as its personality. Furthermore, agents are endowed with a set of behaviours that satisfy particular goals and consist of a sequence of actions towards achieving this goal. In addition to this generic action set, every agent possesses an extra set of actions, based on its assignment of a role or profession. The roles and the respective behaviours have been designed and selected based on available resources regarding life in the ancient agora of classical Athens. In the current implementation visitors can walk around the environment observing daily activities performed by the digital characters and interact with them by asking questions about aspects of their profession.","Vosinakis, S.",0,10.5281/zenodo.204964,2188
6052,An evolutionary approach to low-level conversational cooperation,"The cooperative character of language is an empirical fact and one of the key tenets in linguistics. However, this cooperative character is what makes it evolutionarily suspect: under normal circumstances sharing honest information with biologically unrelated individuals and without any obvious costs is not an ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy) and is not expected to evolve. Here we approach this problem in the context of prototypical language use (also evolutionarily), that is face-to-face conversation, a multimodal interaction unfolding in real time that involves a complex interplay between embodied agents in spatial proximity. We focus our review on low-level coordinative processes - examples being proxemic alignment or postural mirroring - to a large degree continuous with what is found in non-human primates. We aim at categorisation and terminological clarification of these processes, which in turn helps us evaluate their role in initiating and maintaining cooperatively oriented communicative interaction. We conclude with suggesting ways in which such low-level coordinative processes might have formed an evolutionary basis for cooperation, with a focus on the possible role of TFT (tit-for-tat) and TFT-like strategies.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

6055,For a Sociology of Flesh and Blood,"This article elaborates the social ontology and methodology of carnal sociology as a distinctive mode of social inquiry eschewing the spectatorial posture to grasp action-in-the-making, in the wake of debates triggered by my apprenticeship-based study of boxing as a plebeian bodily craft. First I critique the notions of (dualist) agent, (externalist) structure, and (mentalist) knowledge prevalent in the contemporary social sciences and sketch an alternative conception of the social animal, not just as wielder of symbols, but as sensate, suffering, skilled, sedimented, and situated creature of flesh and blood. I spotlight the primacy of embodied practical knowledge arising out of and continuously enmeshed in webs of action and consider what modes of inquiry are suited to deploying and mining this incarnate conception of the agent. I argue that enactive ethnography, the brand of immersive fieldwork based on ""performing the phenomenon,"" is a fruitful path toward capturing the cognitive, conative, and cathectic schemata (habitus) that generate the practices and underlie the cosmos under investigation. But it takes social spunk and persistence to reap the rewards of ""observant participation"" and achieve social competency (as distinct from empirical saturation). In closing, I return to Bourdieu's dialogue with Pascal to consider the special difficulty and urgency of capturing the ""spirit of acuteness"" that animates such competency but vanishes from normal sociological accounts.","Wacquant, L.",0,10.1007/s11133-014-9291-y,2190
6056,Four transversal principles for putting Bourdieu to work,"This article spotlights four transversal principles that animate Pierre Bourdieu's research practice and can fruitfully guide inquiry on any empirical front: the Bachelardian imperative of epistemological rupture and vigilance; the Weberian command to effect the triple historicization of the agent (habitus), the world (social space, of which field is but a subtype), and the categories of the analyst (epistemic reflexivity); the Leibnizian-Durkheimian invitation to deploy the topological mode of reasoning to track the mutual correspondences between symbolic space, social space, and physical space; and the Cassirer moment urging us to recognize the constitutive efficacy of symbolic structures. I also flag three traps that Bourdieusian explorers of the social world should exercise special care to avoid: the fetishization of concepts, the seductions of speaking Bourdieuse while failing to carry out the research operations Bourdieu's notions stipulate, and the forced imposition of his theoretical framework en bloc when it is more productively used in kit through transposition. These principles guiding the construction of the object are not theoretical slogans but practical blueprints for anthropological inquiry. This implies that mimesis and not exegesis should guide those social scientists who wish to build on, revise, or challenge the scientific machinery and legacy of Pierre Bourdieu.","Wacquant, L.",0,10.1177/1463499617746254,2191

6059,CONSIGNELA: A multidisciplinary patient-centered project to improve drug prescription comprehension and execution in elderly people and parkinsonian patients,"Many older patients and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) do not respect medication prescriptions. Non-adherence is caused by several factors among which three play an important role: Treatment complexity, cognitive decline, and patient-provider communication. This article presents an ongoing multidisciplinary project, the CONSIGNELA project, which adopts a patient-centered approach for improving medication adherence in these patients. The first objective of the project is to identify the best way to communicate medication prescriptions with tablets and touch-screen devices. The second objective is to improve medication adherence by creating a collaborative application (app) designed both for older and PD patients and for healthcare professionals in charge of them. Two solutions are combined: A cognitive and a technological solutions. The cognitive solution consists in studying in real time older and PD patients while consulting and executing prescriptions presented in different formats to select the most efficient one. The technological solution aims to improve collaboration between health professionals and patients by developing System of Systems (SoS). The research model used in the project includes three phases. Only the results of phase 1 are presented in the article. A research app, CONSIGNELA-Appli-R was programmed to analyze patient cognitive processes while consulting a prescription on a tablet. A pilot study was carried out with young adults to test it. It confirmed a facilitating effect of table format. In parallel, the prototype of a second app, CONSIGNELA-Appli-P, for patients and healthcare providers was developed. It is based on an SoS architecture connecting a virtual pillbox, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) and a knowledge platform. The virtual pillbox is used by patients and providers to improve mutual understanding of medication prescriptions. The MAS provides agents that extract and analyze indicators, actions and information resulting from the interaction between patients and virtual pillboxes. All the information is capitalized and stored in the knowledge platform. Providers can receive charts and dashboards showing information about the following of the medication regimen, for instance, if patients are following it correctly or not.","Wanderley, G. M.

6068,Applying interactive devices to an elementary nature science course,"The goal of this paper is to design and develop an interactive learning system (ILS) by integrating interactive devices into a real-world classroom. ILS is primarily designed for elementary school students where they can have some hands-on experiences to learn nature science such as airflow and wind. The purpose of adopting interactive devices is to increase students' motivations and pleasures during the learning process. In order to demonstrate the learning effects of using ILS, an empirical study was conducted by comparing traditional and interactive instructional strategies. During the study, three types of measurements were used to assess the different aspects of ILS: learning achievement tests, a questionnaire about students' experiences, and teacher interview. The results showed that ILS does have positive effects on students' learning and we can conclude that ILS can effectively and efficiently assist in learning nature science in a real-world classroom environment.","Wang, C.",1,10.1002/cae.21905,2195
6069,Acceptability and feasibility of a virtual counselor (VICKY) to collect family health histories,"Purpose: To overcome literacy-related barriers in the collection of electronic family health histories, we developed an animated Virtual Counselor for Knowing your Family History, or VICKY. This study examined the acceptability and accuracy of using VICKY to collect family histories from underserved patients as compared with My Family Health Portrait (MFHP). Methods: Participants were recruited from a patient registry at a safety net hospital and randomized to use either VICKY or MFHP. Accuracy was determined by comparing tool-collected histories with those obtained by a genetic counselor. Results: A total of 70 participants completed this study. Participants rated VICKY as easy to use (91%) and easy to follow (92%), would recommend VICKY to others (83%), and were highly -satisfied (77%). VICKY identified 86% of first-degree relatives and 42% of seconddegree relatives; combined accuracy was 55%. As compared with MFHP, VICKY identified a greater number of health conditions overall (49% with VICKY vs. 31% with MFHP; incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.59; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.13-2.25; P = 0.008), in particular, hypertension (47 vs. 15%; IRR: 3.18; 95% CI: 1.66-6.10; P = 0.001) and type 2 diabetes (54 vs. 22%; IRR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.33-4.60; P = 0.004). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that technological support for documenting family history risks can be highly accepted, feasible, and effective.","Wang, C.",0,10.1038/gim.2014.198,2196
6077,"AVATARS WITH SEX APPEAL AS PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS: ATTRACTIVENESS, TRUSTWORTHINESS, EXPERTISE, AND GENDER DIFFERENCES","The study focused on the use of pedagogical agents with sex appeal in a computer-assisted learning environment. The study adopted a 2 (male/female) x 3 (demure/seductive/overtly sexual) experimental design. The primary analysis consisted of 2 parts: (a) comparing the impact of effective learning on students' perceptions of demure, seductive, or overtly sexual pedagogical agents, and (b) exploring gender differences in the usage of pedagogical agents with sex appeal. The empirical study results revealed that the sex appeal of female pedagogical agents is more helpful in effective learning than those of male agents. The sexy appearances of pedagogical agents are perceived by students as attractive, untrustworthy, and unprofessional. A seductive appearance in pedagogical agents is the most beneficial for effective learning than demure or overtly sexual ones. Students' and pedagogical agents' gender affect the impact of pedagogical agents with sex appeal on effective learning.","Wang, C. C.",0,10.2190/EC.48.4.a,2197

6085,Animated pedagogical agents as aids in multimedia learning: Effects on eye-fixations during learning and learning outcomes,"The goal of the present study is to determine how to incorporate social cues such as gesturing in animated pedagogical agents (PAs) for online multimedia lessons in ways that promote student learning. In 3 experiments, college students learned about synaptic transmission from a multimedia narrated presentation while their eye movements were tracked and subsequently took learning outcome tests. In Experiments 1 and 2, students who had a gesturing PA added to the screen performed significantly better on learning outcome tests of transfer (ds = 0.77 and 0.80) and retention (ds = 1.16 and 1.00) and spent more time attending to target material based on eye-tracking measures including fixation time (ds = 1.53 and 2.27) and number of fixations (ds = 1.54 and 1.70). In Experiments 2 and 3, students who learned with a gesturing PA outperformed those who learned with a static PA on transfer (ds = 0.72 and 1.02), retention (ds = 0.96 and 0.93), fixation time (ds = 2.07 and 1.82), and number of fixations (ds = 1.64 and 2.99). In Experiment 2, adding a static PA to the screen did not improve performance. In Experiment 3, adding signaling such as color coding did not improve performance for students who received a gesturing PA. Results support the embodiment principle that people learn better from onscreen multimedia lessons when a gesturing PA is added to the screen, and social agency theory, which posits that social cues can prime learners to process the material more actively and develop better learning outcomes.

6115,,"The first part (Chapter 1 and 2) of this dissertation presents a novel combination study of melanoma therapy. Acquired clinical resistance to vemurafenib, a selective BRAFV600E inhibitor, arises frequently after short term chemotherapy. Since the inhibitions of targets in the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway result in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, vemurafenib-resistant cancer cells are expected to escape this cell cycle arrest and progress to subsequent G2/M phase. We hypothesized that a combined therapy using vemurafenib with a G2/M phase blocking agent will trap resistant cells and overcome vemurafenib resistance. To test this hypothesis, we first determined the combination index (CI) values of our novel tubulin inhibitor ABI-274 and vemurafenib on parental human A375 and MDA-MB-435 melanoma cell lines to be 0.32 and 0.1, respectively, suggesting strong synergy for the combination. We then developed an A375RF21 subline with significant acquired resistance to vemurafenib and confirmed the strong synergistic effect. Next we studied the potential mechanisms of overcoming vemurafenib resistance. Flow cytometry confirmed that the combination of ABI-274 and vemurafenib synergistically arrested cells in G1/G2/M phase, and significantly increased apoptosis in both parental A375 and the vemurafenib-resistant A375RF21 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the combination treatment effectively reduced the level of phosphorylated and total AKT, activated the apoptosis cascade, and increased cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, but had no significant influence on the level of ERK phosphorylation. Finally, in vivo co-administration of vemurafenib with ABI-274 showed strong synergistic efficacy in the vemurafenib-resistant xenograft model in nude mice. Overall, these results offer a rational combination strategy to significantly enhance the therapeutic benefit in melanoma patients who inevitably become resistant to current BRAF inhibition therapy. The second part (Chapter 3 to 5) of this dissertation focuses on the discovery of a series of small molecule survivin inhibitors. Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are widely considered as promising cancer drug targets, especially for drug-resistant tumors. Mimicking the IAP-binding motif of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) is a rational strategy to design potential IAP inhibitors. In this report, we used the bioactive conformation of AVPI tetrapeptide in the N-terminus of Smac as a template and performed a shape-based virtual screening against a drug-like compound library to identify novel IAP inhibitors. Top hits were subsequently docked to available IAP crystal structures as a secondary screening followed by validation using in vitro biological assays. Four novel hit compounds were identified that potently inhibited cell growth in two human melanoma (A375 and M14) and two human prostate (PC-3 and DU145) cancer cell lines. The best compound, UC-112, has IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 3.4 μM. UC-112 also potently inhibits the growth of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) overexpressed multidrug-resistant cancer cells, strongly activates capase-3/7 and caspase-9 activities, and selectively down-regulates survivin level at a concentration as low as 1 μM. Co-incubation of UC-112 with a known proteasome inhibitor (MG132) rescued survivin inhibition, consistent with the anticipated mechanism of action for UC-112. As a single agent, UC-112 strongly inhibits tumor growth and reduces both XIAP and survivin levels in an A375 human melanoma xenograft model in vivo. Three analogs generated from UC-112 structural modification along with template compound UC-112 were submitted to NCI-60 cancer cell line screening. The results indicated that structural modification of UC-112 to give our best compound MX106 has improved activity by four fold (2.2 μM for UC-112 vs. 0.5 μM for MX106, average GI50 values over all cancer cell lines in the NCI-60 panel). Western blot analyses demonstrated the new compounds maintained high selectivity for survivin inhibition over other members in the inhibitiors","Wang, Jin",0,,2201

6119,Virtual prognostication: When virtual alcohol choices predict change in alcohol consumption over 6-months,"Narrative games, in which users interact with virtual agents, are increasingly being used in health interventions to change targeted behaviors. In virtual social interactions, based on similar real-life contextual cues, past behavior can predict virtual choices. Here, based on theories in learning and interactivity, we examined the whether following a virtual intervention, choices in social interactions may be particularly diagnostic of future behavior changes. To test this, we needed to (1) leverage a contextualized risk (e.g., involving alcohol consumption): scenario (e.g., having one more drink with my partner) given a target audience (e.g., sexually risky young men who have sex with men (YMSM)), (2) include within this context an evidence-based virtual intervention (e.g., promoting alcohol reduction), (3) instantiate and record a virtual choice (water or alcohol) in a virtual dating game scenario intervention with IA for that target audience, and (4) assess pre and 6-months post-intervention YMSM's alcohol use. Using a Socially Optimized Learning Environment (SOLVE) intervention game with IA and alcohol use measures, we found that virtual water choice (versus virtual alcohol choice) significantly predicted real-life alcohol consumption change. Furthermore, personality factors (e.g., Behavioral Approach System) predicted virtual choices and alcohol consumption change. Implications of these findings are discussed.","Wang, L.

In order to avoid fragmentation, we construct a potential function and a connectivity-preserving flocking algorithm to enable the multiple agents to move with the same velocity while preserving the connectivity of underlying networks with a mild assumption that the initial network is connected and the coupling strength of the initial network of the nonlinear velocity consensus term is larger than a threshold value. Furthermore the proposed flocking algorithm is extended to solve the problem of multi-agent systems with a nonlinear dynamical virtual leader. The result is that all agents’ velocities asymptotically approach to the velocity of the virtual leader, and the distance between any two agents is asymptotically stabilized to avoid collisions among agents. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

6128,Evaluating the Sensitivity to Virtual Characters Facial Asymmetry in Emotion Synthesis,"The use of expressive Virtual Characters is an effective complementary means of communication for social networks offering multi-user 3D-chatting environment. In such contexts, the facial expression channel offers a rich medium to translate the ongoing emotions conveyed by the text-based exchanges. However, until recently, only purely symmetric facial expressions have been considered for that purpose. In this article we examine human sensitivity to facial asymmetry in the expression of both basic and complex emotions. The rationale for introducing asymmetry in the display of facial expressions stems from two well-established observations in cognitive neuroscience: first that the expression of basic emotions generally displays a small asymmetry, second that more complex emotions such as ambivalent feeling may reflect in the partial display of different, potentially opposite, emotions on each side of the face. A frequent occurrence of this second case results from the conflict between the truly felt emotion and the one that should be displayed due to social conventions. Our main hypothesis is that a much larger expressive and emotional space can only be automatically synthesized by means of facial asymmetry when modeling emotions with a general Valence-Arousal-Dominance dimensional approach. Besides, we want also to explore the general human sensitivity to the introduction of a small degree of asymmetry into the expression of basic emotions. We conducted an experiment by presenting 64 pairs of static facial expressions, one symmetric and one asymmetric, illustrating eight emotions (three basic and five complex ones) alternatively for a male and a female character. Each emotion was presented four times by swapping the symmetric and asymmetric positions and by mirroring the asymmetrical expression. Participants were asked to grade, on a continuous scale, the correctness of each facial expression with respect to a short definition. Results confirm the potential of introducing facial asymmetry for a subset of the complex emotions. Guidelines are proposed for designers of embodied conversational agent and emotionally reflective avatars.","Wang, N.",0,10.1080/08839514.2017.1299983,2205
6131,Subjective Perceptions in Wartime Negotiation,"The prevalence of negotiation in social interaction has motivated researchers to develop virtual agents that can understand, facilitate, teach and even carry out negotiations. While much of this research has analyzed how to maximize the objective outcome, there is a growing body of work demonstrating that subjective perceptions of the outcome also play a critical role in human negotiation behavior. People derive subjective value from not only the outcome, but also from the process by which they achieve that outcome, from their relationship with their negotiation partner, etc. The affective responses evoked by these subjective valuations can be very different from what would be evoked by the objective outcome alone. We investigate such subjective valuations within human-agent negotiation in four variations of a wartime negotiation scenario taken from the political science literature. We observe that the objective outcomes of these negotiations are not strongly related to the human negotiators' subjective perceptions, as measured by the Subjective Value Index. We examine the game dynamics and agent behaviors to identify features that induce different subjective values in the participants, even when separated from the effect of the objective outcomes. We thus are able to identify characteristics of the interaction between negotiation and battlefield processes that most impact people's subjective valuations.","Wang, N.",0,10.1109/taffc.2014.2378312,2206
6134,Comparative performance of logistic regression and survival analysis for detecting spatial predictors of land-use change,"Although survival analysis is known to outperform logistic regression, theoretically and according to evidence from other disciplines, little is known about how true this is in situations where the goal is detecting spatial predictors of land change. Furthermore, with the increasing availability of longitudinal land-change data, evidence is needed on the relative performance of these two different methods in situations with differing levels of data abundance. To fill this gap, we generated a pseudo land-change data set using an agent-based model of residential development in a virtual landscape. This agent-based model simulated the decisions of homebuyers in choosing residential locations based on the values of several spatial variables. Pseudo land-change maps, generated by the agent-based model with different weights on these spatial variables, were exposed to statistical analysis under the logistic and survival approaches. We evaluated how well the two approaches could reveal the spatial variables that were used in the agent-based model and compared the performance of the two methods when land-change data were collected under different sampling frequencies. Our results suggest that survival analysis outperforms logistic regression in detecting the variables that were included in agent decisions, largely because it takes into account time-dependent variables. Also, this research suggests that various properties of land-change processes (like amount of developed area and access of agents to information) affect the relative performance of these statistical approaches aimed at uncovering land-change predictor variables.","Wang, N.

6139,,"Traffic congestion results from a mismatch between travel demand and road capacity. Because the latter depends upon relatively fixed infrastructure, growing metropolitan areas frequently face challenges from traffic congestion. By charging road users a congestion toll, a transport policy of road pricing has the potential to control travel demand. Road pricing is therefore seen as a promising strategy to alleviate traffic congestion. To evaluate the potential effect of implementing a road pricing policy as a congestion management practice, an agent-based simulation model was developed to capture the non-linear relationship between local interactions and global emergent phenomena. The policy mechanism of road pricing has impacts across scale, affecting aggregate traffic performance by changing individual travel behavior. The agent-based model developed in this study simulates the effect of road pricing on a set of autonomous and heterogeneous travelers whose dynamic travel demand is represented for multiple travel modes. Agent behaviors were examined under different spatial environments based on the defined algorithms. Four virtual experiments under different settings were compared to evaluate the effect of road pricing policy on peak-time traffic congestion. These experiments are used to explore the interaction between three traffic factors: travel demand, road capacity and traffic performance. The results demonstrate an improvement of traffic system performance with increasing toll price, underscoring the potential of road pricing as a means of traffic demand control. Applying such a toll on a particular stretch of road leads to a traffic re-distribution along the road network, in use of different transport modes, and in the timing of when travel is undertaken. This analysis points to the important role played by public transit in providing access to the community. This thesis demonstrates how a simulation model can be leveraged as a tool for scenario analysis to support policy makers considering how to implement road pricing in spatially distinct metropolitan contexts.","Wang, Siyuan",0,,2208
6140,The Uncanny Valley: Existence and Explanations,"More than 40 years ago, Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori (1970/2005) proposed the ""uncanny valley"" hypothesis, which predicted a nonlinear relation between robots' perceived human likeness and their likability. Although some studies have corroborated this hypothesis and proposed explanations for its existence, the evidence on both fronts has been mixed and open to debate. We first review the literature to ascertain whether the uncanny valley exists. We then try to explain the uncanny phenomenon by reviewing hypotheses derived from diverse theoretical and methodological perspectives within psychology and allied fields, including evolutionary, social, cognitive, and psychodynamic approaches. Next, we provide an evaluation and critique of these studies by focusing on their methodological limitations, leading us to question the accepted definition of the uncanny valley. We examine the definitions of human likeness and likability, and propose a statistical test to preliminarily quantify their nonlinear relation. We argue that the uncanny valley hypothesis is ultimately an engineering problem that bears on the possibility of building androids that may some day become indistinguishable from humans. In closing, we propose a dehumanization hypothesis to explain the uncanny phenomenon.","Wang, S. S.",0,10.1037/gpr0000056,2209
6143,Human Perception of Animacy in Light of the Uncanny Valley Phenomenon,"The uncanny valley hypothesis by Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori posits a nonlinear relation between human replicas' human likeness and the emotional responses they elicit. In three studies, we corroborated the uncanny valley hypothesis, using the uncanny phenomenon as a vehicle to shed a new light on human animacy perception. In Study 1, 62 participants rated emotional responses and human likeness of 89 artificial and human faces. In Study 2, another 62 participants conducted a visual looming task with the same 89 faces allowing for the measurement of perceived threat. Results support the uncanny valley hypothesis, suggesting that the uncanny feeling may serve a function to wary humans of the potential danger of entities crossing the animate-inanimate boundary. In Study 3, 36 participants sorted faces as either real or unreal as quickly as possible in a reaction time sorting task allowing for the measurement of categorical uncertainty associated with animacy perception. Faces associated with longer sorting reaction times were also those associated with the highest ratings of negative emotions, suggesting that categorical uncertainty in animacy detection is related to the uncanny feeling. Results are discussed in light of human animacy perception and new directions for future research are suggested.","Wang, S. S.",0,10.1177/0301006617722742,2210
6145,,"Two compounds, oxocarbazate (IC50 = 7 nM) and thiocarbazate (IC50 =56 nM) have been identified and synthesized as potent inhibitors of cathepsin L from past HTS campaign. The mode of action of the two compounds has been characterized both as slowly reversible, competitive inhibition. Through protease activity profiling assay, the two compounds demonstrated high selectivity in inhibiting cathepsin L. Oxocarbazate demonstrated potency in blocking the pseudovirus infection with an IC50 = 193 nM against Ebola and IC50 = 273 nM against SARS pseudovirus. On the contrary, thiocarbazate did not block the infection at concentration as high as 10 µM. Intracellular labeling assay was performed using DCG-04 probe to check for interaction of the two compounds with cathepsin L in HEK 293T cells. The result is consistent with the demonstrated potency in blocking pseutovirus infection. Microarray screening of a printed chemical library of pharmacologically active compounds against human cathepsin L, in the absence of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or cysteine, allowed the discovery of disulfiram (DSF) as a potent human cathepsin L inhibitor. Reducing agent in cathepsin assay buffer can typically mask the activity of DSF against Cathepsin L. Under an attenuated reducing assay condition with only 20 nM of cysteine present, DSF inhibited Cathepsin L (IC50 = 0.16 µM) and was 6.7, 9.8, and 306-fold more potent against CatL than against cathepsin S, B, and K, respectively. DSF inhibited Ebola pseudovirus (IC50 = 5.3 µM) and SARS pseudovirus (IC50 = 20.1 µM) transduction of HEK 293T cells, while DSF had no effect on transduction by pseudovirus expressing Vesicular Stomatitis Virus glycoprotein which, unlike SARS an Ebola virus, does not require cathepsin L processing for virus entry. For mouse intranasally infected with human SARS-CoV strain Toronto-2, DSF treatment caused significant reduction of virus titer in the lung tissue 2 days post infection compared to saline-treated controls. 87,236 compounds from five compound libraries were screened at 16 µM. From this primary screen, 283 hits have been identified. 57 compounds were later cherry picked from the compound source plate and 25 compounds were confirmed to be active with IC50 below 10 µM. 16 compounds were again selected for repurchase from the vendor and upon confirmation test, 10 compounds were shown to be active Meanwhile, all 16 compounds repurchased from the vendor were subjected to the pseudovirus transduction assay to test its activity in blocking the virus entering 293T cells. PC-1087933, a benzamide and PC-1101019, a diazepane were identified to have virus blocking effect. In an attempt of virtual screening compound libraries to search for cathepsin L inhibitors, energy optimized pharmacophore (e-pharmacophore) method is used to develop pharmacophore hypotheses derived from protein-ligand complexes generated from docking study. In a validation run, this e-pharmacophore search did successfully identify the hydrazinecarbothioamide series from chembridge10K compound library. Celera library of 40K compounds were also screened using e-pharmacophore approach as described. Experimental confirmation of the top hits is needed to further validate this approach.","Wang, Tianhua",0,,2211
6147,A Survey on Applications of Model-Free Strategy Learning in Cognitive Wireless Networks,"The framework of cognitive wireless networks is expected to endow the wireless devices with the cognition-intelligence ability with which they can efficiently learn and respond to the dynamic wireless environment. In many practical scenarios, the complexity of network dynamics makes it difficult to determine the network evolution model in advance. Thus, the wireless decision-making entities may face a black-box network control problem and the model-based network management mechanisms will be no longer applicable. In contrast, model-free learning enables the decision-making entities to adapt their behaviors based on the reinforcement from their interaction with the environment and (implicitly) build their understanding of the system from scratch through trial-and-error. Such characteristics are highly in accordance with the requirement of cognition-based intelligence for devices in cognitive wireless networks. Therefore, model-free learning has been considered as one key implementation approach to adaptive, self-organized network control in cognitive wireless networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the applications of the state-of-the-art model-free learning mechanisms in cognitive wireless networks. According to the system models on which those applications are based, a systematic overview of the learning algorithms in the domains of single-agent system, multiagent systems, and multiplayer games is provided. The applications of model-free learning to various problems in cognitive wireless networks are discussed with the focus on how the learning mechanisms help to provide the solutions to these problems and improve the network performance over the model-based, non-adaptive methods. Finally, a broad spectrum of challenges and open issues is discussed to offer a guideline for the future research directions.","Wang, W. B.",0,10.1109/comst.2016.2539923,2212

6152,,"Current literature showed there is a need to help faculty improve their iPad integration practices. Using a sequential mixed-methods design, the researcher explored the relationship among faculty’s iPad integration levels, their teachers’ knowledge (TPACK), and pedagogy among faculty members who had integrated iPads into their teaching for at least two semesters. The data were collected with a cross-section questionnaire, follow-up interviews and artifacts. Responses were collected respectively with the three sections of the questionnaire: iPad Usage (N=160), TPACK (N=151), and demographics (N=147). Eight participants were interviewed after the survey. The results indicated TPACK and learning-centered pedagogy were necessary but insufficient conditions for the transformation levels of iPad integration. Technology itself might not bring a pedagogical shift. Learning to teach with technology could be a catalyst that triggers changes in teaching practices. However, the teacher must act as the agent for these changes. The results of this study could be informative to faculty who hope to improve their own iPad integration levels, or faculty developers and administrators to determine more effective ways to support iPad integration in their institutions.","Wang, Xin",0,,2214
6153,Interacting with Traditional Chinese Culture through Natural Language,"Intangible cultural heritage represents the cultural identities and diversity of mankind, and should be preserved and passed on to the current and future generations.

In this paper, we present our research effort on creating an interactive system for conveying traditional Chinese culture through natural language conversation. We propose a systematic method for the domain experts to construct, with minimal effort, the knowledge base from a set of unstructured philosophy texts, and we design an algorithm to build a conversational agent emulating the conversation ability of a famous Chinese philosopher. We also report two evaluation studies on the prototype we developed, showing encouraging results on the feasibility and benefits of our approach. By automating part of the answer-finding task using natural language processing and information retrieval technology, the system is able to find answers dynamically, without the need to manually author large amounts of question and answer pairs. Our proposed method could potentially be used to create other conversational agents for educating and promoting cultural values to the general public in a natural and appealing way.","Wang, X.",0,10.1145/2597183,2215
6157,An analysis of salary mechanisms in the sharing economy: The interaction between streamers and unions,"Live streaming, a recently emerged service in the sharing economy era, is already very popular in China and is growing in the US market. Besides streamers (those who make the content) and the platform itself, unions of streamers are important stakeholders in live streaming platforms because they act as the streamers' agents. Because the union's salary mechanism will significantly influence the behavior of streamers, in this paper, we investigate the interaction between the streamers and unions from the perspective of salary mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a salary mechanism denoted by (theta, R, T) for the union and then set up a game model between the union and streamers. While the proceeds of streamers depend on their efforts, the union's salary mechanism also significantly influences the efforts of streamers in the union. Streamers determine whether to join the union or not, as well as their efforts under the two alternatives. The union's goal is to optimize its salary mechanism, as well as to determine its effort level in the streamer's virtual room. Our results show that: (i) whether a streamer will join the union depends on both the union's salary mechanism and the streamer's ability; (ii) the salary mechanism (theta, R, T) can be used to implement either the elite talent strategy or the huge-crowd strategy; and (iii) the union's optimal salary mechanism is significantly influenced by the platform's share rates to the union and streamers. In this paper, the properties of the union's optimal salary mechanism are analyzed. This paper contributes to the literature by being the first to incorporate a salary mechanism into studies of the live streaming economy.","Wang, X.",0,10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.04.003,2216
6161,Mind Perception of Robots Varies With Their Economic Versus Social Function,"While robots were traditionally built to achieve economic efficiency and financial profits, their roles are likely to change in the future with the aim to provide social support and companionship. In this research, we examined whether the robot's proposed function (social vs. economic) impacts judgments of mind and moral treatment. Studies 1a and 1b demonstrated that robots with social function were perceived to possess greater ability for emotional experience, but not cognition, compared to those with economic function and whose function was not mentioned explicitly. Study 2 replicated this finding and further showed that low economic value reduced ascriptions of cognitive capacity, whereas high social value resulted in increased emotion perception. In Study 3, robots with high social value were more likely to be afforded protection from harm, and such effect was related to levels of ascribed emotional experience. Together, the findings demonstrate a dissociation between function type (social vs. economic) and ascribed mind (emotion vs. cognition). In addition, the two types of functions exert asymmetric influences on the moral treatment of robots. Theoretical and practical implications for the field of social psychology and human-computer interaction are discussed.","Wang, X. J.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01230,2217
6163,,"The drug resistance has become a big threat to human health, and there is currently a dearth of new antibiotics being introduced. In order to find novel potent antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus, a series of amidine and bisamidine compounds were synthesized and investigated against Staphylococcus aureus. The most active compounds are potent inhibitors against undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS), an essential enzyme involved in cell wall biosynthesis pathway. Besides, they bound to an AT-rich DNA dodecamer (CGCGAATTCGCG)2 and were found to increase the melting transition by up to 24 °C using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Good correlations (R2 = 0.89, S. aureus) were found between experimental and predicted cell growth inhibition by using DNA ΔTm and UPPS IC50 experimental results together with one computed descriptor. We also solved the structures of three bisamidines binding to DNA as well as three UPPS structures. Overall, the results are of general interest in the context of the development of resistance-resistant antibiotics that involve multi-targeting. To extend the potential utility of this class of amidine compound, we tested them against Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis. The most active compound was a biphenyldiamidine which had an EC50 of 7.7 nM against bloodstream form parasites. There was little toxicity against two human cell lines with CC50 > 100 μM. There was also good in vivo activity in a mouse model of infection with 100% survival at 3 mg/kg i.p. The most potent lead blocked replication of kinetoplast DNA (k-DNA), but not nuclear DNA, in the parasite. Some compounds also inhibited the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) and some were uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. We developed a computational model for T. brucei cell growth inhibition (R2 = 0.76) using DNA ΔTm values for inhibitor binding, combined with T. brucei FPPS IC50 values. Overall, the results suggest that it may be possible to develop multi-target drug leads against T. brucei that act by inhibiting both k-DNA replication and isoprenoid biosynthesis. In the investigation of other novel inhibitors against T. brucei, we found out that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell growth inhibitor SQ109 showed potent activity against T. brucei. Then, I synthesized a library of 48 analogs of SQ109 in which the ethylene diamine linker was replaced by oxa-, thia- or heterocyclic species, and in some cases, the adamantyl group was replaced by a 1,2-carborane or the N-geranyl group by another hydrophobic species. Compounds were tested against Trypanosoma brucei and two human cell lines (human embryonic kidney, HEK293T, and the hepatocellular carcinoma, HepG2). Most potent activity was found with a compound with a fixed positive charge (imidazolium ring), having IC50 values as low as 12 nM (5.5 ng/mL) and a selectivity index of ∼300. In the investigation of ways of action, the best compound targeted the mitochondrial membrane potential, exhibiting stronger uncoupling effect and better cell growth inhibition activity compared with SQ109 In another project, we were looking for UPPS inhibitors as anti-infective by in silico screening. 12 UPPS crystal structures were used to validate virtual screening models then 100 virtual hits (from 450,000 compounds) were assayed against UPPS from S. aureus and Escherichia coli. The most promising inhibitors (IC50 ∼2 μM) had activity against MRSA, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus anthracis and a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. with MIC or IC 50 values in the 0.25-4 μg/mL range. Moreover, one compound, a rhodanine with close structural similarity to the commercial diabetes drug Epalrestat, exhibited good activity as well as a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.1 with methicillin against the community-acquired MRSA USA300 strain, indicating strong synergism.

6165,Regret-Based Automated Decision-Making Aids for Domain Search Tasks Using Human-Agent Collaborative Teams,"In this paper, we consider domain search tasks using a human-agent collaborative team. An automated Bayesian sequential decision-making strategy is first proposed for the optimal allocation of manual and autonomous sensing modes in the presence of sensing uncertainty. An agent will generate a request for human intervention whenever the manual mode is deemed optimal. However, this type of optimal strategy is not always the style of human decision making under uncertainty. In particular, regret has been shown to play a critical role in human's rational decision making. Humans experience regret when they perceive that they are better off with another option and tend to make choices to avoid such experience. Furthermore, it has been shown that team members who share the same mental model perform better than teams with a more accurate but less similar mental model. Therefore, to enable more effective humanagent collaboration (HAC) and improve joint performance, we embed regret analysis into the proposed decision-making framework to provide suboptimal but more humanlike automated decision aids. We will reconcile the dominant Bayesian methods with the analysis of human behaviors during decision making. We provide the simulation results to compare the decision-making strategies with and without regret analysis and show that regret-based decision making can integrate human tendency in risk averse and risk seeking for better HAC.","Wang, Y.",0,10.1109/tcst.2015.2508963,2219
6166,In our own image? Emotional and neural processing differences when observing human-human vs human-robot interactions,"Notwithstanding the significant role that human-robot interactions (HRI) will play in the near future, limited research has explored the neural correlates of feeling eerie in response to social robots. To address this empirical lacuna, the current investigation examined brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging while a group of participants (n = 26) viewed a series of human-human interactions (HHI) and HRI. Although brain sites constituting the mentalizing network were found to respond to both types of interactions, systematic neural variation across sites signaled diverging social-cognitive strategies during HHI and HRI processing. Specifically, HHI elicited increased activity in the left temporal-parietal junction indicative of situation-specific mental state attributions, whereas HRI recruited the precuneus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) suggestive of script-based social reasoning. Activity in the VMPFC also tracked feelings of eeriness towards HRI in a parametric manner, revealing a potential neural correlate for a phenomenon known as the uncanny valley. By demonstrating how understanding social interactions depends on the kind of agents involved, this study highlights pivotal sub-routes of impression formation and identifies prominent challenges in the use of humanoid robots.","Wang, Y.",0,10.1093/scan/nsv043,2220
6168,,"Because architecture necessitates the conscious planning of space, its consequences for navigation and socio-political status are equally deliberate and have indirect effects. This research combines experiential and spatial syntax techniques to gain a deeper understanding of how Mycenaeans shaped space to construct status and navigation in the Palace of Nestor at Pylos. Using a digital reconstruction of the palace ensured the most accurate experiential data by utilizing a whole, albeit virtual, version of the site. Without employing a digital reconstruction, the only experiences with the site would occur in the ruinous, actual site preventing complete experiences with how the site’s architecture affects the individual. Additionally, the spatial analytics provides the ability to cross-verify, quantify, and in the future compare, the results with other Bronze Age Palaces. While the quantitative methods discern how the architecture interacts with itself and agents in an idealized, objective environment, the phenomenological data elucidates if and how people actually experience the palace and what explicitly or implicitly affects their navigation. The latter ensures the interpretations of all the data maintains plausibility in the real world and not just statistical simulations. Together, the results indicate the palace’s left side has easy local access with little ability to travel across. Conversely, the right side has an overall easy ability to access anywhere in the palace but is difficult to enter. Similarly, court, megaron, and vestibule possess the highest status in the complex with increasingly restricted access into the latter two rooms.","Ward, Caleb",0,,2221

Thinking with sound studies and more posthuman ways of knowing/being/doing, this article details how the sonic was felt not only as an actor on the scene of young children writing but also as an intra-active agent of what the teacher called ‘making space’ and community. Exploring ‘emergent listening’ through a diffractive entanglement of stories and concepts, this paper focus on two pieces of early writing: a digitally produced audio clip and a ‘body built’ (Ms Lionel’s words) tableau depicting the sensorial process and thinking behind children’s making moments. The findings highlight how particular actions of emergent listening generated new forms of embodied knowledge-in-motion. Encouraging educators to consider the modal affordances of sound and sonic composition, this article expands definitions of young children composing with material realia and explores how, as this article suggests, emergent listening opens up pedagogical spaces where creative energies are generated and mobilized to bring to fruition an ethico-onto-epistemological world view.

6173,,"Recent work investigating the dynamics of coupled physical systems with uni-directional slave-master coupling dynamics has demonstrated that the incorporation of delayed feedback within the slave system allows it to achieve anticipation of chaotic master system behavior. This counterintuitive phenomenon of self-organized anticipatory synchronization has been observed for a variety of systems including coupled electrical circuits, laser semi-conductors, and neurons. Most recently research has shown that human individuals are capable of exhibiting the same kind of aperiodic anticipation in the context of interpersonal interaction following the introduction of perceptual-motor feedback delays. Understanding such human behavior as defined by the same universal dynamical laws as other physical systems provides a more parsimonious explanation for how humans are able to maintain complex coordination given the existence of inherent neural and perceptual-motor delays than previously proposed accounts, which depend on the existence of internal models and neural simulation processes. This perspective also provides a novel opportunity to inform the advancement of human robotic interaction; through an in-depth understanding of anticipatory synchronization in humans and other physical systems it should be possible to develop adaptive artificial agents defined by systems of low-dimensional dynamical equations capable of coordinating with complex human behavior in real time. The goal of the current project was to gain further information about human anticipatory synchronization in order to facilitate the design, development and testing of an artificial agent intended to exhibit self-organized anticipation during interaction with a human co-actor. In each of three initial studies, a participant was asked to coordinate with the continuous arm movements of a robot avatar seen via a virtual reality headset. The participant's own virtual arm movements reflected the behavioral outcomes of their actions at one of several short temporal delays (between 25 and 450 ms). Short-term coordination analyses of maximum cross-correlation and instantaneous relative phase were used to evaluate the occurrence of anticipatory synchronization. An analysis of complexity matching, or more long-term behavioral similarity, was also conducted to provide additional information about the coordinative dynamics associated with anticipatory synchronization. Collectively these studies demonstrated that 1) slower movement supports greater frequency of leading behavior than faster movement, 2) human perceptual-motor anticipatory synchronization of aperiodic behaviors can be achieved for one-dimensional movements as has previously been seen for two-dimensional behavior, and 3) anticipation and global movement coordination can occur for a range of bi-directional master-slave coupling strengths. A fourth and final study consisted of three model validation tests meant to establish whether an artificial agent system composed of a harmonic spring oscillator coupled to a human co-actor through a function that continuously minimizes differences between the agent's past behavior and the current behavior of the human actor could achieve anticipation. This study confirmed the agent's ability to exhibit self-organized anticipatory synchronization with respect to ongoing aperiodic human behavior. This project is the first to apply the expanding understanding of anticipatory synchronization in physical systems to research in human robotic interaction in the interest of producing technically realizable artificial agents capable of adaptively anticipating complex human behavior.","Washburn, Auriel",0,,2225
6174,An Internet-Based Virtual Coach to Promote Physical Activity Adherence in Overweight Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Addressing the obesity epidemic requires the development of effective, scalable interventions. Pedometers and Web-based programs are beneficial in increasing activity levels but might be enhanced by the addition of nonhuman coaching. Objectives: We hypothesized that a virtual coach would increase activity levels, via step count, in overweight or obese individuals beyond the effect observed using a pedometer and website alone. Methods: We recruited 70 participants with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35 kg/m(2) from the Boston metropolitan area. Participants were assigned to one of two study arms and asked to wear a pedometer and access a website to view step counts. Intervention participants also met with a virtual coach, an automated, animated computer agent that ran on their home computers, set goals, and provided personalized feedback. Data were collected and analyzed in 2008. The primary outcome measure was change in activity level (percentage change in step count) over the 12-week study, split into four 3-week time periods. Major secondary outcomes were change in BMI and participants' satisfaction. Results: The mean age of participants was 42 years; the majority of participants were female (59/70, 84%), white (53/70, 76%), and college educated (68/70, 97%). Of the initial 70 participants, 62 completed the study. Step counts were maintained in intervention participants but declined in controls. The percentage change in step count between those in the intervention and control arms, from the start to the end, did not reach the threshold for significance (2.9% vs -12.8% respectively, P = 2.07). However, repeated measures analysis showed a significant difference when comparing percentage changes in step counts between control and intervention participants over all time points (analysis of variance, P = .02). There were no significant changes in secondary outcome measures. Conclusions: The virtual coach was beneficial in maintaining activity level. The long-term benefits and additional applications of this technology warrant further study.","Watson, A.",0,10.2196/jmir.1629,2226
6179,,"Sigma receptors are endogenous proteins with potential utility in treating psychological disorders, ischemia, the psychological and convulsive effects of drugs of abuse, and as an imaging agent for cancerous tissues, among others. Drug design efforts targeting these receptors have been hindered by a lack of structural information of the receptors themselves. Traditional ligand-based approaches have succeeded in generating many compounds with high affinity, and quite a few with selectivity for σ-1 receptors. There are few selective ligands for use as pharmacological probes for the σ-2 receptor. Much effort has gone into exploring the structure activity relationships of ligands targeting these receptors. A critical review of the existing literature covering pharmacophore development for σ receptors was undertaken with the intent to develop computational models to assist in ligand-based drug design efforts. Inspired by the lack of pharmacophore models with general utility, and confronted by the obstacles of data heterogeneity, a database of σ ligands and their binding affinity data was collected. Cohorts of data collected under similar experimental methodologies were assembled and clustered by measures of scaffold dissimilarity. Multiple-Instance Learning techniques were used to train classification models that differentiated molecules as active or inactive, and to assist in the identification of relevant conformations of σ ligands at their macromolecular targets. Conformations of high-affinity ligands were then used to develop general pharmacophore models as part of a virtual screening approach. Structure-activity relationship models based on virtual screening alignments of known sigma ligands were developed in the search for selective σ-1 and σ-2 receptor probes.","Watson, David",0,,2227

6184,Designing an MOOC as an agent-platform aggregating heterogeneous virtual learning environments,"With the emergence of cloud technologies, on the one hand, and social networks, on the other hand, the possibilities for e-learning have been drastically enhanced in the latest years. Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) can now indeed contain a huge amount of learning resources; in parallel, large user communities are available in social networks. These nevertheless remain different systems but, by using these heterogeneous software environments together, the possibilities for interaction could be multiplied. That is why, this paper suggests to build a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) environment through a Multi-Agent System (MAS) working as a virtual abstraction layer over heterogeneous software platforms. The idea is to aggregate different traditional VLE to dispose of the learning objects they own as well as other platforms such as social networks to furnish an easy access to the MOOC of their large user communities. The MAS design has been architectured around a real-life organisational pattern - the joint venture - allowing one to deal with the complexity of heterogeneous software environments in a manner that real-life companies set up joint governance. Communication scenarios issued of a field analysis are pointed out in the paper; these are supported by the MOOC platform in the native environment as well as in Facebook. The proposal is indeed validated through the development of a prototype using Facebook as a case study for third-party platform interfacing.

6189,Anthropomorphizing without Social Cues Requires the Basolateral Amygdala,"Anthropomorphism, the attribution of distinctively human mental characteristics to nonhuman animals and objects, illustrates the human propensity for extending social cognition beyond typical social targets. Yet, its processing components remain challenging to study because they are typically all engaged simultaneously. Across one pilot study and one focal study, we tested three rare people with basolateral amygdala lesions to dissociate two specific processing components: those triggered by attention to social cues (e.g., seeing a face) and those triggered by endogenous semantic knowledge (e.g., imbuing a machine with animacy). A pilot study demonstrated that, like neurologically intact control group participants, the three amygdala-damaged participants produced anthropomorphic descriptions for highly socially salient stimuli but not for stimuli lacking clear social cues. A focal study found that the three amygdala participants could anthropomorphize animate and living entities normally, but anthropomorphized inanimate stimuli less than control participants. Our findings suggest that the amygdala contributes to how we anthropomorphize stimuli that are not explicitly social.","Waytz, A.",0,10.1162/jocn_a_01365,2230

We investigated an important theoretical determinant of people's willingness to trust such technology to perform competently the extent to which a nonhuman agent is anthropomorphized with a humanlike mind in a domain of practical importance, autonomous driving. Participants using a driving simulator drove either a normal car, an autonomous vehicle able to control steering and speed, or a comparable autonomous vehicle augmented with additional anthropomorphic features name, gender, and voice. Behavioral, physiological, and self-report measures revealed that participants trusted that the vehicle would perform more competently as it acquired more anthropomorphic features. Technology appears better able to perform its intended design when it seems to have a humanlike mind. These results suggest meaningful consequences of humanizing technology, and also offer insights into the inverse process of objectifying humans.

6200,,"Indigenous Maya men have long looked to domestic migration as an economic strategy. Increasingly, these men engage in transnational migration from Guatemala to the United States as a means of achieving economic security. Men’s decision to migrate has important implications not only for them, but also for their families. This dissertation examines the impacts of Kaqchikel Maya men’s migration on their wives who remain in the highland town of Tecpán, Guatemala. In contrast to other scholarly accounts of transnational migration, which emphasize benefits for, and improved social standing of, women in sending communities, this research reveals that migration can adversely affect migrants’ wives and exacerbate longstanding gender inequalities. Based on 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork, I demonstrate how migrants’ wives become subject to additional social control upon the departure of their husbands. Despite their physical absence, migrants monitor their wives by establishing a virtual presence through cell phones and social media. While previous scholarship focuses on these technologies’ ability to facilitate transnational communication and touts social media technologies as emancipatory, this intimate ethnography demonstrates their disciplinary function. However, it is not male migrants alone that exert control over their wives; gender socialization and patrilocality position mothers-in-law as key agents of familial surveillance, helping to control younger women. My analysis explores how such familial surveillance functions as both a form of social control and care. By connecting wives’ experiences of surveillance and intimacy in Kaqchikel transnational households, I complicate previous ideas of transnationalism, gendered power dynamics, and women’s agency, while providing insights into the personal dilemmas of indigenous migrants and their families who remain “at home.”","Webb, Meghan Farley",0,,2233
6201,,"Introduction: Sensory conflicts in the vestibular system lead to motion sickness of which space motion sickness (SMS) is a special case. SMS affects up to 70% of the astronauts during the first 3 days in space. The search for effective countermeasures has led to several nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches. The current study focuses on the effects of lorazepam (1 mg), meclizine (25 mg), promethazine (25 mg), and scopolamine (0.4 mg) on the vestibular system, with special focus on the canal and otolith functions separately. Methods: The study had a placebo-controlled, single blind, repeated measures design. Sixteen healthy volunteers were subjected to a total of 7 test sessions, the first and last being without intake of medication. Semicircular canal function was evaluated by means of electronystagmography and otolith function with unilateral centrifugation. The horizontal semicircular canal function was characterized by the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain measured during earth vertical axis rotation as well as the total caloric response. The function of the utricles was represented by the utricular sensitivity, reflecting the ocular counter roll relative to the virtual induced head tilt. Results: Promethazine significantly decreased the semicircular canal and utricular parameters. Both scopolamine and lorazepam caused only a decrease in the utricular sensitivity, whereas meclizine only decreased the semicircular canal-induced VOR gain. Discussion: The results show that the drugs affected different areas of the vestibular system and that the effects can thus be attributed to the specific pharmacological properties of each drug. Meclizine, as an antihistaminergic and weak anticholinergic drug, only affected the VOR gain, suggesting a central action on the medial vestibular nucleus. The same site of action is suggested for the anticholinergic scopolamine since acetylcholine receptors are present and utricular fibers terminate here. The global vestibular suppression caused by promethazine is probably a consequence of its anticholinergic, antihistaminergic, and antidopaminergic properties. Based on the fact that lorazepam increased the affinity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for the GABA(A)-receptor and its effects on the utriculi, the site of action seems to be the lateral vestibular nucleus. Conclusion: Meclizine, scopolamine, and lorazepam selectively suppress specific parts of the vestibular system. Selective suppression of different parts of the vestibular system may be more beneficial for alleviating (space) motion sickness than general suppressive agents. Additionally, this knowledge may help the clinician in his therapeutic management of patients with either semicircular canal or otolith dysfunction.

6215,CORRUPTION IN ADVERSARIAL SYSTEMS: THE CASE OF DEMOCRACY,"In this essay I argue that adversarial institutional systems, such as multi-party democracy, present a distinctive risk of institutional corruption, one that is particularly difficult to counteract. Institutional corruption often results not from individual malfeasance, but from perverse incentives that make it the case that agents within an institutional framework have rival institutional interests that risk pitting individual advantage against the functioning of the institution in question. Sometimes, these perverse incentives are only contingently related to the central animating logic of an institution. In these cases, immunizing institutions from the risk of corruption is not a theoretically difficult exercise. In other cases, institutions generale perverse or rival incentives in virtue of some central feature of the institution's design, one that is also responsible for some of the institution's more positive trails. In multi-party democratic systems, partisanship risks giving rise to too close an identification of the partisan's interest with that of the party, to the detriment of the democratic system as a whole. But partisanship is also necessary to the functioning of such a system. Creating bulwarks that allow the positive aspects of partisanship to manifest themselves, while offsetting the aspects of partisanship through which individual advantage of democratic agents is linked too closely to party success, is a central task for the theory and practice of the institutional design of democracy.","Weinstock, D.

6216,,"Position-based methods have become popular for real-time simulation in computer graphics. In contrast to traditional simulation methods, which are based on Newtonian dynamics, particularly forces, a Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) method computes the positional changes directly, based on a set of well-defined geometric constraints. Therefore, position-based methods are reputed to be more controllable, stable, and faster, which make them well-suited for use in interactive environments. This thesis introduces position-based approaches to addressing the important tasks of virtual crowd simulation and virtual layout synthesis. For crowd simulation, we introduce a novel method that runs at interactive rates for up to hundreds of thousands of agents. Our method enables the detailed modeling of per-agent behavior in a Lagrangian formulation. We model short-range and long-range collision avoidance to simulate both sparse and dense crowds. On the particles representing agents, we formulate a set of positional constraints that can be readily integrated into a standard PBD solver. We augment the tentative particle motions with planning velocities to determine the preferred velocities of agents, and project the positions onto the constraint manifold to eliminate colliding configurations. The local short-range interaction is represented with collision and frictional contact between agents, as in the discrete simulation of granular materials. We incorporate a cohesion model for simulating collective behaviors and propose a new constraint for dealing with potential future collisions. Our method is suitable for use in interactive games. For layout synthesis, we propose a position-based interior layout synthesis method that is able to rapidly synthesize large scale layouts that were previously intractable. An interior layout modeling task can be challenging for non-experts, hence the existence of interior design professionals. Recent research into the automation of this task has yielded methods that can synthesize layouts of objects respecting aesthetic and functional constraints that are non-linear and competing. These methods usually adopt a purely stochastic scheme, which samples from a distribution of layout configurations, a process that is slow and inefficient. We introduce an alternative physics-based, continuous layout synthesis technique, which results in a significant gain in speed and is readily scalable. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of examples and show that it achieves results similar to conventional layout synthesis based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) state-search step, but is faster by at least an order of magnitude and can handle layouts of unprecedented size and tight layouts that can overwhelm McMC.","Weiss, Tomer",0,,2238
6217,,"Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are extensively involved in fast synaptic transmission and play a key role in many different neurological processes, such as pain sensation, memory, and addiction. These receptors are known targets for a variety of established pharmacological agents with diverse clinical uses, but recent major progress in our understanding of pLGIC structure-function relationships allows for the enhanced discovery of new drugs with improved therapeutic potential and reduced adverse effects. This dissertation presents the integrated computational and experimental techniques employed towards this end for two different pLGICs, the α3 glycine receptor (GlyR) and the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Three primary accomplishments resulted from this work. First, an ensemble-based virtual screening protocol was developed to target the GlyR transmembrane domain (TMD). Small-scale screening calculations were performed as a pilot study and validated by functional electrophysiology measurements, resulting in a hit rate of over 90% success. Second, this screening protocol was expanded to identify compounds specifically targeting the cannabinoid-binding site in α3GlyR. The lead compound from in vitro functional validation experiments progressed to in vivo behavioral tests in mice and was found to be a potent analgesic for inflammatory pain. Third, experimental restraints from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy were applied to determine the first structures of the α7nAChR intracellular domain (ICD). Although many different pLGIC structures have been solved in recent years, no structure obtained so far contains a complete ICD. This domain is an important target for therapeutic interventions for a variety of neurological disorders associated with intracellular signal transduction, but structure-based drug discovery is impossible without accurate structural information. The α7nAChR ICD structures determined here lay the foundation for future screening efforts in a previously unexplored area of drug discovery.","Wells, Marta M.",0,,2239
6219,,"The overarching objective of this work is to bridge neuroscience and artificial intelligence to ultimately build machines that learn, act, and think like humans. In the context of vision, the brain enables humans to readily make sense of the visual world, e.g. recognizing visual objects. Developing human-like machines requires understanding the working principles underlying the human vision. In this dissertation, I ask how the brain encodes and represents dynamic visual information from the outside world, whether brain activity can be directly decoded to reconstruct and categorize what a person is seeing, and whether neuroscience theory can be applied to artificial models to advance computer vision. To address these questions, I used deep neural networks (DNN) to establish encoding and decoding models for describing the relationships between the brain and the visual stimuli. Using the DNN, the encoding models were able to predict the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses throughout the visual cortex given video stimuli; the decoding models were able to reconstruct and categorize the visual stimuli based on fMRI activity. To further advance the DNN model, I have implemented a new bidirectional and recurrent neural network based on the predictive coding theory. As a theory in neuroscience, predictive coding explains the interaction among feedforward, feedback, and recurrent connections. The results showed that this brain-inspired model significantly outperforms feedforward-only DNNs in object recognition. These studies have positive impact on understanding the neural computations under human vision and improving computer vision with the knowledge from neuroscience.","Wen, Haiguang",0,,2240
6220,Sports lottery game prediction system development and evaluation on social networks,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to establish a social-network sp.orts lottery system to support users in predicting and simulating sports lottery betting. The community data were generated to support user decision and featured instant game records and odds data synchronisation. Furthermore, the next development cycle were evaluated through a questionnaire. Design/methodology/approach - An extended prototype website development methodology was applied to develop the system. An online sample was collected to evaluate the function, interface, operation, and prediction designs. The chi(2) test and variance analysis were used to determine the association between facets and basic demographics. Finally, the regression model was used to identify the potentially essential predictors that influence the measurement facets. Findings - The high frequency of Facebook users, sports lottery purchases, and sports game viewers prefer the ability to predict the results of future sports games as advanced decision-making functions. However, the agent-based virtual gift presentation function was the least preferred function. Research limitations/implications - The study sample was limited only to users: who used PTT and Facebook; were of uneven age, education, and gender; and none segment groups. The study sample primarily comprised Taiwanese respondents. These differences might influence the practicality and prediction bias of the designed website and related models. Practical implications - The proposed method integrates social-network messages with real-time data access by using APIs, crawler schemes, and prediction mechanisms that enable developers to devise strategies for obtaining high system satisfaction. The system can be improved by adding the results of future sports games and excluding authorised Facebook message posts. Originality/value - A social-network-based sports lottery and prediction prototyping website was evaluated through a user-preference survey regarding design functions. The measurement results indicated that users share their opinions, predictions, and personal betting results and interact with their friends.","Wen, Y. F.",0,10.1108/IntR-05-2014-0139,2241

Participants in this study were 123 out of 180 undergraduates who were taking a Probability and Statistics course. The duration to conduct this study was around six months. There were few phases in this study. The first phase was designing the system and PAs for around four months. Second phase was students were given a consent form to obtain their permission to participate in this study. After the students agreed to participate in this study, they were given a duration of one week to fill up the pre-questionnaire online. The third phase was conducted for one month for the students to learn probability topics using the system, PMath Guide with pedagogical agents. These pedagogical agents in the system acted as a lecturer, tutor and motivator. In short, the pedagogical agents led students to have an interest in learning probability, providing encouragements, increasing confidence level, and thus reducing their anxiety level. The fourth phase was conducted for one week for the students to fill up an online post-questionnaire after they finished learning using the PMath Guide. The students’ anxiety level were determined by comparing the scores from mean and standard deviation from pre and post Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS). Anxiety level was low when the scores were below one standard deviation from the mean scores. Meanwhile, anxiety level was categorised as average when scores were within one standard deviation from the mean scores whereas scores that were above one standard deviation from the mean scores was considered to have high anxiety level.","Wern Lin, Yeo",1,,2242
6225,,"Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is among the major drug resistant bacteria that persist in both the community and clinical settings due to resistance to commonly used antimicrobials. This continues to fuel the need for novel compounds that are active against this organism. In our efforts to find new compounds with activity against S. aureus, we have targeted the type IIA bacterial topoisomerase, DNA Gyrase, an essential enzyme involved in bacterial replication, through the ATP-dependent supercoiling of DNA. The virtual screening tool Shape Signatures was applied to screen a large database for agents with shape similar to Novobiocin, a known gyrase B inhibitor. The binding energetics of the top hits from this initial screen were further validated by molecular docking. Compounds with the highest score against available crystal structure of homologous DNA gyrase from T. Thermophilus were selected. From this initial set of compounds, several rhodanine-substituted derivatives had the highest antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, as determined by minimal inhibitory concentration assays, with Novobiocin as the positive control. Further activity validation of the rhodanine compounds through biochemical assays confirmed their inhibition of both the supercoiling and the ATPase activity of DNA gyrase. Subsequent docking and molecular dynamics on the crystal structure of DNA gyrase from S. aureus when it became available, provides further rationalization of the observed biochemical activity and understanding of the receptor-ligand interactions. In addition, a regression model for minimal inhibitory concentration prediction against S. aureus was generated based on the current molecules studied as well as other rhodanines derivatives found in the literature.","Werner, Malela Mwamufiya",0,,2243
6227,Local Tea Party Groups and the Vibrancy of the Movement,"The Tea Party Movement (TPM) is often discussed in terms of Americans for Prosperity, the Republican Party, and other well-funded, national groups. Yet, grounded ethnographic research reveals vibrant, independent, local organizations, which, while they do draw on nationally disseminated cultural images and discourses, are far from simple agents of the larger organizations and media. Relying on eighteen months of fieldwork among eight local Tea Party groups in central North Carolina, I argue that these small, locally situated groups are crucial components in the TPM and its effects. Using theoretical concepts from social movement studies and social practice theory, I analyze the ways personal and Internet-based social networks, media, and elite organizations are cocreating new political subjects, and demonstrate the importance of local, face-to-face political organizations in cultivating and animating these subjects. I suggest that localized political groups are important for long-lasting political transformations.","Westermeyer, W. H.",0,10.1111/plar.12175,2244

This hermeneutic phenomenological–existential study aimed to examine the lived experiences of eight teachers and nine parents in an urban elementary school in western Pennsylvania during pedagogical changes. This inquiry was carried out through interviews; the questions were designed to elicit both teacher and parent expectations. The data arose from two focus groups—one teacher group and one parent group—in addition to six individual interviews with three teachers and three parents. Three themes emerged that pertain to parent–teacher interaction: the need for communication, a desire for human empathy, and felt oppression. School administrators’ attitudes also were found to be critical in terms of teachers’ success. The implications for school counselors and school social workers relate to their potential as a system change agent in a leadership role that is designed with ethnically and multiculturally sensitive strategies to enhance the learning environment of schools.

6230,"Putting Ostracism into Perspective: Young Children Tell More Mentalistic Stories after Exclusion, But Not When Anxious","Much is known about when children acquire an understanding of mental states, but few, if any, experiments identify social contexts in which children tend to use this capacity and dispositions that influence its usage. Social exclusion is a common situation that compels us to reconnect with new parties, which may crucially involve attending to those parties' mental states. Across two studies, this line of inquiry was extended to typically developing preschoolers (Study 1) and young children with and without anxiety disorder (AD) (Study 2). Children played the virtual game of toss ""Cyberball"" ostensibly over the Internet with two peers who first played fair (inclusion), but eventually threw very few balls to the child (exclusion). Before and after Cyberball, children in both studies completed stories about peer-scenarios. For Study 1, 36 typically developing 5-year-olds were randomly assigned to regular exclusion (for no apparent reason) or accidental exclusion (due to an alleged computer malfunction). Compared to accidental exclusion, regular exclusion led children to portray story-characters more strongly as intentional agents (intentionality), with use of more mental state language (MSL), and more between-character affiliation in post-Cyberball stories. For Study 2, 20 clinically referred 4 to 8-year-olds with AD and 15 age- and gender-matched non-anxious controls completed stories before and after regular exclusion. While we replicated the post regular-exclusion increase of intentional and MSL portrayals of story-characters among non-anxious controls, anxious children exhibited a decline on both dimensions after regular exclusion. We conclude that exclusion typically induces young children to mentalize, enabling more effective reconnection with others. However, excessive anxiety may impair controlled mentalizing, which may, in turn, hamper effective reconnection with others after exclusion.","White, L. O.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01926,2246
6239,,"Computer-based modeling and simulation has been a training staple in the military domain since the first aircraft simulators were adopted. More recently, virtual environments based on modeling, simulation and serious games, have introduced relatively low-cost, yet high value additions to the learning environment. As these virtual environments have proliferated, many researchers have investigated the relationship between theoretical foundations of learning, learner development and content delivery, and applied their findings in an attempt to bolster learning, yet performance deficiencies continue to exist. This study asserts that performance deficiencies exist in part because of insufficient contextually appropriate opportunities to practice. This work is multi-disciplinary in nature. Its foundation is modeling and simulation engineering; the use of technology to deliver training. Educational psychology and human factors concepts explain the theoretical basis for modeling and simulation as an effective training delivery agent. The study's thesis is that a framework for delivering contextually appropriate opportunities for warfighter practice can be applied to discover whether modeling, simulation and game-based virtual environments have the potential to improve individual performance for learners beyond the Novice Stage (e.g., Competent Stage) of skills acquisition. Furthermore, this conceptually appropriate practice (CAP) framework can be used to assess the potential of low fidelity virtual environments to provide targeted practice and to improve individual performance, not only during training in high-fidelity virtual environments (near transfer) but also in the live environment (far transfer). To evaluate the thesis, this study investigates the relationship of technology and learning science, and features an empirical evaluation of training effectiveness afforded by delivering additional training repetitions using both low-fidelity virtual environment simulator systems and high-fidelity aircraft simulators.","White, Michael Allan",0,,2247

Affording opportunity for undergraduate general education students to express musical identity and experience musical otherness through musical decision making in an e-learning environment propelled the creation of the two courses that became the context for this study. The first course, MUS 339: What's on your playlist? Aesthetic Experiences in Music, invites students to create a negotiated listening curriculum by demonstrating musical understanding through legally edited audio clips from their own library. The second course, MUS 225: Song and Songwriting, invites students to demonstrate musical understanding through originally created songs and fragments. In the context of these courses, I used the phrase thinking-in-music-with-music to describe the act of musical decision-making as demonstrated in the creation and editing of musical clips and songs within these online courses. Functioning as a teacher/researcher in these settings from 2009-2011, I gathered 386,224 records of virtual data. Using a qualitative methodology, I analyzed these data vfor emergent themes. Layered dialogic analysis invited representation inclusive of arts-based and narrative elements. My interpretation of the data revealed that students were indeed able to move toward musical understanding through thinking-in-music-with-music in an e-learning environment Data analysis further illuminated some ways that students expressed meaning and value through their experiences in these courses, including a recognition that learning about relationships in music can serve as a vehicle toward enhanced understanding of ourselves and others. In this study, aesthetic education underwent its own curricular transformation through the wedding of aesthetic agency, learner agency, and the opportunities made possible for musical thinking and decision making demonstrated and shared in the flexible contexts of virtual classrooms. Through this wedding, music was seen in student experience as a transformational agent in otherness, self, agency, and healing. Thinking-in-music-with-music became a transformative technology functioning as an emancipatory dialogic window into student worlds.","White, Phyllis Aleta",0,,2248
6241,Perception in dynamic scenes: What is your Heider capacity?,"The classic animation experiment by Heider and Simmel (1944) revealed that humans have a strong tendency to impose narrative even on displays showing interactions between simple geometric shapes. In their most famous animation with three simple shapes, observers almost inevitably interpreted them as rational agents with intentions, desires, and beliefs (“That nasty big triangle!”). Much work on dynamic scenes has identified basic visual properties that can make shapes seem animate. Here, we investigate the limits on the ability to use narrative to share information about animated scenes. We created 30 second Heider-style cartoons with 3–9 items. Item trajectories were generated automatically by a simple set of rules, but without a script. In Experiments 1 and 2, 10 observers wrote short narratives for each cartoon. Next, new observers were shown a cartoon and then presented with a narrative generated for that specific cartoon or one generated for a different cartoon having the same items. Observers rated the fit of the narrative to the cartoon on a scale from 1 (clearly does not fit) to 5 (clearly fits). Performance declined markedly when the number of items was larger than 3. Experiment 3 had observers determine if a short clip of a cartoon came from a longer clip. Experiment 4 had observers determine which of two narratives fit a cartoon. Finally, in Experiment 5, narratives always mentioned every item in a display. In all cases of matching narrative to cartoon, performance drops most dramatically between 3 and 4 items.

6265,Making persons accountable: The impact of identification technology and of legal incorporation on notions of the person,"Fingerprints, iris-scans, DNA-tests and other biometric technologies are used for making individuals accountable through fixing personal identity to the body. Virtual identities and corporate organizations are used for regulating personal accountability through allowing identities to be independent of the body of individuals. Both sets of technologies are being spread globally across a diversity of settings. The result is that the accountability of persons has become a critical problem in the everyday life of human beings across the globe and for the social theory of agency and of personal responsibility. This contribution assesses the impact that these technologies have on the way in which we see ourselves as moral beings. The practices of biometrically identifying persons and of organizing them into corporate bodies, I argue, are not just expressions of dominant tropes of personhood but they play a major role in generating and in sustaining the ways in which persons are recognized, especially by state agencies. Both forms of state practice foster a third-person perspective on personal responsibility as individual accountability and they de-emphasize that humans in their social interaction usually assess responsibility in terms of a first-person perspective (being able to put themselves into the place of others) and in terms of a second-person perspective (defining their own place in their relation to others). Since the practices and technologies in question are universalized and implemented in societies across the globe the perspective taken here is comparative, seeking to document and investigate the ways in which the implementation of technologies that fuel biometric and virtual identities redefine personal responsibility as accountability and form the basis for generating new moral agents.","Widlok, T.",0,,2250

Thus, according to this view it is possible that a lie states something that happens to be true. This subjective view on lying has recently been challenged by Turd and Turd (2015) who presented empirical evidence suggesting that people only consider statements as lies that are objectively false (objective view). We argue that the presented evidence is in fact consistent with the standard subjective view if conversational pragmatics is taken into account. Three experiments are presented that directly test and support the subjective view. An additional experiment backs up our pragmatic hypothesis by using the uncontroversial case of making a promise.

6271,I See What You Mean: How Attentional Selection Is Shaped by Ascribing Intentions to Others,"The ability to understand and predict others' behavior is essential for successful interactions. When making predictions about what other humans will do, we treat them as intentional systems and adopt the intentional stance, i.e., refer to their mental states such as desires and intentions. In the present experiments, we investigated whether the mere belief that the observed agent is an intentional system influences basic social attention mechanisms. We presented pictures of a human and a robot face in a gaze cuing paradigm and manipulated the likelihood of adopting the intentional stance by instruction: in some conditions, participants were told that they were observing a human or a robot, in others, that they were observing a human-like mannequin or a robot whose eyes were controlled by a human. In conditions in which participants were made to believe they were observing human behavior (intentional stance likely) gaze cuing effects were significantly larger as compared to conditions when adopting the intentional stance was less likely. This effect was independent of whether a human or a robot face was presented. Therefore, we conclude that adopting the intentional stance when observing others' behavior fundamentally influences basic mechanisms of social attention. The present results provide striking evidence that high-level cognitive processes, such as beliefs, modulate bottom-up mechanisms of attentional selection in a top-down manner.","Wiese, E.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0045391,2253

6278,,"While no method of studying cultural production can possibly include all the people, practices, and procedures that “make” artistic works possible, dance scholars have yet to centralize dance’s infrastructural politics as a topic of research in its own right. My dissertation project looks at dance “making” – the resourcing, staging, and legitimization of dance performance – as the product of multiple agents and agencies. To flesh out how dance is practically produced through a dynamic network of intermediaries, I combine archival accounts of federal arts policy production at the US National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) with ethnographic research and interviews with lifelong dance “makers,” a large group that includes NEA senior leadership, administrators, citizen advisors, and NEA funded dance presenters, managers, booking agents, artists, and organizers. This emphasis on dance’s many authorial agents protests modernist understandings of the choreographer-as-autonomous producer of dance “texts” through a situated review of how people collectively fashion authorizing rhetorics, programs, and procedures at the NEA and in local, NEA supported dance contexts. I trade close interpretive analysis of dance texts for a processual account of infrastructural “norms” and local translations across the agency’s fifty-year lifespan. By studying dance policy and production enactments together in their cultural situatedness, we can start to notice how institutions function as living infrastructures, shaped by people with differential investments in dance practice and performance. Such an embodied epistemology of infrastructure offers a new topic and frontier of research, driven squarely from the domain of dance studies, with implications across dance, arts, humanities and policy discourse. My project is organized across the NEA’s fifty year history of arts resourcing, regulation, and research by way of three infrastructural movements that I define here in italics. Chapter One addresses how early policy “makers” proceeded to negotiate an influx of economic resourcing through an agency-wide strategy of expansion by partition during the NEA’s first fifteen years of policy production (1965-1980). Chapter Two analyzes the agency’s most massive period of regulation and defunding, known in conventional histories as the so-called “Arts Wars” (1980-1996) to detail infrastructural pressures and regulations that instituted a support system rooted in redistribution and artist estrangement. Chapter Three details efforts to champion art and artists as tools for achieving non-arts policy goals from the turn of the 21st century to the present as a hyper-instrumental turn strongly influenced by governmental rationalism and capital development as political endgames of US federal government writ large. In each chapter I also weigh how NEA funded dance grantees negotiate these changes, in practice. What results is a theory of infrastructure as a living social exercise animated by people with differential investments in the production and distribution of dance.","Wilbur, Sarah Marie",0,,2255
6279,,"This qualitative multi-case study explored undergraduate psychology students’ experiences participating in creative drama activities the instructor/researcher developed to teach psychological concepts. The study was conducted in three introductory and developmental courses in a mid-western community college setting. Participants (cases) included 13 students. Data sources included student-generated documents, researcher field notes and journal entries, and transcripts from individual interviews. Iterative inductive analysis informed by symbolic interactionism revealed a succession of complex, layered, interrelated themes pointing to salient interconnections among students’ thoughts, emotions, physical selves, interactions with others, family and educational histories, and their experiences of the activities. The cases were first analyzed individually and then compared across cases, classes, and data sources. Cross case findings included a series of interconnected touchstones students used in making meaning from the activities; their bodies and thoughts, described sense of self, their experiences with family and education, their interactions with classmates, and their emotions. Students perceived the activities as agents for changing their class experiences, climate and learning. Students’ prior family and learning experiences, particularly traumatic and highly stressful ones, seemed especially salient meaning-making touchstones. An alternative framing of student disengagement as struggles within the academy emerged. Findings suggested that certain pedagogical supports are necessary to implement the activities sensitively which related to the embodiment and relational teaching literature, Schon’s (1983) model of reflective practice, and Huitt’s (2003) Transactional Model of the Teaching Learning Process. These connections emphasized the need for a sense of safety, relational teaching, and reflection which changed aspects of implementing creative drama pedagogy. The document concludes with implications regarding instructor orientation to teaching, curriculum, supporting student learning, and undergraduate psychology education. The appendices include the activities used in the study and suggestions for pedagogical framing.","Wilcox, Ruth A.",0,,2256
6280,Virtual taphonomy: A new method integrating excavation and postprocessing in an archaeological context,"The objective of this paper was to integrate excavation and post-processing of archaeological and osteological contexts and material to enhance the interpretation of these with specific focus on the taphonomical aspects. A method was designed, Virtual Taphonomy, based on the use and integration of image-based 3D modeling techniques into a 3D GIS platform, and tested on a case study. Merging the 3D models and a database directly in the same virtual environment allowed the authors to fully integrate excavation and post-processing in a complex spatial analysis reconnecting contexts excavated on different occasions in the field process. The case study further demonstrated that the method enabled a deeper understanding of the taphonomic agents at work and allowed the construction of a more detailed interpretation of the skeletal remains than possible with more traditional methods. The method also proved to add transparency to the entire research process from field to post-processing and interpretation. Other benefits were the timesaving aspects in documentation, not only in the excavation process but also in post-processing without creating additional costs in material, as the equipment used is available in most archaeological excavations. The authors conclude that this methodology could be employed on a variety of investigations from archaeological to forensic contexts and add significant value in many different respects (for example, detail, objectivity, complexity, time-efficiency) compared to methods currently used.

6282,,"A series of experiments was designed to test the inherent effects of the microfluidic platform on swimming behavior of bacterial cells, specifically Caulobacter crescentus. Although microfluidics have been a boon for microbial research in recent years, limited study has been devoted to the question “is the architecture limiting the motility of the cells?” In Chapter 2, we looked at channel width, media flow rate, and media viscosity. For each parameter, videos of C. crescentus swimming through the channel were captured and analyzed with a combination ImageJ plug-ins and in-house scripts. Swim velocity and the distance between turns were investigated, specifically. Channels with a width of 54 μm and smaller were found to hinder the ability of the cell to travel the full distance between turns and caused a decline in swim velocity. Linear flow rates of the M2G media above 30 μm/s led to an increase in run distance. Swim velocity increased with media flow, even after the subtraction of the background flow. Addition of the thickening agent, Ficoll, led to an initial decrease in run length and swim velocity, as well as a decline over the course of an experiment. Chapter 3 focuses on designing and fabricating more complex microfluidic devices to trap and grow bacterial cells. Single-cell analysis of bacteria by optical microscopy is a powerful tool for the observation of natural heterogeneity in an isogeneic population. Agarose pads have been used extensively to immobilize cells for time-lapse microscopy. However, cells trapped with an agarose pad cannot be imaged for more than ~8 generations. To overcome this limitation, we have developed microfluidic devices that can confine the growth of bacteria in a single dimension with both PDMS and agarose nanochannel arrays. The nanochannel arrays are not irreversibly attached to the device substrate, but can be raised and lowered automatically with the application of vacuum or pressure. The ability to raise and lower the nanochannel array simplifies the immobilization of the cells. The nanochannel arrays have been integrated into a multiplexed format for high-throughput screenings. These devices were used to grow Bacillus subtilis and Caulobacter crescentus for multiple generations. The G1 phase of C. crescentus was measured to be 47 min, or 25% of the cell cycle. A nanochannel array was also integrated into a device with microfluidic valves and pumps. This device was used to stain Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Streptomyces venezuelae with fluorescently labeled D-amino acids (FDAAs) to observe the synthesis of the peptidoglycan cell wall with virtual time-lapse microscopy.","Wilkens, Andrew S.",0,,2258
6283,,"I argue for an overlooked distinction between perceptual presence and volumetric content, and flesh it out in terms of predictive processing. Within the predictive processing framework we can distinguish between agent-active and object-active expectations. The former expectations account for perceptual presence, while the latter account for volumetric content. I then support this position with reference to how experiences of presence are created by virtual reality technologies, and end by reflecting on what this means for the relationship between sensorimotor enactivism and predictive processing.

6284,Robot Faces that Follow Gaze Facilitate Attentional Engagement and Increase Their Likeability,"Gaze behavior of humanoid robots is an efficient mechanism for cueing our spatial orienting, but less is known about the cognitive-affective consequences of robots responding to human directional cues. Here, we examined how the extent to which a humanoid robot (iCub) avatar directed its gaze to the same objects as our participants affected engagement with the robot, subsequent gaze-cueing, and subjective ratings of the robot's characteristic traits. In a gaze-contingent eyetracking task, participants were asked to indicate a preference for one of two objects with their gaze while an iCub avatar was presented between the object photographs. In one condition, the iCub then shifted its gaze toward the object chosen by a participant in 80% of the trials ( joint condition) and in the other condition it looked at the opposite object 80% of the time ( disjoint condition). Based on the literature in human-human social cognition, we took the speed with which the participants looked back at the robot as a measure of facilitated reorienting and robot-preference, and found these return saccade onset times to be quicker in the joint condition than in the disjoint condition. As indicated by results from a subsequent gaze-cueing tasks, the gaze-following behavior of the robot had little effect on how our participants responded to gaze cues. Nevertheless, subjective reports suggested that our participants preferred the iCub following participants' gaze to the one with a disjoint attention behavior, rated it as more human-like and as more likeable. Taken together, our findings show a preference for robots who follow our gaze. Importantly, such subtle differences in gaze behavior are sufficient to influence our perception of humanoid agents, which clearly provides hints about the design of behavioral characteristics of humanoid robots in more naturalistic settings.","Willemse, C.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00070,2260
6287,,"As intelligent agents become integrated into our society, it becomes increasingly important for them to be capable of engaging in natural, human-like human-agent interactions. A key aspect of such interactions is the ability to engage in pragmatically appropriate natural language dialogues. That is, intelligent agents must be able to understand and generate natural language expressions in a way that is sensitive to their current environmental context, social context, and dialogue state. This problem is especially difficult in the uncertain and open worlds common to typical human-robot interaction scenarios, in which a robot cannot be expected to have perfect or complete knowledge of its environment. What is more, many of the approaches that have been developed to facilitate human-robot dialogues are tailored to specific knowledge representation schemes or particular domains of information that prevent them from being generally applicable across robot architectures or across application domains. To address these concerns, I have developed a set of algorithms for understanding and generating natural language in uncertain and open worlds, and a set of general frameworks and architectural mechanisms that allow these algorithms to be agnostic to representational format and application domain whenever possible. The algorithms and architectural mechanisms presented in this dissertation represent an interdisciplinary approach to artificial intelligence, in which cognitive science is drawn upon to provide theoretical frameworks (e.g., Speech Act Theory, the Givenness Hierarchy), and cognitive models (e.g. the Incremental Algorithm), and in which computer science is drawn upon to provide computational frameworks (e.g., Multi-Agent Systems, Integrated Robot Architectures) and techniques (Dempster-Shafer Theory, logical inference, search). In this dissertation, I demonstrate how these algorithms and architectural mechanisms can be integrated into a single natural language processing pipeline within an integrated robot architecture. What is more, I show how this integrated system extends the state of the art in domains such as natural language enabled wheelchairs when implemented on robot hardware.","Williams, Thomas E.",0,,2261
6288,,"This project examined whether interacting with two animated agents in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) could induce cognitive disequilibrium and aid learning among college students. Cognitive disequilibrium is a psychological state that arises when learners face obstacles, contradictions, conflicts, challenges, gaps in pre-existing knowledge, novel and/or difficult problems, and when expectations are violated. The complexity of agents' language and the level of their disagreement were manipulated in order to induce cognitive disequilibrium. It was expected that complex language and disagreement would be related to greater amounts of cognitive disequilibrium and learning. This project also explored whether experiencing cognitive disequilibrium, regardless of how it was induced, influenced learning scientific research methods. It was expected that greater amounts of cognitive disequilibrium would be related to greater learning. A sample of 74 college students (36 males) was used. All participants played a computer game, in which they experienced multiple trials, evaluating research studies and discussing potential research method flaws with the animated agents. Upon completion of the computer game, participants were given a test regarding definitions of the research method concepts (potential flaws) presented in the program. As expected, complex language and disagreement were related to greater cognitive disequilibrium. However, complex language and disagreement were not related to learning. Reading an elaboration paragraph that explained the relevant research method concept reduced cognitive disequilibrium. Interestingly, greater cognitive disequilibrium was related to lower scores on the test, suggesting that cognitive disequilibrium had a negative effect on learning. However, greater reduction in cognitive disequilibrium was related to higher scores on the test, suggesting that as participants engage in more effortful processes to resolve their cognitive disequilibrium, they learn the concept better. Moreover, greater cognitive disequilibrium was related to greater learning within the trials. This suggests that cognitive disequilibrium may activate more effortful processing to better understand the material presented within trials, although this may not transfer to long-term learning.","Wilson, Susan Donna",1,,2262
6289,Humanness beliefs about behavior: An index and comparative human-nonhuman behavior judgments,"Social psychological research suggests that two distinct dimensions describe lay conceptions of humanness: a species-typical sense (i.e., human nature) and a species-unique sense (i.e., human uniqueness). Although these two senses of humanness have been discerned among psychological traits and states, there has been no systematic research into lay beliefs about the humanness of human behaviors. Using a range of 60 prosocial, nonsocial, and antisocial behaviors, it was demonstrated that people discriminate between species-typical and species-unique behaviors and that the capacity to perform species-unique behaviors distinguishes humans from animals, whereas the capacity to perform species-typical behaviors distinguishes humans from robots. Behaviors that exemplify the two senses of humanness are identified, and data representing rankings, raw scores, and z-scores in two indices of species typicality and species uniqueness are provided. Taken together, these findings expand our understanding of lay conceptions of humanness and provide researchers of humanness with a wider range of validated stimuli to probe the boundaries of humanity.","Wilson, S.

6291,Effects of system response delays on elderly humans' cognitive performance in a virtual training scenario,"Observed influences of system response delay in spoken human-machine dialogues are rather ambiguous and mainly focus on perceived system quality. Studies that systematically inspect effects on cognitive performance are still lacking, and effects of individual characteristics are also often neglected. Building on benefits of cognitive training for decelerating cognitive decline, this Wizard-of-Oz study addresses both issues by testing 62 elderly participants in a dialogue-based memory training with a virtual agent. Participants acquired the method of loci with fading instructional guidance and applied it afterward to memorizing and recalling lists of German nouns. System response delays were randomly assigned, and training performance was included as potential mediator. Participants' age, gender, and subscales of affinity for technology (enthusiasm, competence, positive and negative perception of technology) were inspected as potential moderators. The results indicated positive effects on recall performance with higher training performance, female gender, and less negative perception of technology. Additionally, memory retention and facets of affinity for technology moderated increasing system response delays. Participants also provided higher ratings in perceived system quality with higher enthusiasm for technology but reported increasing frustration with a more positive perception of technology. Potential explanations and implications for the design of spoken dialogue systems are discussed.","Wirzberger, M.",0,10.1038/s41598-019-44718-x,2264

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) risk perception was operationalized in terms of plausibility ratings and subjective probability estimates on deceptive Al scenarios developed by Bostrom (2014), in which Al-sided deception is described as a function of intelligence. Machiavellianism and psychopathy predicted narrow Al risk perception above the shared variance of the Dark Triad and above the Big Five. In individuals with self-reported knowledge of machine learning, the Dark Triad traits were associated with AGI risk perception.

6299,Fund Managers-Why the Best Might Be the Worst: On the Evolutionary Vigor of Risk-Seeking Behavior,"This article explores the influence of competitive conditions on the evolutionary fitness of different risk preferences. As a practical example, the professional competition between fund managers is considered. To explore how different settings of competition parameters, the exclusion rate and the exclusion interval, affect individual investment behavior, an evolutionary model is developed. Using a simple genetic algorithm, two attributes of virtual fund managers evolve: the share of capital invested in a risky asset and the amount of excessive risk accepted, where a positive value of the latter parameter points to an inefficient investment portfolio. The simulation experiments illustrate that the influence of competitive conditions on investment behavior and attitudes towards risk is significant. What is alarming is that intense competitive pressure generates risk-seeking behavior and undermines the predominance of the most skilled. In these conditions, evolution does not necessarily select managers with efficient portfolios. These results underline the institutional need for the creation of a competitive framework in which risk-taking does not provide an evolutionary advantage per se, and indicate measures on how to achieve this.","Witte, B.

6300,TESTIMONIO AND SPACES OF RISK A forced migrant perspective,"Asylum seekers and refugees tend to be marginalized in physical and discursive spaces, especially in times that are orchestrated as socially, politically, financially and environmentally risky. This article explores the interrelationship between genre and social space from the perspective of asylum seekers and refugees, and how refugees and asylum seekers in the USA, Germany and Hong Kong exposed spaces of risk through testimonio (testimonio is a genre term used throughout the paper and will be explained later). Asylum seekers and refugees testified to social practices like lengthy asylum processes, immobility, criminalization of asylum seekers, or distrust by locals in virtual space and in face-to-face encounters. Testimonio, thus, reflected on social practices and through this reflection, exposed spaces of risk that threatened the well-being of forced migrants. However, asylum seekers did not dwell in those spaces of risk. By publishing testimonios in virtual environments, some asylum seekers became agents of their biographies and created spaces in which they could voice themselves on their own terms.","Witteborn, S.",0,10.1080/09502386.2011.587881,2267

6305,,"Purpose: The overall purpose of this study was a comparison of radiation exposure for patients and staff during intra-operative imaging for orthopedic lumbar spine surgery. In order to achieve this, we: (1) Characterized each x-ray machine for physics performance, (2) Measured occupational radiation exposure inside the surgical suite for multiple intra-operative imaging devices utilizing currently in place clinical protocols for abdominal/spinal imaging, and (3) Measured specific organ doses for a phantom of three different Body Mass Indices (BMI) for each machine. We also compared the dose changes relative to changes in BMI as well as surgical image quality changes relative to BMI. This served as the majority of the first phase of a two phase project. The purpose of the second phase of the project will be to optimize scan parameters for surgical hardware placement in terms of image quality and organ dose for the devices that allow for modifications of scanner settings. Materials and Methods: (1) X-Ray quality control meters were used to verify particular beam characteristics and additional information was calculated from the beam data. Both a small volume ionization chamber as well as Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) dosimeters were used to validate linear response of new design X-Ray tubes. (2) Both handheld ionization chamber survey meters as well as Geiger-Muller based personal dose meters were used to measure stray radiation for room surveys in locations representative of typical radiation worker positions during intra-operative imaging. (3) MOSFET dosimeters were placed in an adult male anthropomorphic phantom representing a normal BMI. 20 MOSFETs were used in nine organs with two small volume ion chambers used for skin surface dosimetry. Two additional layers of adipose equivalent material were progressively added to the phantom to represent BMI values of overweight and obese. Results: (1) The maximum tube potential, half value layer (HVL), effective energy, and soft tissue f-factor for each machine is as follows: IMRIS VISIUS iCT: 118.4 kVp, 7.66 mm Al, 53.64 keV, and 0.934 cGy/R; Mobis Airo: 122.3 kVp, 7.21 mm Al, 51.31 keV, and 0.925 cGy/R; Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3D: 83 kVp, 7.12 mm Al, 32.76 keV, and 0.914 cGy/R; GE OEC 9900 Elite: 75 kVp, 4.25 mm Al, 46.6 keV, and 0.920 cGy/R. (2) The highest exposure rates measured during clinically implemented protocols for each scanner are as follows: IMRIS VISIUS iCT: 800 mR/hr; Mobis Airo: 6.47 R/hr; Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3D: 26.4 mR/hr. (3) The effective dose per scan of each device for a full lumbar spine scan are as follows, for normal, overweight, and obese BMI, respectively: IMRIS VISIUS iCT: 12.00 ± 0.30 mSv, 15.91 ± 0.75 mSv, and 23.23 ± 0.55 mSv; Mobius Airo: 5.90 ± 0.25 mSv, 4.97 ± 0.12 mSv, and 3.44 ± 0.21 mSv; Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3D: 0.30 ± 0.03 mSv, 0.39 ± 0.02 mSv, and 0.28 ± 0.03 mSv; GE OEC 9900 Elite: 0.44 mSv, 0.77 mSv, and 1.14 mSv. Conclusion: (1) The IMRIS VISIUS iCT i-Fluoro capable CT scanner and Mobius Airo mobile CT scanner have similar beam characteristics with significantly different tube parameter modulation protocols. Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3D and GE OEC 9900 offer comparable beam characteristics but different imaging methods. All scanners performed within factory specifications. (2) The IMRIS VISIUS iCT should not be used in i-Fluoro mode for surgical procedures active during scanning due to the 1.42 cGy/s point dose rate in the beam field. The high exposure rate from the Mobius Airo is offset by short scan times and can be mitigated by ensuring enforcement of currently established radiation protection regulations and policies. Minimal stray radiation is measured from the Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3D. (3) The differences in tube modulation of the CT scanners means the Mobius Airo offers a significantly reduced effective dose with increasing patient BMI over the IMRIS VISIUS iCT. Effective dose from the CT scanners varies as much as one to two orders of magnitude higher than the C Arms, but the Siemen","Womack, Kenneth Roland, II",0,,2269
6306,,"Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) with on-board imaging systems provides updated images of patient anatomy using 2D-radiographic and 3D-CT imaging tools. Images from on-board imaging systems for IGRT are used to setup patients based on internal patient anatomy in most of the institutions and to evaluate patient anatomical variation just before dose delivery. IGRT allows accurate patient setup with smaller margins and lower doses for normal tissue and critical structures. Volumetric cone-beam CT images from IGRT with updated patient anatomy from images used for initial treatment planning can be used to consider anatomical variations and re-plan certain cases with adaptive radiation therapy. In this project, the image quality and dose of radiographic images with therapeutic 250 MeV proton beams from the MEVION-S250 system using Gafchromic films and computed radiographic plates were investigated quantitatively. Proton beams from the MEVION-S250 machine were used to acquire radiographic images of different phantoms that include the Leeds, Catphantom, Las Vegas, anthropomorphic head, and pelvis phantoms. The MEVION system provided a double scattering 250-MeV proton beam shaped with two nozzles (14 and 25cm diameters) and various beam ranges (5–32 cm) and range modulation (2–20 cm). The different testing objects in the Leeds phantom were used to quantify image quality. Imaging quality dependence on dose was quantified using different dose levels (0.1–12 MU). The Leeds phantom was place upstream outside the Bragg peak range while the image receptor either of films or CR-cassettes were placed downstream to measure the exiting protons. Image quality of the proton radiographic images was affected by multiple factors that include: (a) depth in phantom, (b) dose or monitor units (MU) from the proton imaging beam, (c) separation between the phantom and image receptor, (d) beam modulation and (e) beam range. Despite difficulties inherent to proton imaging, it has potential advantages particularly in proton treatment. If a proton beam is used for imaging in a way such that the Bragg Peak were deeper than the object being imaged, the imaging doses could potentially be lower compared to the imaging doses of traditional photon imaging techniques. Proton imaging may also improve proton dose calculations for proton treatment planning in addition to patient positioning accuracy. Image quality of the Leeds phantom improved with depth in phantom as the phantom location approached the Bragg-peak where the best position and contrast resolutions were obtained. As dose increased, image quality improved with better signal to noise ratio particularly at the Bragg-peak. The increased separation between the Leeds phantom and imaging plates leads to increased scatter or bending of the proton beam which degraded the image quality of the proton radiographic images. Short beam ranges and wider modulations improved image quality as the phantom became closer to or within the spread-out Bragg-peak, respectively. In conclusion, this study investigated quantitatively the dependence of image quality on different parameters including phantom depth, separation between the phantom and image receptor, range and modulation of high energy therapeutic proton beam. Radiographic proton images were feasible for clinical applications and had comparable image quality to kV-diagnostic photon images. The imaging doses deposited from the proton beams were comparable to or up to 15% lower than the imaging dose deposited by clinically used photon imaging techniques used for image-guided radiation therapy from the on-board imaging system.","Wright, Giles",0,,2270

The study aims to develop and examine the determinants of enterprise blog (E-Blog) adoption for the service industry Organization size is used as a moderating factor to disclose its influence on the effects of the variables. Design/methodology/approach - The research model of the empirical study integrates three composites: social exchange theory, innovation diffusion theory and organization dynamics. For the results, data are analyzed by using factor analysis to derive the actual composites and structural equation model to test the hypotheses. Findings - The main results show the following findings. First, social exchange via E-Blog fosters enterprise reputation. Second, enterprises are doubtful whether they can build online relationships via E-Blog with their customers and E-Blog visitors. Third, virtual trust and the unknown virtual social structure are barriers for enterprises in using E-Blog. Fourth, E-Blog adopters are likely to be purpose-sensitive as the numbers of blog type increase. Practical implications - The research findings reveal that E-Blog vendors and agents should emphasize reputation development to attract the attention of their customers (enterprises). In addition, small- to medium-sized enterprises prefer the relative advantages and simplicity of E-Blogging. In contrast, large enterprises are more concerned with competition pressure and market dynamics involved in the adoption attitude. These findings would be useful for E-Blog service providers to analyze the requirements of their customers. In addition, E-Blog vendors and agents should persuade enterprises adopting E-Blog to ease competition pressure, particularly for large firms who have not adopted the technology. Finally, E-Blog platforms and vendors should emphasize that E-Blog can help increase reputation by attracting the attention of enterprises to adopt E-Blogging. Originality/value - In the virtual socialization process, the blog has been developing its own characteristics that are linked to social behaviour. This link explains social change and stability in cyberspace from the social psychology and sociology points of view. The research findings differ from those of previous research because early studies focused on individual Internet user blog participation without placing emphasis on the adoption intention of enterprises. The findings of this study will be helpful for both E-Blog service providers and enterprises.","Wu, C. H.",0,10.1108/10662241311331736,2272

6316,,"Part A: Antimalarial Agents modified at the C-16 position of Artemisinin. Malaria is a widespread tropical and subtropical parasitic disease which is caused by malarial parasites and transmitted by the infected anopheles mosquitoe. The natural product artemisinin and its derivatives are currently considered the most effective drugs against drug resistant plasmodium falciparum. However, its undesired physicochemical proprieties have limited its usage. In order to improve its effectiveness, scientists around the world have developed novel methodology to synthesize artemisinin derivatives on different positions of the artemisinin skeleton. Previous work in our group has shown that many analogues modified at the C-16 of artemisinin had improved efficacy along with modified physicochemical proprieties. This work focuses on the synthesis of heteroatomic and heterocyclic derivatives of artemisinin with the emphasis on C-16 substituted triazole containing side-chains. Successful synthetic results and subsequent bioassay demonstrated that the compounds have modest antimalarial activity compared to artemisinin and improved water solubility. With these encouraging results in hand, further work is underway to tune the desired physicochemical properties so that plasma half-life and oral bioavailability will be improved. Part B: Lead Optimization of Falcipain-2 and Falcipain-3 Inhibitors. The expanding usage of artemisinin combination therapy casts concern about the potential development of drug resistance to this drug family, thus the search for new drug targets is always needed. Falcipain-2 (FP-II) and falcipain-3 (FP-III) are two cysteine proteases which malarial parasites utilize to degrade hemoglobin to obtain amino acids essential to the parasite. The inhibition of these two enzymes has been shown to have deadly effects on the protozoan life cycle. Recently published crystal structures of FP-II provided an outstanding opportunity for rational drug design and discovery. In the present study, structure-based optimization of virtual screening hits was carried out using scaffold hopping, docking and analogue synthesis. Unfortunately, the biological evaluation of the synthesized compounds against FP-II and FP-III indicated these compounds are inactive. However, the information gained from this exercise could aid further in optimization of this series of compounds.","Wu, Yunshan",0,,2276

The probability limit theory, the algebra graph theory, and some other techniques are employed to derive the necessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing the mean square bounded consensus tracking. It turns out that the maximum allowable sampling period depends on not only the network topology but also the constant feedback gains. Furthermore, the effects of the sampling period on tracking performance, including the tracking speed and the static tracking error, are also analyzed. The results show that reducing the sampling period can accelerate the tracking speed and decrease the static tracking error.

6321,"A computer-aided coloring method for virtual agents based on personality impression, color harmony, and designer preference","Endowing virtual agents with desired personality impression is one of the most important considerations when designers create agents. Color appearance of agents has been suggested to be able to convey personality impression but how to design the right color appearance to obtain the desired personality impression is still a challenge to unexperienced designers, since they have little information on how colors evoke personality impression; moreover, the design become more difficult when multiple design goals need to be considered simultaneously. To respond to the challenge, we propose an automated method for creating color appearance of agents using a multi-objective interactive genetic algorithm. The method can automatically generate the desired color appearance that can convey desired personality impression, has harmonious color combinations, and express designers' preference. The experimental results show that our method can lower the barrier for designers and speed up the design process.","Wu, Z. M.",0,10.1016/j.ergon.2018.09.003,2278
6324,Predicting personality associations evoked by multicolored appearance of virtual agents: An exploratory study,"Designing agents' color appearance that can evoke desired color-personality associations (CPAs) is still a challenge. To respond to the challenge, this study proposed a multicolor personality index (MCPI) model to predict the CPAs evoked by agents using the color-personality indices for single colors together with the histogram of agents' image. Specifically, the color personality index for each bin of an agent's histogram was first calculated based on the color-personality indices for single colors; then, the predicted values of CPAs were obtained by calculating the weighted average of color-personality indices of all bins in the histogram. To improve the MCPI model, a simple color-attention index model was proposed to evaluate the effects of color on attention and the effects were introduced into the MCPI model, that is, the multi-color personality index based on color attention (MCPI-CA) model. To validate the two models, an experiment was conducted to collect the CPAs of five traits (i.e., extraverted-introverted, moody-unemotional, agreeable-disagreeable, organized-disorganized, and wide interests-narrow interests) evoked by the multi-colored appearance of agents. The results showed that (a) observers in general perceived the CPAs evoked by color appearance in similar way; (b) for most agents, the CPAs evoked by multi-colored appearance could be predicted well by the MCPI model; and (c) the MCPI-CA model usually had better performance than the MCPI model due to the inclusion of the effects of color attributes on attention. In addition, the limitations of the proposed models and their implications for designers were also discussed.","Wu, Z. M.",0,10.1002/col.22154,2279

The paradigm comprised a non-verbal Turing test with a humanoid robot. A ""programmed"" condition differed from a ""human-controlled"" condition by onset times of the robot's eye movements, which were either fixed across trials or modeled after prerecorded human reaction times, respectively. Participants judged whether the robot behavior was programmed or human-controlled, with no information regarding the differences between respective conditions. Autistic traits were measured with the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) questionnaire in healthy adults. We found that the fewer autistic traits participants had, the more sensitive they were to the difference between the conditions, without explicit awareness of the nature of the difference. We conclude that although sensitivity to fine behavioral characteristics of others varies with social aptitude, humans are in general capable of detecting human-like behavior based on very subtle cues.","Wykowska, A.",0,10.1075/is.16.2.09wyk,2280
6332,,"The ability to modulate protein function using exogenous small molecules is a longstanding goal in chemical biology. Selective activation or inhibition of a particular protein function can help elucidate crucial molecular mechanisms and enables important advances in cell biology. Small-molecule controlled molecular systems also possess tremendous value in bioengineering and biomedical applications: activation of protein function allows the construction of protein switches and biosensor proteins, whereas inhibition of protein function contributes to the development of novel therapeutic agents. The discovery of small-molecule modulators of function is greatly aided by computational modeling methodologies. By utilizing structural information obtained through X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, these tools allow efficient and affordable examination of large small-molecule databases and provide quantitative evaluation of the likelihood that a given protein-ligand interaction occurs. Advances in computer algorithms and hardware development continue to accelerate and scale up the computation and lower the cost of this discovery process. The primary focus of this thesis is the development of structure-based computer-aided methodologies for designing small-molecule modulators of protein function. To this end I explored two parallel paths, one to study activation and one to study inhibition of protein functions. Taken together, my work aims to not only apply rational design strategies to specific proteins, but also demonstrate their general applicability. The first project, focused on activation of protein function, is built on an approach developed by our laboratory that designs a de novo allosteric binding site directly into the catalytic domain of an enzyme. This approach achieves modulation of function by a novel ""chemical rescue of structure approach"": a tryptophan-to-glycine mutation disrupts local structure and induces conformational changes that distort the geometry at the active site; the subsequent binding of exogenous indole then reverts this conformational change and restores the native enzyme structure. The main challenge of generalizing this approach, however, is the difficulty of rationally designing analogous conformational changes in other proteins. It is therefore important to study the possible mechanisms that can be utilized by chemical rescue of structure. Through collaborative and multidisciplinary efforts, we find that the switchable proteins built via the chemical rescue of structure are frequently controlled indirectly by modulating protein stability, rather than discrete conformational changes. Since energetic evaluation of protein stability is far more tractable than designing and/or predicting allosteric conformational changes, this finding demonstrates how chemical rescue of structure can be applied to other systems for building a variety of new protein switches. To further generalize the applicability of chemical rescue of structure, I sought to extend it to include multiple amino acids, rather than just one. I chose ChxR, a homodimeric response regulator in Chlamydia, as the model protein to examine the feasibility of this strategy. I mutated a pair of tryptophans at the dimer interface to glycine in order to disrupt the dimerization of ChxR. To enable the subsequent functional rescue, I used the removed structural elements as a template for ligand-based virtual screening and discovered a set of candidate small molecules that mimic the three-dimensional geometry and chemical properties of the removed chemical moieties. Biophysical characterization of these compounds suggests that the majority of them selectively bind to the engineered ChxR variant. This observation shows promises in extending this generalized design strategy to allow alternate activating ligands. In parallel to these efforts I carried out studies aimed at inhibition of protein function, as exemplified by my project that uses small molecules to disrupt a protein-RNA interaction.

6334,,"Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer and accounts for the majority of skin cancer death. Although considerable advances have been made in melanoma treatment in recent years, there are many problems associated with current therapies. Drug resistance to targeted therapies is almost inevitable after short term treatment. Immunotherapies generally have low response rate and the effects vary among patients. Therefore, the need to develop new and more effective treatment for melanoma is high. The work presented here focuses on discovery of novel anticancer agents for melanoma by targeting two important cancer targets: tubulin and survivin. Microtubules play important role in mitosis and cell division. Cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, and thus are more sensitive to tubulin targeting agents which disrupt mitosis. Targeting tubulin for anticancer treatment has been very successful. Chapter 3 describes our discovery process of a series of novel tubulin polymerization inhibitors. Our lab previously reported a set of 2-aryl-4-benzoyl-imidazoles (ABI) derivatives with potent anti-proliferative activity against melanoma cells and xenografts. A new series of 4-aryl-2-benzoyl-imidazoles were designed and synthesized after further optimization of the ABI series. The new scaffold reversed the position of the aryl group and benzoyl group on the imidazole ring of ABI structure and thus was named RABI. Those newly synthesized compounds were tested against eight different cancer cells, including multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines. The in vitro results showed that several compounds in this series had excellent anti-proliferative activities. The best compound displayed IC50 value in single-digit nano-molar against several tumor cell lines. In addition, RABI compounds showed advantages in overcoming multiple drug resistance, compared with existing tubulin targeting agents, paclitaxel, colchicine, and vinblastine. Mechanism of action for the RABI compounds was investigated using cell cycle analysis, tubulin polymerization assay, competitive mass spectrometry binding assay, and molecular docking studies. These studies suggested that RABI compounds exerted their anticancer effects by inhibiting tubulin polymerization at the colchicine binding site. The RABI compounds represent promising cancer drug candidates for further development. Another attractive target for anticancer treatment is survivin. The differential expression of survivin between normal differentiated cells and tumor cells and the essential role of survivin in tumor make it an ideal target for cancer. Although survivin is an attractive cancer drug target, the pool of existing survivin inhibitors is quite limited. Thus, it is highly significant to develop new survivin inhibitors. Our attempts to search for new survivin inhibitors were initiated by the identification of UC-112 which turned out to be a potent and selective survivin inhibitor. UC-112 was discovered through virtual screening from a library of compounds. It showed good potency both in vitro and in vivo. Structural modifications of the UC-112 oxyquinoline template generated a number of UC-112 analogs. The new analogs were tested on a panel of cancer cell lines. The results suggested that the new derivatives had strong anticancer activity. Several compounds showed IC 50 value in the nano-molar range. The structure-activity relationships were also elucidated through the structural modifications. Our best compounds along with UC-112 were submitted for NCI-60 cancer cell line screening. The results from the screening indicated the best compound in this series improved potency in terms of GI50. The most potent compound also showed good drug-like properties. Mechanism of action for the UC-112 analogs was investigated using Western blot and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay. This set of compounds selectively inhibited the expression of survivin over other IAP proteins and also protected survivin from digestion by pronase in the DARTS assay.

6340,,"The Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm was proposed more than two decades ago to understand humans’ interaction with computer technologies. Today, as emerging media technologies including social robots and smartphones become more personal and persuasive, questions of how users respond to them socially, what individual factors leverage the relationship, and what constitutes the social influence of these technologies need to be addressed. As an expansion of the CASA paradigm, the Media are Social Actors (MASA) paradigm was applied in the current dissertation to understand users’ social perception, social attitudes, and social behavior in their interactions with humanoid social robots and smartphones. Two lab experiments with between-subjects factorial design were conducted. A total of 110 participants were asked to interact with a humanoid social robot and a smartphone respectively in a socio-emotional context and a task-oriented context. Four pairs of social cues were compared to understand their influence on users’ anthropomorphism of the technologies. Multivariate analyses and textual analyses were conducted. Results suggested that users developed more trust in the social robot with a human voice than with a synthetic voice. Users also developed more intimacy and more interest in the social robot when the robot was paired with humanlike gestures. However, individual differences such as users’ attitudes toward robots, robot use experiences, and suspension of disbelief affected users’ psychological responses to the social robot. Although users’ responses to the smartphone did not vary based on the language styles and the modalities, factors such as individuals’ intensive smartphone use, mobile use habits, and their source orientation and re-orientation moderated the social influence of the smartphone. The dissertation has theoretical value in expanding the CASA paradigm to social robots and smartphones. It also tests the validity of the propositions of the MASA paradigm. The results can lead to more comprehensive, nuanced, and exciting discoveries of the social implications, ethical implications, and practical guides of using these emerging media technologies in the future.","Xu, Kun",0,,2284

For each moment, the user's behavior is not only determined by the actions of the robot that they are directly gazing at, but also shaped by the behaviors from all the other robots in the shared environment. We define cooperative behavior as the action performed by the robots that are not capturing the user's direct attention. In this paper, we are interested in how the human participants adjust and coordinate their own behavioral cues when the robot agents are performing different cooperative gaze behaviors. A novel gaze-contingent platform was designed and implemented. The robots' behaviors were triggered by the participant's attentional shifts in real time. Results showed that the human participants were highly sensitive when the robot agents were performing different cooperative gazing behaviors.","Xu, T.",0,10.1075/is.14.3.05xu,2285

Advances in neuroscience, psychology and ethology made it possible to refine the defined functions of empathy to reach a working definition and a model of empathy. Recently, cognitive science and artificial intelligence communities made attempts to model empathy in artificial agents, which can provide means to test these models and hypotheses. A computational model of empathy not only would help to advance the technological artifacts to be more socially compatible, but also understand the empathy mechanisms, test theories, and address the ethics and morality problems the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community is facing today. In this paper, we will review the empathy research from various fields, gather the requirements for empathic capacity and construct a model of empathy that is suitable for interactive conversational agents.","Yalcin, O.

6346,The impact of Google Neural Machine Translation on Post-editing by student translators,"The author of this study used the design of a 2014 experiment that investigated college students' post-editing potential. The raw Google statistical machine translation (SMT) used in the 2014 experiment was replaced with the raw Google neural machine translation (NMT) of the same source text. A comparison of the results of the two studies yielded the following observations: 1) A quantitative evaluation of post-editing (PE) showed no significant difference in cognitive effort between the studies, but a significant difference in the amount of editing was observed. Overall, NMT+PE is better than SMT+PE in terms of its final product, which contains fewer errors; however, NMT+PE does not empower college students to meet professional standards of translation quality. 2) Students exhibit a poorer error correction rate in the NMT+PE condition despite similar perceived cognitive effort, which is possibly related to NMT producing human-like errors that make it more difficult for students to post-edit. 3) NMT+PE requires almost the same competence as translating a text 'from scratch' or editing human translation. Therefore, translation training is necessary for students to be able to shift their attention to the right problems (such as mistranslation) and be effective post-editors. The results of this study suggest that the more advanced, human-like translation abilities of NMT make it even more challenging for student translators to meet a professional standard of post-editing quality.","Yamada, M.",0,,2287
6347,"Categorization difficulty is associated with negative evaluation in the ""uncanny valley"" phenomenon","Human observers often experience strongly negative impressions of human-like objects falling within a particular range of visual similarity to real humans (the uncanny valley phenomenon). We hypothesized that negative impressions in the uncanny valley phenomenon are related to a difficulty in object categorization. We produced stimulus images by morphing two of each of real, stuffed, and cartoon human face images (Experiment 1). Observers were asked to categorize each of these images as either category and evaluated the likability of the image. The results revealed that the longest latency, the highest ambiguity in categorization, and the lowest likability score co-occurred at consistent morphing percentages. Similar results were obtained even when we employed stimulus images that were created by morphing two of each of real, stuffed, and cartoon dog images (Experiment 2). However, the effect of categorization difficulty on evaluation was weak when two real human faces were morphed (Experiment 3). These results suggest that the difficulty in categorizing an object as either of two dissimilar categories is linked to negative evaluation regardless of whether the object is human-related or not.","Yamada, Y.",0,10.1111/j.1468-5884.2012.00538.x,2288
6350,,"Human-like bipedal walking is a goal of humanoid robotics. It is especially important to provide a robust falling prevention capability by imitating the human ability to switch between control strategies in response to disturbances, e.g., standing balancing and stepping motion. However, the motion control of a humanoid robot is challenging because the contact forces are constrained. This paper proposes a novel framework for control strategy switching based on the maximal output admissible (MOA) set, which is a set of initial states that satisfy the constraints. This makes it possible to determine whether the robot might fall down due to a constraint violation. The MOA set is extended to a trajectory tracking controller with a time-variant reference and constraint. In this extension, the motion of the vertical center of gravity is also considered, which has often been neglected in previous studies. Utilizing the MOA set, an example is shown of the falling prevention control by switching the standing balance control and trajectory tracking control to a stepping and hopping motion. Moreover, a method is presented for applying the MOA set framework to a position-controlled humanoid robot. The validity of the MOA set framework is verified based on simulations and experimental results.

6357,The highly intelligent virtual agents for modeling financial markets,"Researchers have borrowed many theories from statistical physics, like ensemble, Ising model, etc., to study complex adaptive systems through agent-based modeling. However, one fundamental difference between entities (such as spins) in physics and micro-units in complex adaptive systems is that the latter are usually with high intelligence, such as investors in financial markets. Although highly intelligent virtual agents are essential for agent-based modeling to play a full role in the study of complex adaptive systems, how to create such agents is still an open question. Hence, we propose three principles for designing high artificial intelligence in financial markets and then build a specific class of agents called iAgents based on these three principles. Finally, we evaluate the intelligence of iAgents through virtual index trading in two different stock markets. For comparison, we also include three other types of agents in this contest, namely, random traders, agents from the wealth game (modified on the famous minority game), and agents from an upgraded wealth game. As a result, iAgents perform the best, which gives a well support for the three principles.

Compared with traditional online shopping that is navigated by point and click, shopping with virtual assistant resembles the dialogical communication process between humans, allowing consumers to place an order by talking or texting. My dissertation research explores how different types of interaction modes will influence consumer's product decisions while shopping online. I propose that engaging in voice-based interactions will promote consumers choosing more recommended products. This is because oral communication carries more social functions than text-based communication and click-based interaction, and this social inclination will evoke people's anthropomorphism tendency. Accordingly, they tend to think their communication partner is a social actor rather than a computer. As a result, they will be more likely to comply with the request by choosing the recommended product. In addition, I argue that this effect only exists in two-way dialogical communication, where people can get social responses from the computer reciprocally and diminishes in one-way monological communication, where the social responses from the computer are missing. This is because social interaction is two-way in nature, while one-way communication will create social distance and undermine the social bonds between communicators. Thus, it suggests that people rely on the entire interaction process to infer the computer's social identity. An online food ordering website is developed and utilized to test the hypotheses. This website manipulates both user's communication modality (i.e., speak vs. click vs. type) and computer's response modality (i.e., synthesized voice vs. interactive text vs. non-social response) to allow participants to interact with using different modalities. Five studies have been conducted with responses from more than 3,200 MTurk workers. Results from those studies lend support to the hypotheses.","Yang, Zhen",0,,2292

This study provides an exploratory examination of knowledge dissemination in teacher education and analyzes mechanisms for, challenges to, and influences on the use of research literature with pre-service teachers. It contributes to scholarship by providing new knowledge about how teacher education faculty use the dissemination mechanism of course syllabi to share research-based literature with their graduate-level pre-service teachers and provides an account of current teacher education faculty practice in New York State. Qualitative analysis is used to examine course syllabi from selected New York State graduate-level pedagogical methodology courses and interviews with a sub-set of the teacher education faculty who authored and implemented those syllabi. Just over 75% of faculty participants assigned at least one piece of research literature on their syllabi, representing a strong majority. However, the study reveals a collection of varied orientations, definitions, and motivations concerning the assignment of research literature among the methodology course instructors. Strikingly, faculty had almost no overlap in the assignment of specific research-based literature on their syllabi, particularly when looking across content areas. Implications for theory and practice include the role of teacher educators as “linking agents” between researchers and P-12 classroom teachers, and the role doctoral preparation and departmental structure may play in the socializing, and thus decision-making, of teacher education faculty.","Yannuzzi, Leigh",0,,2293

6365,,"Resource management, including channel (time-spectrum pair) assignment, power allocation and hardware management etc., plays a key role in the operation of wireless systems. To efficiently operate the system, the resources need to be jointly managed by proper approaches. Specifically, this thesis considers four resource management problems in two parts with approaches ranging from theoretical analysis, optimization to deep learning. In the first part, we consider the management of spectrum resource in cellular systems. Firstly, we investigate the spectrum allocation in device-to-device (D2D) underlaid cellular networks. Reusing the spectrum of cellular links, the underlaid D2D communications is expected to greatly improve the throughput of the cellular system. To identify the benefits of D2D communication, we systematically analyze the distributions of the interferences in the system. Based on the analysis, we propose a guard-zone based mode selection scheme for the potential D2D links and analyze the throughput of the system with respect to the guard zone size. Analysis results show that with proper configuration of guard-zone, which can be efficiently obtained by the proposed method, the throughput can be significantly improved compared to conventional cellular systems. Secondly, we study the power allocation and downlink beamformer design in massive MIMO systems with optimization technique. The large number of antennas in the massive MIMO system renders the existing signal-processing algorithms incapable of real-time beamforming. To this end, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to enable fast optimization of beamformer design with the help of the uplink-downlink duality. By simulations, we show the proposed algorithm significantly outperfoms the existing ones in both computational complexity order and convergence speed. In the second part, we study the power resource management problems. In our third work, we consider the spectrum allocation problem in virtualized Cloud Radio Access Networks (CRAN) with pricing and optimization approaches. Due to the highly self-interested nature of the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) and the Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO), we formulate the spectrum allocation as a two-level problem, of which the upper level is a spectrum leasing problem and the lower level is an optimization problem of channel-allocation. To provide fast overall solution in large CRAN, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to solve the lower level problem and two efficient algorithms to solve the upper level problem in different cases. As shown above, resource management in wireless systems conventionally resort to theoretical analysis and optimization, of which the theoretical analysis relies on well characterized models of channel information, user distribution etc., and the optimization focuses on very short time and incurs intense computation overhead. However, due to the rich randomness in wireless systems, these models are approximations of real distributions in most cases. Moreover, in many complicated scenarios, model is unavailable. On the other hand, in many cases, we need to consider the resource management in a much larger time scale than that of optimization problems. In such cases, a better alternative is the learning based approach, whose application feasibility have been greatly enhanced thanks to the recent advance in deep learning. In our fourth work, we study the power saving problem in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet). Power consumption becomes a significant problem as the number of Small Base Stations (SBS) increases in order to support the unprecedented data traffic in cellular HetNet.

6371,,"The goal of this thesis is to synthesize believable motions of a character interacting with its surroundings and manipulating objects through physical contacts and forces. Human-like autonomous avatars are in increasing demand in areas such as entertainment, education, and health care. Yet modeling the basic human motor skills of locomotion and manipulation remains a long-standing challenge in animation research. The seemingly simple tasks of navigating an uneven terrain or grasping cups of different shapes involve planning with complex kinematic and physical constraints as well as adaptation to unexpected perturbations. Moreover, natural movements exhibit unique personal characteristics that are complex to model. Although motion capture technologies allow virtual actors to use recorded human motions in many applications, the recorded motions are not directly applicable to tasks involving interactions for two reasons. First, the acquired data cannot be easily adapted to new environments or different tasks goals. Second, acquisition of accurate data is still a challenge for fine scale object manipulations. In this work, we utilize data to create natural looking animations, and mitigate data deficiency with physics-based simulations and numerical optimizations. We develop algorithms based on a single reference motion for three types of control problems. The first problem focuses on motions without contact constraints. We use joint torque patterns identified from the captured motion to simulate responses and recovery of the same style under unexpected pushes. The second problem focuses on locomotion with foot contacts. We use contact forces to control an abstract dynamic model of the center of mass, which sufficiently describes the locomotion task in the input motion. Simulation of the abstract model under unexpected pushes or anticipated changes of the environment results in responses consistent with both the laws of physics and the style of the input. The third problem focuses on fine scale object manipulation tasks, in which accurate finger motions and contact information are not available. We propose a sampling method to discover contact relations between the hand and the object from only the gross motion of the wrists and the object. We then use the abundant contact constraints to synthesize detailed finger motions. The algorithm creates finger motions of various styles for a diverse set of object shapes and tasks, including ones that are not present at capture time. The three algorithms together control an autonomous character with dexterous hands to interact naturally with a virtual world. Our methods are general and robust across character structures and motion contents when testing on a wide variety of motion capture sequences and environments. The work in this thesis brings closer the motor skills of a virtual character to its human counterpart. It provides computational tools for the analysis of human biomechanics, and can potentially inspire the design of novel control algorithms for humanoid robots.","Ye, Yuting",0,,2297
6372,,"There have been many endeavors to design humanoid robots that have human characteristics such as dexterity, autonomy and intelligence. Humanoid robots are intended to cooperate with humans and perform useful work that humans can perform. The main advantage of humanoid robots over other machines is that they are flexible and multi-purpose. In this thesis, a human-like robotic arm is designed and used in a task which is typically performed by humans, namely, catching a ball. The robotic arm was designed to closely resemble a human arm, based on anthropometric studies. A rigid multibody dynamics software was used to create a virtual model of the robotic arm, perform experiments, and collect data. The inverse kinematics of the robotic arm was solved using a Newton-Raphson numerical method with a numerically calculated Jacobian. The system was validated by testing its ability to find a kinematic solution for the catch position and successfully catch the ball within the robot's workspace. The tests were conducted by throwing the ball such that its path intersects different target points within the robot's workspace. The method used for determining the catch location consists of finding the intersection of the ball's trajectory with a virtual catch plane. The hand orientation was set so that the normal vector to the palm of the hand is parallel to the trajectory of the ball at the intersection point and a vector perpendicular to this normal vector remains in a constant orientation during the catch. It was found that this catch orientation approach was reliable within a 0.35 x 0.4 meter window in the robot's workspace. For all tests within this window, the robotic arm successfully caught and dropped the ball in a bin. Also, for the tests within this window, the maximum position and orientation (Euler angle) tracking errors were 13.6 mm and 4.3 degrees, respectively. The average position and orientation tracking errors were 3.5 mm and 0.3 degrees, respectively.

In order for the FC model to be effective, it is important for the student to have self-regulation skills. It is especially important that students have advanced self-regulatory skills so that the online learning process of the FC model can be successfully completed. It is believed that the metacognitive support (MS) provided by the pedagogical agent during the online process of the FC model will contribute to the development of self-regulation skills of the students. The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of MS via pedagogical agent in the FC model on students' self-regulation skills.The research was carried out according to experimental design, and the participants of the research consist of 102 university students. The data of the study were collected using self-regulated learning scale. As a result of the research, it was seen that the students of the experimental group who were provided MS with the pedagogic agent were found to have a statistically significant higher level of self-regulation skills than the control group students who were not provided with MS. Several suggestions have been made for the use of pedagogical agent-assisted MS in the design of FC courses.","Yilmaz, F. G. K.",1,10.1177/0735633117707696,2301
6382,"Educational interface agents as social models to influence learner achievement, attitude and retention of learning","This study examined the impacts of educational interface agents with different attributes on achievement, attitude and retention of elementary school students in their science and technology courses. The study was implemented in four different eighth- grade classes (aged 13-14) of an elementary school. Four different types of educational software, covering living things and life unit of 8th graders, were developed to analyze the impacts of educational software agents with different attributes on the results of learning. The study was conducted according to experimental model with pretest and posttest control group, which is one of the quasi-experimental designs. For five consecutive weeks experimental and control group students used the software designed for this research. The students were asked to fill an attitude scale on science and technology both before and after the implementation. And following completion, an achievement test was applied. The results of the study revealed that students who used a human-like educational interface agent were more successful than both the rest of the experimental groups and the control group in terms of achievement, attitude and retention of learning in science and technology classes. It is also revealed that the software to be developed for elementary school 8th graders (aged 13-14) should be supported with human-like educational interface agents. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

6384,,"Affective experience plays an important role in human-computer interaction and many other emerging areas as it greatly facilitates the ability of computers to heed the rules of human communication. For example, affective experience prediction using different input modalities measured from an individual such as their facial expression or physiological signals has received substantial research attention in recent years. In addition, affective behavior animation from a single image received huge rising interest due to its wide application in computer games, animated feature films, and agent-based system. In this thesis, we define affective pose as the multimodal expression of emotion. We present a multimodal approach to simultaneously analyze facial movements and several peripheral physiological signals to decode individualized affective responses under positive and negative emotional contexts. Facial movement is represented using a robust head vs. 3D face landmark localization and tracking approach, and physiological data are processed by extracting known attributes related to the underlying affective experience. The dynamical coupling between different input modalities is then assessed through the extraction of several complex recurrent network metrics. Inference models are then trained using these metrics as features to predict an individual's affective valence experience in a given context. We validated our approach using a multimodal dataset consists of (i) facial videos and (ii) several peripheral physiological signals. The affective experience prediction results signified that our multimodal fusion method improves the prediction accuracy up to 19\% when compared to the prediction using only one or a subset of the input modalities. Furthermore, we adopted a linear blendshape model to apply facial animation to a character based on the analysis of facial expression. To generate smooth imitation for sequential frames, we applied a median filter through time. Finally, we discussed the limitation and possible solutions of our facial animation approaches. Our main contributions in this work are multifold: (1) extracted features from facial landmarks by employing a 3D model, which decouples head motion from face expression; (2) extracted relevant features for each physiological signal automatically and reliably, and provided an open-source biosignal-specific tool to process 5 types of biosignals (e.g. ECG, EMG, EDA, ICG and BP), all in one easy-to-use, MATLAB based toolbox; (3) applied a novel multimodal feature fusion approach based on recurrence network for affective experience decoding; and (4) adopted a linear blendshape model to apply facial expression animation.","Yin, Yu",0,,2303
6385,,"This thesis proposes a new methodology for modeling road networks at the geometric level, with the purpose to reproduce real-world road networks with an appropriate level of accuracy as well as a low level of workload. After evaluating existing data sources and road network extraction approaches, coarse scale aerial images are selected as data sources of road networks on the 2D x-y plane. An image processing model is proposed to perform road categorization, road segmentation, and road segment centerline extraction on aerial images. The third component: elevation, which cannot be extracted from aerial images, is obtained from another data source: GIS, a MASS public geospatial database. At the topological level, this thesis introduces topological structures to store all information about the virtual environment. Two inter-connected topological structures are proposed: 1) global topological structure and 2) local topological structure. Each component of the road network such as road segments, intersections, bridges, etc. is represented as a node in the global topological structure. Connectivity and traffic information is stored at the global level. For each global topological node, a local topological structure is associated. Each component of the global node is represented as a node in the local topological structure. Information about the local driving environment such as signs, obstacles, etc. is stored at the local level topological structure. The idea of having topological structures at different levels enables autonomous objects to plan and follow its global route in the road network with ability to react to its instantaneous local driving conditions. The issue of implementing autonomous traffic is then addressed. A combination of a perception model, a communication model and a decision-making model is implemented to achieve the goal of modeling autonomous objects that behave intelligently. All models are attached to autonomous objects that represent people and vehicles in a virtual environment. This enables such an autonomous object to be an independent entity that is self-motivated and self-controlled. The perception model enables autonomous agents to perceive their instant driving situation. Autonomous agents communicate with other autonomous objects via their communication model and the decision-making model relies on the perception model and the communication model to investigate possible outcomes before making decisions. The communication model defines senders, receivers, contents, and channels (media through which content is transferred) in real-time to gather desired information from specified objects. The decision-making model is divided into two levels, the global level and the local level. These work, respectively, with environmental information perceived by the perception model and traffic information received by the communications model. A group of logic rules are formulated as decision trees to model the process of making decisions on the basis of real-time activities. A database is used to store both geometric and topological information about the virtual environment. All information is then loaded into in-memory arrays for real-time access and update. Triggers and Colliders, which are attached to all simulated objects, are adopted in this project to update dynamic arrays in all events. Also, triggers and colliders play key roles in designing repeatable driving scenarios. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)","Yin, Zhishuai",0,,2304
6386,Random encounters in probabilistic time geography,"Probabilistic time geography considers the encounter of moving agents to be random; therefore, a quantitative time geography analysis must consider the actual encounter probability. The existing algorithm of encounter probability is oriented over a discrete space and is sensitive to the unit definition of a virtual grid; thus, it is not suitable for continuous space. For this reason, a new method is presented in this paper for the encounter of two moving agents in continuous space. When the encounters are less than a specified distance threshold apart, an encounter event occurs based on the probability of the product, which is calculated by their respective probability density functions over their respective potential location areas. This probability provides a quantitative basis for predicting the likelihood of two agents meeting, as well as the location of this meeting point. Finally, the validity of the proposed model is verified by an experiment, which uses tracking data to calculate the encounter probabilities of three zebras and analyse the distribution characteristics of these probabilities over time and space.","Yin, Z.

6391,Advantages of virtual agents over clinical psychologists during comprehensive mental health interviews using a mixed methods design,"The use of Virtual Agents (VAs) is currently a popular topic in mental health interviews. Advantages of VA over Real Expert (RE) in the interview were reported. However, the advantages of audio-visual VAs over REs during comprehensive mental health interviews remain unclear, and their clarification is important to promote the practical application of VAs in these settings. To explore the advantages, we triangulated data using mixed methods design, aiming to show quantitative advantages of the VAs in their perceived rapport and eye movement, and to describe the qualitative advantages of the VAs in their disclosed mental symptoms during the interview. A total of 55 Japanese university students participated in comprehensive mental health interviews conducted by the VA and RE. Findings show that participants perceived rapport and moved their right eyes more often, along with disclosing numerous mental symptoms, with the RE than the VA. However, they disclosed more sex-related symptoms to the VA than the RE. The VA can be used most practically in sex-related health fields. The anonymity conditions in the VA setting might be relevant to patients' self-disclosure of sex-related topics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

6394,Evolutionary Fuzzy Integral-Based Gaze Control With Preference of Human Gaze,"Research on developing human-like gaze control has been carried out to enhance human-robot interaction. From the viewpoint of a large consistency of human gaze, conventional research had focused on predicting where humans usually pay attention to. However, gaze control is a cognitive process that can even produce different scanpaths from the same visual information. In this paper, an evolutionary fuzzy integral-based gaze control algorithm with preference is proposed. It produces various scanpaths according to the preference of human gaze. The proposed gaze control algorithm evaluates each pixel point with fuzzy measures and fuzzy integral, and produces a scanpath through repeated selections considering memory and bio-inspired processes. The produced scanpath is transformed into a fixation map and compared with a scanpath obtained from a human subject by the earth mover's distance. Based on the comparison, quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm gradually develops preference of human gaze to produce a scanpath similar to the human scanpath. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing a human scanpath with a scanpath produced from the algorithm using the developed preference. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is also demonstrated by applying the developed preference to gaze control for learning from demonstration.","Yoo, B. S.",0,10.1109/tcds.2016.2558516,2307

This study applied data mining techniques to the two most frequently viewed videos related to the employment of robots in hotels. Thematic content analysis was conducted based on the Godspeed dimensions. The findings suggest that potential users' perceptions tend to be negative when it comes to any discussion of humanlike robots. However, people are more receptive towards robots with animated features. Finally, this study contributes to both theoretical and practical discussions on robots and their related modes of analyses. It raises potential problems in the Godspeed scale and uncanny valley theory, provides guidelines to hotels which intend to employ humanlike robots as frontline staff, and offers suggestions, such as promotional videos, to marketers.","Yu, C.

6397,The power of head tilts: gender and cultural differences of perceived human vs human-like robot smile in service,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to understand the perceptual differences toward smiling behaviors with head inclinations displaying by the human-like robot staff and human staff in a service setting. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a 2 (staff: robot/human personal personnel) x 3 (head tilt: left/right/straight) full factorial design, while cross-examining participants' cultural dimensions 2 (power distance: high/lower) x 2 (gender: male/female) during the service encounter. Findings Overall, it was found that male and female customers with different cultural background would perceive robot and human personnel with varying degrees of head tilt very differently, namely, regarding interpersonal warmth but not customer satisfaction. Originality/value Nonverbal cues serve as important elements in the interaction. This paper provides new directions on the design of anthropomorphic robot and gives insight to people's perceptual differences.

6399,A human-like game theory-based controller for automatic lane changing,"Lane changing is a critical task for autonomous driving, especially in heavy traffic. Numerous automatic lane-changing algorithms have been proposed. However, surrounding vehicles are usually treated as moving obstacles without considering the interaction between vehicles/drivers. This paper presents a game theory-based lane-changing model, which mimics human behavior by interacting with surrounding drivers using the turn signal and lateral moves. The aggressiveness of the surrounding vehicles/drivers is estimated based on their reactions. With this model, the controller is capable of extracting information and learning from the interaction in real time. As such, the optimal timing and acceleration for changing lanes with respect to a variety of aggressiveness in target lane vehicle behavior are found accordingly. The game theory based controller was tested in Simulink and dSPACE. Scenarios were designed so that a vehicle controlled by a game theory-based controller could interact with vehicles controlled by both robot and human drivers. Test results show that the game theory-based controller is capable of changing lanes in a human-like manner and outperforms fixed rule-based controllers.","Yu, H. T.",0,10.1016/j.trc.2018.01.016,2310

6407,A multi-agent-based online opinion dissemination model for China's crisis information release policy during hazardous chemical leakage emergencies into rivers,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a multi-agent-based simulation model for the online opinion dissemination during hazardous chemical leakage emergencies into rivers in China, to explore an appropriate crisis information release policy of China's government for controlling public panic. Design/methodology/approach - In the proposed model, two fundamental attributes of crisis information, i.e., truthfulness (for true or false news) and attitude (for positive, neutral or negative opinion), are considered. Four major agents in the online community system, i.e., citizens, the government, media and opinion leaders, are included. Using four typical accidents of hazardous chemical leakage into rivers in China as case studies, insightful policy implications can be obtained for crisis management and panic control. Findings - The news about the terrible potential damages from such a type of accidents will instantly arise wide-ranging public panic; therefore, the corresponding crisis information release policy should be carefully designed. It is strongly advised against publishing false news to temporarily conceal the accidents, which will seriously hurt the government's reputation and agitate much larger-scale public panic in terms of degree and duration. To mitigate public panic, the true news especially about treatment measurements should be published immediately. If the government does nothing and releases no crisis information, the public panic will go out of control. Research limitations/implications - This paper only focuses on the crisis information release policies from the perspectives of the government. Furthermore, this study especially focuses on the cases in China, and extending the proposed model study for general contexts is an important direction to improve this study. Finally, the proposed model should be extended to other types of emergencies to further justify its generalization and universality, especially various natural catastrophes like storms, floods, tsunamis, etc. Originality/value - This paper develops a multi-agent-based model for online public opinion dissemination in emergency to explore an appropriate crisis information release policy for controlling public panic stemming from hazardous chemicals leakage accidents into rivers. The proposed model makes major contributions to the literature from two perspectives. First, the crisis information about emergency accidents are divided into true and false news based on the truthfulness attribute, and into neutral, positive and negative emotions based on the attitude attribute. Second, the proposed model covers the main agents in the online virtual community.","Yu, L.",0,10.1108/oir-04-2015-0126,2312
6412,,"Individuals’ bidding behavior in online auctions has been the subject of research in Information System. Most research has used the lens of a rational decision making process to explain individuals’ bidding behavior. However, bidding behavior is also influenced by non-rational factors. Anthropomorphism, attributing human characteristics to a non-human object, has been the research topic of many disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, and computer science, but has not been investigated in the area of electronic commerce. This dissertation proposal aims to 1) Identify whether auditory and/or visual design factors on a non-human product would induce anthropomorphism and impact individuals' bidding decision; 2) understand the rational and emotional processes underlying anthropomorphism affecting bidding decision. I conducted two studies to answer the research questions. In Study 1, I used behavioral experiment method to test two different paths through which design factors would impact bidding decision. Results show that visual design directly impact bidding decision while the impact of auditory design is mediated through perceived functional value. To further open the black box of rational and non-rational processes underlying the bidding task, I conducted another experiment using psychophysiological and neurophysiological method, electroencephalography (EEG), facial electromyography (EMG), and skin conductance specifically, to directly observe the physical responses during the bidding task. Results show that the impact of emotion wears off within 20 seconds after the stimulus. Different areas of brain in the frontal lobe of the brain were activated between bidding for anthropomorphized products and regular product. This dissertation opens a new conversion on the research of anthropomorphism in the area of Information System. It creates a more holistic understanding of the impact of anthropomorphism on individuals’ behaviors for future research.","Yuan, Lingyao",0,,2313
6413,Acting Like Humans? Anthropomorphism and Consumer's Willingness to Pay in Electronic Commerce,"Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human characteristics to a non-human object. Past research shows that anthropomorphism changes how we perceive objects (e.g., believing them to be more attractive). Does this mean we would be willing to pay more for them? We examined whether displaying a product in an anthropomorphized form influenced how much a consumer was willing to pay. We examined two design aspects, visual (i.e., a face) and auditory (e.g., a voice), in the context of an online auction, and proposed three theoretical routes by which an anthropomorphic product display might affect willingness to pay (emotional, product attachment, and product quality). Results show that adding visual anthropomorphizing features to the way a product was displayed increased the amount bid by 7 percent, but adding auditory anthropomorphizing features had no effect. The visual anthropomorphizing features increased product attachment but had no effect on emotions or perceptions of product quality. Therefore, we conclude that anthropomorphizing the way a product is displayed increases willingness to pay primarily through the theoretical route of creating attachment to the product. There is an additional, as yet undiscovered, theoretical route through which anthropomorphism influences willingness to pay. The results also suggest that the conventional wisdom that the combination of visual and auditory design features is best for triggering anthropomorphism is not always true.","Yuan, L.

The main point we make is that human social agents are embedded in particular landscapes, and it is in landscapes that environmental changes are experienced, which can have implications for well-being. We draw from a variety of perspectives on landscape that understands a fundamental creative relation between humans and landscape and recent developments in neo-materialism theorising. Landscape is understood here as an assemblage of different forms of matter, animate and inanimate objects, as well as symbolic and cultural processes. A case study is also presented to indicate how landscape can be studied in relation to environment and change. Using the conceptual ideas laid out in the first section of the article, we analyse landscape, environment and well-being in Xuan Thuy National Park in North Vietnam. The area is part of a precarious coastal region where extreme weather events have impacted on the well-being of both humans and other matter. This article concludes with suggestions on the use of this landscape approach in researching environment and well-being.","Yuill, C.",0,10.1177/1363459318804603,2315
6421,,"The inevitability of bacterial drug resistance to all marketed antibiotic drug classes warrants continual research into the development of novel chemotype antibacterial agents. Drug resistant `superbugs' such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) account for >70% of US hospital bound bacteremias. Such infections are associated with vastly increased rates of morbidity and mortality resulting in a heavy economic burden on health care authorities. The bacterial topoisomerase enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV are highly conserved amongst almost all bacterial species on account of their unique and essential function in the conservation of chromosomal integrity during DNA replication and transcription. Furthermore, structural similarity between gyrase and topo IV, and distinction from human homologues, makes the selective dual-inhibition of these enzymes a realistic goal. In this thesis, three distinct approaches were utilized in the discovery of novel inhibitors of gyrase (GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (ParE) acting at the ATP binding domains of these enzymes. In the initial strategy, structural variants based on known inhibitors were modelled within the GyrB ATPase site in a bid to displace a highly conserved water molecule at the ligand-enzyme interface. Synthesis and biological screening of these variants proved that such changes were to the detriment of activity, although the work did yield a novel, convenient preparation of Nsubstituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidinones. In an alternative strategy, the de novo molecular design software SPROUT was used in concert with crystallographic data on the GyrB ATP binding site. Putative inhibitors were thus generated 'from scratch', the most attractive of which were further modelled using docking software (AUTODOCK), synthesised and screened for enzyme inhibitory and antimicrobial activity. A number of early series were derived which demonstrated modest (GyrB IC50 <100 μM) enzyme activity. The most promising of these, a series of pyridine-3-carboxamides, was optimized to offer potent (GyrB IC50 <100 nM) enzyme inhibitory activity, dual target specific antibacterial activity (MICs <0.5 μg / mL) and a low potential for resistance development. Finally, using the GLIDE docking software, virtual compound libraries were screened in silico against the ATP binding domain of GyrB. Though largely unsuccessful, the process did identify a moderate inhibitor (GyrB IC50 118 μM, MIC 32 μg / mL), in a cost and time effective manner relative to high-throughput screening.","Yule, Ian Andrew",0,,2316

Previous studies have modelled this particular unit as either an abstract entity or a detailed behaviour model without C2. Our model includes C2 in the models to determine the most critical tasks at company level C2 because this information could direct company commanders to engage in more important operational tasks. Our analysis is based on agent-based modelling and the virtual experiment framework. The overall model includes operational details as discrete event models and soldier behaviour as behavioural models.

6435,Acceptability of robotic manipulators in shared working environments through human-like redundancy resolution,"Next generation robotic manipulators are expected to resemble a human-like behavior at kinematic level, in order to reach the same level of dexterity of humans in operations like assembly of small pieces. These manipulators are also expected to share the same working environments with humans without artificial barriers. In this work we conjecture that making robots not only kinematically similar but also able to move and act in the same way as humans do, might facilitate their social acceptance. For this the kinematic redundancy of such new generation manipulators can be exploited. An experimental campaign has been organized to assess the physiological comfort/discomfort perceived by humans working side-by-side with robots. For comparison, a human-like and two alternative redundancy resolution strategies have been implemented. The analysis confirmed the hypothesis that a human-like motion of the robot helps in facilitating social acceptance, by reducing the perceived stress by humans in human-robot coexistence.

6438,,"There is an unyielding relationship between poverty and underperforming classrooms (Flores, 2007; Harding, 2003; Kopp, 2011; Lauen & Gaddis, 2013; South, Baumer & Lutz, 2003). Research concluded that quality teachers make the biggest difference in underperforming classrooms (Chester & Beaudin, 1996; Eckert, 2013; Faez & Valeo, 2012; Hill, Konstantopoulos, & Hedges, 2004; Konstantopoulos & Sun, 2012.) Yet, these urban and rural classrooms experience teacher shortages as many teachers leave these challenging spaces for suburban venues or leave the profession definitively. In this way, Teach for America’s goal was to fill these classrooms with candidates that would counteract this problem. TFA recruited high-achieving recent college graduates without education degrees and trained them for eight weeks during a Summer Institute and placed them in underperforming classrooms (Kopp, 2011). This qualitative interview-based study including 17 TFA corps members and alumni examined the levels of preparedness and self-efficacy that they had during the first years teaching in underperforming classrooms. In addition, the interviews elucidated the perceived training mechanisms that TFA employed during training. This study drew on the conceptual framework involving Bandura’s Social Learning theory (1977) and self-efficacy (1993) as well as Bourdieu’s (1977) concepts of social reproduction, “organization habitus” as proposed by Horvat and Antonio (1999) and “institutional habitus” (Roofe & Miller, 2013). Participants described the ways in which they perceived themselves to be prepared for their classrooms both from TFA training and from their own background and prior work and classroom experiences. Although participants acknowledged the value of TFA training especially in lesson planning and some basic pedagogical theories they noted that they did not always perceive themselves to be fully prepared or have a high self-efficacy and therefore acted as agents by seeking additional training and colleague observations to enhance their self-efficacy. Based on participants’ lived experiences, this study offers a deeper understanding of Teach for America’s corps members’ perceptions of preparedness of self-efficacy after their Summer Institute training and during the beginning of their teaching careers.","Zappetti, Lisa",0,,2321
6439,,"We describe in this paper a formalization of the notion of “role” that involves a clear separation between two very different sorts of roles. Semantic roles, like student or customer, are seen as (pre-defined) transitory properties that can be associated with (usually animate) entities. From a formal point of view, they can be represented as standard concepts to be placed into a specific branch of a particular ontology; they formalize the static and classificatory aspects of the notion of role. Functional roles must be used, instead, to model those pervasive and dynamic situations corresponding to events, activities, circumstances etc. that are characterized by spatio-temporal references; see, e.g., “John is now acting as a student”. They denote the specific function with respect to the global meaning of an event/situation/activity... that is performed by the entities involved in this event/situation... and formalize the dynamic and relational aspects of the notion of role. A functional role of the subject/agent/actor/protagonist... type is used to associate “John” with the notion of student or customer (semantic roles) during a specific time interval. Formally, functional roles are expressed as primitive symbols like subject, object, source, beneficiary. Semantic and functional roles interact smoothly when they are used to deal with challenging knowledge representation problems like the so-called “counting problem”, or when we need to set-up powerful inference rules whose atoms can directly denote complex situations. In this paper, the differentiation between semantic and functional roles will be illustrated from an narrative knowledge representation language (NKRL) point of view. NKRL is a high-level conceptual tool used for the computer-usable representation and management of the inner meaning of syntactically complex and semantically rich multimedia information. But, as we will see, the importance of this distinction goes well beyond its usefulness in a specific NKRL context. In particular, the use of functional roles is of paramount importance for the set-up of those evolved n-ary forms of knowledge representation that allow us to get rid from the limitations in expressiveness proper to the standard (binary) solutions.

We show that dimensionality reduction does not accurately predict the thumb position. A new algorithm is proposed in which measurements from 2D images are used to classify the thumb opposition angle to one of three positions. The remaining joints employ a reactive torque-control strategy to complete the grasp. The algorithm achieves force closure for 82% of 39 household objects. It is simple, computationally fast, and achieves a success rate that is similar to other contemporary grasp planning algorithms.

6446,Design and Validation of a Virtual Player for Studying Interpersonal Coordination in the Mirror Game,"The mirror game has been recently proposed as a simple, yet powerful paradigm for studying interpersonal interactions. It has been suggested that a virtual partner able to play the game with human subjects can be an effective tool to affect the underlying neural processes needed to establish the necessary connections between the players, and also to provide new clinical interventions for rehabilitation of patients suffering from social disorders. Inspired by the motor processes of the central nervous system (CNS) and the musculoskeletal system in the human body, in this paper we develop a novel interactive cognitive architecture based on nonlinear control theory to drive a virtual player (VP) to play the mirror game with a human player (HP) in different configurations. Specifically, we consider two cases: 1) the VP acts as leader and 2) the VP acts as follower. The crucial problem is to design a feedback control architecture capable of imitating and following or leading an HP in a joint action task. The movement of the end-effector of the VP is modeled by means of a feedback controlled Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) oscillator, which is coupled with the observed motion of the HP measured in real time. To this aim, two types of control algorithms (adaptive control and optimal control) are used and implemented on the HKB model so that the VP can generate a human-like motion while satisfying certain kinematic constraints. A proof of convergence of the control algorithms is presented together with an extensive numerical and experimental validation of their effectiveness. A comparison with other existing designs is also discussed, showing the flexibility and the advantages of our control-based approach.","Zhai, C.",0,10.1109/tcyb.2017.2671456,2324
6451,,"Affect detection from open-ended virtual improvisational contexts is a challenging task. To achieve this research goal, the authors developed an intelligent agent which was able to engage in virtual improvisation and perform sentence-level affect detection from user inputs. This affect detection development was efficient for the improvisational inputs with strong emotional indicators. However, it can also be fooled by the diversity of emotional expressions such as expressions with weak or no affect indicators or metaphorical affective inputs. Moreover, since the improvisation often involves multi-party conversations with several threads of discussions happening simultaneously, the previous development was unable to identify the different discussion contexts and the most intended audiences to inform affect detection. Therefore, in this paper, the authors employ latent semantic analysis to find the underlying semantic structures of the emotional expressions and identify topic themes and target audiences especially for those inputs without strong affect indicators to improve affect detection performance. They also discuss how such semantic interpretation of dialog contexts is used to identify metaphorical phenomena. Initial exploration on affect detection from gestures is also discussed to interpret users’ experience of using the system and provide an extra channel to detect affect embedded in the virtual improvisation. Their work contributes to the journal themes on affect sensing from text, semantic-based dialogue processing and emotional gesture recognition.

The intelligent agent was able to perform sentence-level affect detection from user inputs with strong emotional indicators. However, we noticed that many inputs with weak or no affect indicators also contain emotional implication but were regarded as neutral expressions by the previous interpretation. In this paper, we employ latent semantic analysis to perform topic theme detection and identify target audiences for such inputs. We also discuss how such semantic interpretation of the dialog contexts is used to interpret affect more appropriately during virtual improvisation. Also, in order to build a reliable affect analyser, it is important to detect and combine weak affect indicators from other channels such as body language. Such emotional body language detection also provides a nonintrusive channel to detect users’ experience without interfering with the primary task. Thus, we also make initial exploration on affect detection from several universally accepted emotional gestures.

6455,Enhanced emotional responses during social coordination with a virtual partner,"Emotion and motion, though seldom studied in tandem, are complementary aspects of social experience. This study investigates variations in emotional responses during movement coordination between a human and a Virtual Partner (VP), an agent whose virtual finger movements are driven by the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) equations of Coordination Dynamics. Twenty-one subjects were instructed to coordinate finger movements with the VP in either inphase or antiphase patterns. By adjusting model parameters, we manipulated the 'intention' of VP as cooperative or competitive with the human's instructed goal. Skin potential responses (SPR) were recorded to quantify the intensity of emotional response. At the end of each trial, subjects rated the VP's intention and whether they thought their partner was another human being or a machine. We found greater emotional responses when subjects reported that their partner was human and when coordination was stable. That emotional responses are strongly influenced by dynamic features of the VP's behavior, has implications for mental health, brain disorders and the design of socially cooperative machines.

6460,"The ""Hyper-Presence"" of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Collective Memory","Virtual reality (VR) uses sensorial mimetics to construct collective memory in virtual space. The regeneration of high-definition cultural heritage symbols transforms memory into an immediate experience that is constantly being renewed, strengthens the relationship between cultural heritage and contemporary society, and continually affects the persistent renewal of cultural traditions. Hyper-presence is a networked state of cognitive psychology that lies in links, interactions, and exchanges; it is the result of networked social minds and distributed cognition. In the contemporary moment, cultural heritage takes on three types of progressively developed presence: simulated restoration presence, informationally reproduced presence, and symbolically regenerated presence. Symbolic regeneration belongs to the realm of hyper-presence. Building databases with data collected on cultural heritage is the foundation of building a cognitive agent. As a platform, VR becomes an efficient mode of information dissemination, forming an independent presence for cultural heritage through the reproduction of media and information. In a network society, informatized cultural heritage becomes a source for the production of new cultural symbols, and presence is created through the continuous regeneration and dissemination of symbols. Symbols and regenerated symbols combine to constitute the hyper-presence of informatized cultural heritage; people's understanding of cultural heritage therefore exists in an ever-changing state. Intelligences with presence on the network form a complete system, and VR creates comprehensive cognition for the system through high-definition virtuality. Formed in the coordination between intelligences, collective memory creates its hyper-presence today.","Zhang, X.",0,10.1162/PRES_a_00321,2329
6462,Making Students Happy with Wellbeing-Oriented Education: Case Study of a Secondary School in China,"Positive education is being increasingly applied to improve students' wellbeing in schools. The main positive education strategies adopted by schools consist of teaching wellbeing skills directly to students to increase their resilience, positive emotion, engagement, and meaning. These wellbeing skills can be either added to or integrated into the existing curricula of schools. While school leaders and teachers have a key role to play as change agents in institutionalizing positive education and developing 'happy' schools, little research exists in the literature on leadership practices in happy schools. The current article attempts to fill this knowledge gap by reporting a qualitative case study of leadership practices for improving students' wellbeing. The case study was set in a junior secondary school in Guangzhou, China, where the wellbeing of secondary school students is generally low as a result of academic pressure. Research methods included interviews with school leaders and teachers, observation of lessons, and document analysis. The said school implemented an alternative approach underpinned by positive expectation of student development; that is, it embraced a student-centered approach in curriculum adaptation, pedagogical design, staff development and resource management. This approach aimed to relieve the academic pressure on students and to better support their learning and development. Findings show that, after the school had adopted wellbeing-oriented education for 3 years, student learning and wellbeing were greatly improved. This study expands the idea of positive education practices beyond the direct teaching of wellbeing skills and enriches our understanding of positive education in China.","Zhang, Y.

6463,Could social robots facilitate children with autism spectrum disorders in learning distrust and deception?,"Social robots have been increasingly involved in our daily lives and provide a new environment for children's growth. The current study aimed to examine how children with and without Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) learned complex social rules from a social robot through distrust and deception games. Twenty children with ASD between the ages of 5-8 and 20 typically-developing (TD) peers whose age and IQ were matched participated in distrust and deception tasks along with an interview about their perception of the human-likeness of the robot. The results demonstrated that: 1) children with ASD were slower to learn to and less likely to distrust and deceive a social robot than TD children and 2) children with ASD who perceived the robot to appear more human-like had more difficulty in learning to distrust the robot. Besides, by comparing to a previous study the results showed that children with ASD appeared to have more difficulty in learning to distrust a human compared to a robot, particularly in the early phase of learning. Overall, our study verified that social robots could facilitate children with ASD's learning of some social rules and showed that children's perception of the robot plays an important role in their social learning, which provides insights on robot design and its clinical applications in ASD intervention.","Zhang, Y.

We developed a computer-simulated provider conducting an informed consent process for clinical research to investigate the effects of a provider's alignment of interests with a patient, the research team, or a neutral party on patient trust in the provider. Methods: Participants (N = 43) interacted with a simulated provider for a research informed consent process in a three-arm, counterbalanced, within-subjects experiment. Participants reported their trust in the simulated provider after each treatment. Results: Participants successfully recognized the alignment manipulation, and perceived the patient-aligned provider as more trustworthy than the other providers. Participants were also more satisfied with the patient-aligned provider, liked this provider more, expressed more desire to continue working with this provider, and stated that they were significantly more likely to sign the consent form after interacting with this provider compared to the other two. Conclusion: Relational contextualization that aligns with the patient increases trust, satisfaction, and willingness to enroll in the context of research informed consent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

6481,A Novel Algorithm of Human-Like Motion Planning for Robotic Arms,"As robots get closer to humans, higher requests to robots are put forward. Human-like motion is one of those important issues, especially for humanoid service robots, advanced industrial robots and assistive robots. In this paper, a motion-decision algorithm is proposed and applied to human-like motion planning of robotic arms. The algorithm consists of two parts: intelligent decision and calculation of the joint trajectory. The former includes two parts: the hierarchical planning strategy (HPS) and the Bayesian decision. The HPS reflects the general rules of human arm movements and the robotic arms using the HPS can simulate the movements of human arms accurately. The Bayesian decision is used to make robotic arms choose an appropriate mode of motion. The calculation of the joint trajectory builds a motion framework of robotic arms to generate human-like movements. The human performance measures (HPMs) in different planning hierarchies are proposed. Finally, the validity of the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments.","Zhao, J.",0,10.1142/s0219843616500237,2334
6483,CLUST: Simulating Realistic Crowd Behaviour by Mining Pattern from Crowd Videos,"In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to simulate realistic locomotion of virtual pedestrians. We focus on simulating low-level pedestrians' motion, where a pedestrian's motion is mainly affected by other pedestrians and static obstacles nearby, and the preferred velocities of agents (direction and speed) are obtained from higher level path planning models. Before the simulation, collision avoidance processes (i.e. examples) are extracted from videos to describe how pedestrians avoid collisions, which are then clustered using hierarchical clustering algorithm with a novel distance function to find similar patterns of pedestrians' collision avoidance behaviours. During the simulation, at each time step, the perceived state of each agent is classified into one cluster using a neural network trained before the simulation. A sequence of velocity vectors, representing the agent's future motion, is selected among the examples corresponding to the chosen cluster. The proposed CLUST model is trained and applied to different real-world datasets to evaluate its generality and effectiveness both qualitatively and quantitatively. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can generate realistic crowd behaviours with comparable computational cost.","Zhao, M.",0,10.1111/cgf.13259,2335
6486,Moving attractive virtual agent improves interpersonal coordination stability,"Interpersonal motor coordination is influenced not only by biomechanical factors such as coordination pattern, oscillating frequency, and individual differences, but also by psychosocial factor such as likability and social competences. Based on the social stereotype of ""what is beautiful is good"", the present study aimed at investigating whether people coordinate differently with physically attractive people compared to less attractive people. 34 participants were engaged in an interpersonal coordination task with different looking (virtual) agents while performing at the same time a reaction time task. Results showed that participants had more stable motor coordination with the moving attractive than with the less attractive agent, and that the difference in motor coordination could not be interpreted by a specific attention allocation strategy. Our findings provide the evidence that physical attractiveness genuinely affects how people interact with another person, and that the temporal-spatial coordinated movement varies with the partner's psychosocial characteristics. The study broadens the perspective of exploring the effect of additional psychosocial factors on social motor coordination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

6492,,"As humanoid robots move from science fictions to reality, and are gradually being used in education, health care, and entertainment areas, interactions between humans and humanoid robots are becoming critically important. Previous findings show that in human-robot interactions (HRI) people tend to communicate with humanoid robots as if they were humans, which requires humanoid robots to be behaviorally more humanlike and socially more sophisticated. Nonverbal behaviors (e.g. gaze cues and gestures) are essential communication signals in human-human interactions (HHI), and they are equally important in HRI. This thesis reports a study on nonverbal behaviors of humanoid robots in hope to facilitate more natural HRI. Through extensive HHI and HRI experiments, intuitive robot gaze cues and gestures are studied, and their impacts on HRI are demonstrated. Gaze cues can subtly mediate how human-human handovers take place. We conjecture that such effect also exists in human-robot handovers. Based on observations of the giver’s gaze behaviors during human-human handovers, several typical gaze patterns are extracted and transferred to a PR2 humanoid robot for carrying out robot-to-human handovers. In two consecutive HRI experiments the robot hands objects to human receivers while using different gaze patterns. Results show that where the robot gazes at and how it changes its gaze direction during the handover can significantly affect human receivers’ reaching time for the handed object and their subjective experience (likeability, anthropomorphism, etc.) of the handover. Emblematic gestures are frequently used in HHI, because their meanings are self-contained and can be understood without spoken words, such as waving. We conjecture that emblematic gestures are also applicable to humanoid robots during HRI. Several commonly used emblematic gestures are identified and transferred to a NAO humanoid robot to be evaluated by human subjects. Results show that the perceived meanings of the robot’s emblematic gestures are generally consistent with the perceived meanings of a human’s emblematic gestures, but the recognition rate in the robot case is lower. To improve this situation, two design methods are implemented, i.e. by hand-puppeteering (designers manipulate the robot’s limbs with hands as if manipulating a puppet) and by motion mapping (human gesture trajectories are captured by an RGB-D sensor, and corresponding joint trajectories are mapped to the robot’s joints). Results show that gestures designed from the motion mapping method are faster and have larger range of motion, while gestures designed from the hand-puppeteering method are perceived subjectively as more likeable and as better conveying semantic meaning. This research contributes to the design of humanoid robots’ nonverbal behaviors with theoretically and empirically grounded methodologies, and offers better understandings of gaze cues and gestures in both HHI and HRI. Findings from this research provide instructive and valuable references for many practical application scenarios involving interactive robots.","Zheng, Minhua",0,,2337
6493,,"In this paper, we investigate the use of a robot’s gaze to improve the timing and subjective experience of face-to-face robot-to-human handovers. Based on observations of human gaze behaviors during face-to-face human–human handovers, we implement various gaze behaviors on a PR2 humanoid robot. We conducted two consecutive robot-to-human handover studies. Results show that when the robot continually gazes at a projected handover position while handing over an object, the human receivers reach for the object significantly earlier than when the robot looks down, away from the handover location; further, when the robot continually gazes at the receiver’s face instead of the handover position, the receivers reach for the object even earlier. When the robot—instead of continually gazing at a location—transitions its gaze from the handover position to the receivers’ face, or vice versa, the receivers’ reach time did not improve; however, the receivers perceive these gaze transitions to better communicate handover timing than continual gazes. Finally, the receivers perceive the robot to be more likeable and anthropomorphic when it looks at their face than when it does not. Findings from our studies indicate that robot’s use of gaze can help improve both fluency and subjective experience of the robot-to-human handover interactions.

6497,,"With continued progress in artificial intelligence, vehicle technologies have advanced significantly from human controlled driving towards fully automated driving. During the transition, the intelligent vehicle should be able to understand the driver’s perception of the environment and controlling behavior of the vehicle, as well as provide human-like interaction with the driver. To understand the complicated driving task which incorporates the interaction among the driver, the vehicle, and the environment, naturalistic driving studies and autonomous driving perception experiments are necessary to capture the in-vehicle and out-of-vehicle signals, process their dynamics, and migrate the driver’s decision-making into the vehicle. This dissertation is focused on intelligent vehicle advancements, which include driver behavior analysis, environment perception, and advanced human-machine interface. First, with the availability of UTDrive naturalistic driving corpus, the driver’s lane-change event is detected from vehicle dynamic signals, achieving over 80% accuracies using CAN signals only. Human factors for the lane-change detection are analyzed. Second, a high-digits road map corpus is leveraged to retrieve driving environment attributes, as well as to provide the road prior knowledge for drivable space segmentation on images. Combining environment attributes with vehicle dynamic signals, the lane-change recognition accuracies are improved from 82.22%-88.46% to 92.50%-96.67%. The road prior mask generated from the map data is shown to be an additional source to fuse with vision/laser sensors for the autonomous driving road perception, and in addition, it also has the capability for automatic annotation and virtual street views compensation. Next, the vehicle dynamics sensing functionality is migrated into a mobile platform – Mobile-UTDrive, which allows for a smartphone device to be freely positioned in the vehicle. As an application, the smartphone collected signals are employed for an unsupervised driving performance assessment, giving the driver’s objective rating score. Finally, a voice-based interface between the driver and vehicle is simulated, and natural language processing tasks are investigated in the design of a navigation dialogue system. The accuracy for intent detection (i.e., classify whether a sentence is navigation-related or not) is achieved as 98.83%, and for semantic parsing (i.e., extract useful context information) is achieved as 99.60%. Taken collectively, these advancements contribute to improved driver-to-vehicle interaction modeling, improved safety, and therefore reduce the transition challenge between human controlled to fully automated smart vehicles.","Zheng, Yang",0,,2339
6498,,"With the rapid development of large-scale wireless sensor networks in the past few years, we expect the embedded sensors to be integrated smoothly with other mobile embedded devices. In this dissertation, we consider the following model of a hybrid network with both static and mobile nodes. There are pervasive static sensor nodes embedded in the environment to gather real-time data. The mobile nodes can be either robots with controlled mobility to aid the network operation and repair dysfunctional network components, or users of the sensor network that demand real-time knowledge gathered by the sensor nodes, or robots/users that use the sensor network as a communication infrastructure, or a mixture of the above. The specific scenarios include, but are not limited to, online resource management and allocation, maintaining group communication and coordination of mobile agents, and efficient and resilient routing schemes. To solve these problems, we introduce a framework to manage the efficient and highly selective information flow between the sensor nodes and the mobile nodes. This framework involves the following components: 1. We extract a hierarchical well separated tree (HST) to approximate the shortest path metric of the static sensor network. 2. With the HST, we allow spontaneous, distributed matching between users that may emerge anywhere and the resources available in the network. 3. We also show that in the same framework, we can coordinate mobile users by maintaining an approximate minimum Steiner tree with modest communication cost. 4. By using two or multiple HSTs, we also show how to support low-stretch routing that is also resilient to in-transit link failures. In addition to the above HST framework, we develop the compact conformal map for greedy routing in wireless mobile sensor networks. The map is only dependent on the network domain and is independent of the network connectivity. This is the first practical solution for using virtual coordinates for greedy routing in a sensor network and could be easily extended to the case of a mobile network.","Zhou, Dengpan",0,,2340

6503,,"The use of computational strategies in the design of novel therapeutic agent is a rapidly growing field. The research presented here utilized Computer-aided Drug Design and Chemoinformatics techniques against two antimicrobial targets: bacteria N5-CAIR mutase (PurE) and Hepatitis C Virus NS3 protease. The first part of this dissertation describes our efforts on the identification of novel PurE inhibitors by virtual screening and post High Throughput Screening (HTS) analysis. The second part of this thesis is focused on the computational evaluation of one Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitor with pan-genotypic activities as well as activity against both wide type and mutants, and backup latent hit series for future chemical development were proposed by post HTS analysis. PurE is a key enzyme involved in de novo purine synthesis that represents a novel target for the design of antibacterial agents. The active site of PurE is relatively small, so we are interested in screening compounds with relatively small molecular weight (150-400 Da). Computational screening of fragments (MW <250) has proven to be difficult, and tailored virtual screening protocols are consequently needed. Prospective virtual screening against a small in-house fragment library (352 compounds) by consensus and constrained docking identified three specific binders. In addition, we have developed a novel fragment-based virtual screening protocol to identify potential inhibitors of PurE. This computational screening protocol utilized molecular docking, graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated molecular dynamics, and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson.Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) free energy estimations. The protocol was validated by comparing the computational screening results with experimental screens of the same library, including both initial screens using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), and secondary screen to confirm active site specificity by competition NMR spectrometry. In these validation studies, the protocol was able to effectively identify the competitive binders that had been independently identified by experimental testing, suggesting the potential utility of this method for the identification of novel fragments for future development as PurE inhibitors. The next phase of the PurE project involved computational screening against lead-like compound collections (MW: 250-400 Da). Both ligand-based and structure-based approaches have been employed in the identification of lead-like PurE inhibitors. And several structural diverse chemical starting points with PurE activities were identified for further exploration. Prioritization of HTS hits by computational docking scores for biological validation has facilitated the discovery of a structural class of compounds with potent antibacterial activity. The second project discussed in this work is the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS3 project. HCV is a major cause of chronic liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cirrhosis, which affects more than 150 million people.

6505,,"Living organs in human bodies continuously interact with the in vivo bio-environment, while reshaping and rearranging their constituents, responding to external or internal stimuli through life cycles. For instance, living tissues adjust the growth (or turnover) rates of their constituents to develop (volumetric and mass) changes as the tissues adapt to the pathological or physiological changes in bio-environment. From the perspective of biomechanics, changes in the bio-environment will induce the growth and remodelling (G\&R) process and reset the mechanical environment. Consequently, the mechanical cues will feed back to G\&R processes. In the long run, the interaction between G\&R and the mechanical response of living organs plays an important role in regulating the organ formulation or pathological growth. To understand the interaction between the mechanical response and the G\&R process, an important ingredient in evaluating the involved mechanics is knowledge of the solid mechanical properties of the soft tissues. Residual stress, resulting from G\&R of soft tissues, is important in modelling the mechanics of soft tissues, which still presents a modelling challenge for including residual stress in cardiovascular applications. For G\&R of living organs, changes of tissue structure and volume are also important determinants for organ development. This raises academic challenges for the understanding of the evolution of material properties and mechanical response of living tissues within a dynamic environment. To investigate the stress states (residual strain or residual stress) of living organs, the experimental results showed that the arterial slices would spring open after cutting along the radial directions, which indicates the residual strain in organs estimated by the opening angle. The residual strain, which is the elastic strain between zero-stress and no-load states, indicates the existence of residual stress after removal of the external loads. The residual stress is considered to modulate the growth and remodelling process in living organs. The evolution of residual stress could relieve the information about the history of growth, which could help to better the understanding of the formation of organs and the development of diseases. Besides the residual stress, G\&R processes are regulated by other factors, while the principles governing those mechanism are still not fully understood. Obviously, improving knowledge in this particular field will give huge potential for the design and optimization of clinical treatments to efficiently save more lives. From a general mechanics perspective to investigate the G\&R process in living tissues, the questions are: How does the residual stress influence the fibre remodelling and the material properties of entire organs? How to determine the combined effects of growth (in the stressed configuration) and remodelling on the fibre structure? How to develop a framework for investigating G\&R processes occurring in the stressed configuration? For arteries, multiple layer models are developed to analytically study residual stress in living organs. For the heart, due to its complex structure and geometry, most previous studies used the unloaded configuration or one-cut configuration as the stress-free configuration to estimate the stress state. However, both experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that: 1) residual stress will significantly influence the stress distribution in the heart. 2) a simple (or single) cut does not release all the residual stress in the heart. We build a multi-cut model and show that multiple cuts are required to release the residual stresses in the left ventricle. Our results show that with the 2-cut and 4-cut models (one radial cut followed by circumferential cuts), agreement with the measured opening angles and radii can be greatly improved. This suggests that a multi-cut model should be used to predict the residual stresses in the left ventricle, at least in the middle wall region.

6510,"An Agent-based Spatial Urban Social Network Generator: A Case Study of Beijing, China","This paper proposes an agent-based spatial social network model, which combines a utility function and heuristic algorithms, to formulate friendships of agents in a given synthetic population comprising individuals and households, as well as their attributes and locations. In order to better and explicitly represent the real social networks, the model attempts to generate both close and somewhat close social networks by linking agents with either close or somewhat close friendships, fitting both distributions of network degree and transitivity, which are two basic characteristics of a network. Here, a utility function, which incorporates the similarity between agents in individual attributes (e.g., sex), as well as the spatial closeness of their residential locations and workplaces, is developed to judge whether a friendship between a pair of agents can be built. Furthermore, the social network model is developed as a key component of an agent-and Geographic Information System (GIS)-based virtual city creator that is a set of synthesis methods used to generate spatially disaggregate urban data. Finally, Beijing, China is used as a case study. Both close and somewhat close social networks are generated with the target and generated distributions well matched, and the generated networks are further analysed from a geographical perspective.

6513,The Effect of Realistic Appearance of Virtual Characters in Immersive Environments - Does the Character's Personality Play a Role?,"Virtual characters that appear almost photo-realistic have been shown to induce negative responses from viewers in traditional media, such as film and video games. This effect, described as the uncanny valley, is the reason why realism is often avoided when the aim is to create an appealing virtual character. In Virtual Reality, there have been few attempts to investigate this phenomenon and the implications of rendering virtual characters with high levels of realism on user enjoyment. In this paper, we conducted a large-scale experiment on over one thousand members of the public in order to gather information on how virtual characters are perceived in interactive virtual reality games. We were particularly interested in whether different render styles (realistic, cartoon, etc.) would directly influence appeal, or if a character's personality was the most important indicator of appeal. We used a number of perceptual metrics such as subjective ratings, proximity, and attribution bias in order to test our hypothesis. Our main result shows that affinity towards virtual characters is a complex interaction between the character's appearance and personality, and that realism is in fact a positive choice for virtual characters in virtual reality.","Zibrek, K.",0,10.1109/tvcg.2018.2794638,2346
6516,Anthropomorphism: Opportunities and Challenges in Human-Robot Interaction,"Anthropomorphism is a phenomenon that describes the human tendency to see human-like shapes in the environment. It has considerable consequences for people's choices and beliefs. With the increased presence of robots, it is important to investigate the optimal design for this technology. In this paper we discuss the potential benefits and challenges of building anthropomorphic robots, from both a philosophical perspective and from the viewpoint of empirical research in the fields of human-robot interaction and social psychology. We believe that this broad investigation of anthropomorphism will not only help us to understand the phenomenon better, but can also indicate solutions for facilitating the integration of human-like machines in the real world.","Zlotowski, J.",0,10.1007/s12369-014-0267-6,2347
6520,Model of Dual Anthropomorphism: The Relationship Between the Media Equation Effect and Implicit Anthropomorphism,"Anthropomorphism, the attribution of humanlike characteristics to nonhuman entities, may be resulting from a dual process: first, a fast and intuitive (Type 1) process permits to quickly classify an object as humanlike and results in implicit anthropomorphism. Second, a reflective (Type 2) process may moderate the initial judgment based on conscious effort and result in explicit anthropomorphism. In this study, we manipulated both participants' motivation for Type 2 processing and a robot's emotionality to investigate the role of Type 1 versus Type 2 processing in forming judgments about the robot Robovie R2. We did so by having participants play the Jeopardy! game with the robot. Subsequently, we directly and indirectly measured anthropomorphism by administering self-report measures and a priming task, respectively. Furthermore, we measured treatment of the robot as a social actor to establish its relation with implicit and explicit anthropomorphism. The results suggested that the model of dual anthropomorphism can explain when responses are likely to reflect judgments based on Type 1 and Type 2 processes. Moreover, we showed that the social treatment of a robot, as described by the Media Equation theory, is related with implicit, but not explicit anthropomorphism.","Zlotowski, J.",0,10.1007/s12369-018-0476-5,2348
6526,"Can we control it? Autonomous robots threaten human identity, uniqueness, safety, and resources","Emergence of autonomous machines is a hotly debated topic in mass-media. However, previous research has not empirically investigated whether the perceived autonomy of robots affects their social acceptance. In this study we examined the impact of perceived robot autonomy on realistic threats (threats to human jobs, resources and safety) and identity threats (threats to human identity and distinctiveness), attitude toward robots, and support for robotics research. US based participants watched a video of robots performing-Various tasks these robots were presented as either autonomous and capable of disregarding human commands or non-autonomous and only capable of following human commands. Participants who watched videos of supposedly autonomous robots perceived robots in general to be significantly more threatening to humans (both realistic and identity threats) than those who watched a video of non-autonomous robots. Furthermore, exposure to autonomous robots evoked stronger negative attitude towards robots in general and more opposition to robotics research than exposure to non-autonomous robots. Both realistic and identity threats mediated the increase in negative attitudes toward robots and opposition to robotics research, although realistic threats were often the stronger mediator of the two. Our findings have practical implications for research on AI and open new questions on the relationship between robot autonomy and their social impact.","Zlotowski, J.",0,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.12.008,2349
6529,Persistence of the uncanny valley: the influence of repeated interactions and a robot's attitude on its perception,"The uncanny valley theory proposed by Maori has been heavily investigated in the recent years by researchers from various fields. However, the videos and images used in these studies did not permit any human interaction with the uncanny objects. Therefore, in the field of human-robot interaction it is still unclear what, if any, impact an uncanny-looking robot will have in the context of an interaction. In this paper we describe an exploratory empirical study using a live interaction paradigm that involved repeated interactions with robots that differed in embodiment and their attitude toward a human. We found that both investigated components of the uncanniness (likeability and eeriness) can be affected by an interaction with a robot. Likeability of a robot was mainly affected by its attitude and this effect was especially prominent for a machine-like robot. On the other hand, merely repeating interactions was sufficient to reduce eeriness irrespective of a robot's embodiment. As a result we urge other researchers to investigate Maori's theory in studies that involve actual human-robot interaction in order to fully understand the changing nature of this phenomenon.","Zlotowski, J.
