2,The effectiveness of E- learning in learning: A review of the literature,"Entry to the information age and effective life in information-oriented society requires an understanding of its characteristics. One of the social institutions that will undergo extensive changes at this age is general and higher education and training institutions. The aim of this review study is to evaluate the effectiveness of e learning in learning. This paper is a review study carried out using Medline and CINAHL databases and Google search engine. The studies used include review articles and English meta-analysis of language. Of the retrieved results, 38 documents including articles, books and web sites were investigated and classified. At first, the background of e learning was studied history and in the next section its effectiveness in learning was briefly examined. The overall benefits of e-learning include the promotion of learning, independence and individual satisfaction, learning at anytime, anywhere and with any background, learning without the same prerequisites, speed and process of learning due to individual needs, individual learning along with cooperative learning, saving time and costs significantly, the possibility of teaching and learning for all people, mutual teaching and learning, getting quick results in learning, learning more by using multimedia and maintaining resources and reducing environmental and audio pollution. The results of studies suggest positive effects of e-learning on learning thus it is suggested that this approach be used more in education, which requires building the required grounds.",Video Meta Results Raw,Somayeh M and Dehghani M and Mozaffari F and Ghasemnegad SM and Hakimi H and Samaneh B,,,1,2
3,A meta analysis on effective conditions to offer animation based teaching style,"Purpose - The aim of this study is to find in which conditions animation based teaching style for example teaching through 2D or 3D animations or animated diagrams leads to the better learning outcome. To achieve this purpose, we compared these two conditions (i) animation based teaching style is effective when offered to high spatial ability learners versus low spatial ability learners (ii) animation based teaching style is effective when offered to high prior knowledge learners versus low prior knowledge learners. Methodology - The data of 37 experiments from 22 different published studies were collected to identify the effective conditions. The results were obtained by conducting a meta-analysis. Animations can be effective for a wide range of subject disciplines and age group. Therefore, the present study incorporated published empirical data from different subject disciplines and age groups. Findings - The weighted mean effect size of HSA and LSA groups were 0.34 and 0.58 respectively. Thus, the current study is able to reject the null hypothesis that animation based teaching style is only effective for HSA students. The weighted mean effect size of HPK and LPK groups were 0.49 and -0.16 respectively. As a result, this study is unable to reject the null hypothesis that animation based teaching style is only effective for HPK students. Significance - This study statistically proved that prior knowledge is a crucial factor while offering animation based teaching style and thus it should only be offered to HPK students. Whereas, spatial ability is not a crucial factor as both high and low spatial ability students performed positively with animation based teaching style. These facts can help educators to design teaching methodologies to enhance the learning outcomes. © 2013, Universiti Utara Malaysia Press.",Animation based teaching style; spatial ability; prior knowledge; individual differences; DYNAMIC VISUALIZATIONS; SPATIAL ABILITIES; PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; COGNITIVE LOAD; EXPERTISE; DESIGN; INFORMATION; ANATOMY; MOTION; WORDS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Kaushal RK and Panda SN,,,1,3
4,Promoting Testicular Cancer Awareness and Screening: A Systematic Review of Interventions,"BACKGROUND: Testicular cancer (TC) is a relatively curable malignancy that predominantly affects young males. Key decision makers discourage TC screening because of lack of evidence about the benefits of this practice, whereas others argue that men must be aware of normal versus abnormal testicular findings. Despite the debate on TC surveillance, a number of research efforts are still being made to increase men's awareness of TC and its screening. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically review studies that were conducted to enhance men's knowledge and awareness regarding TC and its screening and increase their TC screening intentions and practices. METHODS: Studies published in English between 2004 and 2014 were reviewed using 3 e-databases, and interventions that were in line with the review aims were selected. RESULTS: A total of 3076 records were screened for eligibility, and 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the reviewed interventions successfully enhanced men's awareness of TC and its screening and increased their intentions to perform testicular self-examination. Examples include videos about TC, shower gel sachets, stickers, and posters, a television show, a university campaign, and high self-efficacy messages about TC screening. Men at risk of health disparities were underrepresented in the reviewed literature. CONCLUSIONS: A number of interesting channels through which men can learn about TC were identified. Examples include social media and mass media. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Given the controversy that surrounds TC screening, nurses can play a key role in increasing men's awareness of TC rather than advising periodical TC self-examination.",Video Meta Results Raw,Saab MM and Landers M and Hegarty J,,,0,4

6,The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Social Media Big data Analytics for Disaster Management - Initial Results of a Systematic Literature Review,"When any kind of disaster occurs, victims who are directly and indirectly affected by the disaster often post vast amount of data (e.g., images, text, speech, video) using numerous social media platforms. This is because social media has recently become a primary communication channel among people to report either to public or to emergency responders (ERs). ERs, who are from various emergency response organizations (EROs), usually consider to gain awareness of the situation in order to respond to occurred disaster. However, with the occurrence of the disaster, within minutes, the social media platforms are flooded with various kinds of data which become overwhelmed for ERs with big data. Further, in this posted data, there may be majority of the data consist of redundant and irrelevant content. With this, it becomes challenging for ERs to make sense and take decisions of/on the available big data. Despite recent advances in the technology, processing and analyzing of the disaster related social media big data remains a challenging task. Hence, in this paper, we focus on presenting an initial analysis of a systematic literature review on application of artificial intelligence to analyze/process social media big data for efficient disaster management. During a systematic review process 68 publications were identified. Thereafter, we analyzed all the identified papers. From our analysis, we conclude that the most of the reviewed papers are on text and image classification and mostly convolutional neural networks have been employed for the classification.","Social media; Big data analytics; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Deep learning; Disaster management; Survey; Literature Review; Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications; Computer Science; Telecommunications; Video Meta Results Raw",Nunavath V and Goodwin M,,,0,6
7,Women are not less field independent than men-the role of stereotype threat,"Prior research has shown that females are less field independent (FI) than males. However, when gender identity is salient, performance on tests assessing constructs similar to FI may be hindered, because of stereotype threat. This study examined the impact of stereotype threat on gender differences in FI. We expected that (a) reporting one's own gender prior to FI testing and (b) having an opposite-gender experimenter would activate stereotype threat, and in turn result in lower performance on a test of FI among females. Overall, 170 participants were randomly assigned to one of eight conditions in a between-participants design varying the participant's gender, experimenter's gender and timing of the gender question (before vs. after test). Results showed that reporting one's gender before the FI test led to lower FI performance among females. Furthermore, females achieved higher FI when experimenters were females and gender questions were administered after the FI test.","Field dependence/independence; Stereotype threat; Gender differences; Spatial abilities; SPATIAL ABILITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; GENDER STEREOTYPES; TEST-PERFORMANCE; METAANALYSIS; SCIENCE; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Drazkowski D and Szwedo J and Krajczewska A and Adamczuk A and Piatkowski K and Jadwizyc M and Rakowski A,,,0,7
8,Ultra-processed food product brands on Facebook pages: highly accessed by Brazilians through their marketing techniques,"Objective: To analyse the content and extent of marketing of ultra-processed food products (UPP) and their brand pages on Facebook, which are highly accessed by Brazilians. Design: Descriptive. Setting: Sixteen UPP brand pages on Facebook were selected from 250 pages that were the most liked by Brazilians in October 2015. Subjects: We analysed the frequency of 'likes' and members 'talking about' each one of the pages, in addition to fifteen marketing techniques used in the previous year (September 2014 to October 2015). The number of posts, likes, 'shares' and 'commentaries', and the mean number of likes, shares and commentaries per post, were collected for one month, from 23 September to 23 October 2015. Results: The two most liked pages were: Coke (R) (93 673 979 likes) and McDonald's (R) (59 749 819 likes). Regarding the number of people talking about the pages, McDonald's led with 555 891 commentaries, followed by Coke (287 274), Burger King (R) (246 148) and Kibon (R) (244 523). All pages used marketing techniques, which included photos, user conversations, presence of brand elements and links. Videos were observed on 93.8% of the pages; promotions on 68.8%; and celebrities on 62.5%. In one month, Garoto (R), Outback (R) and Coke were brands that published more than one post per day. Kibon achieved the highest ratio of likes per post (285 845.50) and Burger King had the highest mean shares per post (10 083.93), including commentaries per post (7958.13). Conclusions: UPP marketing is extensively used on Facebook pages and is highly accessed by Brazilians, with UPP companies employing a diversity of marketing strategies.","Advertising; Industrialized foods; Facebook; Marketing; Social media; Food publicity; UNHEALTHY FOOD; CHILDREN; METAANALYSIS; ADOLESCENTS; ADULTS; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Video Meta Results Raw",Horta PM and Rodrigues FT and dos Santos LC,,,0,8
9,Short-term and long-term effects of violent media on aggression in children and adults,"OBJECTIVES: To test whether the results of the accumulated studies on media violence and aggressive behavior are consistent with the theories that have evolved to explain the effects. We tested for the existence of both short-term and long-term effects for aggressive behavior. We also tested the theory-driven hypothesis that short-term effects should be greater for adults and long-term effects should be greater for children. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Children younger than 18 years and adults. MAIN EXPOSURES: Violent media, including TV, movies, video games, music, and comic books. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (eg, heart rate, blood pressure), and helping behavior. RESULTS: Effect size estimates were combined using meta-analytic procedures. As expected, the short-term effects of violent media were greater for adults than for children whereas the long-term effects were greater for children than for adults. The results also showed that there were overall modest but significant effect sizes for exposure to media violence on aggressive behaviors, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, arousal levels, and helping behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the theory that short-term effects are mostly due to the priming of existing well-encoded scripts, schemas, or beliefs, which adults have had more time to encode. In contrast, long-term effects require the learning (encoding) of scripts, schemas, or beliefs. Children can encode new scripts, schemas, and beliefs via observational learning with less interference and effort than adults.",Video Meta Results Raw,Bushman BJ and Huesmann LR,,,0,9
10,Cohort Differences in the Association of Cardiovascular Risk and Cognitive Aging,"Aim: To investigate birth cohort differences in associations between cardiovascular risk and fluid cognition between the age of 70 and 79. Method: Data were drawn from representative population-based cohort samples (H70), born 1901-1902, 1906-1907, and 1930, measured at ages 70, 75, and 79 on fluid cognitive measures (spatial ability and logical reasoning). The Framingham Risk Score (FRS), derived from office-based nonlaboratory predictors (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, BMI, smoking, diabetes status), was used to measure cardiovascular risk. Multiple-group latent growth curve models were fitted to the data. Findings: Estimates revealed small associations between the FRS and fluid cognition. These associations were slightly reduced in the 1930 cohort. Conclusion: Findings suggest diminishing adverse effects of cardiovascular risk on cognitive aging in cohorts born later.","aging; cardiovascular risk; cognition; cognitive change; cohort differences; BODY-MASS INDEX; MEN AGED 50; SECULAR CHANGES; BLOOD-PRESSURE; DEMENTIA; PROFILE; STROKE; GOTHENBURG; TRENDS; METAANALYSIS; Psychology, Developmental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Karlsson P and Johansson B and Skoog I and Skoog J and Ryden L and Thorvaldsson V,,,0,10
11,Theory of mind in patients with schizophrenia: Is mentalizing delayed?,"Objective: Functional imaging studies have used numerous neurocognitive designs to investigate brain activation during theory of mind (ToM) tasks in patients with schizophrenia. The majority of studies asks participants to retrospectively attribute mental states to others. We used a novel animated task to investigate implicit mentalizing online. Because behavioral studies have revealed slower ToM performance reaction times in patients with schizophrenia, we hypothesized that time would influence functional MRI (fMRI) activation patterns also.

12,Simulation and Web-based learning increases utilization of Bier block for forearm fracture reduction in the pediatric emergency department,"Objectives: Bier block (BB) is a safe and effective alternative to procedural sedation for analgesia during forearm fracture reductions, yet remains infrequently used in the pediatric emergency department (PED). No standardized methods of BB training have previously been described. The objective of this study was to determine whether a multimodal instructional course increases comfort with BB and translates to increased use of this technique. Methods: A novel interdisciplinary simulation and Web-based training course was developed to teach the use of BB for forearm fracture reduction at a tertiary PED. Participants were surveyed pre-/post-training, and at 2 and 6 months regarding their comfort with BB. In parallel, we prospectively assessed the clinical use of BB for children ages 6 to 18 years requiring closed reduction of forearm fractures during the 24-month post-course period. Results: Course participation included 26 physicians and 12 nurses. Survey response rate was 100%. Course participation increased both comfort (10% pre-training v. 89% post-training, p<0.001) and the willingness to use BB (51% pre-training v. 95% post-training, p<0.001), an effect sustained at 6 months post-course (66% and 92%, respectively, p<0.001 for both). In clinical practice, there were no BBs performed prior to course administration. We observed a consistent and sustained increase in clinical use among the BB-trained physicians, with 37% of all forearm reductions performed using BB at 24 months post-course completion. Conclusions: A novel combined simulation and Web-based training course increased comfort and willingness to use BB and was associated with increased use of this technique for forearm fracture reduction in the PED.","intravenous regional anesthesia; lidocaine; procedural sedation; INTRAVENOUS REGIONAL ANESTHESIA; PATIENT DATA METAANALYSIS; UPPER-EXTREMITY INJURIES; KETAMINE SEDATION; CPR PERFORMANCE; ADVERSE EVENTS; 8,282 CHILDREN; PREDICTORS; MAINTAIN; Emergency Medicine; Emergency Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Burstein B and Fauteux-Lamarre E and Cheng A and Chalut D and Bretholz A,,,0,12
13,Sex-related structural differences in language areas of the human brain and their implications for intergroup relations in ancestral groups,"In his research on the bilingual brain, Hagen (2008) shows adult learners' foreign language achievement variability and universal success of language acquisition by children as the reflections of minimal intergroup and maximum intragroup contact in our ancestral societies. However, his arguments are criticized by Hirschfeld (2008) who states that the capacity of children to acquire multiple languages before the critical period, without a negative effect on first language acquisition, signals the availability of intergroup contact in prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies. He argues that groups achieved peaceful intergroup contact through marriage or sustained long distance trade. In this study, I consider the argument between Hagen (2008) and Hirschfeld (2008) with an emphasis on sex-related structural differences in the language areas of the brain and their implications for the dynamics of ancestral inter-group interaction. Within the context of the male warrior hypothesis, the current study hypothesizes that these differences could be because of minimum intergroup interaction (minimum second or foreign language exposure) that males in our ancestral societies had and relatively more inter-group interaction that females were exposed to than males.

14,Shared and Distinct Neural Bases of Large- and Small-Scale Spatial Ability: A Coordinate-Based Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis,"Background: Spatial ability is vital for human survival and development. However, the relationship between large-scale and small-scale spatial ability remains poorly understood. To address this issue from a novel perspective, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies to determine the shared and distinct neural bases of these two forms of spatial ability.

15,DO WE EVALUATE PROPERLY TO OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENTS?,"Introduction: Health education requires compilation of knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed to train future professionals. It is necessary to establish an appropriate educational process based on skills and strategies for a further comprehensive assessment of the skills acquired. The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is a test designed to assess clinical competencies. The originality to change this evaluation method is to reflect the importance of learning what takes place during the assessment and not just only what students know that will be evaluated. The power of this test is due to the mix of assessment methods, so it is able to explore enough three of the four levels of the pyramid Miller: knowledge, know-how and show-how. The teacher can see the students interacting with patients to assess their clinical skills, thinking skills, problem solving skills, integrating diagnosis and communication and interpersonal skills, i.e., a comprehensive assessment which requires professionalism. Objectives: To launch a new competency evaluation methodology: the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) and compare the results with those obtained by the same students in a traditional evaluation short test and multiple choice questionnaires. Material and Methods: After carrying out a program of educational innovation in the Subject: Pediatrics \Clinical Practice\' (structured clinical rotation",practical content in a virtual classroom and simulation seminars) a systematic review of competency assessment (OSCE) was performed. The design of the test was developed by the staging of a series of ten simulated clinical scenarios that reflects actual practice,Pino Vazquez A and Gonzalez Garcia H and Coco Martin MB and Mayo Iscar A and Cuadrado Asensio R and Villa Francisco C and Lopez Miguel A and Urbaneja Rodriguez E and Medina Perez C and Maldonado Lopez MJ and Rellan Rodriguez S and Martinez Sopena MJ and Alvarez Guisasola FJ,,,0,15
16,The effect of video interventions on improving knowledge and treatment compliance in the sexually transmitted disease clinic setting. Lesson for HIV health education,"Eight intervention studies investigating patient education and treatment adherence in the sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic setting are reviewed. Across the eight studies selected for analysis, meta-analytic procedures were applied to compare the impact of educational and prevention approaches. The effect of video was compared with that of other modes of health education on: 1) knowledge and attitudes about STDs and condoms and 2) treatment compliance, as measured by return for test of cure, drug compliance, premature resumption of sexual activity, and condom coupon redemption rates. The largest effects were those for video on knowledge and attitudes about STDs and condoms, followed by the effects of other non-video interventions on STD knowledge. Lower effects were found among video and non-video interventions targeting treatment compliance outcomes. These results are consistent with prior prevention studies that have demonstrated difficulty in achieving behavior change.",Video Meta Results Raw,Healton CG and Messeri P,,,1,16
17,Introducing the familiarity mechanism: A unified explanatory approach for the personalization effect and the examination of youth slang in multimedia learning,"Several approaches have been used to explain how the personalization effect operates in multimedia messages. This paper aims at unifying these statements in a core concept of familiarity and its influence on social cues. By amplifying the scope of possible forms of personalization, the study explores additionally how youth slang as a new factor of conversation influences learning. Secondary school children (N = 166) were randomly assigned to experimental groups and provided with materials about photosynthesis in two different experiments (audio vs. text message). Each experiment consisted of performance tests and a questionnaire concerning the newly found mechanism of familiarity. The results of each single factor between-subject design show that youth slang fosters learning. Strong effects among transfer task performance (d(1) = 1.19; d(2) = 1.26) confirm the personalization effect. Moreover, the outcomes deliver valid empirical evidence for the proposed familiarity mechanism. These findings are discussed as well as the confirmation of all presumptions for the familiarity mechanism as incorporated in the explanatory approach, resulting in clear theoretical implications and future directions for the field of multimedia learning research.

18,A finite element model validates an external mechanism for opening the urethral tube prior to micturition in the female,"Existing theories for micturition in the female mandate total relaxation of the pelvic floor while detrusor pressure pushes the urethra open. However, video X-ray and electromyogram data indicate that micturition is preceded by active outwards opening of the outflow tract by backward-/downward-acting muscle vectors. If the detrusor pressure alone is enough to expand the tube, why does the active opening take place? The aim was to model the urethral tube in detail to assess the relative importance of the active opening mechanism and detrusor pressure. Finite element methods were used to model the urethral tube in detail. Nonlinear-elastic properties similar to urethral component tissues were taken from the literature. The boundary conditions applied to the tube model included internal pressure due to detrusor contraction (60 cm H2O) and various displacements and constraints such as pubourethral and pubovesical ligament attachments. In order to achieve opening dimensions similar to those in the lateral X-ray under the action of detrusor pressure alone, the pressure had to be increased by two orders of magnitude above normal levels. Normal detrusor pressure alone is not sufficient to achieve opening of the urethra against the elasticity of the constituent tissues, suggesting that normal micturition requires an active mechanism provided by backward-/downward-acting pelvic floor muscles, as predicted by the integral theory.",Video Meta Results Raw,Bush MB and Liedl B and Wagenlehner F and Petros P,,,0,18

20,The implications for academic attainment of perceived gender-appropriateness upon spatial task performance,"Affect detection is a key component in intelligent educational interfaces that respond to students' affective states. We use computer vision and machine-learning techniques to detect students' affect from facial expressions (primary channel) and gross body movements (secondary channel) during interactions with an educational physics game. We collected data in the real-world environment of a school computer lab with up to 30 students simultaneously playing the game while moving around, gesturing, and talking to each other. The results were cross-validated at the student level to ensure generalization to new students. Classification accuracies, quantified as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were above chance (AUC of 0.5) for all the affective states observed, namely, boredom (AUC=.610), confusion (AUC=.649), delight (AUC=.867), engagement (AUC=.679), frustration (AUC=.631), and for off-task behavior (AUC=.816). Furthermore, the detectors showed temporal generalizability in that there was less than a 2% decrease in accuracy when tested on data collected from different times of the day and from different days. There was also some evidence of generalizability across ethnicity (as perceived by human coders) and gender, although with a higher degree of variability attributable to differences in affect base rates across subpopulations. In summary, our results demonstrate the feasibility of generalizable video-based detectors of naturalistic affect in a real-world setting, suggesting that the time is ripe for affect-sensitive interventions in educational games and other intelligent interfaces.",Video Meta Results Raw,Bosch N and D'Mello SK and Ocumpaugh J and Baker RS and Shute V,,,0,20
21,"A systematic review of the literature reporting on studies that examined the impact of interactive, computer-based patient education programs","Objective: To evaluate studies that examined the impact of interactive, computer-based education (ICBE) programs on patient education. Methods: The Medline and CINAHL databases were searched to identify randomized controlled studies that evaluated the impact of ICBE programs. Results: The 25 studies that met the selection criteria generally supported the ability of ICBE programs to promote knowledge gains. Results related to economic or clinical Outcomes were less consistent. Significant variations were noted across studies in program features, implementation and integration strategies, and in comparison program attributes and quality. It is likely that these differences contributed to the disparity in findings across studies. Conclusion: Although significant inconsistencies in results were noted, the research provided collective evidence that ICBE programs had the potential to add great value to the patient education process. Programs must be properly designed and implementation and integration processes effectively planned in order to achieve consistently positive outcomes.

22,A Systematic Review of Treatments for Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity,"Background: Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is a poorly understood condition in which patients report symptoms following perceived exposure to weak electromagnetic fields (EMFs) such as those produced by mobile phones or visual display units. Little is known about the aetiology of the condition although experimental data suggest that EMFs are an unlikely causal agent. In this systematic review we assessed the efficacy of any treatment for people reporting EHS. Methods: Twelve literature databases were examined to identify relevant studies. We also hand-searched conference proceedings and examined the reference sections of reviews and other papers. Only clinical trials that compared the efficacy of a potential treatment for EHS against a control condition were included in the review. Results: Nine controlled clinical trials were identified, examining the effects of cognitive behavioural therapy (4 studies), visual display unit screen filters (2 studies), 'shielding' EMF emitters (1 study), supplementary antioxidant therapy (1 study) and acupuncture (1 study). The quality of these studies was limited. Nevertheless, their results suggest that cognitive behavioural therapy is more effective than providing no treatment. None of the other therapies have had their efficacy adequately demonstrated. Conclusions: The evidence base concerning treatment options for EHS is limited and more research is needed before any definitive clinical recommendations can be made. However, the best evidence currently available suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy is effective for patients who report being hypersensitive to weak EMFs.

24,Are Technology-Based Interventions Effective in Reducing Dental Anxiety in Children and Adults? A Systematic Review,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of technology-based interventions for the treatment of dental anxiety in children and adults. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search using relevant keywords was conducted in PubMed-Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and The Cochrane Library. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared technology-based interventions with inactive controls in the treatment of moderate to severe dental anxiety were included. RESULTS: A total of seven RCTs were included in the review. These studies investigated the effectiveness of video modeling, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy, virtual reality exposure therapy, and distraction with music and audiovisual video material. Six studies examining video modeling, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy, virtual reality exposure therapy, and distraction (audiovisual) showed significantly greater reductions in dental anxiety than inactive controls in both children and adults. None of the included studies followed Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines completely or reported sufficient data, thereby precluding a possible meta-analysis. Four out of seven included studies were assessed to be at high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: A limited number of studies supported the effectiveness of technology-based interventions in the treatment of dental anxiety in children and adults. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The quality of the methods of studies on the effects of technology-based interventions allows only limited inferences on the effects of these interventions. However, within the limitations of the systematic review, the results converge to suggest that technology-based interventions may be useful as an adjunct to standard dental care. High-quality RCTs are needed to determine the (relative) effectiveness of these interventions.

The visual in video games is believed to have a major role in learning, as the learning happens with visual description. Although computer games have been realized as a tool for teaching and learning of complex conceptual subjects, the way how visual design delivers wisdom was remain underexplored. This paper reviews the recent trend of children educational games to obtain an understanding of the multifaceted advantages of visual imageries of computer games. A systematic review over the pool of 200 papers from two established journals in education was conducted. The patterns of how visual design contributes to learning were investigated. The insight from the reviewed papers, subsequently, was analyzed to construct an elaboration on the use of visual computer game design to improve the learning experience.",Video Meta Results Raw,Anugerah YB and Budiyanto CW,,,0,25
26,Effect of different methods of education on oral health in children with hearing impairment: A systematic review,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aim of oral health education is to prevent oral diseases. Literature review indicates that oral hygiene is poor in children with hearing impairment. Different methods have been used to teach oral health to children with hearing impairment. This systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different methods of oral health education to improve oral health in children with hearing impairment. METHODS: Two independent researchers searched the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases without language restrictions, and a time limit of up to December 2016. Articles were imported to EndNote software and duplicate articles were removed. Relevant and proper articles were selected after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality assessment was carried out, and articles with a score of more than 5 were selected for analysis in the review. RESULTS: Of 453 articles found, 12 were assessed for eligibility based on defined inclusion criteria, and 9 studies were included in the review after quality assessment. Different methods such as video clips and dental models were used to train children. Out of the 9 studies, 8 studies showed a reduction in plaque index, and 4 studies were effective in improving gingival indexes.

CONCLUSION: Oral health education was effective in improving oral health status in children with hearing impairment without considering the method of education and learning barriers in these children.","Hearing Impairment; Oral Health; Education; Systematic Review; Children; HYGIENE; INSTRUCTION; Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Pouradeli S and Rad M and Shahravan A and Hashemipour MA and Rezaeian M,,,0,26
27,"Learning with multimedia: The effects of gender, type of multimedia learning resources, and spatial ability","The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of gender and type of multimedia resource on learning outcomes while controlling for the effect of spatial ability. This study also aimed to investigate the differences in learning outcomes between retention and transfer questions. The independent variables for the study were gender and type of multimedia resources (static versus animated), and the covariate was spatial ability. The dependent variables for the first study goal were learning outcomes measured by performance scores in two procedural learning tasks (functioning of a toilet cistern and a car brake system). The dependent variables for the second study goal were learning outcomes measured by retention and transfer performance scores in the two procedural learning tasks. A total of 245 undergraduate students completed participation online. As anticipated, spatial ability had the most significant overall influence on learning outcomes. Gender differences were also found, even after controlling for spatial ability. The study, however, failed to identify effects of multimedia type in learning outcomes. Male participants consistently outperformed female participants in all learning tasks, regardless of the multimedia type. While the scores from the transfer questions were lower than the scores from retention questions, as expected, this decline was significantly less for males in the car brakes task. This was not the case in the toilet cistern task however, implying a potential subject domain effect. Overall, this study is significant in that it offers empirical evidence of gender effects, separate from spatial ability, when learning with multimedia resources.","Media in education; Informal learning; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MENTAL ROTATION; INSTRUCTIONAL ANIMATION; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; COGNITIVE LOAD; METAANALYSIS; VISUALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; RECOGNITION; TECHNOLOGY; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education & Educational Research; Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Heo M and Toomey N,,,0,27

29,The Psychological Effects of Playing Exergames: A Systematic Review,"Successful exergames should lead players not only to achieve enough level of energy expenditure but also to engage in the play itself. The aim of this study is to review studies that explored the psychological effects of playing exergames, from the viewpoint of player engagement. Peer-reviewed journal articles in English collected via database search (Science Direct, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library) from 2011 to 2015 were considered, and 45 experimental studies were selected out of 911 studies. The results show that a variety of psychological effects of engagement including enjoyment, immersion, and flow were measured in the exergame studies. In addition, physiological variables (e.g., energy expenditure), feedback modality (e.g., auditory and tactile), and play modes (e.g., solitary or group play mode) are related to psychological effects of playing exergames. Finally, salient methodological issues (e.g., validated measurement, sample size calculation) in the studies are identified and discussed.","exergame; enjoyment; flow; immersion; intrinsic motivation; flow; energy expenditure; play mode; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY LEVELS; VIDEO GAMES; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES; SITUATIONAL MOTIVATION; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; EXERCISE INTENTIONS; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; AEROBIC EXERCISE; SPATIAL PRESENCE; VIRTUAL-REALITY; Psychology, Social; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Lee S and Kim W and Park T and Peng W,,,0,29
30,The VOICE study - A before and after study of a dementia communication skills training course,"BACKGROUND: A quarter of acute hospital beds are occupied by persons living with dementia, many of whom have communication problems. Healthcare professionals lack confidence in dementia communication skills, but there are no evidence-based communication skills training approaches appropriate for professionals working in this context. We aimed to develop and pilot a dementia communication skills training course that was acceptable and useful to healthcare professionals, hospital patients and their relatives. METHODS: The course was developed using conversation analytic findings from video recordings of healthcare professionals talking to patients living with dementia in the acute hospital, together with systematic review evidence of dementia communication skills training and taking account of expert and service-user opinion. The two-day course was based on experiential learning theory, and included simulation and video workshops, reflective diaries and didactic teaching. Actors were trained to portray patients living with dementia for the simulation exercises. Six courses were run between January and May 2017. 44/45 healthcare professionals attended both days of the course. Evaluation entailed: questionnaires on confidence in dementia communication; a dementia communication knowledge test; and participants' satisfaction. Video-recorded, simulated assessments were used to measure changes in communication behaviour. RESULTS: Healthcare professionals increased their knowledge of dementia communication (mean improvement 1.5/10; 95% confidence interval 1.0-2.0; p<0.001). Confidence in dementia communication also increased (mean improvement 5.5/45; 95% confidence interval 4.1-6.9; p<0.001) and the course was well-received. One month later participants reported using the skills learned in clinical practice. Blind-ratings of simulated patient encounters demonstrated behaviour change in taught communication behaviours to close an encounter, consistent with the training, but not in requesting behaviours. CONCLUSION: We have developed an innovative, evidence-based dementia communication skills training course which healthcare professionals found useful and after which they demonstrated improved dementia communication knowledge, confidence and behaviour.",SIMULATED PATIENTS; GENERAL HOSPITALS; OLDER PATIENTS; KNOW ME; CARE; PROGRAM; PEOPLE; PROFESSIONALS; PSYCHOSIS; EDUCATION; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw,O'Brien R and Goldberg SE and Pilnick A and Beeke S and Schneider J and Sartain K and Thomson L and Murray M and Baxendale B and Harwood RH,,,0,30
31,An Algorithmic Approach to Prepectoral Direct-to-Implant Breast Reconstruction: Version 2.0,"Background: Prepectoral direct- to- implant breast reconstruction has historically been fraught with complications, including flap necrosis, implant extrusion, and capsular contracture, along with high rates of operative revisions. This may result from a number of factors, including the lack of an algorithmic approach, failure to predict postoperative migration of the implant, use of improper implants, and unsuitable patient selection. Over the past 5 years, the authors have gained significant experience in prepectoral breast reconstruction as they have transitioned their direct- to- implant technique. Methods: Using video, technical aspects for achieving superior results are demonstrated, including suture technique, application of acellular dermal matrix, creation of the implant pocket, implant selection and placement, and postoperative dressings. Video is used to highlight technical aspects to yield consistent, predictable results using the anterior tenting technique. Results: A systematic review of prepectoral direct- to- implant breast reconstruction was conducted to amalgamate the experience of the authors and others with regard to technique, material, and outcomes. Conclusions: Prepectoral direct- to- implant breast reconstruction represents a significant paradigm shift in postmastectomy breast reconstruction and warrants reconsideration. Prepectoral direct- to- implant breast reconstruction provides the potential benefits of a single- stage operation, elimination of dynamic deformity, enhanced aesthetic outcomes, and increased patient satisfaction. Although early evidence suggests an increased incidence of complications, our experience and that of others demonstrate favorable outcomes with version 2.0 of prepectoral direct- to- implant breast reconstruction. As the body of literature encompassing a modern approach to prepectoral direct- to- implant breast reconstruction grows, greater appreciation for operative technique, candidate selection, and implant choice may accelerate its adoption and mitigate past concerns.",ACELLULAR DERMAL MATRIX; ANIMATION DEFORMITY; PLACEMENT; EXPERIENCE; OUTCOMES; POCKET; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Antony AK and Robinson EC,,,0,31
32,"In-Class Versus Online Video Lectures: Similar Learning Outcomes, but a Preference for In-Class","Previous findings suggest some advantages to using an online format to deliver declarative knowledge and to using class time for active learning and discussion. During 4 weeks of an introductory psychology course, students were assigned on alternate weeks to attend one of two lecture formats: in-class lecture or online video lecture with an in-class active learning session. No advantage was found for either format on the basis of quiz scores. Students appreciated the convenience of online lectures but preferred in-class lectures because of the increased ease of maintaining attention in the more structured environment. Attendance, as well as access of online content, decreased during the course of the study, suggesting that hybrid courses may lead to decreases in overall student effort.",Video Meta Results Raw,Jensen SA,,,0,32
33,Signaling text-picture relations in multimedia learning: A comprehensive meta-analysis,"The signaling principle recommends emphasizing relevant aspects of a multimedia message by means of signals (e.g., color coding). We determined the effectiveness of signals that highlight correspondences between text and pictures as well as possible boundary conditions by means of a meta-analysis. To this end, 58 potentially relevant articles were identified in a comprehensive search. After rating the studies based on inclusion criteria and correcting for biases, 27 studies were included in the meta-analysis yielding 45 pairwise comparisons with N = 2464 participants. Domain-specific prior knowledge, pacing of the materials, pictorial format, mapping requirements, and distinctiveness of signals were coded as moderators. For transfer and comprehension performance a positive small-to-medium effect size (r = .17, 95% CI [0.11, 0.22]) favoring signaled multimedia material was found, which was moderated by prior knowledge. The findings support the effectiveness of the signaling principle in particular for learners with low prior knowledge. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Instructional design; Meta-analysis; Multimedia learning; Signaling; Cueing; Video Meta Results Raw; Unsorted; Multimedia Target Set,Richter J and Scheiter K and Eitel A,,,1,33
34,LIE DETECTION BY INDUCING COGNITIVE LOAD Eye Movements and Other Cues to the False Answers of \Witnesses\' to Crimes',"Research on the accuracy of eyewitness testimony has expanded dramatically in recent years. Most of it concerns the issue of mistaken identification, not the problem of uncovering deceptive accounts of witnesses, which is the focus of this research. In the literature, a technique for lie detection has been proposed that induces cognitive load on liars by averting their rehearsal of deception: Time Restricted Integrity-Confirmation. The current authors tested it by instructing \witnesses\' of actual crime videos to lie or tell the truth to related questions.

35,A systematic review of dyadic approaches to reminiscence and life review among older adults,"Objective: This paper describes a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative studies that examine the effectiveness of dyadic approaches to life review and reminiscence. Methods: The search process began with 1,056 potentially eligible articles and, after a multi-step screening process, led to 20 full-text articles for review. Results: The resulting studies (ten quantitative, nine qualitative, and one mixed-method) comprised six different kinds of dyadic approaches. There are a combination of benefits and problems associated with dyadic life review and reminiscence approaches. Conclusions: This review provides initial understanding of the impact of life review and reminiscence when care recipients and caregivers participate in the intervention together. Future clinical studies on dyadic approaches to life review and reminiscence should provide clearer descriptions of their protocols, include more consistent measures (incorporating in-the-moment measures), and involve populations of healthy older adults and their partners as well as those with cognitive impairment. The inclusion of qualitative studies helps interpret the diverse results reported in the quantitative studies and highlights key themes related to participating in dyadic interventions.",Life review; reminiscence; dyadic interventions; systematic review; MULTIMEDIA BIOGRAPHIES; STORY APPROACH; FAMILY CARERS; DEMENTIA; PEOPLE; INTERVENTIONS; INDIVIDUALS; THERAPY; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Gerontology; Psychiatry; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Ingersoll-Dayton B and Kropf N and Campbell R and Parker M,,,0,35

37,E-learning in postsecondary education,"Over the past decade postsecondary education has been moving increasingly from the classroom to online. During the fall 2010 term 31 percent of U.S. college students took at least one online course. The primary reasons for the growth of e-learning in the nation’s colleges and universities include the desire of those institutions to generate new revenue streams, improve access, and offer students greater scheduling flexibility. Yet the growth of e-learning has been accompanied by a continuing debate about its effectiveness and by the recognition that a number of barriers impede its widespread adoption in higher education. Through an extensive research review, Bradford Bell and Jessica Federman examine three key issues in the growing use of e-learning in postsecondary education. The first is whether e-learning is as effective as other delivery methods. The debate about the effectiveness of e-learning, the authors say, has been framed in terms of how it compares with other means of delivering instruction, most often traditional instructor-led classroom instruction. Bell and Federman review a number of meta-analyses and other studies that, taken together, show that e-learning produces outcomes equivalent to other delivery media when instructional conditions are held constant. The second issue is what particular features of e-learning influence its effectiveness. Here the authors move beyond the 'does it work' question to examine how different instructional features and supports, such as immersion and interactivity, influence the effectiveness of e-learning programs. They review research that shows how these features can be configured to create e-learning programs that help different types of learners acquire different types of knowledge. In addressing the third issue—the barriers to the adoption of e-learning in postsecondary education—Bell and Federman discuss how concerns about fraud and cheating, uncertainties about the cost of e-learning, and the unique challenges faced by low-income and disadvantaged students have the potential to undermine the adoption of e-learning instruction. Based on their research review, the authors conclude that e-learning can be an effective means of delivering postsecondary education. They also urge researchers to examine how different aspects of these programs influence their effectiveness and to address the numerous barriers to the adoption of online instruction in higher education.

38,Re-exploring game-assisted learning research: The perspective of learning theoretical bases,"Previous literature reviews or meta-analysis based studies on game-assisted learning have provided important results, but few studies have considered the importance of learning theory, and coverage of papers after 2007 is scant. This study presents a systematic review of the literature using a meta-analysis approach to provide a more comprehensive analysis and synthesis of relevant studies based on four orientations of learning theories and principles: behaviorism, cognitivism, humanism, and constructivism. Major findings of this study include that the majority of published studies were not based on learning theory and the development of learning theory orientations has prompted more studies to focus on constructivism and humanism than on behaviorism and cognitivism. In addition, most studies adopted a descriptive approach, followed by experimental methods and surveys, and most presented positive outcomes. These findings not only advance understanding of game-assisted learning from the important perspective of learning theory, but also provide useful insights for researchers and educators in issues related to game-assisted learning.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Computer Uses in Education; Constructivism (Learning); Epistemology; Learning Theories; Research Methodology; Humanism; Research Reports; Educational Research; Educational Games; Computer Games; Synthesis; Educational Technology; Video Games; Literature Reviews; Meta Analysis; Behaviorism; Game-assisted learning; Interactive learning environments; Pedagogical issues; Learning theory; Video Meta Results Raw",Wu WH and Chiou WB and Kao HY and Alex Hu CH and Huang SH,,,0,38

40,Development and preliminary pilot evaluation of a brief tablet computer intervention to motivate tobacco quitline use among smokers in substance use treatment,"Background and ObjectivesThe majority of individuals in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment also smoke cigarettes; yet, the availability of smoking cessation services in SUD treatment remains limited. In this study, we developed and piloted a brief intervention for smokers in SUD treatment intended to motivate engagement in tobacco quitline treatment (TIME-TQ). MethodsFirst, we interviewed 19 smokers in SUD treatment to inform the development of TIME-TQ (Phase 1). Second, we delivered a prototype TIME-TQ to 16 smokers in the same SUD treatment program and followed them for 3 months post-discharge (Phase 2). ResultsFeedback from Phase 1 participants was used to refine response choices and video segments included in the prototype TIME-TQ. Phase 2 participants rated TIME-TQ high on relevance, interest, respectfulness, and helpfulness. Additionally, they reported significant increases in readiness to quit and perceived importance of quitting after receiving TIME-TQ. A total of 8 of the 16 accepted a quitline referral, and 8 of 13 reached for follow-up (four referral acceptors, four decliners) reported efforts to quit or reduce smoking during the follow-up period. However, only three received quitline counseling and none achieved a sustained period of abstinence. Conclusions and Scientific SignificanceOur results suggest that TIME-TQ activated these patients to quit smoking, but our referral method (standard fax referral) was unsuccessful in helping participants fully engage in quitline treatment or achieving a period of abstinence. Scientific SignificanceWe are now conducting an RCT to evaluate TIME-TQ with a revised referral procedure intended to increase treatment engagement and, ultimately, abstinence rates.

41,Sex differences in discrimination reversal learning in the guppy,"In several mammalian and avian species, females show a higher performance than males in tasks requiring cognitive flexibility such as the discrimination reversal learning. A recent study showed that female guppies are twice as efficient as males in a reversal learning task involving yellow-red discrimination, suggesting a higher cognitive flexibility in female guppies. However, the possibility exists that the superior performance exhibited by females does not reflect a general sex difference in cognitive abilities, but instead, is confined to colour discrimination tasks. To address this issue, we compared male and female guppies in two different discrimination reversal learning tasks and we performed a meta-analysis of these experiments and the previous one involving colour discrimination. In the first experiment of this study, guppies were tested in a task requiring them to learn to select the correct arm of a T-maze in order to rejoin a group of conspecifics. In experiment 2, guppies were observed in a numerical task requiring them to discriminate between 5 and 10 dots in order to obtain a food reward. Although females outperformed males in one condition of the T-maze, we did not find any clear evidence of females' greater reversal learning performance in either experiment. However, the meta-analysis of the three experiments supported the hypothesis of females' greater reversal learning ability. Our data do not completely exclude the idea that female guppies have a generally higher cognitive flexibility than males; however, they suggest that the size of this sex difference might depend on the task.",Fish cognition; Numerical abilities; Poecilia reticulata; Reversal learning; T-maze; Sex differences; FEMALE MATE CHOICE; POECILIA-RETICULATA; OVERTRAINING REVERSAL; SPATIAL ABILITY; ZEBRA FINCHES; FISH; PREFERENCE; HYPOTHESIS; LATERALIZATION; FLEXIBILITY; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology; Video Meta Results Raw,Petrazzini ME and Bisazza A and Agrillo C and Lucon-Xiccato T,,,0,41
42,Does class attendance matter? Results from a second-year medical school dermatology cohort study,"BackgroundLittle is known about the impacts of class attendance and learning preferences on academic performance in dermatology. ObjectivesThis study was designed to examine the effects of medical student class attendance and learning preferences on students' academic performance in an introductory dermatology course. MethodsA total of 101 second-year medical students enrolled in a required introductory dermatology course were surveyed regarding their learning preferences. Records of class attendance and scores on the final examination were reviewed. ResultsThe most frequently cited reason for attending classes was social expectation (96%), whereas the least cited was learning well in a classroom-type setting (65%). The top reasons cited by students for not attending classes were availability of lectures online (35%), preference for individual study outside the classroom setting (26%), and the inconvenience of traveling to class (24%). Multivariate analysis found no statistically significant relationship between class attendance and performance on the final examination (estimate -0.074, standard error 0.12; P=0.54) after adjusting for sex, age, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) score, having children at home, and reason for attending class. Those who prefer to learn by watching online videos scored significantly higher on the final examination (prefer online videos: 875.5; neutral: 86 +/- 5.9; do not prefer online videos: 82 +/- 2.6 [P=0.049]). ConclusionsClass attendance was not associated with improved academic performance in a dermatology course.

43,Development of a video-delivered relaxation treatment of late-life anxiety for veterans,"Background: Behavioral treatments reduce anxiety, yet many older adults may not have access to these efficacious treatments. To address this need, we developed and evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a video-delivered anxiety treatment for older Veterans. This treatment program, BREATHE (Breathing, Relaxation, and Education for Anxiety Treatment in the Home Environment), combines psychoeducation, diaphragmatic breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation training with engagement in activities. Methods: A mixed methods concurrent study design was used to examine the clarity of the treatment videos. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 Veterans (M age = 69.5, SD = 7.3 years; 55% White, Non-Hispanic) and collected ratings of video clarity. Results: Quantitative ratings revealed that 100% of participants generally or definitely could follow breathing and relaxation video instructions. Qualitative findings, however, demonstrated more variability in the extent to which each video segment was clear. Participants identified both immediate benefits and motivation challenges associated with a video-delivered treatment. Participants suggested that some patients may need encouragement, whereas others need face-to-face therapy. Conclusions: Quantitative ratings of video clarity and qualitative findings highlight the feasibility of a video-delivered treatment for older Veterans with anxiety. Our findings demonstrate the importance of ensuring patients can follow instructions provided in self-directed treatments and the role that an iterative testing process has in addressing these issues. Next steps include testing the treatment videos with older Veterans with anxiety disorders.","anxiety; behavioral therapy; psychogeriatrics; qualitative; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; GUIDED SELF-HELP; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; OLDER-ADULTS; META-REGRESSION; DISORDER; METAANALYSIS; DEPRESSION; HEALTH; PSYCHOTHERAPY; Psychology, Clinical; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Gerontology; Psychiatry; Psychology; Psychology; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw",Gould CE and Zapata AM and Bruce J and Merrell SB and Wetherell JL and O'Hara R and Kuhn E and Goldstein MK and Beaudreau SA,,,0,43
46,Identifying emerging trends for implementing learning technology in special education: A state-of-the-art review of selected articles published in 2008–2012,"As electronic learning (e-learning) becomes increasingly popular in education worldwide, learning technology (LT) has been applied in various learning environments and activities to promote meaningful, efficient, and effective learning. LT has also been adopted by researchers and teacher-practitioners in the field of special education, but as yet little review-based research has been published. This review research thus carefully examined the trends of LT implementations in special education, providing a comprehensive analysis of 26 studies published in indexed journals in the past five years (2008–2012). Two research questions were addressed: (a) What are the major research aims, methodologies, and outcomes in these studies of implementing LT in the field of special education? and (b) What types of LT are mainly used with special education students, and for what kinds of students? Major findings include that examining the learning effectiveness of LT using was the most common research purpose (75%); researchers primarily relied on experimental studies (46%, 12 studies), followed by interviews and questionnaires (19%, 5 studies). Moreover, the most common use of LT was computer-assisted technology (such as web-based mentoring, educational computer games, laptop computers) in special education; studies investigating the use of LT with mentally disabled students were more than those with physically disabled ones. It is expected that the findings of this work and their implications will serve as valuable references with regard to the use of LT with special education students.

47,A Bespoke Kinect Stepping Exergame for Improving Physical and Cognitive Function in Older People: A Pilot Study,"BACKGROUND: Systematic review evidence has shown that step training reduces the number of falls in older people by half. This study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of a bespoke Kinect stepping exergame in an unsupervised home-based setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An uncontrolled pilot trial was conducted in 12 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 79.3 ± 8.7 years, 10 females). The stepping game comprised rapid stepping, attention, and response inhibition. Participants were recommended to exercise unsupervised at home for a minimum of three 20-minute sessions per week over the 12-week study period. The outcome measures were choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) (main outcome measure), standing balance, gait speed, five-time sit-to-stand (STS), timed up and go (TUG) performance, and neuropsychological function (attention: letter-digit and executive function:Stroop tests) assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and trial end (12 weeks). RESULTS: Ten participants (83%) completed the trial and reassessments. A median 8.2 20-minute sessions were completed and no adverse events were reported. Across the trial period, participants showed significant improvements in CSRT (11%), TUG (13%), gait speed (29%), standing balance (7%), and STS (24%) performance (all P < 0.05). There were also nonsignificant, but meaningful, improvements for the letter-digit (13%) and Stroop tests (15%). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a bespoke Kinect step training program was safe and feasible for older people to undertake unsupervised at home and led to improvements in stepping, standing balance, gait speed, and mobility. The home-based step training program could therefore be included in exercise programs designed to prevent falls.","Kinect; exergames; fall prevention; elderly; Accidental Falls; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Feasibility Studies; Female; Gait; Humans; Male; Physical Conditioning, Human; Pilot Projects; Postural Balance; Video Games; Walking Speed; Cognitive Ability; Falls; Prevention; Elder Care; Video Meta Results Raw",Garcia JA and Schoene D and Lord SR and Delbaere K and Valenzuela T and Navarro KF,,,0,45

At the time of the study, a central theme of early mathematics curricula, Number Concept, was fully developed. It was broken down into five mathematical concepts including counting, comparing, adding, subtracting and decomposing. Each of these was further subdivided yielding 22 online activities, each building in a level of complexity and abstraction. In total, 234 grade one students from 12 classes participated in the two-group post-test study that lasted about seven weeks and for which students in the experimental group used ELM for about 30 minutes weekly. The results for the final sample of 186 students showed that ELM students scored higher on the standardized math test (Canadian Achievement Test, 2008) and reported less boredom and lower anxiety as measured on the Academic Emotions Questionnaire than their peers in the control group. This short duration pilot study of one ELM theme holds great promise for ELM's continued development.",Video Meta Results Raw,Lysenko L and Rosenfield S and Dedic H and Savard A and Idan E and Abrami PC and Wade CA and Naffi N,,,0,46

We reviewed the applications intended to complement traditional curriculum materials for K-12. We found 87 research articles on augmented reality learning experiences (ARLEs) in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library and other learning technology publications. Forty-three of these articles conducted user studies, and seven allowed the computation of an effect size to the performance of students in a test. In our meta-analysis, research show that ARLEs achieved a widely variable effect on student performance from a small negative effect to a large effect, with a mean effect size of 0.56 or moderate effect. To complement this finding, we performed a qualitative analysis on the design aspects for ARLEs: display hardware, software libraries, content authoring solutions, and evaluation techniques. We explain that AR incur three inherent advantages: real world annotation, contextual visualization, and vision-haptic visualization. We illustrate these advantages through the exemplifying prototypes, and ground these advantages to multimedia learning theory, experiential learning theory, and animate vision theory. Insights from this review are aimed to inform the design of future ARLEs. © 2013 IEEE.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Kindergarten; Computers; Visualization; Cognitive Processes; Multimedia Instruction; Learning Theories; Memorization; Computer Software; Simulated Environment; Design; Questionnaires; Effect Size; Academic Achievement; Meta Analysis; Evaluation Methods; Program Effectiveness; Elementary Secondary Education; Equipment; Educational Technology; Experiential Learning; Literature Reviews; Technology Uses in Education; Qualitative Research; Performance; Augmented reality learning experience; Evaluation method; Learning theory; Meta-analysis; Prototyping; Augmented reality; Curricula; Digital libraries; Software prototyping; Educational settings; Experiential learning theories; Learning experiences; Multimedia learning theory; Reality learning; Engineering education; Video Meta Results Raw",Santos ME and Chen A and Taketomi T and Yamamoto G and Miyazaki J and Kato H,,,0,47
50,Diagnostic accuracy of nasal nitric oxide for establishing diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia: a meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: To date, diagnosis of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) remains difficult and challenging. We systematically evaluated the diagnostic performance of nasal Nitric Oxide (nNO) measurement for the detection of PCD, using either velum-closure (VC) or non-velum-closure (non-VC) techniques. METHODS: All major electronic databases were searched from inception until March 2015 using appropriate terms. The sensitivity and specificity of nNO measurement was calculated in PCD patients diagnosed by transmission electron microscopy, high speed video-microscopy or genetic testing. Summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves were drawn using the parameters of the fitted models. RESULTS: Twelve studies provided data for 13 different populations, including nine case-control (n = 793) and four prospective cohorts (n = 392). The overall sensitivity of nNO measured by VC techniques was 0.95 (95 % CI 0.91-0.97), while specificity was 0.94 (95 % CI 0.88-0.97). The positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of the test was 15.8 (95 % CI 8.1-30.6), whereas the negative likelihood ratio (LR-) was 0.06 (95 % CI 0.04-0.09). For non-VC techniques, the overall sensitivity of nNO measurement was 0.93 (95 % CI 0.89-0.96) whereas specificity was 0.95 (95 % CI 0.82-0.99). The LR+ of the test was 18.5 (95 % CI 4.6-73.8) whereas the LR- was 0.07 (95 % CI 0.04-0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic accuracy of nNO measurement both with VC and non-VC maneuvers is high and can be effectively employed in the clinical setting to detect PCD even in young children, thus potentiating early diagnosis. Measurement of nNO merits to be part of a revised diagnostic algorithm with the most efficacious combination of tests to achieve PCD diagnosis.",Video Meta Results Raw,Kouis P and Papatheodorou SI and Yiallouros PK,,,0,48
51,"The complexity of obesity in UK adolescents: relationships with quantity and type of technology, sleep duration and quality, academic performance and aspiration","BackgroundContemporary technology and multiple device use may link to increased body mass index (BMI). The sleep-obesity relationship is inconsistent in adolescents. Sleep duration and quality may have crucial connections to obesity development, particularly in adolescents where sleep alterations are common. Elevated BMI in adolescents may influence academic performance and aspiration, but data are limited. ObjectivesThe objectives of this study was to assess the linear associations between BMIz-score and (i) quantity/type of technology used; (ii) sleep quantity/quality and (iii) academic performance/aspiration. MethodsConsenting adolescents (n=624; 64.9% girls, aged 11-18 years) were recruited. The Schools Sleep Habits Survey and Technology Use Questionnaire were administered. Objective measures of height/weight were obtained. ResultsQuantity of technology was positively associated with BMIz-score =0.10, P<0.01. Those who always engaged in video gaming had significantly higher BMIz-score vs. never-users, =1.00, P<0.001. Weekday sleep duration and sleep onset latency were related to BMIz-score, =-0.24, P<0.001 and =0.01, P<0.001, respectively. An inverse linear association was observed between BMIz-score and academic performance, =-0.68, P<0.001. ConclusionsIf confirmed prospectively, reducing bedtime use of technology and improving sleep hygiene in adolescents could be an achievable intervention for attenuating obesity with potentially positive effects on academic performance.",Video Meta Results Raw,Arora T and Hosseini-Araghi M and Bishop J and Yao GL and Thomas GN and Taheri S,,,0,49
52,Spatial Ability Mediates the Gender Difference in Middle School Students' Science Performance,"Prior research has demonstrated a male advantage in spatial skills and science achievement. The present research integrated these findings by testing the potential role of spatial skills in gender differences in the science performance of eighth-grade students (13-15 years old). In Study 1 (N = 113), the findings showed that mental rotation ability mediated gender differences in physical science and technology/engineering test scores. In Study 2 (N = 73,245), science performance was examined in a state population of eighth-grade students. As in Study 1, the results revealed larger gender differences on items that showed higher correlations with mental rotation. These findings underscore the importance of considering spatial training interventions aimed at reducing gender differences in the science performance of school-aged children.",Video Meta Results Raw,Ganley CM and Vasilyeva M and Dulaney A,,,0,50
53,Decoding training effectiveness: the role of organisational factors,"Purpose - Organisations invest heavily in training and development initiatives (Miller, 2012). However, a small percentage of what is learnt by the trainees from training gets transferred to the job (Mackay, 2007). The purpose of this study is to extend previous findings and examine various organisational factors, which have not been studied sufficiently, that influence training transfer. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model based on previous research work is hypothesised and tested. The sample included 123 full-time employees working at one of the major public sector organisations operating in India. Findings - The result suggested that training transfer climate, training awareness, participation and involvement in training decision and training assessment mechanism were found to be positively and significantly related to perceived training transfer. Research limitations/implications - Typical limitations consistent with self- report measures (e.g. social desirability) apply to this study as well. Another limitation was the small sample size. Future studies should assess a large sample size. Future research may assess the extent to which not only trainees but also other training stakeholders, such as trainers and supervisors, feel accountable and responsible for training and its transfer. This would provide a stronger test of the accountability hypothesis. It would also be worthwhile to study the type of evaluation/assessment mechanism that would be more appropriate for training transfer. Practical implications - Organisations should take care of these organisational factors for increasing the transfer of training at the workplace. Organisations can have better control over these factors compared to individual-related variables. Future research studies may also look at the role of evaluation/assessment feedback in training transfer. Finally, the mediating or moderating role of some of the organisational factors can also be considered for future research work. Originality/value - This study is an attempt to add value to the present literature on training transfer by focusing on organisational factors. Most factors studied were neglected by previous research studies. Hence, this is a moderate attempt to add to the transfer of training literature.",Training transfer; Training effectiveness; Pre-training factors; Training assessment; Training awareness; SITUATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS; SCIENCE; CLIMATE; PARTICIPATION; METAANALYSIS; OPPORTUNITY; MOTIVATION; KNOWLEDGE; BEHAVIOR; OUTCOMES; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Kodwani AD,,,0,51

This article reports on the development and student evaluation of WoundCare: An Interactive Learning Program for Health Professionals (version 1.0a). Of particular interest to those involved in nursing education is the extent to which the learning activities incorporated in WoundCare promote \deep\' rather than \'surface' learning. Specific design features believed to facilitate and inhibit deep learning are identified. Modifications that could increase the learning effectiveness of WoundCare and other interactive multimedia programs are proposed.',Video Meta Results Raw,Ross CC and Tuovinen JE,,,0,52
55,Pain Offset Reduces Rumination in Response to Evoked Anger and Sadness,"Four studies examined whether pain offset reduces rumination in response to anger or sadness. Past research has demonstrated that, following the offset of pain, individuals show a distinct state of relief involving both reduction in negative affect and an increase in positive affect. This response may help to explain why people sometimes seek out pain and discomfort (e.g., vigorous exercise, self-harm) to regulate negative emotion and suggests that following pain people should recover better from negative emotional states. To test this, we examined ruminative responses to anger and sadness. These negative, approach-related emotions often produce rumination; a response that is generally considered maladaptive. In Study 1, pain was manipulated through a cold pressor task, and participants were induced to experience anger through autobiographical recall. In Study 2, pain was also manipulated pain via a cold pressor task, and anger and sadness were induced through social exclusion using the Cyberball paradigm. In Study 3, pain was manipulated by squeezing exercise handgrips, and sadness was induced with imagery from a sad video. Study 4 replicated the methods of Study 3 and added measures of relief and distraction to examine whether these moderated the effect. A minimeta-analysis showed that, across all studies, individuals engaged in less rumination in the pain conditions as measured by a thought-listing task and a self-reported rumination questionnaire. These results suggest that the regulation of anger and sadness are improved following pain offset.","emotion; emotion regulation; pain; rumination; relief; COGNITIVE-DISSONANCE; EMOTION REGULATION; SELF-INJURY; DEPRESSIVE-DISORDERS; NEGATIVE AFFECT; EXERCISE; CONSEQUENCES; METAANALYSIS; EXPRESSION; EXPERIENCE; Psychology, Social; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Harmon-Jones C and Hinton E and Tien J and Summerell E and Bastian B,,,0,53
56,Revisiting trainee reactions: A multilevel analysis of the nomological network,"Surveying participants' reactions remains the most popular approach to evaluate training programs. However, it is unclear how reactions are related to training contexts and outcomes. Using a multilevel analysis, this study examined the structural relationships among individual/situational characteristics, trainee reactions, and training outcomes in mandatory safety and health training programs. We analyzed data from 545 participants of 29 face-to-face training classes who completed three sequential surveys. The results revealed that pre-training motivation and the classroom setting are associated with reactions, and reactions are associated with participatory behavior, cognitive learning, and perceived transfer. Trainee reactions significantly mediated the relationships of pre-training motivation and the classroom setting with training outcomes. The significance of this study is identifying the roles of trainee reactions in training, applying a multilevel analysis in training research.","affective reactions; learning; participation; reactions; situational characteristics; trainee characteristics; transfer; utility reaction; OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; MOTIVATION; METAANALYSIS; PARTICIPATION; ASSIGNMENT; PROGRAMS; MODELS; Industrial Relations & Labor; Psychology, Applied; Management; Business & Economics; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Kim S and Park S and Lavelle J and Kim M and Chaudhuri S,,,0,54
57,A meta-analysis of how signaling affects learning with media,"The signaling effect states that learners profit from cues that highlight the organization of specific relevant information within materials. This meta-analysis includes 103 studies and N = 12,201 participants. 139 retention and 70 transfer performance measures were used to determine separate mean effect sizes. Cognitive load, motivation/affect, learning time, and eye-tracking data were included as dependent variables to explain possible effect mechanisms. Additionally, nine possible moderators (e.g., type of signaling) were identified. The retention (g+ = 0.53, 95% CI [0.42, 0.64]) and transfer (g+ = 0.33, 95% CI [0.22, 0.43]) sizes support the positive effect of signaling on motivation/affect, learning time, and learning-relevant fixations. Cognitive load was significantly reduced. In contrast to the expertise reversal effect hypothesis, prior knowledge was not identified as a moderator of the signaling effect. The results were interpreted using media learning theories.

58,Validity Threats in Quantitative Data Collection With Games: A Narrative Survey,"Background. Games are increasingly used to collect scientific data. Some suggest that game features like high cognitive load may limit the inferences we can draw from such data, yet no systematic overview exists of potential validity threats of game-based methods. Aim. We present a narrative survey of documented and potential threats to validity in using games for quantitative data collection. Method. We combined an unsystematic bottom-up literature review with a systematic top-down application of standard validity threat typologies to games to arrive at a systematisation of game-characteristic validity threats. Results. We identify three game characteristics that potentially impact validity: Games are complex systems, impeding the predictable control and isolation of treatments. They are rich in unwanted variance and diversity. And their social framing can differ from and interact with the framing of research studies or non-game situations they are supposed to represent. The diversity of gamers and their differences to general populations bring further complications. Discussion and Conclusions. The wealth of potential validity threats in game-based research is met by a dearth of systematic methodological studies, leading us to outline several future research directions.","applied games; data collection; game-based methods; games with a purpose; research gamification; validity; validity threats; VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR; FEELINGS; METAANALYSIS; COGNITION; THOUGHTS; EXPOSURE; AROUSAL; PLAYERS; Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Social; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Education & Educational Research; Psychology; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw",Gundry D and Deterding S,,,0,56

It begins with a description of a multimedia learning scenario, a cognitive theory of multimedia learning, and a set of design principles that lead to constructivist learning. Then, results from more than 40 studies are reviewed. In combination, these studies explore the conditions under which multimedia environments promote problem-solving transfer of scientific and mathematical principles.

61,The paradox of relaxation training: Relaxation induced anxiety and mediation effects of negative contrast sensitivity in generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder,"Background: The Contrast Avoidance Model postulates that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) fear a sharp spike in negative emotion, and thus, prefer to worry to maintain their negative affect rather than being in a more euthymic state, such as relaxation. Relaxation induced anxiety (RIA) is a paradoxical phenomenon wherein people experience a spike in their anxiety during relaxation training. Because these phenomena may be related and may also operate among individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), we attempted to test whether negative contrast sensitivity was a mediator of GAD or MDD in the prediction of RIA. Methods: Individuals with GAD (n = 32), MDD (n = 34), and healthy controls (n = 30) were exposed to a negative emotional contrast by engaging with relaxation practice and then watching a negative emotional video. This was followed by the assessment of their negative contrast sensitivity. After this, participants engaged again with relaxation and RIA was measured. We examined mediation effects of negative contrast on the relationship between diagnostic status and RIA. Results: Negative contrast sensitivity fully mediated GAD and partially mediated MDD in predicting RIA. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypotheses that negative contrast sensitivity is the mediator of both GAD and MDD in predicting RIA. This may have implications for assessment and treatment of GAD and MDD.",Relaxation induced anxiety; Contrast Avoidance Model; Generalized anxiety disorder; Major depressive disorder; Mediation analysis; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL-THERAPY; RUMINATIVE SELF-FOCUS; PANIC ATTACKS; INVENTORY-II; WORRY; VALIDATION; MULTICOLLINEARITY; INTERVENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; MECHANISMS; Clinical Neurology; Psychiatry; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Kim H and Newman MG,,,0,59

63,Single Versus Multi-Incisional Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background: Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) is conventionally performed through multiple small incisions (C-VATS). Recent studies have reported encouraging results with the single-incision VATS (S-VATS) over the conventional technique. However, these studies were either small in size, unfocused, nonuniform, retrospective, lacking follow-up information, or focused on pain. We aim to validate previously reported results in a single large meta-analysis, including only the best evidence studies available. Methods: Systematic review of the PubMed archive was conducted to include only full English articles with Newcastle Ottawa Scale score >= 7. The primary outcome was the complications rate while secondary outcomes were operative time, resected lymph nodes (LNs), chest tube duration, estimated blood loss, length of postoperative stay (LOS), and postoperative pain on day 1 after surgery. Odds ratio and standard mean difference were used as effect estimates. Random model and leave-one-out analysis were used. Results: A total of 39 studies were included with 4635 patients (1686 S-VATS versus 2949 C-VATS). S-VATS has resulted in significantly less postoperative pain (P.05). Subgroup comparison of the rate of complications between lung resections versus other intrathoracic procedures, lung cancer versus pneumothorax, and lung cancer versus other lung-only lesions did not show any significant differences between the groups. Conclusion: Performing S-VATS technique has shown superior postoperative outcomes over the C-VATS technique in the treatment of thoracic disorders. Substantial benefit was confirmed in terms of less postoperative pain, blood loss, drainage time, and postoperative hospital stay.",single/one/uniportal VATS; video-assisted thoracic surgery; conventional VATS; multiportal VATS; multi-incisional VATS; PRIMARY SPONTANEOUS PNEUMOTHORAX; THORACOSCOPIC SURGERY; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; LEARNING-CURVE; LUNG-CANCER; SILS PORT; LOBECTOMY; VATS; FEASIBILITY; RESECTION; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Abouarab AA and Rahouma M and Kamel M and Ghaly G and Mohamed A,,,0,61
64,A systematic review of left ventricular cardio-endoscopic surgery,"Better visualisation, accurate resection and avoidance of ventriculotomy associated with use of endoscopic devices during intracardiac surgery has led to increasing interest in their use. The possibility of combining a cardio-endoscopic technique with either minimally invasive or totally endoscopic cardiac surgery provides an incentive for its further development. Several devices have been used, however their uptake has been limited due to uncertainty around their impact on patient outcomes. A systematic review of the literature identified 34 studies, incorporating 54 subjects undergoing treatment of left ventricular tumours, thrombus or hypertrophic myocardium using a cardio-endoscopic technique. There were no mortalities (0%; 0/47). In 12 studies, the follow-up period was longer than 30 days. There were no post-operative complications apart from one case of atrial fibrillation (2.2%; 1/46). Complete resection of left ventricular lesion was achieved in all cases (100%; 50/50). These successful results demonstrate that the cardio-endoscopic technique is a useful adjunct in resection of left ventricular tumours, thrombus and hypertrophic myocardium. This approach facilitates accurate resection of pathological tissue from left ventricle whilst avoiding exposure related valvular damage and adverse effects associated with ventriculotomy. Future research should focus on designing adequately powered comparative randomised trials focusing on major cardiac and cerebrovascular morbidity outcomes in both the short and long-term. In this way, we may have a more comprehensive picture of both the safety and efficacy of this technique and determine whether such devices could be safely adopted for routine use in minimal access or robotic intra-cardiac surgery.",Cardioscopy; Left ventricular tumor; Thrombus; Hypertrophic myocardium; VIDEO-ASSISTED REMOVAL; PAPILLARY FIBROELASTOMA; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; RESECTION; MYXOMA; MANAGEMENT; THROMBUS; MASS; ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; THORACOSCOPE; Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Video Meta Results Raw,Soylu E and Kidher E and Ashrafian H and Stavridis G and Harling L and Athanasiou T,,,0,62
65,A systematic literature review of early posttraumatic interventions for victims of violent crime,"Criminal acts are the most common traumatic events to which the general population is exposed. Developing clinical guidelines for preventing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among victims of violent crime would help to reduce the mental health costs related to these events. The goal of the current article was to systematically review published studies on the efficacy of early interventions for victims of violent crime. Of the twelve selected studies, six evaluated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), four evaluated psychological debriefing (PD) and two evaluated another type of intervention (i.e., video). Our review found modest and inconsistent effects of active early interventions. CBT appeared to be the most promising early intervention when compared to an assessment condition or a progressive relaxation group, but relatively equivalent to supportive counselling. No proof of efficacy was found for PD compared to other interventions or a control group. A psychoeducational video for rape victims appeared to help a subgroup of victims. The assessment conditions and PD led to similar reductions in posttraumatic symptoms, while CBT had a greater impact. Further research is needed in order to develop early interventions to prevent PTSD, improve quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs.

66,A Heuristic Framework of Spatial Ability: a Review and Synthesis of Spatial Factor Literature to Support its Translation into STEM Education,"An abundance of empirical evidence exists identifying a significant correlation between spatial ability and educational performance particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Despite this evidence, a causal explanation has yet to be identified. Pertinent research illustrates that spatial ability can be developed and that doing so has positive educational effects. However, contention exists within the relevant literature concerning the explicit definition for spatial ability. There is therefore a need to define spatial ability relative to empirical evidence which in this circumstance relates to its factor structure. Substantial empirical evidence supports the existence of unique spatial factors not represented in modern frameworks. Further understanding such factors can support the development of educational interventions to increase their efficacy and related effects in STEM education. It may also lead to the identification of why spatial ability has such a significant impact on STEM educational achievement as examining more factors in practice can help in deducing which are most important. In light of this, a synthesis of the spatial factors offered within existing frameworks with those suggested within contemporary studies is presented to guide further investigation and the translation of spatial ability research to further enhance learning in STEM education.","Spatial ability; Spatial factors; STEM education; Human intelligence; MENTAL ROTATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; ENGINEERING STUDENTS; COGNITIVE-ABILITIES; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; TEST-PERFORMANCE; SEX-DIFFERENCES; PRIMARY-SCHOOL; META-ANALYSIS; Psychology, Educational; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Buckley J and Seery N and Canty D,,,0,64

Here we ask whether it may be possible to train individuals to enhance their generalization abilities despite this natural trade-off. We first review the proposal that enhanced attentional control and cognitive flexibility may be potential mechanisms that will produce broad generalization. We then consider the case of action video game play which has been associated with enhancements in both attentional control and cognitive flexibility as well as generalization beyond the trained intervention.","ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; COGNITIVE SKILLS; PLAYERS; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; EXPERIENCE; SELECTION; SEARCH; TASK; Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychology, Experimental; Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Bavelier D and Bediou B and Green CS,,,0,65
68,Web-based Personalised System of Instruction: An effective approach for diverse cohorts with virtual learning environments?,"The Personalised System of Instruction is a form of mastery learning which, though it has been proven to be educationally effective, has never seriously challenged the dominant lecture-tutorial teaching method in higher education and has largely fallen into disuse. An information and communications technology assisted version of the Personalised System of Instruction using a virtual learning environment is promoted here based on the authors' longitudinal design research into this pedagogy. The particular elements of the virtual learning environment which are promoted are short video clips, online formative tests and an assessment management system. The authors present their experiences of developing and deploying this pedagogy for the teaching of introductory discrete mathematics to large classes of Computer Science students at two UK higher education institutions both with whole cohorts and 'at risk' groups of students. In particular, this method is promoted as particularly helpful to students who do not adopt a deep approach to learning as many students fail to do. Moreover 'at risk' students using this method (n = 71) demonstrated an average Glass effect size of 0.83 compared with other 'at risk' students who did not (n = 35). Based on these experiences, this pedagogy is promoted as an effective approach to teaching in higher education, especially the teaching of cognitive skills to diverse cohorts of students on foundation level modules.

70,Enhancing Example-Based Learning: Teaching on Video Increases Arousal and Improves Problem-Solving Performance,"Recent findings show that after studying a text, teaching the learned content on video to a fictitious peer student improves learning more than restudying the content. This benefit may be in part due to increased arousal associated with the teaching activity. The present experiment investigated whether teaching on video is also effective for acquiring problem-solving skills from worked examples, and explored the role of cognitive load, worry, and arousal. Participants (N = 61 university students) first studied two worked examples on electrical circuits troubleshooting and completed a practice problem. Then they either taught the content of a worked example of the practice problem on video (teaching condition) or studied that worked example (control condition) for the same amount of time. Self-reported cognitive load was measured after each task and self-reported worry after the final task. Effects on arousal were explored via the Empatica wristband measuring electrodermal activity (EDA; i.e., galvanic skin response). Teaching the content of the worked example on video was not associated with more worry, but did result in higher perceived cognitive load, more arousal, and better performance on isomorphic and transfer problems on the posttest. Although this finding has to be interpreted with caution, teaching also seemed to moderate the effect of prior knowledge on transfer that was present in the study condition. This suggests that teaching is particularly effective for students who initially have low prior knowledge. Educational Impact and Implications Statement Studying examples of how to solve a problem is a very effective way of learning new problem-solving skills. We examined whether the effectiveness of example study could be enhanced further by teaching the content of an example in front of a camera to a fictitious peer student. Our findings indicate that after an initial study phase, teaching the content of an example on video results in better performance on problems on a posttest than studying the example for the same duration. This benefit does not seem to be a result of the increased excitement/arousal associated with the teaching activity. This study provides further evidence that teaching on video is an effective learning strategy, which could be interesting and relatively easy to implement for educational practice.","example-based learning; arousal; teaching; explaining; video; INSTRUCTIONAL-DESIGN; SOCIAL FACILITATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SELF-EXPLANATION; STRESS; EFFICIENCY; MEMORY; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; METAANALYSIS; STRATEGIES; Psychology, Educational; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Hoogerheide V and Renkl A and Fiorella L and Paas F and van Gog T,,,0,67
71,Your Way to a Better Theory of Mind: A Healthy Diet Relates to Better Faux Pas Recognition in Older Adults,"Background/Study Context: Aging is characterized by a well-documented worsening of general cognition, and also a decline in social understanding such as the ability to recognize emotions or detect socially inappropriate behavior (faux pas). Several studies have demonstrated that lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, social integration, smoking) tend to offset general cognitive decline, and we examined whether they also help to offset age-related declines in social cognition. Methods: There were 56 participants aged 60years or over. General cognition was measured using a matrices task and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Emotion recognition was measured by the matching of faces to emotion sounds and bodies to sounds. Faux pas recognition was measured by 16 videos, examining participants' ability to differentiate appropriate and inappropriate social behavior. Diet, exercise, social integration, and smoking habits were measured via questionnaires. Results: For general cognition, diet, pr=.32, p<.02, smoking, pr=-.32, p=.02, and education, pr=.48, p<.001, explained unique variance in matrices performance. For social cognition, even after accounting for participants' education, age, exercise habits, smoking, and social integration, a healthy diet explained independent variance in the ability to identify appropriate social behavior, pr=.29, p=.04. Conclusion: We replicated previous research in finding that lifestyle factors were related to fluid intelligence. In addition, we obtained the novel finding that a healthy diet is associated with better recognition of faux pas in older adults, likely acting through facilitation of brain health, and providing initial support for a means of enhancing social functioning and well-being in old age.",Video Meta Results Raw,Ruffman T and Zhang J and Taumoepeau M and Skeaff S,,,0,68
72,Body surface area is a novel predictor for surgical complications following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for lung adenocarcinoma: a retrospective cohort study,"Background: Body surface area (BSA) is a biometric unit to measure the body size. Its clinical significance in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was rarely understood. We aimed to estimate the predictive value of BSA for surgical complications following VATS anatomical resections for lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). Methods: A single-center retrospective analysis was performed on the consecutive patients between July 2014 and January 2016 in our institution. The differences in mean BSA values were evaluated between groups of patients classified by the development of postoperative surgical complications (PSCs), overall morbidity and cardiopulmonary complications, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine a threshold value of BSA on prediction of PSC occurrence. A multivariate logistic-regression model involving this optimal cut-off value and other significant parameters was established to identify the predictors for PSCs. Results: During the study period, a total of 442 patients undergoing VATS anatomical resections for LAC were enrolled in this study. There were 135 patients developed with one or more complications (rate = 30.5%). PSCs occupied the largest percentages of all these complications (n = 81, rate = 18.3%). The mean BSA in PSC group was significantly higher than that in non-PSC group (1.76 +/- 0.15 m(2) vs 1.71 +/- 0.16 m(2); P = 0.016). No difference was found in mean BSA values between groups classified by any other complication. The ROC analysis determined a BSA value of 1.68 m(2) to be the threshold value with the maximum joint sensitivity of 72.8% and specificity of 48.5%. Compared to patients with BSA = 1.68 m(2), patients with BSA > 1.68 m(2) had significantly higher incidences of prolonged air leak (P = 0.006) and chylothorax (P = 0.004). Further multivariate logistic-regression analysis indicated that BSA > 1.68 m(2) could be an independent risk factor for PSCs (odds ratio: 2.03; P = 0.025). Conclusions: BSA is an excellent categorical predictor for surgical complications following VATS anatomical resections for LAC. It may be considered when informing patients about surgical risks and selecting cases in the early learning curve.

74,Effects of Animal-Assisted Therapy on Concentration and Attention Span in Patients With Acquired Brain Injury: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective: Previous studies have reported that brain-injured patients frequently suffer from cognitive impairments such as attention and concentration deficits. Numerous rehabilitation clinics offer animal-assisted therapy (AAT) to address these difficulties. The authors' aim was to investigate the immediate effects of AAT on the concentration and attention span of brain-injured patients. Method: Nineteen patients with acquired brain injury were included in a randomized, controlled, within-subject trial. The patients alternately received 12 standard therapy sessions (speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy) and 12 paralleled AAT sessions with comparable content. A total of 429 therapy sessions was analyzed consisting of 214 AAT and 215 control sessions. Attention span and instances of distraction were assessed via video coding in Noldus Observer. The Mehrdimensionaler Befindlichkeitsbogen ([Multidimensional Affect Rating Scale] MDBF questionnaire; Steyer, Schwenkmezger, Notz, & Eid, 1997) was used to measure the patient's self-rated alertness. Concentration was assessed through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) via self-assessment and therapist's ratings. Results: The patients' attention span did not differ whether an animal was present or not. However, patients displayed more instances of distraction during AAT. Moreover, patients rated themselves more concentrated and alert during AAT sessions. Further, therapists' evaluation of patients' concentration indicated that patients were more concentrated in AAT compared with the control condition. Conclusions: Although the patients displayed more instances of distraction while in the presence of an animal, it did not have a negative impact on their attention span. In addition, patients reported to be more alert and concentrated when an animal was present. Future studies should examine other attentional processes such as divided attention and include neurobiological correlates of attention.","animal-assisted therapy; brain injury; concentration; attention; rehabilitation; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; COGNITIVE REHABILITATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; DOG; TASK; STRESS; MEMORY; INTERVENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; HIPPOCAMPUS; Psychology, Clinical; Neurosciences; Psychology; Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw",Gocheva V and Hund-Georgiadis M and Hediger K,,,0,70
75,Gender differences in pre-adolescents' mental-rotation performance: Do they depend on grade and stimulus type?,"In psychometric mental-rotation tasks, adult male participants usually outperform females. A large body of evidence suggests that this effect is reliable, quite stable over lifespan and one of the largest cognitive gender differences. However, there are controversial findings regarding the age in which the male advantage emerges. The present study aimed at contributing to a systematic developmental research of mental rotation by examining two grades and three stimulus types in order to determine how these variables influence the gender difference. Second and fourth graders (n = 432) were tested with a paper-pencil mental-rotation task in three stimulus conditions (animal pictures, letters, cube figures). Whereas fourth graders showed a small, but significant, stimulus-independent gender difference favoring males, there was no effect of gender on the mental-rotation performance of second graders. Fourth-grade boys performed better than second-grade boys in all stimulus conditions. Fourth-grade girls, in contrast, outperformed second-grade girls in the animal pictures condition and the letters condition, but not in the cube-figures condition.

76,"Gross Anatomy Videos: Student Satisfaction, Usage, and Effect on Student Performance in a Condensed Curriculum","Anatomy educators are being tasked with delivering the same quantity and quality of material in the face of fewer classroom and laboratory hours. As a result they have turned to computer-aided instruction (CAI) to supplement and augment curriculum delivery. Research on the satisfaction and use of anatomy videos, a form of CAI, on examination performance continues to grow. The purpose of this study was to describe the usage and effect on examination scores of a series of locally produced anatomy videos after an 11% curriculum reduction. First-year medical students (n = 40) were given access to the videos and the prior year's students (n = 40) were used as historical controls. There was no significant difference in demographics between the two groups. The survey response rate was 85% (n = 34) in the experimental group. The students found the videos to be highly satisfying (median 5 5 on a five-point Likert scale, interquartile range = 1) and used them on average 1.55 times/week (SD +/- 0.77). Availability of the videos did have a statistically significant effect (4% improvement) on the final laboratory examination (p = 0.039). This suggests that the videos were a well-received form of CAI that may be useful in bridging the gap created by a reduction in gross anatomy course contact hours.

77,Real-time multi-agent systems for telerehabilitation scenarios,"Telerehabilitation in older adults is most needed in the patient environments, rather than in formal ambulatories or hospitals. Supporting such practices brings significant advantages to patients, their family, formal and informal caregivers, clinicians, and researchers. This paper presents a focus group with experts in physiotherapy and telerehabilitation, debating on the requirements, current techniques and technologies developed to facilitate and enhance the effectiveness of telerehabilitation, and the still open challenges. Particular emphasis is given to (i) the body-parts requiring the most rehabilitation, (ii) the typical environments, initial causes, and general conditions, (iii) the values and parameters to be observed, (iv) common errors and limitations of current practices and technological solutions, and (v) the envisioned and desired technological support. Consequently, it has been performed a systematic review of the state of the art, investigating what types of systems and support currently cope with telerehabilitation practices and possible matches with the outcomes of the focus group. Technological solutions based on video analysis, wearable devices, robotic support, distributed sensing, and gamified telerehabilitation are examined. Particular emphasis is given to solutions implementing agent-based approaches, analyzing and discussing strength, limitations, and future challenges. By doing so, it has been possible to relate functional requirements expressed by professional physiotherapists and researchers, with the need for extending multi-agent systems (MAS) peculiarities at the sensing level in wearable solutions establishing new research challenges. In particular, to be employed in safety-critical cyber-physical scenarios with user-sensor and sensor-sensor interactions, MAS are requested to handle timing constraints, scarcity of resources and new communication means, crucial to providing real-time feedback and coaching. Therefore, MAS pillars such as the negotiation protocol and the agent's internal scheduler have been investigated, proposing solutions to achieve the aforementioned real-time compliance.","Wearable multi-agent systems; Real-time multi-agent systems; Telerehabilitation; Real-time negotiation; Real-time scheduler; MAS; COGNITIVE REHABILITATION; CARE; TELEMEDICINE; NETWORKS; DISEASE; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Biomedical; Medical Informatics; Computer Science; Engineering; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw",Calvaresi D and Marinoni M and Dragoni AF and Hilfiker R and Schumacher M,,,0,73
78,Learning Mathematics in Metacognitively Oriented ICT-Based Learning Environments: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"This article encompasses a systematic review of the research on ICT-based learning environments for metacognitively oriented K-12 mathematics education. This review begins with a brief overview of the research on metacognition and mathematics education and on ICT and mathematics education. Based on a systematic screening of the databases Web of Science and ERIC wherein three elements-ICT-based learning environments, metacognitive pedagogies, and mathematics-are combined, 22 articles/studies were retrieved, situated at various educational levels (kindergarten, elementary school, and secondary school). This review revealed a variety of studies, particularly intervention studies, situated in elementary and secondary schools. Most studies involved drill-and-practice software, intelligent tutoring systems, serious games, multimedia environments, and computer-supported collaborative learning environments, with metacognitive pedagogies either integrated into the ICT software itself or provided externally by the teacher, mainly for arithmetic or algebraic word problem-solving but also related to other mathematical topics. All studies reported positive effects on mathematical and/or metacognitive learning outcomes. This review ends with a discussion of issues for further theoretical reflection and empirical research. © 2019 Lieven Verschaffel et al.",ONLINE; CHILDREN; SUPPORT; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Verschaffel L and Depaepe F and Mevarech Z,,,0,74
79,Meta-analysis of the modality effect,"This article reviews research on the modality effect, the educational practice of presenting to-be-learned graphical information visually, and related textual information through an auditory mode. Meta-analytic methods were applied to 43 independent effects (39 between-subjects designs, 4 within-subjects designs). Major hypotheses regarding the instructional benefits of presenting information across modalities were supported, including the effect of two hypothesised moderators, level of element interactivity and pacing of presentation, and between certain fields of study. The strong observed modality effect under system-paced conditions must be weighed against the additional cost of developing audio-visual instructional materials.

Methods: Retrospective review of all surgical cases in the DANTE trial, a randomized study of lung cancer screening with LDCT. Patient characteristics, workup, procedures, resections for benign disease, complications, tumor features, and final outcomes have been analyzed in the LDCT and in the control arm. Results: In the LDCT arm, 77 suspicious lesions were surgically managed in 72 patients. A benign lesion was diagnosed in 17 cases (22%). Major video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery resection was carried out in five lung cancer cases (7%) and segmentectomy in 11 (19%). Complete resection was achieved in 93%, and stage I rate was 73%. Two patients had a local recurrence after open lobectomy, and three had a resectable new primary. In the control group, 28 patients underwent 31 surgical procedures, in five cases (16%) for benign lesions. No major video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery resections were carried out. Resectability rate was 88%, and stage I rate was 52%. Five patients had a local recurrence and two had a second primary. Conclusions: Surgery for benign lesions is a relevant issue in screening-derived patients. Local control may be achieved by minimally invasive techniques or segmentectomy; however, developing the necessary skills requires an effort by the surgical team. Longterm survivors have a noticeable chance of developing second primary cancers or resectable recurrences and may benefit from a second resection.",Video Meta Results Raw,Infante M and Chiesa G and Solomon D and Morenghi E and Passera E and Lutman FR and Bottoni E and Cariboni U and Errico V and Voulaz E and Ferraroli G and Testori A and Inzirillo F and Chiarenza M and Roncalli M and Cavuto S and Chiti A and Alloisio M and Ravasi G,,,0,76
81,Using learning study to understand preschoolers’ learning: Challenges and possibilities,"This article reports a meta-analysis based on a multiple case study of the use of learning study (LS) to understand children’s learning in Swedish preschool. The aim is to investigate whether and how the LS model can be developed, adjusted and used to meet contemporary demands placed upon preschool teachers for increased content focus and improved cognitive outcomes. The research questions are (1) How can the LS model be adapted to understand preschool children’s learning? and (2) What challenges and possibilities arise in such process? The material consists of video documentation of eight meetings, 10 interventions and 237 individual, hands-on interviews with preschoolers collected within five LS projects in Sweden including seven researchers, 10 teachers/student teachers and 86 children. Four features (approach to learning, way of guiding the children, content focus and assessment of children’s learning) found to be possibly challenging in the tension between the school based LS model and the preschool context are used to demonstrate changes made to the LS that allowed it to be adapted to preschool settings. We conclude that the LS model may be applied and adjusted to preschool settings to deepen the teachers’ understanding of children’s learning, but the tradition of seeing learning in preschool as doing, having fun or playing should be challenged and revised in a new way unique to this setting. An educational practice combining play with learning in a more purposeful way has to be developed along with better methods to assess children’s learning.

The results are based on two correlation studies. The first study was carried out with 35 different pieces of interactive multimedia software for secondary students, and 34 pieces of interactive multimedia software for primary students were used in the second study. The teachers of special subject and class-teachers participated in these studies. The correlations between the teachers' evaluations about the interactive multimedia software and students' learning outcomes were found. The present study revealed that primary teachers' evaluations were not related to or negatively correlated with students' learning outcomes.

83,Active Video Games as a Training Tool for Individuals With Chronic Respiratory Diseases: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,"PURPOSE: Exercise is an effective treatment for reducing symptom severity and improving quality of life for patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Active video games offer a new and enjoyable way to exercise and have gained popularity in a rehabilitation setting. However, it is unclear whether they achieve comparable physiological and clinical effects as traditional exercise training. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies that included an active video game component as a form of exercise training and a comparator group in chronic respiratory disease. Two assessors independently reviewed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and extracted data for exercise capacity, quality of life, and preference of exercise model. RESULTS: Six studies were included in this review. Because of the heterogeneity of the populations, study designs, length of intervention, and outcome measures, meta-analysis could not be performed. Active video game training resulted in comparable training maximal heart rate and dyspnea levels to those achieved when exercising using a treadmill or cycle (n = 5). There was insufficient evidence (n = 3) to determine whether active video game training improved exercise capacity as measured by 6-min walk test or treadmill endurance walking. CONCLUSIONS: Although the quality of evidence was low, in a small number of studies active video games induced peak heart rates and dyspnea levels comparable with traditional exercise training. Larger and longer-term randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the impact of video game training for individuals with chronic respiratory diseases.",active video games; exercise training; exergames; respiratory disease; PULMONARY REHABILITATION; CYSTIC-FIBROSIS; EXERCISE INTERVENTION; ADULTS; MANAGEMENT; CHILDREN; PROGRAMS; FATIGUE; Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Video Meta Results Raw,Butler SJ and Lee AL and Goldstein RS and Brooks D,,,0,79
84,Changing Behavioral Lifestyle Risk Factors Related to Cognitive Decline in Later Life Using a Self-Motivated eHealth Intervention in Dutch Adults,"Background: Our labor force is aging, but aged workers are not yet coached on how to stay cognitively fit for the job. Objective: In this study, we tested whether a self-motivated, complex eHealth intervention could improve multiple health-related behaviors that are associated with cognitive aging among working Dutch adults. Methods: This quasi-experimental prospective study with a pre-post design was conducted with employees of Dutch medium to large companies. All employees with Internet access, a good understanding of the Dutch language, and who provided digital informed consent were eligible to participate. In total, 2972 participants (2110/2972, 71.11% females) with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 51.8 (SD 12.9) years were recruited; 2305 became active users of the intervention, and 173 completed the 1-year follow-up. This self-motivated eHealth lifestyle intervention stimulates participants to set personally relevant, monthly health behavior change goals using Goal Attainment Scaling and to realize these goals by implementing behavior change techniques grounded in behavior change theory. The primary outcomes were the goal-setting success rate and the change in overall lifestyle score from baseline to the 1-year follow-up; the score was based on physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol, sleep, and stress scores. The secondary outcomes were the changes in body weight, body mass index, specific lifestyle characteristics, and website usage. Results: A total of 1212 participants set 2620 behavior change goals; 392 participants assessed 1089 (1089/2288, 47.59%) goals and successfully achieved 422 (422/1089, 38.75%) of these goals. Among the goal-setting participants in follow-up, this led to a +0.81-point improvement (95% CI 0.49-1.13, P<.001) in overall lifestyle (d=0.32) and weight loss of 0.62 kg (95% CI -1.16 to -0.07, P=.03). These participants also showed significant improvement in 8 out of 11 specific lifestyle components. Conclusions: Among an adult Dutch population, this eHealth intervention resulted in lifestyle changes in behavioral risk factors associated with cognitive decline, and these improvements lasted over the period of 1 year. Given the general aging of our workforce, this eHealth intervention opens new avenues for the widespread use of cost-effective self-motivated prevention programs aimed at prevention of early-stage cognitive decline and more self-management of their risk factors.",Video Meta Results Raw,Aalbers T and Qin L and Baars MA and de Lange A and Kessels RP and Rikkert MG,,,0,80

86,"Gender, Culture, and Sex-Typed Cognitive Abilities","Although gender differences in cognitive abilities are frequently reported, the magnitude of these differences and whether they hold practical significance in the educational outcomes of boys and girls is highly debated. Furthermore, when gender gaps in reading, mathematics and science literacy are reported they are often attributed to innate, biological differences rather than social and cultural factors. Cross-cultural evidence may contribute to this debate, and this study reports national gender differences in reading, mathematics and science literacy from 65 nations participating in the 2009 round of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Consistently across all nations, girls outperform boys in reading literacy, d = -.44. Boys outperform girls in mathematics in the USA, d=.22 and across OECD nations, d=.13. For science literacy, while the USA showed the largest gender difference across all OECD nations, d=.14, gender differences across OECD nations were non-significant, and a small female advantage was found for non-OECD nations, d = -.09. Across all three domains, these differences were more pronounced at both tails of the distribution for low-and high-achievers. Considerable cross-cultural variability was also observed, and national gender differences were correlated with gender equity measures, economic prosperity, and Hofstede's cultural dimension of power distance. Educational and societal implications of such gender gaps are addressed, as well as the mechanisms by which gender differences in cognitive abilities are culturally mediated.",Video Meta Results Raw,Reilly D,,,0,82

89,Use of active video gaming in children with neuromotor dysfunction: a systematic review,"AIM: To examine current evidence on use of active video gaming (AVG) to improve motor function in children with movement disorders including cerebral palsy, developmental coordination disorder, and Down syndrome. METHOD: Scopus, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched. Included papers studied the use of AVG for improving movement-related outcomes in these populations. Parameters studied included health condition, strength of evidence, AVG delivery methods, capacity for individualizing play, outcomes addressed, effectiveness for achieving outcomes, and challenges/limitations. RESULTS: The 20 extracted articles varied in quality. Studies involved children with six different conditions using AVG in clinical, home, or school settings for 49 different motor outcomes. Dosage varied in frequency and duration. Choice of games played and difficulty level were therapist determined (n=6) or child controlled (n=14). The most common study limitations were small sample sizes and difficulty individualizing treatment. All articles showed improvement in outcomes with AVG, although differences were not consistently significant compared with conventional therapy. INTERPRETATION: Heterogeneity of measurement tools and target outcomes prevented meta-analysis or development of formal recommendations. However, AVG is feasible and shows potential for improving outcomes in this population. Additional investigations of dosing variables, utility as a home supplement to clinical care, and outcomes with larger sample sizes are merited.",neuromotor dysfunction; video games; pediatrics; quality of life; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Down Syndrome; Humans; Motor Activity; Motor Skills Disorders; Movement Disorders; Neurological Rehabilitation; Video Games; Computer Games; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Pediatrics; Quality of Life; Digital Gaming; Video Meta Results Raw,Hickman R and Popescu L and Manzanares R and Morris B and Lee SP and Dufek JS,,,0,85

Research on these instructional design effects has focused on the instructional benefits for novices of reducing split attention between spatially or temporally disparate but related elements of information. Meta-analytic techniques were applied to 50 independent studies yielding performance data. Major hypotheses regarding the instructional benefits of reducing split attention across time or space were supported, including the effect of a hypothesised moderator, the complexity of learning materials. The analyses indicate that, for complex learning materials in particular, increasing either the spatial or temporal contiguity of related elements of information can lead to substantial learning gains.

91,"Serious Games for Mental Health: Are They Accessible, Feasible, and Effective? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","INTRODUCTION: The development and use of serious games for mental health disorders are on the rise. Yet, little is known about the impact of these games on clinical mental health symptoms. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of serious games on symptoms of mental disorder. METHOD: We conducted a systematic search in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases, using mental health and serious games-related keywords. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review, and nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: All of the serious games were provided via personal computer, mostly on CD-ROM without the need for an internet connection. The studies targeted age groups ranging from 7 to 80 years old. The serious games focused on symptoms of depression (n = 2), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 2), autism spectrum disorder (n = 2), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 1), cognitive functioning (n = 2), and alcohol use disorder (n = 1). The studies used goal-oriented (n = 4) and cognitive training games (n = 6). A total of 674 participants were included in the meta-analysis (380 in experimental and 294 in control groups). A meta-analysis of 9 studies comprising 10 comparisons, using a random effects model, showed a moderate effect on improvement of symptoms [g = 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.28-0.83); P < 0.001], favoring serious games over no intervention controls. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Though the number of comparisons in the meta-analysis was small, these findings suggest that serious gaming interventions may be effective for reducing disorder-related symptoms. More studies are needed in order to attain deeper knowledge of the efficacy for specific mental disorders and the longer term effects of this new type of treatment for mental disorders.",serious games; gamification; game-based intervention; depression; anxiety; post-traumatic stress disorder; alcohol; attention; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER ADHD; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; VIRTUAL-REALITY; WORKING-MEMORY; VIDEO GAMES; THERAPY; DEPRESSION; CHILDREN; INTERVENTIONS; ADOLESCENTS; Psychiatry; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Lau HM and Smit JH and Fleming TM and Riper H,,,0,87
93,Flipped classroom improves student learning in health professions education: a meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The use of flipped classroom approach has become increasingly popular in health professions education. However, no meta-analysis has been published that specifically examines the effect of flipped classroom versus traditional classroom on student learning. This study examined the findings of comparative articles through a meta-analysis in order to summarize the overall effects of teaching with the flipped classroom approach. We focused specifically on a set of flipped classroom studies in which pre-recorded videos were provided before face-to-face class meetings. These comparative articles focused on health care professionals including medical students, residents, doctors, nurses, or learners in other health care professions and disciplines (e.g., dental, pharmacy, environmental or occupational health). METHOD: Using predefined study eligibility criteria, seven electronic databases were searched in mid-April 2017 for relevant articles. Methodological quality was graded using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). Effect sizes, heterogeneity estimates, analysis of possible moderators, and publication bias were computed using the COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS software. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of 28 eligible comparative studies (between-subject design) showed an overall significant effect in favor of flipped classrooms over traditional classrooms for health professions education (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.33, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.21-0.46, p < 0.001), with no evidence of publication bias. In addition, the flipped classroom approach was more effective when instructors used quizzes at the start of each in-class session. More respondents reported they preferred flipped to traditional classrooms. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that the flipped classroom approach in health professions education yields a significant improvement in student learning compared with traditional teaching methods.","Flipped classroom; Flipped learning; Health professions education; Meta-analysis; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; NURSING-EDUCATION; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; SATISFACTION; MATHEMATICS; OUTCOMES; TRIAL; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Hew KF and Lo CK,,,0,88

95,"Biological Motion Sensitivity, But Not Interpersonal Predictive Coding Is Impaired in Schizophrenia","Social predictive coding is now a well-established phenomenon in healthy individuals. It has been demonstrated that the communicative gestures of one agent may be effectively used to predict the actions of other agents. Individuals with schizophrenia often present social-cognitive deficits. The aim of this paper is to examine interpersonal predictive coding in patients with schizophrenia. Forty-six participants with schizophrenia and 40 healthy controls (HC) completed a simultaneous masking detection task (Interpersonal Detection Task; IDT), during which they observed point-light displays of two agents (A and B). During the communicative condition, agent A performed a communicative gesture, to which agent B responded accordingly. During the individual condition, agent A performed a noncommunicative action instead of the communicative gesture. Upon completion of the IDT, participants were asked to explicitly classify the actions of two agents based on nonmasked videos of point-light dyads. In line with previous findings, people with schizophrenia presented a reduced masking threshold for biological motion displays, and were less able to correctly recognize the actions of two agents during the explicit recognition task. However, observing the communicative gesture of agent A enhanced the visual discrimination of agent B in participants from all groups. This effect was observed despite the fact that SCZ presented overall diminished sensitivity to biological motion during IDT. Interpersonal predictive coding, which at least partially relies upon implicit processes, may be less impaired in people with schizophrenia than explicit social-cognitive processes (e.g., theory of mind).","schizophrenia; biological motion; interpersonal predictive coding; social cognition; communicative interactions; SOCIAL COGNITION; METAANALYSIS; PERCEPTION; AUTISM; SCALE; SYMPTOMS; TOOL; MIND; Psychology, Clinical; Psychiatry; Psychology; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw",Okruszek L and Piejka A and Wysokinski A and Szczepocka E and Manera V,,,0,90
96,"The Relationship between Expertise in Sports, Visuospatial, and Basic Cognitive Skills","Team sports place high demands on visuospatial and other cognitive skills. However, there is a lack of research on visuospatial skills of elite athletes and there are heterogeneous results on basic cognitive skills of this population. Therefore, this series of studies tested different cognitive skills in elite team sports athletes. In Experiment 1, elite athletes were compared to recreational athletes, but no differences were observed between the groups in choice response time (CRT) and mental rotation (MR). To see if differences could be observed when the tested groups had a greater difference in expertise and more representative stimuli, in Experiment 2, we tested CRT and MR of elite athletes who had higher level of expertise, and we also used three-dimensional human stimuli. Overall, we still found no differences in MR; however, elite athletes did have shorter CRTs. In Experiment 3, instead of testing MR, we compared elite athletes' and recreational athletes' basic cognitive skills, such as processing speed, letter readout speed, memory span, and sustained attention. We found that elite athletes only performed better in sustained attention. Building on this data, in a supplementary analysis (Experiment 4) we tested whether MR and CRTs are correlated with basic cognitive skills. Results show that processing speed is the best predictor for MR, whereas letter readout speed explains most of the variance in CRTs. Finally, we discuss these findings against the backdrop of expertise and offer implications for future studies on mental rotation.",Video Meta Results Raw,Heppe H and Kohler A and Fleddermann MT and Zentgraf K,,,0,91

98,Tactical Skills Training in Team Sports: Technological Supports for the 4P Strategy,"Since few years decision-making in team sports has been studied through a Naturalistic Decision-Making (NDM) approach. Considering the need for an intuitive and coordinated decision-making (ICDM), implications from NDM framework are examined according to literature on tactical skills training in team sports. Small-Sided Games (SSGs) are approved by a large majority of coach and researchers. Nevertheless, the pedagogical use of SSG led to implicit learning according to the Led-Constraints framework, whereas it focused on explicit learning according to the Teaching-Games-For-Understanding model. According to NDM, there is a need for a wide range of decision-making processes in team sports, so that a tactical skills training strategy should be based on a blend of implicit and explicit learning. Thus, scientists and coaches in soccer designed the 4P strategy (i.e., Positioning; Practicing; Picturing; Post-analysing). Complementary they explored the role of technology supports embedded into the 4P strategy. Results suggested that soccer players benefited from video feedback because it highlighted relevant configurations of play and helped them to share \pictures\' during small-sided games.'",Video Meta Results Raw,Kermarrec G,,,0,93
99,Observational Coding Training Methods for CBT Treatment Fidelity: A Systematic Review,"Observational coding is the gold standard for coding treatment fidelity in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This method allows researchers to objectively assess therapist behaviors to determine if CBT was delivered as intended. However, there is no standard method or protocol that ensures reliability within and between research groups, compromising comparability between studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate procedures used to train raters to quantify CBT fidelity. A systematic review was conducted. PsycINFO and Web of Science databases were reviewed for articles up until July 2015; the parameters of the search included CBT, depression, treatment fidelity, and coding/rating. A total of 521 articles were screened for inclusion, which yielded 81 articles. Data was extracted across four categories (study characteristics, training process, inter-rater reliability, and rating), and 62 codes. The results revealed variability in training approaches (e.g., 25.9% of articles reported 10–50 h of training). Very little information was provided about the training process (i.e. only one study specified training duration). Training materials were: manuals (21.0%), videos (18.5%), audiotapes (2.4%), readings (1.2%), and lectures (1.2%). Almost all (90.1%) studies did not describe the trainer, and 28.4% did not describe raters. The relation between CBT fidelity and clinical outcomes is equivocal, perhaps because intra-team and inter-team reliability is difficult to achieve. This systematic review revealed variability in training others to rate CBT fidelity, of which some approaches might inform the field for future use.

100,Long-term follow up of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding examined with video capsule endoscopy,"Background: Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a commonly used test for the evaluation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. However, long-term outcomes of patients undergoing VCE are unclear. Aims: To evaluate the long-term outcomes in patients undergoing VCE for suspected obscure bleeding including iron deficiency anemia (IDA), and determine the need for additional intervention for persistence or recurrence of symptoms in patients with a diagnostic as well as non-diagnostic VCE. Design: Retrospective cohort study within a large county hospital system. Methods: We collected information on indications and findings of VCE and outcomes including further testing, bleeding, and hemoglobin (Hgb) at last follow-up through structured review of the electronic health records. VCE findings were classified as active bleeding or high potential for bleeding (P2), intermediate potential (P1) or without any disruption of the mucosa, and no potential for bleeding (P0). We compared demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with and without normal Hgb at the time of last follow up. Results: We examined 116 patients who underwent VCEs performed for obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding during 2010 to 2012 with mean duration of follow up after VCE completion of 571 days (standard deviation [SD]=248). Abnormal VCE findings (37.9% for P1 lesions, 44.8% for P2 lesions) were seen in 106 (87.9%) patients. Additional diagnostic testing was performed in 55/ 116 (47.4%) (67.7% GI procedures). Hgb was restored to normal range in 59/116 (50.9%) by end of follow up which were attributed to iron supplementation and/or discontinuation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in a majority. Twenty six of 116 patients experienced rebleeding (22.4%). Conclusions: The diagnostic yield of VCE is high among patients with obscure GI bleeding. More than 50% of patients achieve normal Hgb in the long term with conservative measures such as iron supplementation and the discontinuation of NSAIDs.","iron deficiency anemia; obscure gastrointestinal bleeding; small bowel bleeding; video capsule endoscopy; METAANALYSIS; ENTEROSCOPY; YIELD; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Sealock RJ and Thrift AP and Ei-Serag HB and Sellin J,,,0,95
101,Psychological and psychiatric aspects of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES): A systematic review,"Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are common in neurological settings and often associated with considerable distress and disability. The psychological mechanisms underlying PNES are poorly understood and there is a lack of well-established, evidence-based treatments. This paper advances our understanding of PNES by providing a comprehensive systematic review of the evidence pertaining to the main theoretical models of this phenomenon. Methodological quality appraisal and effect size calculation were conducted on one hundred forty empirical studies on the following aspects of PNES: life adversity, dissociation, anxiety, suggestibility, attentional dysfunction, family/relationship problems, insecure attachment, defence mechanisms, somatization/conversion, coping, emotion regulation, alexithymia, emotional processing, symptom modelling, learning and expectancy. Although most of the studies were only of low to moderate quality, some findings are sufficiently consistent to warrant tentative conclusions: (i) physical symptom reporting is elevated in patients with PNES; (ii) trait dissociation and exposure to traumatic events are common but not inevitable correlates of PNES; (iii) there is a mismatch between subjective reports of anxiety and physical arousal during PNES; and (iv) inconsistent findings in this area are likely to be attributable to the heterogeneity of patients with PNES. Empirical, theoretical and clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Video Meta Results Raw,Brown RJ and Reuber M,,,0,96
103,Implementation of a study skills program for entering at-risk medical students,"While the first year of medical school is challenging for all students, there may be specific issues for students from rural areas, economically disadvantaged backgrounds, ethnic minorities, or nontraditional age groups. A Summer Prematriculation Program (SPP) was created to prepare entering at-risk students for the demands of medical school. For the past 2 yr, an emphasis was placed on the development of appropriate study plans and skills. On presurveys, students predicted an increase in their number of study hours per lecture hour, from 7.6 h in undergraduate coursework to 9.1 h in medical school coursework (n = 35). These study plans were infeasible given the rigorous didactic lecture schedule in medical school. Interventions were made through lectures on study plans and modeling of appropriate study habits using engaging lectures in the SPP physiology course. At the end of the program, a postsurvey was given, and students reported a reduction in the planned hours of study to a more realistic 3.9 h of study time per hour of lecture. Furthermore, students planned to decrease their use of textbooks while increasing their use of concept mapping, videos, and peer teaching. The majority of students completing the SPP program with a study skills emphasis performed well in the Medical Physiology course, with 4 students honoring in the course, 27 students passing, and 2 students remediating the course after an initial failure. These results indicate that at-risk medical students may have inappropriate study plans that can be improved through participation in a program that emphasizes study skills development.",Video Meta Results Raw,Miller CJ,,,0,97
104,A Game-Based Repeated Assessment for Cognitive Monitoring: Initial Usability and Adherence Study in a Summer Camp Setting,"The current feasibility study examined the adherence, reliability, and assessment potential of an evidence-based game-like mobile Monitoring Tool (Akili Interactive Labs), to monitor 100 participants' cognition for eight sessions at a summer camp for children with special needs. A validated measure of attention was administered at baseline. In the last session, participants completed an exit questionnaire. The Monitoring Tool was found to be enjoyable, and showed a high rate of adherence. No Monitor-related adverse events were reported. Monitor metrics showed good reliability across repeated measurements, indicating it is stable over long-term cognitive monitoring. There was evidence that the Monitoring Tool was able to detect differences in cognition between the children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorders.","Autism spectrum disorders; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Learning disorders; Cognition; Clinical assessment; Video game; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION DEFICITS; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; WORKING-MEMORY; CHILDREN; ADHD; METAANALYSIS; COMPUTER; MODELS; TIME; Psychology, Developmental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Flynn RM and Colon-Acosta N and Zhou J and Bower J,,,0,98
105,Effective Reading Programs for Middle and High Schools: A Best-Evidence Synthesis,"ABSTRACT This article systematically reviews research on the achievement outcomes of four types of approaches to improving the reading of middle and high school students: (1) reading curricula, (2) mixed-method models (methods that combine large-and small-group instruction with computer activities), (3) computer-assisted instruction, and (4) instructional-process programs (methods that focus on providing teachers with extensive professional development to implement specific instructional methods). Criteria for inclusion in the study were use of randomized or matched control groups, a study duration of at least 12 weeks, and valid achievement measures that were independent of the experimental treatments. A total of 33 studies met these criteria. The review concludes that programs designed to change daily teaching practices have substantially greater research support than those focused on curriculum or technology alone. Positive achievement effects were found for instructional-process programs, especially for those involving cooperative learning, and for mixed-method programs. The effective approaches provided extensive professional development and significantly affected teaching practices. In contrast, no studies of reading curricula met the inclusion criteria, and the effects of supplementary computer-assisted instruction were small.

On a trouvé des effets positifs sur la réussite pour les programmes par processus de formation, et tout particulièrement pour ceux qui comportent un apprentissage coopératif, et pour des programmes de méthode mixte. Les approches efficaces permettent un développement professionnel important et ont un effet significatif sur les pratiques d'enseignement. Par contre, aucune étude sur les programmes n'a satisfait aux conditions d'inclusion, et les effets d'un enseignement supplémentaire assisté par ordinateur sont minces.

Este artículo examina sistemáticamente la investigación sobre los resultados logrados en cuatro tipos de acercamientos al mejoramiento de la lectura en estudiantes entre el séptimo y decimosegundo grado: (1) el currículo o programa de lecturas, (2) modelos en los que se mezclan los métodos (métodos que combinan instrucción en grupos grandes y pequeños con actividades usando la computadora), (3) instrucción con la ayuda de la computadora, y (4) programas del proceso de enseñanza (métodos que se basan en el amplio desarrollo profesional de los maestros para que implementen métodos específicos de enseñanza). Para ser incluida en el estudio, la investigación tenía que haber usado grupos de control al azar o apareados, un plazo de estudio de por lo menos 12 semanas, y medidas válidas de los logros que obraran independientemente de los tratos experimentales. Un total de 33 estudios cumplieron estos requisitos. El examen llegó a la conclusión que los programas diseñados para cambiar el ejercicio diario de la enseñanza tienen mucho más apoyo investigativo que los que se concentran sólo en el currículo o la tecnología. Efectos de logros positivos fueron encontrados para los programas de proceso de enseñanza, especialmente para esos que incluían enseñanza cooperativa, y para los programas de métodos mixtos. Los acercamientos efectivos proveyeron un desarrollo profesional amplio y afectaron de forma significativa los hábitos de enseñanza. En contraste, ningún estudio sobre el currículo de lectura cumplió los requisitos, y los efectos de la enseñanza suplementada con el uso de computadoras fueron pocos.

106,Brain circuits involved in understanding our own and other?s internal states in the context of romantic relationships,"Social interactions require the capacity to understand both our and other?s internal states. These semi-independent skills, the ability to understand oneself and others, seem to rely on the same type of representations and recruit similar brain areas. In this study, we looked at the neural basis of self and other processing in the context of an interaction with a significant other. Fourty-two participants in a monogamous relationship completed an fMRI task in which they watched a set of video-vignettes of his/her romantic partner expressing emotional contents. Participants were asked to elaborate on his/her spouse?s experience (other condition) and on his/her own experience when watching the video-vignettes (self-condition). The results showed a significant overlap in the brain activation for both conditions (e.g. anterior insula, posterior cingulate/precuneus, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule). In addition, the self-condition recruited brain areas associated with interoceptive processing and affect sharing (e.g., posterior insula), whereas the other-condition engaged brain areas involved in the cognitive representation of another?s internal states and self-other distinction (e.g., fusiform, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus and temporoparietal junction).",Social cognition; theory of mind; self; other processing; romantic relationships; EMPATHIC NEURAL RESPONSES; EMOTION; SELF; MIND; METAANALYSIS; COGNITION; PAIN; PARCELLATION; REACTIVITY; JUDGMENTS; Neurosciences; Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw,Esmenio S and Soares JM and Oliveira-Silva P and Goncalves OF and Decety J and Coutinho J,,,0,100
107,Tracking emotions in the brain - Revisiting the Empathic Accuracy Task,"Many empathy tasks lack ecological validity due to their use of simplistic stimuli and static analytical approaches. Empathic accuracy tasks overcome these limitations by using autobiographical emotional video clips. Usually, a single measure of empathic accuracy is computed by correlating the participants' continuous ratings of the narrator's emotional state with the narrator's own ratings. In this study, we validated a modified empathic accuracy task. A valence-independent rating of the narrator's emotional intensity was added to provide comparability between videos portraying different primary emotions and to explore changes in neural activity related to variations in emotional intensity over time. We also added a new neutral control condition to investigate general emotional processing. In the scanner, 34 healthy participants watched 6 video clips of people talking about an autobiographical event (2 sad, 2 happy and 2 neutral clips) while continuously rating the narrator's emotional intensity. Fluctuation in perceived emotional intensity correlated with activity in brain regions previously implicated in cognitive empathy (bilateral superior temporal sulcus, temporoparietal junction, and temporal pole) and affective empathy (right anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus). When emotional video clips were compared to neutral video clips, we observed higher activity in similar brain regions. Empathic accuracy, on the other hand, was only positively related to activation in regions that have been implicated in cognitive empathy. Our modified empathic accuracy task provides a new method for studying the underlying components and dynamic processes involved in empathy. While the task elicited both cognitive and affective empathy, successful tracking of others' emotions relied predominantly on the cognitive components of empathy. The fMRI data analysis techniques developed here may prove valuable in characterising the neural basis of empathic difficulties observed across a range of psychiatric conditions.","Empathy; Emotion; Social cognition; fMRI; Ecological validity; DISTINCT NEURAL-NETWORKS; NEUROSCIENCE; METAANALYSIS; PERCEPTION; ANATOMY; OTHERS; BASES; MIND; Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Video Meta Results Raw",Mackes NK and Golm D and O'Daly OG and Sarkar S and Sonuga-Barke EJ and Fairchild G and Mehta MA,,,0,101
108,Parent-infant psychotherapy for improving parental and infant mental health,"BACKGROUND: Parent-infant psychotherapy (PIP) is a dyadic intervention that works with parent and infant together, with the aim of improving the parent-infant relationship and promoting infant attachment and optimal infant development. PIP aims to achieve this by targeting the mother's view of her infant, which may be affected by her own experiences, and linking them to her current relationship to her child, in order to improve the parent-infant relationship directly. OBJECTIVES: 1. To assess the effectiveness of PIP in improving parental and infant mental health and the parent-infant relationship.2. To identify the programme components that appear to be associated with more effective outcomes and factors that modify intervention effectiveness (e.g. programme duration, programme focus). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases on 13 January 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS Citation Index, Science Citation Index, ERIC, and Sociological Abstracts. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, checked reference lists, and contacted study authors and other experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two review authors assessed study eligibility independently. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCT) that compared a PIP programme directed at parents with infants aged 24 months or less at study entry, with a control condition (i.e. waiting-list, no treatment or treatment-as-usual), and used at least one standardised measure of parental or infant functioning. We also included studies that only used a second treatment group. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We adhered to the standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. We standardised the treatment effect for each outcome in each study by dividing the mean difference (MD) in post-intervention scores between the intervention and control groups by the pooled standard deviation. We presented standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data, and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data. We undertook meta-analysis using a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies comprising 846 randomised participants, of which four studies involved comparisons of PIP with control groups only. Four studies involved comparisons with another treatment group (i.e. another PIP, video-interaction guidance, psychoeducation, counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), two of these studies included a control group in addition to an alternative treatment group. Samples included women with postpartum depression, anxious or insecure attachment, maltreated, and prison populations. We assessed potential bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, and other bias). Four studies were at low risk of bias in four or more domains. Four studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment, and no study blinded participants or personnel to the intervention. Five studies did not provide adequate information for assessment of risk of bias in at least one domain (rated as unclear).Six studies contributed data to the PIP versus control comparisons producing 19 meta-analyses of outcomes measured at post-intervention or follow-up, or both, for the primary outcomes of parental depression (both dichotomous and continuous data); measures of parent-child interaction (i.e. maternal sensitivity, child involvement and parent engagement; infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, disorganised, resistant); attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and secondary outcomes (e.g. infant cognitive development). The results favoured neither PIP nor control for incidence of parental depression (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.04, 3 studies, 278 participants, low quality evidence) or parent-reported levels of depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.02, 4 studies, 356 participants, low quality evidence). There were improvements favouring PIP in the proportion of infants securely attached at post-intervention (RR 8.93, 95% CI 1.25 to 63.70, 2 studies, 168 participants, very low quality evidence); a reduction in the number of infants with an avoidant attachment style at post-intervention (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.95, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); fewer infants with disorganised attachment at post-intervention (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.58, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); and an increase in the proportion of infants moving from insecure to secure attachment at post-intervention (RR 11.45, 95% CI 3.11 to 42.08, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence). There were no differences between PIP and control in any of the meta-analyses for the remaining primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes.Four studies contributed data at post-intervention or follow-up to the PIP versus alternative treatment analyses producing 15 meta-analyses measuring parent mental health (depression); parent-infant interaction (maternal sensitivity); infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, resistant, disorganised) and attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and infant cognitive development. None of the remaining meta-analyses of PIP versus alternative treatment for primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes showed differences in outcome or any adverse changes.We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence. For all comparisons, we rated the evidence as low or very low quality for parental depression and secure or disorganised infant attachment. Where we downgraded the evidence, it was because there was risk of bias in the study design or execution of the trial. The included studies also involved relatively few participants and wide CI values (imprecision), and, in some cases, we detected clinical and statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency). Lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although the findings of the current review suggest that PIP is a promising model in terms of improving infant attachment security in high-risk families, there were no significant differences compared with no treatment or treatment-as-usual for other parent-based or relationship-based outcomes, and no evidence that PIP is more effective than other methods of working with parents and infants. Further rigorous research is needed to establish the impact of PIP on potentially important mediating factors such as parental mental health, reflective functioning, and parent-infant interaction.",Video Meta Results Raw,Barlow J and Bennett C and Midgley N and Larkin SK and Wei Y,,,0,102

111,Impact of a Technology-Mediated Reading Intervention on Adolescents' Reading Comprehension,"In this experimental study we examined the effects of a technology-mediated, multicomponent reading comprehension intervention, Comprehension Circuit Training (CCT), for middle school students, the majority of whom were struggling readers. The study was conducted in three schools, involving three teachers and 228 students. Using a within-teacher design, middle school teachers' reading classes were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 9) or business as usual (n = 7) conditions. In the CCT condition, students received, on average, 39 lessons of video-modeled instruction in word reading, vocabulary, and comprehension instruction during reading intervention classes. Results of multilevel structural equation models indicated statistically significant effects favoring the CCT condition on three measures: reading comprehension latent variable (ES = 0.14), proximal vocabulary (ES = 0.43), and silent reading efficiency (ES = 0.28). Subgroup analyses indicated that students with lower entry-level reading comprehension tended to benefit more from the CCT intervention in reading comprehension, silent reading efficiency, and state test scores.",reading comprehension; struggling readers; technology-mediated interventions; MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS; LEARNING-DISABILITIES; STRUGGLING READERS; EXPOSITORY TEXT; SIMPLE VIEW; METAANALYSIS; INSTRUCTION; KNOWLEDGE; OUTCOMES; DIFFICULTIES; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Fogarty M and Clemens N and Simmons D and Anderson L and Davis J and Smith A and Wang H and Kwok OM and Simmons LE and Oslund E,,,0,105
112,Comparison of video and direct laryngoscope for tracheal intubation in emergency settings: A meta-analysis,"Background: Video laryngoscope has recently been introduced as an alternative for performing intubation; however, its validity in emergency settings has not been thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess its value compared with direct laryngoscope in emergency settings. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis to assess its value compared with direct laryngoscope in emergency settings. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies published through April 2011. Trials that reported data comparing video laryngoscope versus direct laryngoscope-assisted intubation in the emergency room or prehospital locations were included. Results: Four trials reporting a total of 1305 participants were identified. During intubation, video laryngoscope failed to produce high rates of successful intubation (success rate: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-1.01). Time to intubation was not different when using either video laryngoscope or direct laryngoscope (standardized mean difference: 0.19; 95% CI: -0.20-0.58). Furthermore, video laryngoscope seems to achieve a similar glottic view as direct laryngoscope (ratio of better glottic view: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.63-1.46). Conclusion: In the reviewed studies, video laryngoscope was not superior to direct laryngoscope for performing intubation in emergency settings. © 2012.",Intubation; Laryngoscope; Meta-analysis; Videotape recording; article; direct laryngoscopy; emergency care; endotracheal intubation; glottis; human; intermethod comparison; laryngoscopy; meta analysis; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; video laryngoscopy; Video Meta Results Raw,Lee YK and Chen CC and Wang TL and Lin KJ and Su YC,,,0,106
113,Increased physical education at school improves the visual-spatial cognition during adolescence,"The main goal of this study was to investigate the influence of an established school programme with a high amount of physical education on visual-spatial ability in a secondary school. One hundred and forty-four adolescents, 69 from sport classes and 75 from regular classes, solved a cognitive processing speed task and a mental rotation task. The results reflect a better cognitive processing speed of the boys in the sports classes compared to regular classes but no differences for girls. Concerning the mental rotation performance, we found a significantly better mental rotation performance for boys and girls in the sports classes compared to regular classes due to an increased number of items worked on. Supposedly, motor expertise facilitates mental rotation performance by promoting a faster editing of the task. The benefits of sport classes in normal high school settings have to be investigated in further studies considering the effect on academic performance.","Physical activity school programme; adolescents; visual-spatial ability; MENTAL-ROTATION PERFORMANCE; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MOTOR-PERFORMANCE; ABILITY; CHILDREN; METAANALYSIS; STUDENTS; FITNESS; Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Educational; Education & Educational Research; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Jansen P and Ellinger J and Lehmann J,,,0,107
114,Patient Preferences for Receiving Education on Venous Thromboembolism Prevention - A Survey of Stakeholder Organizations,"Importance Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients and is largely preventable. Strategies to decrease the burden of VTE have focused on improving clinicians' prescribing of prophylaxis with relatively less emphasis on patient education. Objective To develop a patient-centered approach to education of patients and their families on VTE: including importance, risk factors, and benefit/harm of VTE prophylaxis in hospital settings. Design, Setting and Participants The objective of this study was to develop a patient-centered approach to education of patients and their families on VTE: including importance, risk factors, and benefit/harm of VTE prophylaxis in hospital settings. We implemented a three-phase, web-based survey (SurveyMonkey) between March 2014 and September 2014 and analyzed survey data using descriptive statistics. Four hundred twenty one members of several national stakeholder organizations and a single local patient and family advisory board were invited to participate via email. We assessed participants' preferences for VTE education topics and methods of delivery. Participants wanted to learn about VTE symptoms, risk factors, prevention, and complications in a context that emphasized harm. Although participants were willing to learn using a variety of methods, most preferred to receive education in the context of a doctor-patient encounter. The next most common preferences were for video and paper educational materials. Conclusions Patients want to learn about the harm associated with VTE through a variety of methods. Efforts to improve VTE prophylaxis and decrease preventable harm from VTE should target the entire continuum of care and a variety of stakeholders including patients and their families.",Video Meta Results Raw,Popoola VO and Lau BD and Shihab HM and Farrow NE and Shaffer DL and Hobson DB and Kulik SV and Zaruba PD and Shermock KM and Kraus PS and Pronovost PJ and Streiff MB and Haut ER,,,0,108
116,"Context counts: The different implications of weekday and weekend video gaming for academic performance in mathematics, reading, and science","Video gaming has been a source of serious concern for parents and educators, based on the belief that video games disrupt adolescents' academic activities. However, previous studies have been mixed regarding video games' effects on academic outcomes. We revisited this issue by analyzing data on approximately 30,000 adolescents from three large-scale public datasets. We consistently found that the more adolescents played video games on weekdays, the poorer they performed on standardized assessments of mathematics, reading, and science.

117,The Effectiveness of Psychosocial Interventions for Psychological Outcomes in Pediatric Oncology: A Systematic Review,"CONTEXT: This review summarizes the current randomized controlled trials literature on psychological and physical outcomes of psychosocial interventions in pediatric oncology. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of psychosocial interventions in children with cancer. METHODS: A search of the literature resulted in a total of 12 randomized clinical trials and these have evaluated psychosocial interventions in children younger than 18 years with current and previous diagnoses of cancer. Outcome measures were both psychological (e.g., symptoms of anxiety, depression, quality of life, and self-esteem) and physical (e.g., cancer symptoms, treatment adherence, and pain). Interventions identified included cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; n = 4), joint CBT and physical exercise therapy (n = 1), family therapy (n = 2), therapeutic music video (n = 2), self-coping strategies (n = 1), a wish fulfillment intervention (n = 1), and joint family therapy and CBT (n = 1). RESULTS: Nine studies reported statistically significant improvements on psychological outcomes. These findings suggest that psychosocial interventions are effective at reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as improving quality of life. Additionally, six studies found psychosocial interventions to have a positive impact on physical symptoms and well-being, including a reduction in procedural pain and symptom distress. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that mental health needs in pediatric oncology patients can and should be addressed, potentially which will lead to better mental and physical health outcomes.","Pediatric oncology; systematic review; psychosocial interventions; randomized controlled trials; mental health; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL; POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS; CHILDHOOD-CANCER; CHILDREN; SURVIVORS; VALIDITY; SCALE; METAANALYSIS; ADOLESCENTS; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medicine, General & Internal; Clinical Neurology; Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw",Coughtrey A and Millington A and Bennett S and Christie D and Hough R and Su MT and Constantinou MP and Shafran R,,,0,110
118,Mobile Learning Content Authoring Tools (MLCATs): A Systematic Review,"Mobile learning is currently receiving a lot of attention in the education arena, particularly within electronic learning. This is attributed to the increasing mobile penetration rates and the subsequent increases in university student enrolments. Mobile Learning environments are supported by a number of crucial services such as content creation which require an authoring tool. The last decade or so has witnessed increased attention on tools for authoring mobile learning content for education. This can be seen from the vast number of conference and journal publications devoted to the topic. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to review works that were published, suggest a new classification framework and explore each of the classification features. This paper is based on a systematic review of mobile learning content authoring tools (MLCATs) from 2000 to 2009. The framework is developed based on three broad dimensions i.e. Technology, Pedagogy and Usability and a number of features such as system type, development context, Tools and Technologies used, tool availability, ICTD relation, Multimedia support, tool purpose, support for standards, learning style support, intuitive Graphical User Interface and accessibility. This paper provides a means for researchers to extract assertions and several important lessons for the choice and implementation of MLCATs.",Video Meta Results Raw,Mugwanya R and Marsden G,,,0,111
119,Sympathetic pain? A role of poor parasympathetic nervous system engagement in vicarious pain states,"This study investigated the psychophysiological correlates of the subjective experience of vicarious pain; that is, a spontaneous experience of pain when seeing another in pain. Forty-nine healthy, otherwise pain-free individuals aged 18-55 years completed empathy and anxiety questionnaires and were classified into three groups: vicarious responders with high anxiety (n=11), vicarious responders with low anxiety (n=22), and nonresponders (n=16). Electrophysiological recordings of heart rate variability (HRV) during paced breathing and cognitive stress (serial sevens task) were completed before participants viewed short videos of athletes in states of pain or happiness, taken from Australian League Football matches. Change in beats per minute, relative to neutral scenes, were analyzed for the first 4 s after onset of the painful or happy event. Anxious responders had lower HF-HRV than both other groups, implicating poor parasympathetic regulation specific to states of stress. Both vicarious responder groups had elevated HR at the event onset, regardless of valence. After viewing painful injuries, nonanxious vicarious responders showed sustained HR over time, anxious responders showed HR acceleration with a peak at 3 s after the injury onset, and nonresponders showed a pattern of marked HR deceleration. These findings suggest that vicarious pain in anxious responders is associated with poorly regulated sympathetic arousal via insufficient inhibitory parasympathetic activity, whereas nonanxious persons show sustained arousal. Clearly, multiple mechanisms in the central and peripheral nervous system must play a role in vicarious pain states, and the different manifestations are likely to lead to very different behavioral consequences.",Video Meta Results Raw,Nazarewicz J and Verdejo-Garcia A and Giummarra MJ,,,0,112
120,A scoping review of research on digital game-based language learning,"The continuing attention to the educational value of digital games highlights the need for more focused literature reviews in order to identify critical gaps and opportunities in domain-specific areas. The current study thus set out to provide a scoping overview of empirical evidence on the use and impacts of digital games in language education from 2007 to 2016, as a means to advance the emerging research on digital game-based language learning (DGBLL). A total of 50 selected studies were systematically analyzed, revealing the following findings: (1) Most of the selected DGBLL studies adopted mixed methods to examine the educational use of digital games; (2) Immersive games, notably massively multiplayer online role-playing games, were the most common genre in the current DGBLL literature; (3) Most of the games for language learning were custom-built by DGBLL researchers; (4) Personal computers were the most common platforms for playing games to support language learning; (5) Most of the DGBLL studies adopted games to facilitate the learning of English as a second or foreign language; (6) Most of the research on DGBLL investigated learners with mixed levels of language proficiency; (7) University students were the most frequently selected samples in the existing DGBLL literature; and (8) The majority of DGBLL studies featured positive outcomes in regard to student learning, with the most frequently reported ones being related to affective or psychological states, closely followed by language acquisition. Taken as a whole, these findings reflect the diverse nature of this field and suggest the overall feasibility of using digital games for promoting the language and literacy learning of both native and non-native speakers in various aspects. Several promising but under researched areas were also identified in this review, along with discussions on their implications for future investigations.","Applications in subject areas; Digital games; Language learning; Literature review; Media in education; ROLE-PLAYING GAMES; COMPUTER GAMES; ENGLISH VOCABULARY; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; SERIOUS GAMES; VIDEO GAMES; EDUCATION; PERFORMANCE; LEARNERS; STUDENTS; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education & Educational Research; Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Hung HT and Yang JC and Hwang GJ and Chu HC and Wang CC,,,0,113
121,A virtual learning environment for the continuation of education and its relationship with the mental well-being of chronically ill adolescents,"Research has shown that the continuation of education by chronically ill adolescents is an important way to avoid social isolation, psychosocial problems and the accumulation of learning difficulties. In this light, virtual learning environments (VLEs), which connect sick adolescents to their schools, play an important role in ensuring that the sick adolescents continue their education, and in contributing to their mental well-being. This study investigated the extent to which a VLE supports the continuation of education and school interactions among sick adolescents and how it is related to their mental well-being. The results show that the VLE had a positive impact on supporting the continuation of education and school interactions among chronically sick adolescents and was considered very helpful to their mental well-being.",Video Meta Results Raw,Zhu C and Van Winkel L,,,0,114

124,Treatments of internet gaming disorder: a systematic review of the evidence,"Introduction: The American Psychiatric Association included Internet gaming disorder (IGD) in the 5th Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and the World Health Organization included gaming disorder in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases. These recent updates suggest significant concern related to the harms of excessive gaming.Areas covered: This systematic review provides an updated summary of the scientific literature on treatments for IGD. Inclusion criteria were that studies: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention for IGD or excessive gaming; 2) use an experimental design (i.e. multi-armed [randomized or nonrandomized] or pretest-posttest); 3) include at least 10 participants per group; and 4) include an outcome measure of IGD symptoms or gaming duration. The review identified 22 studies evaluating treatments for IGD: 8 evaluating medication, 7 evaluating cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, and 7 evaluating other interventions and psychosocial treatments.Expert opinion: Even with the recent uptick in publication of such clinical trials, methodological flaws prevent strong conclusions about the efficacy of any treatment for IGD. Additional well-designed clinical trials using common metrics for assessing IGD symptoms are needed to advance the field.",Internet gaming disorder; treatment; systematic review; video game addiction; excessive gaming; ONLINE GAME PLAY; CRAVING BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ADDICTION; BUPROPION; ADOLESCENTS; THERAPY; ESCITALOPRAM; ADULTS; Clinical Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Video Meta Results Raw,Zajac K and Ginley MK and Chang R,,,0,116
125,Design and Evaluation of a Low-Cost Bronchoscopy-Guided Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheostomy Simulator,"Introduction Bronchoscopy-guided percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (BG-PDT) is an invasive procedure regularly performed in the intensive care unit. Risk of serious complications have been estimated in up to 5%, focused during the learning phase. We have not found any published formal training protocols, and commercial simulators are costly and not widely available in some countries. The objective of this study was to present the design and simulator performance of a low-cost BG-PDT simulator. Methods A simulator was designed with materials available in a hardware store, synthetic skin pads, ex vivo bovine tracheas, and a pipe inspection camera. The simulator was tested in 8 experts and 9 novices. Sessions were video recorded, and participants were equipped with the Imperial College Surgical Device, a hand motion-tracking device. Performance was evaluated with a multimodal approach, including first attempt success rate, global success rate, total procedural time, Imperial College Surgical Device-derived proficiency parameters, and global rating scale applied blindly by 2 expert observers. A satisfaction survey was applied after the procedure. Results A simulator was successfully constructed, allowing multiple iterations per assembly, with a fixed cost of US $30 and $4 per use. Experts had greater global and first attempt success rate, performed the procedure faster, and with greater proficiency. It presented high user satisfaction and fidelity. Conclusions A low-cost BG-PDT simulator was successfully constructed, with the ability to discriminate between experts and novices, and with high fidelity. Considering its ease of construction and cost, it can be replicated in almost any intensive care unit.",Tracheostomy; simulation; low cost; percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy; intensive care medicine; critical care; CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETERIZATION; MODEL; METAANALYSIS; COMPETENCE; INSERTION; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Kattan E and Vera M and Putz F and Corvetto M and De la Fuente R and Bravo S,,,0,117
126,Psychological Vulnerability and Problem Gambling: The Mediational Role of Cognitive Distortions,"Despite numerous studies demonstrating the influence of cognitive distortions on gambling problem severity, empirical data regarding the role of psychological vulnerability on the latter is limited. Hence, this study assesses the mediating effect of cognitive distortions between psychological vulnerability (personality and mood), and gambling problem severity. It also verifies whether the relationships between these variables differs according to the preferred gambling activity. The sample is composed of 272 male gamblers [191 poker players; 81 video lottery terminal (VLT) players] aged between 18 and 82 years (M = 35.2). Bootstrap analysis results revealed that cognitive distortions mediate the effect of narcissism on gambling problem severity for both groups. The level of depression for VLT players significantly predicted gambling problem severity, both directly and indirectly via the mediating effect of cognitive distortions. Mediation analyses also indicated that narcissism had an indirect impact on problem gambling through cognitive distortions for both groups. These findings suggest that certain vulnerabilities related to personality and mood may influence cognitive distortion intensity and gambling problem severity. In addition, psychological vulnerabilities could differ based on preferred gambling activity. These results may be useful for prevention policies, identifying high risk gamblers and planning psychological interventions.","Problem gambling; Poker; Video lottery terminals; Cognitive distortion; Mediation; Personality; Mood; SENSATION SEEKING; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; PATHOLOGICAL NARCISSISM; PATHWAYS MODEL; INVENTORY; GAMBLERS; ANXIETY; METAANALYSIS; IMPULSIVITY; VALIDATION; Substance Abuse; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Substance Abuse; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Levesque D and Sevigny S and Giroux I and Jacques C,,,0,118
127,Pills or Push-Ups? Effectiveness and Public Perception of Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Cognitive Enhancement,"We review work on the effectiveness of different forms of cognitive enhancement, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological. We consider caffeine, methylphenidate, and modafinil for pharmacological cognitive enhancement (POE) and computer training, physical exercise, and sleep for non-pharmacological cognitive enhancement (NPCE). We find that all of the techniques described can produce significant beneficial effects on cognitive performance. However, effect sizes are moderate, and consistently dependent on individual and situational factors as well as the cognitive domain in question. Although meta-analyses allowing a quantitative comparison of effectiveness across techniques are lacking to date, we can conclude that POE is not more effective than NPCE. We discuss the physiological reasons for this limited effectiveness. We then propose that even though their actual effectiveness seems similar, in the general public POE is perceived as fundamentally different from NPCE, in terms of effectiveness, but also in terms of acceptability. We illustrate the potential consequences such a misperception of POE can have.",Video Meta Results Raw,Caviola L and Faber NS,,,0,119
128,A review of the literature: direct and video laryngoscopy with simulation as educational intervention,"Introduction: A review of the literature was conducted to analyze the impact of -simulation-based training for direct and video laryngoscopy (VL) skills for health care professionals and health care students. Methods: This review focused on the published literature that used randomized controlled trials to examine the effectiveness of simulation-based training to develop airway management skills and identify pertinent literature by searching PubMed from inception of the database up to July 2013. This current review addresses the question of whether airway management simulation-based training improves the acquisition of resuscitation skills for health care profession learners. Results: A total of eleven articles qualified for this systematic review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These studies were analyzed and the specific simulators, participants, assessments, and details related to: time of intubation; Cormack and Lehane classification; success and failure rate; and number of attempts. Conclusion: This review suggests that simulation-based training is one effective way to teach VL skills. VL allows for a higher success rate, faster response time, and a decrease in the number of attempts by health care students and health care professionals under the conditions based on the eleven studies reviewed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Vanderbilt AA and Mayglothling J and Pastis NJ and Franzen D,,,0,120
129,A meta-analytic review of age differences in theory of mind,"Age-related difficulties in understanding basic emotional signals are now well established, but less clear is how aging affects theory of mind (ToM), which refers to the understanding of more complex emotions and mental states. A meta-analysis of 23 datasets involving 1462 (790 younger and 672 older) participants was conducted in which six basic types of ToM task were identified (Stories, Eyes, Videos, False belief-video, False belief-other, and Faux pas). Each ToM task was also categorized according to domain (affective, cognitive, or mixed) and modality (verbal, visual-static, visual-dynamic, verbal and visual-static, or verbal and visual-dynamic). Overall, collapsed across all types of task, older adults were found to perform more poorly than younger adults, with the degree of ToM difficulty they experienced moderate in magnitude (r = −.41). The results also provide evidence for increased ToM difficulties in late adulthood regardless of specific task parameters, with deficits evident across all task types, domains, and modalities. With few exceptions, age deficits for ToM tasks were larger in magnitude compared with matched control tasks. These data have implications for our understanding of mental state attribution processes in late adulthood, suggesting that ToM difficulties are not simply secondary to non-ToM related task demands.

130,Influence of indocyanine green angiography on microsurgical treatment of spinal perimedullary arteriovenous fistulas,"OBJECTIVE The microvascular anatomy of spinal perimedullary arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) is more complicated than that of dural AVFs, and occlusion rates of AVF after open microsurgery or endovascular embolization are lower in patients with perimedullary AVFs (29%-70%) than they are in those with dural AVF (97%-98%). Reports of intraoperative blood flow assessment using indocyanine green (ICG) video angiography in spinal arteriovenous lesions have mostly been for spinal dural AVFs. No detailed reports on spinal perimedullary AVFs are available. METHODS Participants were 11 patients with spinal perimedullary AVFs (Type IVa in 5 patients, Type VIb in 4, and Type IVc in 2). Intraoperative ICG video angiography was assessed by measuring the number of cases in which this modality was judged essential by the surgeon to correctly occlude the fistula. RESULTS In all patients, arterial feeders were identified and intravenous ICG video angiography was performed before and after blocking the feeders. In one patient, selective intraarterial ICG video angiography was also performed. The findings provided by ICG video angiography significantly changed the surgical procedure in 4 of 11 patients (36%). Post-operatively, complete occlusion of the AVF was achieved in 10 of the 11 patients (91%). CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative ICG video angiography can have a significant impact on deciding surgical strategy in the microsurgical treatment of spinal perimedullary AVF.",Video Meta Results Raw,Takai K and Kurita H and Hara T and Kawai K and Taniguchi M,,,0,122

However, relatively little is known about the outcomes and changes in viewing behaviour when learners watch with captions over an extended period if choice and control of viewing material are provided. This article reports qualitative findings of the EURECAP Project in which 36 learners of French, German, Italian and Spanish at intermediate level and above in a large UK university chose from a wide range of films on DVD with optional captions and watched them under their control in their own time. Their experiences as noted in viewing diaries revealed wide differences in viewing behaviour, attitudes to watching with captions and caption-guided viewing strategies over the period of the study. Participants fell into three broad strategic categories: Minimal users who were focused throughout on enjoying films as they would in their L1, evolving users who showed marked changes in their viewing behaviour over time, and maximal users who tended to be experienced at using films to enhance their language learning. We also compare participant behaviour with models of multimedia learning and suggest implications for future practice and research, especially in the light of global video streaming services with captions. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Language Learning.",Subtitles; captions; captioned films; multimedia; audiovisual; television; strategies; TELEVISION; LANGUAGE; LEARNERS; VIDEO; PRINT; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; audio-visual; Video Meta Results Raw,Vanderplank R,,,0,123
132,Speech versus text supported hints in learning to solve word problems,"The aim of this research was to test whether the effectiveness of hints offered in a computer programme for word problem solving can be enhanced by combining visual schemas with spoken instruction (audio and visual input) instead of written instruction with visual schemas (visual only input). In complex tasks, audio/visual information is easier to comprehend than visual only information (Clark and Mayer, 2011, call this the 'modality effect'). In a first study, it was tested on the basis of 6 word problems whether grade 5 students (n = 20) better improved their solution plans using audio plus visual schemas than students who were provided with text plus visual schemas (n = 21). We found that students who worked with audio/visual hints had less difficulty in translating the hints information into their solution plans. The second study was based on a programme containing 48 word problems in which hints use was optional. The students in the audio-visual condition (n = 28) solved more problems correctly and performed better on a post-test than the students in the text-visual condition (n = 30). These results seem to support our expectation that the modality of hints affects students' comprehension and ability levels in solving word problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

134,A Study on the Effect of Lecture and Multimedia Software on Drug Calculation and Prescription: A Systematic Review,"Objective: Medication errors can be a risk factor undermining the patient's health, giving rise to irreparable consequences. The medication errors involve miscalculation of drug dosages by nurses and nursing students. Methods: This study employed several databases including Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus. For this purpose, the keywords were relevant to virtual learning, electronic learning, learning through lecture, blended learning, online learning, distance education, nursing education, multimedia learning, and teaching aids. The search results were not limited in terms of time. Results: Lack of knowledge and skills in pharmacology and miscalculations are the major factors contributing to medication errors by nurses and nursing students. Moreover, poor basic knowledge of mathematics among the nursing students can lead to numerous mistakes. The results of previous studies have indicated that blended learning can have a positive impact on learning progress among nursing students. However, some studies have suggested that multimedia tools and teaching aids leave little impact on learning. Conclusion: It is suggested that the correct adoption of blended learning methods can improve the nursing education in terms of drug calculations.",Video Meta Results Raw,Feizalahzadeh H and Valizadeh S and Avari M and Virani F,,,0,125

But will people still use this self-esteem proxy when trait-relevant diagnostic information is available? We test this possibility in two experiments: participants learn that a target person has low or high self-esteem, and then receive diagnostic information about the target's academic success or failure and positive or negative affectivity (Study 1), or watch a video of the target's extraverted or introverted behavior (Study 2). In both experiments, participants' impressions of the target's traits accurately tracked diagnostic information, but impressions also revealed an independent self-esteem proxy effect. Evidently, the self-esteem proxy is robust and influences person perception even in the presence of vivid individuating information.",Video Meta Results Raw,Cameron JJ and Stinson DA and Hoplock L and Hole C and Schellenberg J,,,0,126

The Purdue Visualization of Rotations (ROT) test was administered to science major students enrolled in a college chemistry course to measure mental rotation ability. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of three alternative models. A bi-factor model is a better fit for the data than other models (1-factor, 4-factor 2nd-order), which indicates that the probability of answering a test item correctly is affected not only by student ability but also by an item-writing pattern. Results from multiple group CFA support the measurement invariance of the bi-factor model between sexes and the outperformance of males over females with medium to large effect sizes. In conclusion, the ROT is appropriate to measure student mental rotation ability in college classrooms and to detect a difference between sexes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

138,Defining the learning curve for endotracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy: A systematic review,"More than two failed intubation attempts and failed endotracheal intubations (ETIs) are associated with severe complications and death. The aim of this review was to determine the number of ETIs a health care provider in training needs to perform to achieve proficiency within two attempts. A systematic search of the literature was conducted covering the time frame of January 1990 through July 2014. We identified 13 studies with a total of 1462 students who had attempted to intubate 19,108 patients. This review shows that in mostly elective circumstances, at least 50 ETIs with no more than two intubation attempts need to be performed to reach a success rate of at least 90%. However, the evidence is heterogeneous, and the incidence of difficult airways in non-elective settings is up to 20 times higher compared to elective settings. Taking this factor into account, training should include a variety of exposures and should probably exceed 50 ETIs to successfully serve the most vulnerable patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A Social Story((TM)) describing how to greet teaching staff and other adults at school was introduced across participants in a multiple-baseline design. After the students demonstrated they had learned to make a simple greeting (e.g., Hi), video modeling was introduced to teach them to produce a more complex greeting (e.g., Hello. How are you?\). The two students learned to greet teachers and researchers",but they did not consistently use the more complex greeting response with the teachers. The results suggest that the Social Stories((TM)) and video modeling interventions were moderately effective in teaching the targeted greeting responses.',Kagohara DM and Achmadi D and van der Meer L and Lancioni GE and O'Reilly MF and Lang R and Marschik PB and Sutherland D and Ramdoss S and Green VA and Sigafoos J,,,0,129
140,Polarity correspondence in metaphor congruency effects: structural overlap predicts categorization times for bipolar concepts presented in vertical space,"Previous research has shown that words presented on metaphor congruent locations (e.g., positive words UP on the screen and negative words DOWN on the screen) are categorized faster than words presented on metaphor incongruent locations (e.g., positive words DOWN and negative words UP). These findings have been explained in terms of an interference effect: The meaning associated with UP and DOWN vertical space can automatically interfere with the categorization of words with a metaphorically incongruent meaning. The current studies test an alternative explanation for the interaction between the vertical position of abstract concepts and the speed with which these stimuli are categorized. Research on polarity differences (basic asymmetries in the way dimensions are processed) predicts that +polar endpoints of dimensions (e.g., positive, moral, UP) are categorized faster than -polar endpoints of dimensions (e.g., negative, immoral, DOWN). Furthermore, the polarity correspondence principle predicts that stimuli where polarities correspond (e.g., positive words presented UP) provide an additional processing benefit compared to stimuli where polarities do not correspond (e.g., negative words presented UP). A meta-analysis (Study 1) shows that a polarity account provides a better explanation of reaction time patterns in previous studies than an interference explanation. An experiment (Study 2) reveals that controlling for the polarity benefit of +polar words compared to -polar words did not only remove the main effect of word polarity but also the interaction between word meaning and vertical position due to polarity correspondence. These results reveal that metaphor congruency effects should not be interpreted as automatic associations between vertical locations and word meaning but instead are more parsimoniously explained by their structural overlap in polarities.","Netherlands; Netherlands (Utrecht); ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Higher Education; Postsecondary Education; Spatial Ability; College Students; Congruence (Psychology); Classification; Perception; Interference (Learning); Reaction Time; Meta Analysis; Foreign Countries; Figurative Language; Video Meta Results Raw",Lakens D,,,0,130
141,Sex Differences in Mental Rotation Tasks: Not Just in the Mental Rotation Process!,"The paper-and-pencil Mental Rotation Test (Vandenberg & Kuse, 1978) consistently produces large sex differences favoring men (Voyer, Voyer, & Bryden, 1995). In this task, participants select 2 of 4 answer choices that are rotations of a probe stimulus. Incorrect choices (i.e., foils) are either mirror reflections of the probe or structurally different. In contrast, in the mental rotation experimental task (Shepard & Metzler, 1971) participants judge whether 2 stimuli are the same but rotated or different by mirror reflection. The goal of the present research was to examine sources of sex differences in mental rotation, including the ability to capitalize on the availability of structure foils. In 2 experiments, both men and women had greater accuracy and faster reaction times (RTs) for structurally different compared with mirror foils in different versions of the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotation Test (Experiment 1) and the Shepard and Metzler experimental task (Experiment 2). A significant male advantage in accuracy but not response time was found for both trial types. The male advantage was evident when all foils were structure foils so that mental rotation was not necessary (Experiment 3); however, when all foils were structure foils and participants were instructed to look for structure foils a significant sex difference was no longer evident (Experiment 4). Results suggest that the mental rotation process is not the only source of the sex difference in mental rotation tasks. Alternative strategy use is another source of sex differences in these tasks.","mental rotation; sex differences; strategies; SPATIAL ABILITY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; 3-DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; PERFORMANCE; METAANALYSIS; COMPONENTS; COMPLEXITY; MAGNITUDE; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Boone AP and Hegarty M,,,0,131
142,Implementing Follow-Along Physical Activity Videos with People Living With Chronic Conditions: A Feasibility Study,"Background Compelling evidence supports multiple benefits of physical activity (PA) even in small bursts. Less than 50% of Americans achieve recommended PA levels, lower still for individuals living with chronic illness or disease. Purpose The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of 3-min follow-along video scenarios to promote brief episodes of low-moderate levels of PA among individuals with chronic diseases. Methods Guided by our previous studies and self-efficacy theory, the program (WellMe in 3 (c) for Patients) was modeled after another program developed for healthcare staff. An advisory panel and a health and fitness expert guided the creation of twelve 3-min video scenarios that included two individuals living with chronic illness and a fitness leader who guided the PA scenarios and how to adapt them based on limitations. The 12 scenarios included 3 min of aerobic activities, stretching, or balance. Preliminary pilot effects were measured among 39 patients living with chronic conditions for one month. Standardized instruments were used to measure PA levels, PA self-efficacy (SE), and quality of life (QoL); usability and satisfaction were assessed using researcher-developed tools. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to evaluate change over time. Results Twelve video scenarios were created tailored to persons with chronic illness. Thirty-nine participants piloted the program, reporting an average of two chronic conditions. Baseline QoL scores were lower than normative data, self-efficacy scores were low-to-moderate, and PA levels were very low. Participants averaged using one video per day. 62% of participants provided complete self-reported pre- and post-QoL and SE data and 41% provided pre- and post-PA (accelerometer) data. Significant improvements were found for general health and energy scores, and trends were found for self-efficacy scores. PA levels were highly variable with nonsignificant increases from baseline.

While there is a large body of research concerning the question how materials should be designed in order to foster learning optimally, there is astonishingly little research on the question how to design a documentation in order to facilitate its application - with respect to time, number of errors, and subjective measures. These issues are addressed in the present work.

144,"The Arts and Education: Knowledge Generation, Pedagogy, and the Discourse of Learning","Within the past 20 years, the arts have gained increasing prominence in educational discourses as well as public arenas. At the same time that traditional genres of art (e.g., music, visual art, and performance) are being taught as part of school curricula, the study of the arts in education has taken on new venues in supporting learning and teaching through technology and multimedia. These new foci are especially critical in bridging the local and the global, and in linking cultures and worlds across age, time, and space that in earlier periods in history would have been virtually impossible to connect. Moreover, they portend opportunities for enhancing learning and improving pedagogy and practice. This chapter focuses on the arts within a social-cultural-contextual framework, examining their role as a (re)source in educational theory, research, and practice. Rather than highlighting individual disciplines within the field, typically referred to as \the arts",\' the chapter is concerned with the changing nature of the arts and what counts as the arts. The chapter has a six-part structure that begins with an overview of issues that are central to redefining the relationship of the arts and education.

145,Examination of Single Subject Studies Conducted on Individuals with Disabilities by Using Self Management Strategies: A Meta Analysis Study,"Individuals with disabilities need to learn to control their own behaviors to rank among in the community. Self-management strategies are developed for this purpose. These strategies include antecedent cue regulation, self-instruction, self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-reinforcement. In the literature, there are researches about the effectiveness of self-management strategies on teaching various behaviors to individuals with disabilities. In this study 40 single-subject research articles conducted with individuals with disabilities and published in peer-reviewed journals in between 1999-2008 have been examined. Articles primarily have been descriptively analyzed and then examined by use of meta-analysis as the computation of effect-size. Examining the findings of the descriptive analysis, it is found out that the most commonly used strategy is self-monitoring and strategies are mostly used for people aged between 7 and 17, which is referred to as school age. The PND score obtained in the studies that were examined was found as 87.23% on average for the behaviors that were wished to be increased, compared with PZD score an average of 43.96% for the behaviors that were desired to be decreased. According to the PND and PZD scores, it is possible to say that self-management strategies are effective for those behaviors that are desired to be increased, but they are doubtful/unstable in managing behaviors that are desired to be decreased. Findings have been interpreted and discussed by considering the literature and suggestions have been submitted for the implications and future researches.",Video Meta Results Raw,Ozkan SY and Sonmez M,,,0,135
146,Arts versus science - Academic background implicitly activates gender stereotypes on cognitive abilities with threat raising men's (but lowering women's) performance,There is ongoing debate as to whether \innate\' cognitive sex differences contribute to the underrepresentation of women in science and engineering careers. Decades of gender research have revealed good evidence that both biological (e.g. sex hormones) and socio-cultural factors (e.g. gender stereotypes) contribute significantly to cognitive sex differences. Research on gender stereotypes has revealed that priming gender can have adverse or beneficial effects on cognitive performance,depending on whether primed participants appraise the testing situation as threatening or challenging. Several contextual factors have been investigated in this respect. Despite the debate on women in STEM disciplines,Hausmann M,,,0,136

148,Systematic review of serious games for medical education and surgical skills training,"BACKGROUND: The application of digital games for training medical professionals is on the rise. So-called 'serious' games form training tools that provide a challenging simulated environment, ideal for future surgical training. Ultimately, serious games are directed at reducing medical error and subsequent healthcare costs. The aim was to review current serious games for training medical professionals and to evaluate the validity testing of such games. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsychInfo and CINAHL were searched using predefined inclusion criteria for available studies up to April 2012. The primary endpoint was validation according to current criteria. RESULTS: A total of 25 articles were identified, describing a total of 30 serious games. The games were divided into two categories: those developed for specific educational purposes (17) and commercial games also useful for developing skills relevant to medical personnel (13). Pooling of data was not performed owing to the heterogeneity of study designs and serious games. Six serious games were identified that had a process of validation. Of these six, three games were developed for team training in critical care and triage, and three were commercially available games applied to train laparoscopic psychomotor skills. None of the serious games had completed a full validation process for the purpose of use. CONCLUSION: Blended and interactive learning by means of serious games may be applied to train both technical and non-technical skills relevant to the surgical field. Games developed or used for this purpose need validation before integration into surgical teaching curricula.",Video Meta Results Raw,Graafland M and Schraagen JM and Schijven MP,,,0,138
149,Objective Assessment of Robotic Surgical Technical Skill: A Systematic Review,"PURPOSE: Robotic surgeries, especially in urology, have grown exponentially during the last decade. Various skills assessment tools have been developed. We reviewed the current status, the current challenges and the future needs of robotic evaluations with a focus on urological applications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) criteria 2 paired investigators screened the PubMed®, Scopus® and Web of Science® databases for all full text, English language articles published between 2006 and 2018 using the query (evaluation OR assessment) AND (robot-assisted surgery OR robotic surgery) AND (surgical performance OR surgical skill) AND training. The research design, validity and reliability of each study were ascertained and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 259 studies were identified, of which 109 were included in the final analysis. We grouped the studies into 2 categories, including manual and automated assessments. Manual evaluation included global skill, procedure specific and error based assessments. For automated assessment we summarized evaluations derived from robotic instrument kinematic tracking data, systems events and surgical video data, and we explored those associations with various domains by manual evaluation. We further reviewed the current progress in automated surgical segmentation and skill evaluation with machine learning and deep learning. Concerns remain regarding efficient and effective surgeon training and credentialing. CONCLUSIONS: No universally accepted robotic skills assessment currently exists. The purpose of assessment (training or credentialing) may dictate whether manual or automated surgeon assessment is more suitable. Moving forward, assessment tools must be objective and efficient to facilitate the training and credentialing of competent surgeons.",urology; robotic surgical procedures; education; quality assurance; health care; credentialing; CROWD-SOURCED ASSESSMENT; GLOBAL EVALUATIVE ASSESSMENT; TRAINING CURRICULUM; EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION; CONCURRENT VALIDITY; PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY; SURGERY; VALIDATION; PERFORMANCE; ANASTOMOSIS; Urology & Nephrology; Urology & Nephrology; Video Meta Results Raw,Chen J and Cheng N and Cacciamani G and Oh P and Lin-Brande M and Remulla D and Gill IS and Hung AJ,,,0,139

For adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and complex communication needs, mobile technology presents opportunities for inclusive social experiences and additional modalities for communicating with communicative partners (e.g., making a request to a partner who may or may not be within close proximity). This study examines using video prompting to teach four adolescent males with ASD, intellectual disability, and limited verbal expression of how to emit pictures to communication partners using text messaging technology. Results indicate acquisition was achieved and maintained when presented under the same conditions for three of the four participants.

158,How effective are pedagogical agents for learning? A meta-analytic review,"Research on the use of software programs and tools such as pedagogical agents has peaked over the last decade. Pedagogical agents are on-screen characters that facilitate instruction. This meta-analysis examined the effect of using pedagogical agents on learning by reviewing 43 studies involving 3,088 participants. Analysis of the results indicated that pedagogical agents produced a small but significant effect on learning. The overall mean effect size was moderated by the contextual and methodological features of the studies. The findings revealed that the use of pedagogical agents were more beneficial for K-12 students than post-secondary students. Pedagogical agents that communicated with students using on-screen text facilitated learning more effectively than agents that communicated using narration. The findings of this study have implications for advancing theory and practice, as well as highlighting productive future directions for research.

160,"Effectiveness of Adaptive E-Learning Environments on Knowledge, Competence, and Behavior in Health Professionals and Students: Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Background: Adaptive e-learning environments (AEEs) can provide tailored instruction by adapting content, navigation, presentation, multimedia, and tools to each user's navigation behavior, individual objectives, knowledge, and preferences. AEEs can have various levels of complexity, ranging from systems using a simple adaptive functionality to systems using artificial intelligence. While AEEs are promising, their effectiveness for the education of health professionals and health professions students remains unclear. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of AEEs in improving knowledge, competence, and behavior in health professionals and students.

Recent studies indicate that the completeness of resection of malignant nodules is comparable to that obtained with conventional thyroidectomy. Aims: To compare the 5-year outcomes in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) treated with MIVAT versus conventional thyroidectomy. Methods: In this prospective cohort study conducted over 2 years (July 2005-June 2007), 172 patients with node-negative, nonmetastatic PTC underwent either MIVAT (n = 67) or conventional thyroidectomy (n = 105). Study outcomes were 1) the cumulative dose of radioactive iodine (RAI) to achieve a disease-free state, defined as a stimulated serum thyroglobulin (Tg) level <2 ng/mL with negative Tg antibody and no tumor on a whole-body scan or cross-sectional imaging, and 2) the 5-year serum Tg level. Results: The clinical parameters of the MIVAT and conventional thyroidectomy groups were comparable except for age (mean 43 +/- 12 vs. 59 +/- 17 years, respectively; p = 0.03) and operative time (mean 69 +/- 24 vs. 53 +/- 16 minutes, p = 0.02); the mean tumor size was similar between groups (1.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.9 cm, p = 0.14). Surgical morbidity was similar in both groups. Median follow-up was 5 years. RAI dose (mean 72 +/- 38 vs. 96 +/- 47 mCu, p = 0.34) and serum Tg at 5 years (mean 0.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.3 ng/mL, p = 0.30) were not significantly different between the MIVAT and conventional thyroidectomy groups. Conclusions: MIVAT can be safely utilized in patients with localized PTC, providing comparable completeness of resection and oncological outcome to conventional thyroidectomy.",Video Meta Results Raw,Del Rio P and Maestroni U and Sianesi M and Viani L and Vicente D and Stojadinovic A and Avital I,,,0,150
163,"Spatial skills in undergraduate students-Influence of gender, motivation, academic training, and childhood play","Spatial reasoning is critical for success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and particularly for geoscience. To evaluate capabilities among U.S. students, we assessed spatial reasoning skills in 345 introductory geology and upper-level structural geology students. The test measured students' abilities to disembed, visualize, and mentally rotate objects. The results highlight an uneven distribution of spatial skills with a minimum score of 6% and a maximum score of 75% correct responses. Spatial skills are positively correlated with standardized test scores, motivation for learning, STEM major declaration, and number of science courses taken. Our analysis also indicates that the cumulative, informal training of childhood play has the ability to increase spatial reasoning. Spatial skill scores were significantly higher among students who played action, construction, or sports video games in childhood. Male and female students display significant differences in spatial skills, especially for mental rotation, with males outperforming females. However, gender disparities are fully mediated after adjusting for a variety of academic factors and whether students frequently played with construction-based toys. This indicates that gender differences are experiential rather than biological in origin. This study suggests that both formal academic training and extracurricular activities appear to develop spatial skills throughout students' lives and indicates that systematic testing of spatial skills and formal training opportunities for students would facilitate improved spatial reasoning among students. We hypothesize that formal training opportunities for spatial reasoning could increase the potential pool of students who successfully enter STEM careers, including the geosciences, especially among women.","MENTAL ROTATION PERFORMANCE; EMBODIED COGNITION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; META-ANALYSIS; VIDEO GAMES; ABILITY; SPORT; METAANALYSIS; EDUCATION; THINKING; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Geology; Video Meta Results Raw",Gold AU and Pendergast PM and Ormand CJ and Budd DA and Stempien JA and Mueller KJ and Kravitz KA,,,0,151
165,Utilizing e-learning to train medical personnel for emergency preparedness,"Introduction Preparing health care professionals to deal with emergencies is a complex and costly process. The training process requires not only the provision of the knowledge and skills required for the task, but also the need for the knowledge and skills to be retained over time. E-learning technologies that have been developing over the past two decades are providing educators with an important tool that has contributed to the ability to achieve this important goal. Objectives To conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed published literature on the effectiveness of e-learning interventions in emergency preparedness programs. Methods The study was performed by reviewing relevant publications identified through various search engines such as Google, PubMed, Cochrane, and Dynamed. The keywords used in the search: e-learning, emergency preparedness, continuing medical education, electronic or distant training, disasters mitigation through teaching and education, blended education. Characteristics of E-Learning in Training for Emergency Preparedness E-learning is defined as the utilization of electronic communication and information technologies to achieve learning. Unlimited information can be stored and used consistently in as many sessions as desired, by various instructive means such as lectures, chat-rooms, downloadable documents, pictures, or video-films. The trainees can be selective regarding the amount of time allocated to the educational session. The elearning enables different degrees of interactivity between instructors and trainees and allows the instructor to monitor the trainees' progress. E-learning allows for self-study, group-study and even holistic organizational study of emergency preparedness. It can be used as a means for developing early training programs for emergency preparedness, or for on-the-job training. E-learning enables the implementation of training programs to import knowledge and skills to an unlimited number of personnel due to its high accessibility. Simulations of complex real-live emergency scenarios provide the opportunity for trainees to experience the dynamics of dealing with an emergency. Following the initial funding needed for development, this method is an efficient and cost-effective way to train medical teams to deal with large-scale emergency scenarios. Additional information can easily be provided, when required allowing for updating information if new threats are identified, and also integrating lessons learned from actual events. Conclusions E-learning is an advanced and effective education tool aimed at promoting emergency preparedness of health care professionals. There is a need to study the impact of e-learning on disaster management in order to present evidence-based data on the effectiveness of this method in developing and retaining knowledge and skills for emergency preparedness. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Video Meta Results Raw,Adini B and Cohen R and Bar-Dayan Y,,,1,152
166,Single-Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy A Systematic Review,"Objectives: To compare the morbidity, pain, cosmesis, and cost-effectiveness of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) with standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SLC). Data Sources: Existing literature in MEDLINE through July 31, 2011. Study Selection: We reviewed all studies identified through MEDLINE. References were cross-checked to ensure capture of cited pertinent articles. Case reports and series of less than 4 cases were excluded. Data Synthesis: In total we analyzed 49 studies, including 2336 patients. Seven studies consisted of randomized trials and 11 of case-matched control series (compared with SLC). The technical aspects of SILC were not standardized. Median follow-up time was 4 weeks, although 27 stud-ies (55.1%) reported no follow-up. The overall median complication rate was 7.37% (range, 0-28.6%), and the overall rate of biliary duct complications was 0.39%. Postoperative pain was similar or worse in SILC compared with SLC in 10 of 13 articles reporting pain outcomes (76.9%). Six articles investigating cosmesis after SILC compared outcomes with those of SLC. Three articles demonstrated significantly improved cosmesis after SILC. Conclusions: The perceived benefits of SILC compared with SLC are improved cosmesis and reduced surgical trauma. No definitive evidence suggests that such improvements can be gained by SILC. Complications are more common, may be underestimated owing to the lack of sufficient follow-up, and may be associated with a shift from safe practice.",Video Meta Results Raw,Hall TC and Dennison AR and Bilku DK and Metcalfe MS and Garcea G,,,0,153
168,Genetics of Nurture: A Test of the Hypothesis That Parents' Genetics Predict Their Observed Caregiving,"Twin studies have documented that parenting behavior is partly heritable, but it is unclear how parents' genetics shape their caregiving. Using tools of molecular genetics, the present study investigated this process by testing hypotheses about associations between a genome-wide polygenic score for educational attainment and parental caregiving in 702 members of the Dunedin Study, a population-representative birth cohort. Data have been prospectively collected from when Study members were born through to midlife, and include assessments of the caregiving they provided once they became parents. Results showed that parents' polygenic scores predicted warm, sensitive, and stimulating caregiving, both in personal interactions with their young children (as captured on video) and through the home environments they created for their families (as observed by home visitors). The magnitude of this effect was small. Polygenic-score associations were independent of well-established predictors of parenting, such as parents' own childhood experiences of parenting and the age at which they became parents. Polygenic-score associations were mediated by parents' early-emerging cognitive abilities and self-control skills. Findings have implications for theory and research about genetic influences on caregiving and child development.","educational attainment; gene-environment correlation; parenting; polygenic score; GENOME-WIDE-ASSOCIATION; INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION; ENVIRONMENT CORRELATION; BEHAVIORAL-GENETICS; CHILD-CARE; RISK; METAANALYSIS; PERSONALITY; INTERPLAY; SCHOOL; Psychology, Developmental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Wertz J and Belsky J and Moffitt TE and Belsky DW and Harrington H and Avinun R and Poulton R and Ramrakha S and Caspi A,,,0,154
169,"The Effect of Body-Related Stimuli on Mental Rotation in Children, Young and Elderly Adults","This study aimed to explore the development of mental rotation ability throughout life by comparing different kinds of stimuli. Thirty-six children (6-9 years-old), 30 young (20-28 years-old) and 30 elderly people (60-82 years-old) performed mental rotation tasks with abstract (i.e. two-dimensional lines) and concrete stimuli (i.e. hands, human/animal faces). The results showed that overall young people outperformed children and elderly people, while children were less accurate than the elderly. However, the effect of age was shaped by the kinds of stimuli: (a) young people were more accurate than children and elderly people particularly with abstract stimuli; (b) elderly people improved their performance with images depicting faces; (c) children performed better with body-related stimuli than animal faces. Finally, performance was more difficult when stimuli were rotated by 180 degrees, especially for younger and older females. We may conclude that the effects of age are modulated by the characteristics of the stimuli with a specific difficulty for abstract stimuli and a facilitation for concrete stimuli. As an innovative aspect, during childhood there appeared a specific facilitation for body-related stimuli, not just for concrete ones. These findings are interpreted according to embodied models of cognitive development and the effects of ageing on the brain.",VISUOSPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MOTOR IMAGERY; SPATIAL ABILITY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; AGE; MOVEMENT; BRAIN; TASK; METAANALYSIS; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw,Iachini T and Ruggiero G and Bartolo A and Rapuano M and Ruotolo F,,,0,155
170,Field independence: reviewing the evidence,"BACKGROUND: The construct of field independence (FI) remains one of the most widely cited notions in research on cognitive style and on learning and instruction more generally. However, a great deal of confusion continues to exist around the definition of FI, its measurement, and the interpretation of research results, all of which have served to limit our understanding of and practice in education. AIMS: This study reviews research evidence on FI and highlights key issues to frame a more informed agenda for future research. ARGUMENTS: Caution needs to be exercised over the interpretation of the evidence around FI and field dependence (FD). In tests measuring FI only, it is inappropriate to use the term FD. FI is clearly correlated with measures of spatial ability; however, whether FI is just a measure of perceptual and more specifically spatial ability is a matter of debate. Furthermore, whether FI is just a cognitive ability or a cognitive style is not the central issue, as both can be developed. FI has a significant relationship with aspects of working memory and with other variables. It is especially important in the management and interpretation of complex cognitive tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Field independence has an important role to play in the navigation of the complex and information-rich learning environments of the 21st century. It is therefore important to move beyond the present narrow focus on FI as a style or trait by acknowledging, embracing, and exploring the complexity of the interaction between individual and contextual variables.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Educational Psychology; Measurement Objectives; Cognitive Style; Measurement Techniques; Cognitive Measurement; Literature Reviews; Evidence; Research Needs; Meta Analysis; Learning Processes; Short Term Memory; Video Meta Results Raw",Evans C and Richardson JT and Waring M,,,0,156
172,Prevalence of small-bowel neoplasia in Lynch syndrome assessed by video capsule endoscopy,"Objective The aim was to determine the prevalence of small-bowel neoplasia in asymptomatic patients with Lynch syndrome (LS) by video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Design After obtaining informed consent, asymptomatic proven gene mutation carriers aged 3570 years were included in this prospective multicentre study in the Netherlands. Patients with previous small-bowel surgery were excluded. After bowel preparation, VCE was performed. The videos were read by two independent investigators. If significant lesions were detected, an endoscopic procedure was subsequently performed to obtain histology and, if possible, remove the lesion. Results In total, 200 patients (mean age 50 years (range 35-69), M/F 88/112), with proven mutations were included. These concerned MLH1 (n=50), MSH2 (n=68), MSH6 (n=76), PMS2 (n=3) and Epcam (n=3) mutation carriers. In 95% of the procedures, caecal visualisation was achieved. Small-bowel neoplasia was detected in two patients: one adenocarcinoma (TisN0Mx) and one adenoma, both located in the duodenum. In another patient, a duodenal cancer (T2N0Mx) was diagnosed 7 months after a negative VCE. This was considered a lesion missed by VCE. All three neoplastic lesions were within reach of a conventional gastroduodenoscope. All patients with neoplasia were men, over 50 years of age and without a family history of small-bowel cancer. Conclusions The prevalence of small-bowel neoplasia in asymptomatic patients with LS was 1.5%. All neoplastic lesions were located in the duodenum and within reach of conventional gastroduodenoscopy. Although VCE has the potential to detect these neoplastic lesions, small-bowel neoplasia may be missed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Haanstra JF and Al-Toma A and Dekker E and Vanhoutvin SA and Nagengast FM and Mathus-Vliegen EM and van Leerdam ME and Cappel WH and Sanduleanu S and Veenendaal RA and Cats A and Vasen HF and Kleibeuker JH and Koornstra JJ,,,0,157
173,Key factors for the development of a culturally appropriate interactive multimedia informative program for aboriginal health workers,"This research aims to create and evaluate a model for a culturally appropriate, interactive, multimedia and informative health program for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers that aims to improve the capacity to independently control their learning within an attractive learning environment. The research also aims to provide recommendations for policy development and further research. This study involved four phases: program needs assessment, identification of the key factors that should be considered in developing the CD-ROM, model development, and formative evaluation for the model. A general needs assessment as a first step in program development highlighted the presence of continuing education gaps and indicated the need for a new means to deliver a sustainable, efficient and culturally acceptable program. This article explores the second objective in this study, which is the identification of the key factors considered for developing the program. The identification began with a systematic review of the literature which served as background information, followed by qualitative semistructured interviews with diverse key stakeholders to explore their expectations and recommendations. The findings indicated that the most important key factors could be categorised under four main categories: cultural factors, information technology availability and literacy, learning aspects, and interactive multimedia factors. Cultural factors included cultural inclusivity, oral cultural, pre-existing knowledge, and Aboriginal preferred learning styles. Information technology factors concerned technology availability and literacy. Learning aspects highlighted the impact of the learning theory in model design. Interactive multimedia development factors explored included the requirements for the process, fitting and design of the program.

174,Learning Statistics with a Multimedia Resource,"Researchers have often reported the negative attitude and low performance of students in statistics (Francis, 2002; Gordon, 1995; Ograjensek & BavdazKveder, 2003). While considerable efforts and research have been undertaken to remedy this situation, researchers, educators, and policy makers have admitted a degree of failure in the teaching and learning of statistics and advocated a radical rethinking in the way statistics education is implemented (Cobb & Moore, 1997; Moore, 1997, 2005; Weldon, 2005). One approach that has been advanced is the use of multimedia instruction. Nolan and Lang (2006) observed that the potential for multimedia to enhance the statistics curriculum is clear, but there are challenges to developing instructional materials that take advantage of the riches of multimedia. It requires more than a simple translation of textbooks into the computer in order to obtain a tool that is effective for learning statistics. While statistical tools like SPSS have improved analyses of data, it has not significantly improved the learning of statistical concepts (Hawkins, Jolliffe, & Glickman, 1992). This has necessitated recommendations that technologies should not only be used as a computational tool, but also as a means for providing students with opportunities to explore conceptual ideas (Franklin & Garfield, 2006). It seems plausible that effectively-designed multimedia resources may help alleviate some of the difficulties students face in learning statistics. This chapter describes a prototype digital resource (StatConquer) for learning about correlation of bivariate data(1), an important topic in many introductory statistics courses.

175,Writing a Systematic Review for Publication in a Health-Related Degree Program,"Background: The protocol in this manuscript was designed to help graduate students publish. It is the result of a challenge from our provost in 2013. I developed this protocol over the last 6 years and have exercised the protocol for the last 5 years. The current version of the protocol has remained mostly static for the last 2 years-only small changes have been made to the process. Objective: The objective of this protocol is to enable students to learn a valuable skill of conducting a systematic review and to write the review in a way that can be published. I have designed the protocol to fit into the schedule of a traditional semester, but also used it in compressed semesters. Methods: An image map was created in HTML 5.0 and imported into a learning management system. It augments traditional instruction by providing references to published articles, examples, and previously recorded instructional videos. Students use the image map outside the classroom after traditional instruction. The image map helps students create manuscripts that follow established practice and are reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and whose authorship follows guidelines by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Results: Since its inception, this protocol has helped 77 students publish 27 systematic reviews in nine journals worldwide. Some manuscripts take multiple years to progress through multiple review processes at multiple journals submitted in sequence. Two other professors in the School of Health Administration have used this protocol in their classes. Conclusions: So far, this method has helped 51% of graduate students who used it in my graduate courses publish articles (with more manuscripts under consideration whose numbers have remained uncounted in this sum). I wish success to others who might use this protocol.",systematic review; health information management; SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Kruse CS,,,0,160

178,Early science learning with a virtual tutor through multimedia explanations and feedback on spoken questions,"The purpose of this pilot study with a within-subject design was to gain a deeper understanding about the promise and restrictions of a virtual tutoring system designed to teach science to first grade students in Finland. Participants were 61 students who received six tutoring science sessions of approximately 20 min each. Sessions consisted of a sequence of narrated multimedia science presentations during which a virtual tutor explained science phenomena displayed in pictures. Narrated science explanations were followed by one or more multiple choice questions with immediate feedback about students' choices and a possible second attempt, during which students reached 97% accuracy. A pretest and posttest was administered to assess students' ability to reason about the science and to transfer knowledge to new contexts. Results indicated significantly greater improvement in the understanding of the science concepts taught during the tutoring sessions, relative to the concepts that were not taught. Results from the surveys administered to teachers and students indicated that the program was well received. Detailed analysis of student error responses provided a deeper understanding about the complex interplay between students' prior knowledge, the way topics were taught in the multimedia lessons, and the way learning was assessed. Findings from the quantitative and qualitative analyses are discussed in the context of designing high quality lessons delivered through a virtual tutoring system.",METAANALYSIS; LEARNERS; AGENTS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Hautala J and Baker DL and Keurulainen A and Ronimus M and Richardson U and Cole R,,,0,162
179,Role of test motivation in intelligence testing,"Intelligence tests are widely assumed to measure maximal intellectual performance, and predictive associations between intelligence quotient (IQ) scores and later-life outcomes are typically interpreted as unbiased estimates of the effect of intellectual ability on academic, professional, and social life outcomes. The current investigation critically examines these assumptions and finds evidence against both. First, we examined whether motivation is less than maximal on intelligence tests administered in the context of low-stakes research situations. Specifically, we completed a meta-analysis of random-assignment experiments testing the effects of material incentives on intelligence-test performance on a collective 2,008 participants. Incentives increased IQ scores by an average of 0.64 SD, with larger effects for individuals with lower baseline IQ scores. Second, we tested whether individual differences in motivation during IQ testing can spuriously inflate the predictive validity of intelligence for life outcomes. Trained observers rated test motivation among 251 adolescent boys completing intelligence tests using a 15-min 'thin-slice' video sample. IQ score predicted life outcomes, including academic performance in adolescence and criminal convictions, employment, and years of education in early adulthood. After adjusting for the influence of test motivation, however, the predictive validity of intelligence for life outcomes was significantly diminished, particularly for nonacademic outcomes. Collectively, our findings suggest that, under low-stakes research conditions, some individuals try harder than others, and, in this context, test motivation can act as a third-variable confound that inflates estimates of the predictive validity of intelligence for life outcomes.

180,Importance of machine learning for enhancing ecological studies using information-rich imagery,"There is increasing demand for efficient ways to process large volumes of data from visual-based remote-technology, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in ecology and conservation, with machine learning methods representing a promising avenue to address varying user demands. Here, we evaluated current trends in how machine learning and UAVs are used to process imagery data for detecting animals and vegetation across habitats, placing emphasis on their utility for endangered species. We reviewed 213 publications that used UAVs at 256 study sites, of which just 89 (42%) used machine learning to assess the visual data. We evaluated geographical and temporal trends and identified how each technology is used at a global scale. We also identified the most commonly encountered machine-learning methods, including potential reasons for their limited use in ecology and possible solutions. Thirteen out of the 17 habitats defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) habitat classification scheme were monitored using UAVs, while 12 habitats were monitored using both UAVs and machine learning. Our results show that, while machine learning is already being used across many habitat types, it is primarily restricted to more uniform habitats at present. Out of 173 plant and animal species monitored using UAV surveys, 30 were of conservation concern, with machine learning being used to assess UAV imagery data for 9 of these species. In conclusion, we anticipate that the joint use of UAVs and machine learning for ecological research and conservation will expand as machine learning methods become more accessible. © The authors 2019.",Meta-analysis; Computer vision; Video analysis; Big data; Classifier; Deep learning; BRUVs; ROVs; UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS; AERIAL-PHOTOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; WILDLIFE; VEHICLES; Biodiversity Conservation; Biodiversity & Conservation; ecological approach; endangered species; imagery; machine learning; nature conservation; unmanned vehicle; Animalia; Video Meta Results Raw,Dujon AM and Schofield G,,,0,164
181,Effects of awareness interventions on children's attitudes toward peers with a visual impairment,"The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of two awareness programs (6-day vs. 1-day programs) on children's attitudes toward peers with a visual impairment. Three hundred and forty-four Spanish physical education students (164 girls and 180 boys) aged 10-15 years, took part in the study. A modified version of the Attitudes Toward Disability Questionnaire (ATDQ) was used, which includes three sub-scales: (i) cognitive perceptions, (ii) emotional perception, and (iii) behavioral readiness to interact with children with disabilities. The questionnaire was filled out during the regular physical education class before and immediately after the awareness activity. The 6-day didactical unit included a lecture on visual impairments and a video describing visual impairments and the game of 5-a-side soccer (first lesson), sensibilization activities toward visual impairment (second and third lessons), training and competitive 5-a-side soccer tasks using blindfolded goggles (fourth and fifth lessons), and a sport show and chat with soccer players with a visual impairment (sixth lesson). The 1-day awareness unit only included the final session of the didactical activity. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant time effects in the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral subscales. Sex also was found to demonstrate significant effects, in which women showed more favorable results than men. A time-by-group intervention effect was only demonstrated in the cognitive sub-scale, and the 6-day didactic intervention was more effective than the 1-day awareness unit.",Video Meta Results Raw,Reina R and Lopez V and Jimenez M and Garcia-Calvo T and Hutzlerc Y,,,0,165
182,Physiological responses during exercise with video games in patients with cystic fibrosis: A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Interactive video games are recently being used as an exercise tool in cystic fibrosis (CF). This study aimed to assess the literature describing whether video games generate a physiological response similar to the exercise intensity needed for training in CF. METHODS: An online search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, SciELO, LILACS and PEDro databases was conducted and original studies describing physiological responses of the use of video games as exercise in CF were included. RESULTS: In four, out of five studies, the heart rate achieved during video games was within the standards recommended for training (60-80%). Two studies assessed VO2 and showed higher levels compared to the six-minute walk test. No desaturation was reported. Most games were classified as moderate intensity. Only one study used a maximum exercise test as comparator. CONCLUSION: Interactive video games generate a heart rate response similar to the intensity required for training in CF patients.",Cystic fibrosis; Interactive video game; Physical exercise; Video games; Video Meta Results Raw,Carbonera RP and Vendrusculo FM and Donadio MV,,,0,166
183,Interactive telemedicine: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine (TM) is the use of telecommunication systems to deliver health care at a distance. It has the potential to improve patient health outcomes, access to health care and reduce healthcare costs. As TM applications continue to evolve it is important to understand the impact TM might have on patients, healthcare professionals and the organisation of care. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and costs of interactive TM as an alternative to, or in addition to, usual care (i.e. face-to-face care, or telephone consultation). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases and two trials registers to June 2013, together with reference checking, citation searching, handsearching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomised controlled trials of interactive TM that involved direct patient-provider interaction and was delivered in addition to, or substituting for, usual care compared with usual care alone, to participants with any clinical condition. We excluded telephone only interventions and wholly automatic self-management TM interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For each condition, we pooled outcome data that were sufficiently homogenous using fixed effect meta-analysis. We reported risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: We included 93 eligible trials (N = 22,047 participants), which evaluated the effectiveness of interactive TM delivered in addition to (32% of studies), as an alternative to (57% of studies), or partly substituted for usual care (11%) as compared to usual care alone.The included studies recruited patients with the following clinical conditions: cardiovascular disease (36), diabetes (21), respiratory conditions (9), mental health or substance abuse conditions (7), conditions requiring a specialist consultation (6), co morbidities (3), urogenital conditions (3), neurological injuries and conditions (2), gastrointestinal conditions (2), neonatal conditions requiring specialist care (2), solid organ transplantation (1), and cancer (1).Telemedicine provided remote monitoring (55 studies), or real-time video-conferencing (38 studies), which was used either alone or in combination. The main TM function varied depending on clinical condition, but fell typically into one of the following six categories, with some overlap: i) monitoring of a chronic condition to detect early signs of deterioration and prompt treatment and advice, (41); ii) provision of treatment or rehabilitation (12), for example the delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy, or incontinence training; iii) education and advice for self-management (23), for example nurses delivering education to patients with diabetes or providing support to parents of very low birth weight infants or to patients with home parenteral nutrition; iv) specialist consultations for diagnosis and treatment decisions (8), v) real-time assessment of clinical status, for example post-operative assessment after minor operation or follow-up after solid organ transplantation (8) vi), screening, for angina (1).The type of data transmitted by the patient, the frequency of data transfer, (e.g. telephone, e-mail, SMS) and frequency of interactions between patient and healthcare provider varied across studies, as did the type of healthcare provider/s and healthcare system involved in delivering the intervention.We found no difference between groups for all-cause mortality for patients with heart failure (16 studies; N = 5239; RR:0.89, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.03, P = 0.12; I(2) = 44%) (moderate to high certainty of evidence) at a median of six months follow-up. Admissions to hospital (11 studies; N = 4529) ranged from a decrease of 64% to an increase of 60% at median eight months follow-up (moderate certainty of evidence). We found some evidence of improved quality of life (five studies; N = 482; MD:-4.39, 95% CI -7.94 to -0.83; P < 0.02; I(2) = 0%) (moderate certainty of evidence) for those allocated to TM as compared with usual care at a median three months follow-up. In studies recruiting participants with diabetes (16 studies; N = 2768) we found lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c %) levels in those allocated to TM than in controls (MD -0.31, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.24; P < 0.00001; I(2)= 42%, P = 0.04) (high certainty of evidence) at a median of nine months follow-up. We found some evidence for a decrease in LDL (four studies, N = 1692; MD -12.45, 95% CI -14.23 to -10.68; P < 0.00001; I(2 =) 0%) (moderate certainty of evidence), and blood pressure (four studies, N = 1770: MD: SBP:-4.33, 95% CI -5.30 to -3.35, P < 0.00001; I(2) = 17%; DBP: -2.75 95% CI -3.28 to -2.22, P < 0.00001; I(2) = 45% (moderate certainty evidence), in TM as compared with usual care.Seven studies that recruited participants with different mental health and substance abuse problems, reported no differences in the effect of therapy delivered over video-conferencing, as compared to face-to-face delivery. Findings from the other studies were inconsistent; there was some evidence that monitoring via TM improved blood pressure control in participants with hypertension, and a few studies reported improved symptom scores for those with a respiratory condition. Studies recruiting participants requiring mental health services and those requiring specialist consultation for a dermatological condition reported no differences between groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings in our review indicate that the use of TM in the management of heart failure appears to lead to similar health outcomes as face-to-face or telephone delivery of care; there is evidence that TM can improve the control of blood glucose in those with diabetes. The cost to a health service, and acceptability by patients and healthcare professionals, is not clear due to limited data reported for these outcomes. The effectiveness of TM may depend on a number of different factors, including those related to the study population e.g. the severity of the condition and the disease trajectory of the participants, the function of the intervention e.g., if it is used for monitoring a chronic condition, or to provide access to diagnostic services, as well as the healthcare provider and healthcare system involved in delivering the intervention.",Video Meta Results Raw,Flodgren G and Rachas A and Farmer AJ and Inzitari M and Shepperd S,,,0,167
184,Robot-Assisted Mckeown Esophagectomy is Feasible After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation. Our Initial Experience,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation has become the standard of care for esophageal cancer, especially for middle third esophageal lesions and those with squamous histology. Although more and more thoracic surgeons and surgical oncologists have now shifted to video-assisted and robot-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy; there is still limited experience for the use of minimal-assisted approaches in patients undergoing surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Most surgeons have concerns of feasibility, safety, and oncological outcomes as well as issues related to difficult learning curve in adopting robotic esophagectomy in patients after chemoradiation. We present our initial experience of Robot-Assisted Mckeown Esophagectomy in 27 patients after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, from May 2013 to October 2014. All patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation to a dose of 50.4 Gy/25Fr with concurrent weekly cisplatin, followed by reassessment with clinical examination and repeat FDG PET/CT 6 weeks after completion of chemoradiation. Patients with progressive disease underwent palliative chemotherapy while patients with either partial or significant response to chemoradiation underwent Robot-Assisted Mckeown Esophagectomy with esophageal replacement by gastric conduit and esophagogastric anastomosis in the left neck. Out of 27 patients, 92.5 % patients had stage cT3/T4 tumours and node-positive disease in 48.1 % on imaging. Most patients were middle thoracic esophageal cancers (23/27), with squamous histology in all except for one. All patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and subsequently underwent Robot Assisted Mckeown Esophagectomy. The average time for robot docking, thoracic mobilization and total surgical procedure was 13.2, 108.4 and 342.7 min, respectively. The procedure was well tolerated by all patients with only one case of peri-operative mortality. Average ICU stay was 6.35 days (range 3-9 days). R0 resection rate of 96.3 % and average lymph node yield of 18 could be achieved. Pathological node negativity rate (pN0) and complete response (pCR) were 66.6 and 44.4 %, respectively. In the initial cases, four patients had to be converted to open due technical reasons or intraoperative complications. The present study, with shorter operative times, similar ICU stay, overall low morbidity, and mortality and optimal oncological outcomes suggest that robot-assisted thoracic mobilization of esophagus in patients with prior chemoradiation is feasible and safe with acceptable oncological outcomes. It has a shorter learning curve and hence allows for a transthoracic minimally invasive transthoracic esophagectomy to more and more patients, otherwise unfit for conventional approach.",RAME= robot assisted Mckeown esophagectomy; CTRT = concurrent chemoradiation; pCR = pathological complete response; MIE = Minimally invasive esophagectomy; MINIMALLY INVASIVE ESOPHAGECTOMY; LYMPH-NODE DISSECTION; THORACOSCOPIC ESOPHAGECTOMY; TRANSHIATAL ESOPHAGECTOMY; ONCOLOGIC OUTCOMES; CANCER; SURGERY; CHEMORADIOTHERAPY; RESECTION; METAANALYSIS; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Goel A and Shah SH and Selvakumar VP and Garg S and Kumar K,,,0,168
185,Optimising activity and participation outcomes for people with self-awareness impairments related to acquired brain injury: an interventions systematic review,"Impaired self-awareness related to acquired brain injury (ABI-ISA) can result in limitations in daily living activities and community participation. We hypothesise that with the appropriate interventions, outcomes for adults with ABI-ISA can be enhanced. The objectives of the study were to describe and examine critically the non-pharmacological intervention literature and to identify intervention elements that optimise everyday living outcomes in adults with ABI-ISA. Two reviewers selected articles and extracted data using five databases, a review protocol, and systematic review standards (i.e., Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Assessing the Quality and Applicability of Systematic Reviews (AQASR)). Included studies reported quantitative activity and participation intervention outcomes for people with stated or measured ABI-ISA, and the methodological quality of randomised controlled trials (RCT) was rated using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale (PEDro). Seventeen articles discussing 15 unique intervention studies were found, including two RCTs of good methodological quality. All studies reported improvements on measures of everyday living, utilised interventions with multiple therapeutic elements, and used various forms of external feedback. Evidence supports the use of intervention protocols including elements of experiential practice, external feedback, Socratic guided discussion, and metacognitive strategy training.",Awareness; brain injuries; review; activities of daily living; social participation; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; STAGE ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE REHABILITATION; STROKE REHABILITATION; COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; MULTICONTEXT APPROACH; VIDEO FEEDBACK; THE-LITERATURE; STRATEGY USE; DEFICITS; Neurosciences; Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw,Engel L and Chui A and Goverover Y and Dawson DR,,,0,169

187,Psychotherapy mediated by remote communication technologies: A meta-analytic review,"Background: Access to psychotherapy is limited by psychopathology (e.g. agoraphobia), physical disability, occupational or social constraints and/or residency in under-served areas. For these populations, interventions delivered via remote communication technologies (e.g. telephone, internet) may be more appropriate. However, there are concerns that such delivery may influence the therapeutic relationship and thus reduce therapy effectiveness. This review aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness of remotely communicated, therapist-delivered psychotherapy. Methods: Systematic review (including electronic database searching and correspondence with authors) of randomized trials of individual remote psychotherapy. Electronic databases searched included MEDLINE (1966–2006), PsycInfo (1967–2006), EMBASE (1980–2006) and CINAHL databases (1982–2006). The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR). All searches were conducted to include studies with a publication date to July 2006. Results: Thirteen studies were identified, ten assessing psychotherapy by telephone, two by internet and one by video conference. Pooled effect sizes for remote therapy versus control conditions were 0.44 for depression (95%CI 0.29 to 0.59, 7 comparisons, n = 726) and 1.15 for anxiety-related disorders (95%CI 0.81 to 1.49, 3 comparisons, n = 168). There were few comparisons of remote versus face-to-face psychotherapy. Conclusion: Remote therapy has the potential to overcome some of the barriers to conventional psychological therapy services. Telephone-based interventions are a particularly popular research focus and as a means of therapeutic communication may confer specific advantages in terms of their widespread availability and ease of operation. However, the available evidence is limited in quantity and quality. More rigorous trials are required to confirm these preliminary estimates of effectiveness. Future research priorities should include overcoming the methodological shortcomings of published work by conducting large-scale trials that incorporate both clinical outcome and more process-orientated measures.

188,Virtual reality training for surgical trainees in laparoscopic surgery,"BACKGROUND: Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. This is time consuming, costly, and of variable effectiveness. Training using a virtual reality simulator is an option to supplement standard training. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether virtual reality training can supplement or replace conventional laparoscopic surgical training (apprenticeship) in surgical trainees with limited or no prior laparoscopic experience. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and grey literature until March 2008. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised clinical trials comparing virtual reality training versus other forms of training including video trainer training, no training, or standard laparoscopic training in surgical trainees with little or no prior laparoscopic experience. We also included trials comparing different methods of virtual reality training. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We collected the data on the characteristics of the trial, methodological quality of the trials, mortality, morbidity, conversion rate, operating time, and hospital stay. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the standardised mean difference with 95% confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included 23 trials with 612 participants. Four trials compared virtual reality versus video trainer training. Twelve trials compared virtual reality versus no training or standard laparoscopic training. Four trials compared virtual reality, video trainer training and no training, or standard laparoscopic training. Three trials compared different methods of virtual reality training. Most of the trials were of high risk of bias. In trainees without prior surgical experience, virtual reality training decreased the time taken to complete a task, increased accuracy, and decreased errors compared with no training; virtual reality group was more accurate than video trainer training group. In the participants with limited laparoscopic experience, virtual reality training reduces operating time and error better than standard in the laparoscopic training group; composite operative performance score was better in the virtual reality group than in the video trainer group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality training can supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training of apprenticeship and is at least as effective as video trainer training in supplementing standard laparoscopic training.

190,Video-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy: keynote lecture,"Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) by thoracoscopy after neoadjuvant therapy results in significant short-term advantages such as a lower incidence of pulmonary infections and a better quality of life (QoL) with the same completeness of resection. After 1 year, a better QoL is still observed for MIE in comparison with the open approach, while having the same survival. Seven issues about implementation of MIE for cancer require discussion: (1) choice of the extension of esophageal resection and use of neoadjuvant therapy; (2) reasons to approach the esophageal cancer by MIE; (3) determining the best minimally invasive approach for gastro-esophageal junction cancers; (4) implementation of evidence-based MIE; (5) standardization of the surgical anatomy of the esophagus based on MIE; (6) future lines of research of MIE; and (7) learning process.

191,Exposure to video games: Effects on sleep and on post-sleep cognitive abilities. A systematic review of experimental evidences,"The public opinion is ever more interested and worried about possible effects of exposure to VGs (video games) on human life and well-being. Scientific literature shows several evidences highlighting negative outcomes on behavioural, emotive, cognitive and physical health spheres. All these aspects are intrinsically linked to sleep quality and quantity and to date very few studies directly investigated the effects of videogame (VG) exposure on sleep and post-sleep cognitive status. The aim of the present systematic review is to examine the impact that the exposure to VGs can produce on sleep pattern and the consequent post-sleep cognitive abilities. To this extent, only studies directly investigating the effects of VGs on sleep features and post-sleep cognitive abilities have been selected and discussed. Data currently present in literature show the alteration of sleep pattern after exposure to VGs. The analysis indicated a reduction of Total Sleep Time (TST) and an increase of Sleep Onset Latency (SOL), modifications of the REM sleep and Slow Wave Sleep (SWS), and increased sleepiness and self-perceived fatigue. Moreover, post-sleep sustained attention and verbal memory also appear to be impaired. It can be concluded that playing VGs for long periods, particularly in the evening, is a significant, common and probable cause of sleep problems: evening exposure to VGs, in fact, can bring to insufficient and low quality sleep, with possible effects on cognition in the subsequent waking days. Potential methodological flaws and limitations of these studies have also been described and discussed. Because of the very limited number of available study on this topic further research is strongly needed. © 2018 Brazilian Association of Sleep and Latin American Federation of Sleep Societies.

192,Neural substrates of sexual arousal are not sex dependent,"Sexual arousal is a dynamical, highly coordinated neurophysiological process that is often induced by visual stimuli. Numerous studies have proposed that the cognitive processing stage of responding to sexual stimuli is the first stage, in which sex differences occur, and the divergence between men and women has been attributed to differences in the concerted activity of neural networks. The present comprehensive metaanalysis challenges this hypothesis and provides robust quantitative evidence that the neuronal circuitries activated by visual sexual stimuli are independent of biological sex. Sixty-one functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (1,850 individuals) that presented erotic visual stimuli to men and women of different sexual orientation were identified. Coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation was used to conduct metaanalyses. Sensitivity and clustering analyses of averaged neuronal response patterns were performed to investigate robustness of the findings. In contrast to neutral stimuli, sexual pictures and videos induce significant activations in brain regions, including insula, middle occipital, anterior cingulate and fusiform gyrus, amygdala, striatum, pulvinar, and substantia nigra. Cluster analysis suggests stimulus type as the most, and biological sex as the least, predictor for classification. Contrast analysis further shows no significant sex-specific differences within groups. Systematic review of sex differences in gray matter volume of brain regions associated with sexual arousal (3,723 adults) did not show any causal relationship between structural features and functional response to visual sexual stimuli. The neural basis of sexual arousal in humans is associated with sexual orientation yet, contrary to the widely accepted view, is not different between women and men.",sexual arousal; neuroimaging; sex differences; metaanalysis; HUMAN BRAIN; GRAY-MATTER; GENDER-DIFFERENCE; WOMEN; METAANALYSIS; ACTIVATION; MEN; BEHAVIOR; STIMULI; ORIENTATION; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw,Mitricheva E and Kimura R and Logothetis NK and Noori HR,,,0,175

Methods: This was an 8-week pilot randomized controlled trial performed as outpatient and self-directed learning at home among 40 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years or older who met criteria for an anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, or anxiety disorder unspecified). The study looked at the BREATHE intervention compared with a wait list control condition. The primary outcome measure was anxiety symptoms (Geriatric Anxiety Scale). Secondary outcomes included activity engagement (modified Activity Card Sort), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire), and somatic symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale). Results: In linear mixed-effects models, findings indicated a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms. There was no significant effect of group on activity engagement. Results also showed significant reductions in depressive and somatic symptoms associated with the BREATHE intervention compared with wait list. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate feasibility and preliminary efficacy for this brief video-delivered relaxation intervention and suggest that older adults can benefit from technology-delivered interventions with minimal provider contact.

It is anticipated that this education will result in beneficial outcomes for the patient. Many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of different formats used to deliver the information, and the effect of this information on a variety of outcomes. While there has been substantial research and several meta-analyses undertaken on different aspects of preoperative education, there has been no previous attempt to summarise this body of research to evaluate its impact on knowledge and understanding of patients. Objective: The objective of this review was to present the best available evidence related to knowledge retention and/or correct performance of postoperative activities after preoperative patient education. Review method: This review considered all studies that included adults in a hospital setting, either as inpatients or same day surgical patients, and who received some form of information and/or instruction before an operative procedure. Interventions were the methods of preoperative patient education, instruction or teaching, and included evaluations of the effectiveness of different presentations such as: written information; audio-visual aids; computer-assisted instruction; learning packages in either group or individual formats, at either pre-admission or post-admission. The primary outcomes were those associated with the understanding of the information related to the operative or postoperative period that were provided in the intervention and included: (1) increased knowledge; (2) ability to perform postoperative activities; and (3) time to teach skills. This review considered randomised controlled trials that evaluated forms of preoperative patient education and their effect on patient understanding, knowledge and ability to perform postoperative activities. Results: The findings of this review support the use of pamphlets to inform patients and to improve their skills. The role of videos as a preoperative instruction tool has not been rigorously evaluated. However, existing studies support the use of preoperative videos to improve patient knowledge and skill. The data suggest that the instructional method, the act of educating a patient by delivering directions for actions or behaviour is useful for improving patients' knowledge of their treatment and their ability to perform and comply with required exercises. However, instruction is likely to be more effective if provided before admission. If teaching is to be done after admission, using a group format has been shown to be equally as effective as individual instruction. Although numerous studies have been performed on many aspects of preoperative education, little high-quality research has assessed the effectiveness of this information on patient knowledge and ability to perform specific skills such as exercises. Further research is required to examine: (i) the effectiveness of pamphlets and other written material for people with English as a second language or limited literary skills; (ii) the accuracy of information provided in preoperative pamphlets; (iii) the effectiveness of pamphlets on general populations; (iv) the role of videos and learning packages; (v) the effectiveness of preoperative instruction; and (vi) the changes in patient misconceptions with the provision of preoperative information.

196,Designing online software for teaching the concept of variable that facilitates mental interaction with the material: systemic approach,"Our case study is a response to the need for research and reporting on specific strategies employed by software designers to produce effective multimedia instructional solutions. A systemic approach for identifying appropriate software features and conducting a formative evaluation that evaluates both the overall effectiveness of the multimedia instructional design and the effectiveness of specific features of the software is presented. The instructional software for teaching the concept of variable was designed as a research platform and tested with 90 undergraduate students at a Midwestern university. Behavior tracking and data collection instruments (pre-test, surveys, and delayed post-test) were embedded in the software. As a part of design-engineering-develop approach, two potential types of feedback, single try versus two tries, were tested in two experimental conditions. The results of the formative evaluation demonstrated preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the designed software with either type of feedback for both high and low prior knowledge students. An innovative instructional strategy of helping the learner mindfully process the program feedback is described.",Video Meta Results Raw,Koehler NA and Thompson AD and Correia AP and Hagedorn LS,,,0,179

198,Testing the limits: Extending attachment-based intervention effects to infant cognitive outcome and parental stress,"Using a sample of 41 infants and toddlers (21 interventions, 20 controls) who were neglected or at serious risk for neglect, this randomized clinical trial examined the efficacy of a parent-child attachment-based video-feedback intervention on parental sensitivity, parental stress, and child mental/psychomotor development. Results showed that following the 8-week intervention, scores for maternal sensitivity and child mental and psychomotor development were higher in the intervention group than in the control group. The intervention appears to have no effect on self-reports of stress. All parents report lower levels of stress postintervention; however, when defensive responding is not considered (i.e., extremely low score of parental stress), parents in the control group report somewhat lower scores, raising questions as to the significance of this finding. Considering the small nature of our sample, replication of the present results is needed. Nevertheless, the present findings contribute to the burgeoning literature suggesting that the early attachment relationship provides an important context that influences developmental outcome in different spheres and raises questions as to how such intervention strategies may or may not affect the subjective experience of parenting.","CHILD INTERACTION THERAPY; RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL; MATERNAL SENSITIVITY; MALTREATING FAMILIES; METAANALYSIS; TODDLERS; PROGRAM; MOTHERS; DYADS; REUNIFICATION; Psychology, Developmental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Dubois-Comtois K and Cyr C and Tarabulsy GM and St-Laurent D and Bernier A and Moss E,,,0,181
199,A review and meta-analysis of the nomological network of trainee reactions,"A review and meta-analysis of studies assessing trainee reactions are presented. Results suggest reactions primarily capture characteristics of the training course, but trainee characteristics (e.g., anxiety and pretraining motivation) and organizational support also have a moderate effect on reactions. Instructional style (ρ = .66) followed by human interaction (ρ = .56) were the best predictors of reactions. Reactions predicted pre-to-post changes in motivation (β = .51) and self-efficacy (β = .24) and were more sensitive than affective and cognitive learning outcomes to trainees' perceptions of characteristics of the training course. Moderator analyses revealed reactions- outcomes correlations tended to be stronger in courses that utilized a high level rather than a low level of technology, and affective and utility reactions did not differ in their relationships with learning outcomes. The current study clarifies the nomological network of reactions and specifies outcomes that are theoretically related to reactions.

201,Mobile Mixed Reality for Experiential Learning and Simulation in Medical and Health Sciences Education,"New accessible learning methods delivered through mobile mixed reality are becoming possible in education, shifting pedagogy from the use of two dimensional images and videos to facilitating learning via interactive mobile environments. This is especially important in medical and health education, where the required knowledge acquisition is typically much more experiential, self-directed, and hands-on than in many other disciplines. Presented are insights obtained from the implementation and testing of two mobile mixed reality interventions across two Australian higher education classrooms in medicine and health sciences, concentrating on student perceptions of mobile mixed reality for learning physiology and anatomy in a face-to-face medical and health science classroom and skills acquisition in airways management focusing on direct laryngoscopy with foreign body removal in a distance paramedic science classroom. This is unique because most studies focus on a single discipline, focusing on either skills or the learner experience and a single delivery modality rather than linking cross-discipline knowledge acquisition and the development of a student's tangible skills across multimodal classrooms. Outcomes are presented from post-intervention student interviews and discipline academic observation, which highlight improvements in learner motivation and skills, but also demonstrated pedagogical challenges to overcome with mobile mixed reality learning.","mixed reality; mobile learning; experiential learning; augmented reality; virtual reality; 3D printing; distance education; paramedic science; simulation; medical education; METAANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIES; FIDELITY; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science; Video Meta Results Raw",Birt J and Stromberga Z and Cowling M and Moro C,,,0,184
202,Can We Predict Technical Aptitude?: A Systematic Review,"OBJECTIVE: To identify background characteristics and cognitive tests that may predict surgical trainees' future technical performance, and therefore be used to supplement existing surgical residency selection criteria. BACKGROUND: Assessment of technical skills is not commonly incorporated as part of the selection process for surgical trainees in North America. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that not all trainees are capable of reaching technical competence. Therefore, incorporating technical aptitude into selection processes may prove useful. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out of the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase online databases to identify all studies that assessed associations between surrogate markers of innate technical abilities in surgical trainees, and whether these abilities correlate with technical performance. The quality of each study was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. RESULTS: A total of 8035 records were identified. After screening by title, abstract, and full text, 52 studies were included. Very few surrogate markers were found to predict technical performance. Significant associations with technical performance were seen for 1 of 23 participant-reported surrogate markers, 2 of 25 visual spatial tests, and 2 of 19 dexterity tests. The assessment of trainee Basic Performance Resources predicted technical performance in 62% and 75% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: To date, no single test has been shown to reliably predict the technical performance of surgical trainees. Strategies that rely on assessing multiple innate abilities, their interaction, and their relationship with technical skill may ultimately be more likely to serve as reliable predictors of future surgical performance.",Video Meta Results Raw,Louridas M and Szasz P and de Montbrun S and Harris KA and Grantcharov TP,,,0,185
203,THE IMPACT OF USING MODERN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES ON DRIVING SAFETY,"With the development and application of modern information and communication equipment and services (ICES), global society has undergone significant development and progress in everyday life. Along with the positive, negative aspects of their usage have evolved. One of the problems is the new sources of driver distraction, which ultimately results in a serious, growing daily threat to traffic safety. Simultaneously with the development of ICES, the number of distracters (mobile terminal devices, laptops, smart watches, and others) has increased as well, which also reduces the level of safety and affects the quality of driving. With the increase in participation and ownership of mobile terminal devices, as well as the implementation of modern multimedia information and communication systems in vehicles, this problem will further escalate in the coming years. The unfavorable factor comes from the fact that distraction factors influenced by using ICES belong to bio-mechanical, cognitive, auditory, and visual categories, which directly affects essential human functions for successful and safe vehicle operation. This paper provides insight into the issue of distraction factors that affect drivers with an emphasis on those caused by using modern ICES.",information and communication; equipment; services; mobile terminal devices; nomadic devices; traffic safety; distraction; driver; IN-VEHICLE; DRIVER DISTRACTION; MOBILE PHONE; SYSTEMS; TASKS; METAANALYSIS; DEVICES; AGE; Transportation Science & Technology; Transportation; Video Meta Results Raw,Jovovic I and Perakovic D and Husnjak S,,,0,186
204,Using Evidence-Centered Design to Create a Special Educator Observation System,"The evidence-centered design framework was used to create a special education teacher observation system, Recognizing Effective Special Education Teachers. Extensive reviews of research informed the domain analysis and modeling stages, and led to the conceptual framework in which effective special education teaching is operationalized as the ability to effectively implement evidence-based practices for students with disabilities. In the assessment implementation stage, four raters evaluated 40 videos and provided evidence to support the scores assigned to teacher performances. An inductive approach was used to analyze the data and to create empirically derived, item-level performance descriptors. In the assessment delivery stage, four different raters evaluated the same videos using the fully developed rubric. Many-facet Rasch measurement analyses showed that the item, teacher, lesson, and rater facets achieved high psychometric quality. This process can be applied to other content areas to develop teacher observation systems that provide accurate evaluations and feedback to improve instructional practice.","many-facet Rasch measurement; observation systems; special education teacher evaluation; LEARNING-DISABILITIES; TEACHER EVALUATION; STUDENTS; METAANALYSIS; INSTRUCTION; CHALLENGES; Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Educational; Education & Educational Research; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Johnson ES and Crawford A and Moylan LA and Zheng Y,,,0,187
205,Distance Education and Spatial Citizenship in Africa--Challenges and Prospects,"The relevance of GIS for sustainable development in Africa is undisputed. One web 2.0 application which plays a particularly strong role within local governance structures in Africa is PGIS (Participatory Geographical Information System). In fact, Spatial Citizenship education is the basis for the empowerment of the indigenous capacity for using PGIS. This article will introduce the concept of Citizenship and address the question: What are the conditions in Africa that enhance Spatial Citizenship through distance education? Consequently, the relationship between ICT, distance education, e-government, geographic information technologies, and PGIS in Africa is of central interest. These interrelationships have been studied within the context of a meta-analysis of already published data and qualified studies of these topics. One of the results of this investigation is that there is no lack of distance education materials for GIS and PGIS; even so, all are being developed for the post-secondary education sector and not for primary and secondary education. In addition, online-based distance learning is not accessible for all African citizens due to a lack of skills, technical equipment, and financial means. As a solution for this problem, m-learning approaches need to be advanced.","Africa; ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Elementary Secondary Education; Geographic Information Systems; Citizenship Education; Indigenous Populations; Correlation; Access to Computers; Postsecondary Education; Geographic Regions; Foreign Countries; Telecommunications; Governance; Web 2.0 Technologies; Spatial Ability; Distance Education; Educational Technology; Barriers; Handheld Devices; Technology Uses in Education; Meta Analysis; Citizen Participation; Video Meta Results Raw",Kanwischer D and Quennet F,,,0,188
206,"The Study of Mental and Resistance Training (SMART) Study-Resistance Training and/or Cognitive Training in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Double-Sham Controlled Trial","Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increases dementia risk with no pharmacologic treatment available. Methods: The Study of Mental and Resistance Training was a randomized, double-blind, double-sham controlled trial of adults with MCI. Participants were randomized to 2 supervised interventions: active or sham physical training (high intensity progressive resistance training vs seated calisthenics) plus active or sham cognitive training (computerized, multidomain cognitive training vs watching videos/quizzes), 2-3 days/week for 6 months with 18-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were global cognitive function (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale; ADAS-Cog) and functional independence (Bayer Activities of Daily Living). Secondary outcomes included executive function, memory, and speed/attention tests, and cognitive domain scores. Results: One hundred adults with MCI [70.1 (6.7) years; 68% women] were enrolled and analyzed. Resistance training significantly improved the primary outcome ADAS-Cog; [relative effect size (95% confidence interval) -0.33 (-0.73, 0.06); P <.05] at 6 months and executive function (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Matrices; P = .016) across 18 months. Normal ADAS-Cog scores occurred in 48% (24/ 49) after resistance training vs 27% (14/ 51) without resistance training [P <.03; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 3.50 (1.18, 10.48)]. Cognitive training only attenuated decline in Memory Domain at 6 months (P < . 02). Resistance training 18-month benefit was 74% higher (P = .02) for Executive Domain compared with combined training [z-score change -0.42 (0.22, 0.63) resistance training vs 0.11 (-0.60, 0.28) combined] and 48% higher (P <.04) for Global Domain [z-score change -.0.45 (0.29, 0.61) resistance training vs 0.23 (0.10, 0.36) combined]. Conclusions: Resistance training significantly improved global cognitive function, with maintenance of executive and global benefits over 18 months.

207,Whether and How Authentic Contexts Using a Virtual Chemistry Lab Support Learning,"How can we help students develop an understanding of chemistry that integrates conceptual knowledge with the experimental and computational procedures needed to apply chemistry in authentic contexts? The current work describes ChemVLab +, a set of online chemistry activities that were developed using promising design principles from chemistry education and learning science research: setting instruction in authentic contexts, connecting concepts with science practices, linking multiple representations, and using formative assessment with feedback. A study with more than 1400 high school students found that students using the online activities demonstrated increased learning as evidenced by improved problem solving and inquiry over the course of the activities and by statistically significant improvements from pre-to posttest. Further, exploratory analyses suggest that students may learn most effectively from these materials when the activities are used after initial exposure to the content and when they work individually rather than in pairs.","High School/Introductory Chemistry; First-Year Undergraduate/General; Chemical Education Research; Internet/Web-Based Learning; Multimedia-Based Learning; Stoichiometry; Equilibrium; Thermodynamics; MULTIPLE REPRESENTATIONS; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; COMPUTER-SIMULATIONS; METAANALYSIS; FRAMEWORK; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Chemistry; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Davenport JL and Rafferty AN and Yaron DJ,,,0,190
208,Costs and Benefits of More Learner Freedom: Meta-Analyses of Exploratory and Learner Control Training Methods,"Objective: Individual meta-analyses were conducted for six training methods as part of a U.S. Army basic research project. The objective was to identify evidence-based guidelines for the effectiveness of each training method, under different moderating conditions, for cognitive skill transfer in adult learning. Results and implications for two of these training methods, learner control (LC) and exploratory learning (EL), are discussed. LC provides learners with active control over training variables. EL requires learners to discover relationships and interactions between variables. Background: There is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of both LC and EL learning methods on transfer relative to more guided training methods. Cognitive load theory (CLT) provides a basis for predicting that training strategies that manage intrinsic load of a task during training and minimize extraneous load will avail more resources that can be devoted to learning. Method: Meta-analyses were conducted using a Hedges's g analysis of effect sizes. Control conditions with little to no learner freedom were contrasted with treatment conditions manipulating more learner freedom. Results: Overall more LC was no different from training with limited or no learner control, and more EL was less effective than limited or no exploration; however, each can be effective under certain conditions. Both strategies have been more effective for cognitive skill learning than for knowledge recall tasks. LC exhibited more benefit to very near transfer, whereas EL's benefit was to far transfer. Conclusion: Task type, transfer test, and transfer distance moderate the overall transfer cost of more learner freedom. Application: The findings are applicable to the development of instructional design guidelines for the use of LC and EL in adult skill training.",Video Meta Results Raw,Carolan TF and Hutchins SD and Wickens CD and Cumming JM,,,0,191

Tailor-made evaluation plans were produced for each website; the evaluation was conducted by an evaluation officer, and a report was provided to each teacher, thus supporting continuous development. To date, 58 cases of evaluation data have been collected. In this paper, a meta-analysis across these cases is presented in order to see which are the most useful web-assisted functions currently in use in Hong Kong universities. This study indicates the following four functions as being most useful: learning tools such as glossaries, notes and PowerPoints, assessment tasks associated with grades, and creation and exhibition of multimedia projects. The reasons for these rankings are postulated.

212,Women Who Emerge as Leaders in Temporarily Assigned Work Groups: Attractive and Socially Competent but Not Babyfaced or Naive?,"The underrepresentation of women in top positions has been in the spotlight of research for decades. Prejudice toward female leaders, which decreases women's chances of emerging as leaders, has been discussed as a potential reason. Aiming to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this prejudice, we focused on the question of how facial characteristics might influence women's leadership emergence. Because other research has related ascribed social competence and ascribed naivete to attractiveness and babyfacedness, respectively, we hypothesized that ascribed social competence would mediate the impact of ascribed attractiveness on leadership emergence and that ascribed naivete would mediate the impact of ascribed babyfacedness on leadership emergence. In a pilot study, we analyzed data from 101 participants of a women's leadership contest held in 2015 in Germany. We then confirmed these results in a methodologically improved main study on other women who participated in the contest in one of two other years: 2016 and 2017 (N = 195). Women applied to participate in the contest by recording their answers to several questions in a video interview. In the contest, they were assigned to teams of about ten women each and worked on several assessment-center-like tasks. After each task, each member of each team nominated the three women they believed showed the best leadership potential in their group. We operationalized women's leadership emergence as the number of nominations received. We measured participants' facial attractiveness, babyfacedness, social competence, and naivete by having raters follow a specifically developed rating manual to rate the answers the women gave in the video interviews. In both studies, the results indicated that women with higher ascribed facial attractiveness had higher ascribed social competence, which significantly predicted leadership emergence in the contest. Likewise, women with higher ascribed babyfacedness had higher ascribed naivete, which significantly, albeit only slightly, negatively predicted leadership emergence. We discuss the implications of the results for personnel selection.","leadership emergence; babyfacedness; attractiveness; social competence; naivete; PHYSICAL APPEARANCE; ROLE CONGRUITY; FACIAL MATURITY; GENDER; STEREOTYPES; PERCEPTION; CONSEQUENCES; METAANALYSIS; IMPRESSIONS; ACHIEVEMENT; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Gruber FM and Veidt C and Ortner TM,,,0,194
213,A systematic review of flipped classroom empirical evidence from different fields: what are the gaps and future trends?,"Purpose: Despite the enhanced popularity of flipped classroom research, there is a lack of empirical evidence reported about the different impacts revealed by the implementation of this concept. Therefore, to respond to this issue, this study aims to review and analyze the trends and contents of flipped classroom research based on 48 studies recently published in 2017 and 2018. The analysis was based on flipped classroom impacts from various fields. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review and content analysis were used as a methodology to investigate positive impacts and challenges of flipped classroom implementation. Findings: The results of the analysis were interpreted using descriptive analysis. Analysis of the impact revealed that the flipped classroom yielded positive impacts on students’ learning activities such as academic performance, learning motivation and/or engagement, social interaction and self-directed learning skills. Meanwhile, the most significant challenges encountered by the instructors is a lack of students’ motivation to watch the pre-recorded video lectures or to study the contents outside of the class time. Practical implications: Several issues in this discussion become implications that can be taken into consideration for future research. The findings suggest that the flipped classroom concept might be effective in promoting the twenty-first century learning skills. Originality/value: While highlighting the limitations of an ineffective flipped classroom implementation, this study proposes further recommendations for future research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Social interaction; Flipped classroom; Motivation; Research gaps; Academic achievement; Self-directed learning skills; LEARNING-PERFORMANCE; 1ST PRINCIPLES; STUDENTS; EDUCATION; MODEL; INSTRUCTION; EXPERIENCES; DESIGN; IMPACT; MOTIVATION; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Zainuddin Z and Haruna H and Li X and Zhang Y and Chu SK,,,0,195
214,Systematic review of predictors of surgical performance,"BACKGROUND: Selection criteria for surgical training are not scientifically proven. There is a need to define which attributes predict future surgical performance. The aim of this study was to examine the predictive value of specific attributes that impact on surgical performance. METHODS: All studies assessing the predictive power of specified attributes with regard to outcome measures of surgical performance in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Educational Resources Information Centre databases, and bibliographies of selected articles from 1950 to November 2010 were considered for inclusion by two independent reviewers. Information on study identifiers, participant characteristics, predictors assessed, evaluation methods for predictors, outcome measures, results and statistical analysis was collected. Quality assessment was carried out using the Hayden criteria. RESULTS: Visual-spatial perception correlated with both subjective and objective assessments of surgical performance, including rate of skill acquisition. Visual-spatial perception did not correlate with operative ability in experts, although it did with operative ability at the end of a training programme. Psychomotor aptitude, assessed collectively, correlated with rate of skill acquisition. Academic achievement predicted completion of a training programme and passing end-of-training examinations, but did not predict clinical performance during the training programme. CONCLUSION: Intermediate- and high-level visual-spatial perception, as well as psychomotor aptitude, can be used as criteria for assessing candidates for surgical training. Academic achievement is an effective predictor of successful completion of training programmes and should continue to form part of the assessment of surgical candidates.",Video Meta Results Raw,Maan ZN and Maan IN and Darzi AW and Aggarwal R,,,0,196
215,"Spatial cognition, navigation, and mobility among children in a forager-horticulturalist population, the Tsimane of Bolivia","In many societies, males range farther than females, and this greater environmental experience may foster better spatial ability. Females are also reported to be more harm-avoidant, which may reduce spatial exploration. We evaluated these relationships among 6-18 year old Tsimane children, who live in a forager-horticulturalist society where both girls and boys have few constraints on spatial exploration compared to children in Western societies. Mobility was assessed through GPS tracking and interview, spatial ability through pointing accuracy, perspective-taking and mental rotation, and harm avoidance through interview. Few gender differences were found in mobility or spatial ability, although males pointed more accurately to challenging (high sinuosity) routes. Both girls and boys became more harm avoidant about travel risks as they got older, but there were few gender differences in harm avoidance. Schooling was associated with better performance on mental rotation but worse performance on regional pointing accuracy, probably because schooling limits outdoor spatial exploration.","Spatial cognition; Navigation; Gender; Children; Learning; Tsimane; SEX-DIFFERENCES; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; MENTAL-ROTATION; ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERIENCE; TEST-PERFORMANCE; TIME ALLOCATION; RISK-TAKING; ABILITY; METAANALYSIS; DIFFERENCE; Psychology, Developmental; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Davis HE and Cashdan E,,,0,197
216,Experienced Practitioners' Views on Interpersonal Skills in Telehealth Delivery,"Background. As telehealth becomes a larger part of the health care landscape, clinicians are becoming prepared to operate technology-based systems for conducting routine care and exchanging information. Less defined are interpersonal skills for telehealth care delivery such as communication and therapeutic relationships that can influence clinical outcomes. Examples include clinician adaptability to the communication process via telehealth, clinician congeniality in communications, and clinician commitment to achieve telepresence. The purpose of this study was to describe interpersonal skills for telehealth delivery to assist in the preparation of health professionals. Methods. A qualitative methods approach was used to build on results from our previously published systematic review. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with experienced practitioners or educators (n=6) at multiple regional telehealth centers. Video/audio-recorded sessions were transcribed verbatim and researchers conducted thematic analysis of data until achieving saturation of data. Results. Participants provided their perspectives about interpersonal skills important for quality telehealth delivery based on professional experiences. Analysis of responses across interviews showed strong alignment with the six themes identified previously as non-technical clinician attributes: pre-interactional, verbal communication, non-verbal communication, relational, environmental, and educational. Also, an additional theme of management/operations emerged. Suggested training topics crossed clinical disciplines and ranged from telemedicine etiquette and verbal skills to equipment operation and billing and coding. Each study participant commented on benefits from preparation of telehealth clinicians related to the clinician-patient interaction such as patient engagement, patient-centered care, patient satisfaction, patient implementation of care plans, effective communication with patients, and quality assessment of telehealth sessions. Conclusions. This study identified interpersonal skills that may be applied in professional education for telehealth delivery from the perspective of experienced practitioners. Further research could explore outcomes from professional preparation for interpersonal skills and patient perspectives.",TELEMEDICINE; COMMUNICATION; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Henry BW and Ames LJ and Block DE and Vozenilek JA,,,0,198
217,Instructional strategies framework for military training systems,"In an effort to improve training efficiency, the military has focused much attention on the development of replicable and generalizable training systems. As a result, a substantial number of companies and contractors have spent significant time and money developing a wide-array of simulators, virtual reality programs, and the like. However, many are designed without considering the effectiveness and efficiency of embedded instructional strategies. In response, the current review argues for the creation of improved training systems through the incorporation of a repository of research-based instructional strategies that can be employed across the entire training cycle. Using a grounded theory method, this review consolidates the vast literature on instructional strategies from the fields of education and the cognitive sciences into a coherent framework that can be used to enhance the design of military training systems. In particular, this review is intended to provide a concise, organized, and practical framework for the selection and implementation of research-based instructional strategies relevant to military training goals.

218,Situational Awareness as an Instructable and Instructed Matter in Multi-Media Supported Debriefing: a Case Study from Aviation,"Debriefing is an important practice for learning from experience especially in high-risk industries, including the medical field and aviation. Although it might be assumed that tools aiding in representing the events to be debriefed will improve the learning outcomes, meta-analytic studies appear to show that there is no advantage to debriefing sessions that use videos. Simultaneously, such meta-analytic studies are calling for process-related investigations of debriefing generally and those focusing on representational tools more specifically. In this study, we provide an exemplary interaction analysis of debriefing meetings in aviation that immediately follow 4-hour examination sessions. We examine how situational awareness—a crucial feature of aircraft piloting performance—becomes an instructable and instructed matter in and through the meetings.

219,A meta-analysis of the effects of feedback in computer-based instruction,"A quantitative research synthesis (meta-analysis) was conducted on the literature concerning the effects of feedback on learning from computer-based instruction (CBI). Despite the widespread acceptance of feedback in computerized instruction, empirical support for particular types of feedback information has been inconsistent and contradictory. Effect size calculations from twenty-two studies involving the administration of immediate achievement posttests resulted in a weighted mean effect size of .80. Also, a mean weighted effect size of .35 was obtained from nine studies involving delayed posttest administration. Feedback effects on learning and retention were found to vary with CBI typology, format of unit content and access to supplemental materials. Results indicate that the diagnostic and prescriptive management strategies of computer-based adaptive instructional systems provide the most effective feedback. The implementation of effective feedback in computerized instruction involves the computer's ability to verify the correctness of the learner's answer and the underlying causes of error.",Video Meta Results Raw,Azevedo R and Bernard RM,,,1,201
220,Systematic review of sedentary behaviour and health indicators in school-aged children and youth: an update,"This systematic review is an update examining the relationships between objectively and subjectively measured sedentary behaviour and health indicators in children and youth aged 5-17 years. EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Medline were searched in December 2014, and date limits were imposed (≥February 2010). Included studies were peer-reviewed and met the a priori-determined population (apparently healthy children and youth, mean age: 5-17 years), intervention (durations, patterns, and types of sedentary behaviours), comparator (various durations, patterns, and types of sedentary behaviours), and outcome (critical: body composition, metabolic syndrome/cardiovascular disease risk factors, behavioural conduct/pro-social behaviour, academic achievement; important: fitness, self-esteem) study criteria. Quality of evidence by outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. Due to heterogeneity, a narrative analysis was conducted. A total of 235 studies (194 unique samples) were included representing 1 657 064 unique participants from 71 different countries. Higher durations/frequencies of screen time and television (TV) viewing were associated with unfavourable body composition. Higher duration/frequency of TV viewing was also associated with higher clustered cardiometabolic risk scores. Higher durations of TV viewing and video game use were associated with unfavourable behavioural conduct/pro-social behaviour. Higher durations of reading and doing homework were associated with higher academic achievement. Higher duration of screen time was associated with lower fitness. Higher durations of screen time and computer use were associated with lower self-esteem. Evidence ranged from \very low\' to \'moderate\' quality. Higher quality studies using reliable and valid sedentary behaviour measures should confirm this largely observational evidence.'",TV; academic achievement; assis; body composition; cardiovascular disease; comportement prosocial; composition corporelle; condition physique; estime de soi; fitness; maladie cardiovasculaire; metabolic syndrome; pro-social behaviour; rendement scolaire; screen time; self-esteem; sitting; syndrome métabolique; temps d’écran; télé; Video Meta Results Raw,Carson V and Hunter S and Kuzik N and Gray CE and Poitras VJ and Chaput JP and Saunders TJ and Katzmarzyk PT and Okely AD and Connor Gorber S and Kho ME and Sampson M and Lee H and Tremblay MS,,,0,202

222,A Novel Model for Advancing Sexual Assault Education and Prevention on Campus,"Teachers of psychology have been called to both educate college students about interpersonal violence (e.g., sexual assault) and use service learning. However, few models exist for how teachers may simultaneously address both of these calls. This article describes a service-learning course in psychology that integrated an evidence-based, bystander intervention program (BIP) into it in order to provide students with both sexual assault education and roles for advancing sexual assault prevention on campus. Sixteen students in an undergraduate psychology course watched TakeCare, a video shown to improve students' positive bystander behavior to prevent sexual assault and then facilitated delivery of TakeCare to 156 other students on campus. This course illustrates a novel model for advancing sexual assault education and prevention on campus, and the model may be used in other psychology courses. Future directions for implementing and evaluating this model are described.","sexual assault; bystander effect; college students; violence; service learning; ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; BYSTANDER EDUCATION; VICTIMIZATION; VIOLENCE; METAANALYSIS; IMPACT; WOMEN; Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Education & Educational Research; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Cavanaugh CE,,,0,204
224,Compound cuing in free recall,"According to the retrieved context theory of episodic memory, the cue for recall of an item is a weighted sum of recently activated cognitive states, including previously recalled and studied items as well as their associations. We show that this theory predicts there should be compound cuing in free recall. Specifically, the temporal contiguity effect should be greater when the 2 most recently recalled items were studied in contiguous list positions. A meta-analysis of published free recall experiments demonstrates evidence for compound cuing in both conditional response probabilities and interresponse times. To help rule out a rehearsal-based account of these compound cuing effects, we conducted an experiment with immediate, delayed, and continual-distractor free recall conditions. Consistent with retrieved context theory but not with a rehearsal-based account, compound cuing was present in all conditions, and was not significantly influenced by the presence of interitem distractors.

226,Laparoscopic surgical box model training for surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience,"BACKGROUND: Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. This is time consuming, costly, and of variable effectiveness. Training using a box model physical simulator - either a video box or a mirrored box - is an option to supplement standard training. However, the impact of this modality on trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare the benefits and harms of box model training versus no training, another box model, animal model, or cadaveric model training for surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to May 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised clinical trials comparing box model trainers versus no training in surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience. We also included trials comparing different methods of box model training. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently identified trials and collected data. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager for analysis. For each outcome, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-five trials contributed data to the quantitative synthesis in this review. All but one trial were at high risk of bias. Overall, 16 trials (464 participants) provided data for meta-analysis of box training (248 participants) versus no supplementary training (216 participants). All the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers. Overall, 14 trials (382 participants) provided data for quantitative comparison of different methods of box training. There were no trials comparing box model training versus animal model or cadaveric model training. Box model training versus no training: The meta-analysis showed that the time taken for task completion was significantly shorter in the box trainer group than the control group (8 trials; 249 participants; SMD -0.48 seconds; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.22). Compared with the control group, the box trainer group also had lower error score (3 trials; 69 participants; SMD -0.69; 95% CI -1.21 to -0.17), better accuracy score (3 trials; 73 participants; SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.17), and better composite performance scores (SMD 0.65; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88). Three trials reported movement distance but could not be meta-analysed as they were not in a format for meta-analysis. There was significantly lower movement distance in the box model training compared with no training in one trial, and there were no significant differences in the movement distance between the two groups in the other two trials. None of the remaining secondary outcomes such as mortality and morbidity were reported in the trials when animal models were used for assessment of training, error in movements, and trainee satisfaction. Different methods of box training: One trial (36 participants) found significantly shorter time taken to complete the task when box training was performed using a simple cardboard box trainer compared with the standard pelvic trainer (SMD -3.79 seconds; 95% CI -4.92 to -2.65). There was no significant difference in the time taken to complete the task in the remaining three comparisons (reverse alignment versus forward alignment box training; box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; and single incision versus multiport box model training). There were no significant differences in the error score between the two groups in any of the comparisons (box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; single incision versus multiport box model training; Z-maze box training versus U-maze box training). The only trial that reported accuracy score found significantly higher accuracy score with Z-maze box training than U-maze box training (1 trial; 16 participants; SMD 1.55; 95% CI 0.39 to 2.71). One trial (36 participants) found significantly higher composite score with simple cardboard box trainer compared with conventional pelvic trainer (SMD 0.87; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.56). Another trial (22 participants) found significantly higher composite score with reverse alignment compared with forward alignment box training (SMD 1.82; 95% CI 0.79 to 2.84). There were no significant differences in the composite score between the intervention and control groups in any of the remaining comparisons. None of the secondary outcomes were adequately reported in the trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review are threatened by both risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance). Laparoscopic box model training appears to improve technical skills compared with no training in trainees with no previous laparoscopic experience. The impacts of this decreased time on patients and healthcare funders in terms of improved outcomes or decreased costs are unknown. There appears to be no significant differences in the improvement of technical skills between different methods of box model training. Further well-designed trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary. Such trials should assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills in both the short and long term, as well as clinical outcomes when the trainee becomes competent to operate on patients.",Video Meta Results Raw,Nagendran M and Toon CD and Davidson BR and Gurusamy KS,,,0,207
227,Unraveling Platform Strategies: A Review from an Organizational Ambidexterity Perspective,"Platform strategies, which highlight the interdependence in and evolution of business ecosystems, are increasingly relevant for sustainable business models in the digital era. So far, platform research has existed as a fragmented body of insights from different fields, but an integrated theoretical perspective can lead to a more coherent understanding of the research overall. Organizational ambidexterity emphasizes the balance between exploration and exploitation, which is particularly conducive to understanding the sustainability of a firm. Using an organizational ambidexterity perspective, the authors analyze five platform strategies: pricing, openness, integration, differentiation, and envelopment. This paper provides a systematic review of the theoretical and empirical studies in leading management, economics, and information systems journals from 2000 to 2016. The findings show that platform strategies can help platform owners achieve ambidexterity by domain, temporal, and organizational separation. Finally, this paper proposes an agenda for future research.",platform strategies; pricing; openness; integration; differentiation; envelopment; organizational ambidexterity; DIGITAL BUSINESS STRATEGY; MULTI-SIDED PLATFORMS; VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; WORD-OF-MOUTH; 2-SIDED MARKETS; SOFTWARE INDUSTRY; EMPIRICAL-TEST; SOCIAL MEDIA; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Video Meta Results Raw,Wan X and Cenamor J and Parker G and Van Alstyne M,,,0,208
228,HIV-Associated Cognitive Impairment in Perinatally Infected Children: A Meta-analysis,"CONTEXT: Research shows, conclusively, that perinatal HIV infection has negative effects on cognitive functioning of children and adolescents. However, the extent of these cognitive impairments is unknown. Current literature does not document specific cognitive domains most affected in HIV-infected children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze the degree of cognitive impairment, and the specific cognitive domains affected, in children and adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV infection. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched 5 electronic bibliographic databases, namely: PubMed, PsychINFO, Academic Search Premier, Scopus, and WorldCat, by using a search protocol specifically designed for this study. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected on the basis of set a priori eligibility criteria. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were assessed by 2 independent reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from included studies were extracted into Microsoft Excel by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were identified for inclusion in the systematic review and of this, 6 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results from the meta-analysis indicated that working memory and executive function were the domains most affected by the HIV virus. LIMITATIONS: Only 27% of the included studies were suitable to enter into the meta-analysis. There was significant geographic bias in published studies, with only 32% (7/22) of included studies from sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence supports an association between HIV infection in children and adolescents and cognitive impairment in the domains of working memory, executive function and processing speed, with effect size estimates also providing some support for deficits in visual memory and visual-spatial ability.",HIV; cognitive impairment; perinatally infected children; meta-analysis; Cognitive Impairment; HIV; Infectious Disorders; Meta Analysis; Video Meta Results Raw,Phillips N and Amos T and Kuo C and Hoare J and Ipser J and Thomas KG and Stein DJ,,,0,209
229,Mobile phone messaging for facilitating self-management of long-term illnesses,"BACKGROUND: Long-term illnesses affect a significant proportion of the population in developed and developing countries. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), may present convenient, cost-effective ways of supporting self-management and improving patients' self-efficacy skills through, for instance, medication reminders, therapy adjustments or supportive messages. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging applications designed to facilitate self-management of long-term illnesses, in terms of impact on health outcomes and patients' capacity to self-manage their condition. Secondary objectives include assessment of: user evaluation of the intervention; health service utilisation and costs; and possible risks and harms associated with the intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009).We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We selected only studies where it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third. Primary outcomes of interest were health outcomes as a result of the intervention and capacity to self-manage long-term conditions. We also considered patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, health service utilisation and costs, and potential harms or adverse effects. The included studies were heterogeneous in type of condition addressed, intervention characteristics and outcome measures. Therefore, a meta-analysis to derive an overall effect size for the main outcome categories was not considered justified and findings are presented narratively. MAIN RESULTS: We included four randomised controlled trials involving 182 participants.For the primary outcome of health outcomes, including physiological measures, there is moderate quality evidence from two studies involving people with diabetes showing no statistical difference from text messaging interventions compared with usual care or email reminders for glycaemic control (HbA1c), the frequency of diabetic complications, or body weight. There is moderate quality evidence from one study of hypertensive patients that the mean blood pressure and the proportion of patients who achieved blood pressure control were not significantly different in the intervention and control groups, and that there was no statistically significant difference in mean body weight between the groups. There is moderate quality evidence from one study that asthma patients receiving a text messaging intervention experienced greater improvements on peak expiratory flow variability (mean difference (MD) -11.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -19.56 to -2.68) and the pooled symptom score comprising four items (cough, night symptoms, sleep quality, and maximum tolerated activity) (MD -0.36, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.17) compared with the control group. However, the study found no significant differences between the groups in impact on forced vital capacity or forced expiratory flow in 1 second.For the primary outcome of capacity to self-manage the condition, there is moderate quality evidence from one study that diabetes patients receiving the text messaging intervention demonstrated improved scores on measures of self-management capacity (Self-Efficacy for Diabetes score (MD 6.10, 95% CI 0.45 to 11.75), Diabetes Social Support Interview pooled score (MD 4.39, 95% CI 2.85 to 5.92)), but did not show improved knowledge of diabetes. There is moderate quality evidence from three studies of the effects on treatment compliance. One study showed an increase in hypertensive patients' rates of medication compliance in the intervention group (MD 8.90, 95% CI 0.18 to 17.62) compared with the control group, but in another study there was no statistically significant effect on rates of compliance with peak expiratory flow measurement in asthma patients. Text message prompts for diabetic patients initially also resulted in a higher number of blood glucose results sent back (46.0) than email prompts did (23.5).For the secondary outcome of participants' evaluation of the intervention, there is very low quality evidence from two studies that patients receiving mobile phone messaging support reported perceived improvement in diabetes self-management, wanted to continue receiving messages, and preferred mobile phone messaging to email as a method to access a computerised reminder system.For the secondary outcome of health service utilisation, there is very low quality evidence from two studies. Diabetes patients receiving text messaging support made a comparable number of clinic visits and calls to an emergency hotline as patients without the support. For asthma patients the total number of office visits was higher in the text messaging group, whereas the number of hospital admissions was higher for the control group.Because of the small number of trials included, and the low overall number of participants, for any of the reviewed outcomes the quality of the evidence can at best be considered moderate. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found some, albeit very limited, indications that in certain cases mobile phone messaging interventions may provide benefit in supporting the self-management of long-term illnesses. However, there are significant information gaps regarding the long-term effects, acceptability, costs, and risks of such interventions. Given the enthusiasm with which so-called mHealth interventions are currently being implemented, further research into these issues is needed.",Video Meta Results Raw,de Jongh T and Gurol-Urganci I and Vodopivec-Jamsek V and Car J and Atun R,,,0,210
230,The effect of read-aloud assistance on the text comprehension of dyslexic and non-dyslexic English language learners,"One of the special arrangements in testing contexts is to allow dyslexic students to listen to the text while they read. In our study, we investigated the effect of read-aloud assistance on young English learners' language comprehension scores. We also examined whether students with dyslexia identification benefit from this assistance differently from their peers with no official identification of dyslexia. Our research was conducted with young Slovenian learners of English who performed four language assessment tasks adapted from a standardized battery of Slovenian national English language tests. In a counter-balanced design, 233 students with no identified dyslexia and 47 students with dyslexia identification completed two language comprehension tasks in a reading-only condition, one task with read-aloud assistance and one task in listening-only mode. We used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Modelling (GLMM) to estimate accurately the effects of the mode of administration, dyslexia status, and input text difficulty, while accounting for error variance owing to random differences between students, texts, and questions. The results of our study revealed that young L2 learners with no dyslexia identification performed similarly in the three conditions. The read-aloud assistance, however, was found to increase the comprehension scores of dyslexic participants when reading difficult texts, allowing them to perform at the level of their non-dyslexic peers. Therefore, our study suggests that this modification of the test administration mode might assist dyslexic students in demonstrating their text comprehension abilities.",Learning difficulties; listening assessment; read aloud; reading assessment; special arrangements; young learners; WORKING-MEMORY; TESTING ACCOMMODATIONS; LEARNING-DISABILITIES; TEST FAIRNESS; STUDENTS; METAANALYSIS; MULTIMEDIA; INPUT; COMPONENTS; KNOWLEDGE; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics; Linguistics; Video Meta Results Raw,Kosak-Babuder M and Kormos J and Ratajczak M and Pizorn K,,,0,211

232,Telehealth services in rural and remote Australia: a systematic review of models of care and factors influencing success and sustainability,"INTRODUCTION: With the escalating costs of health care, issues with recruitment and retention of health practitioners in rural areas, and poor economies of scale, the question of delivering people to services or services to people is a dilemma for health authorities around the world. People living in rural areas have poorer health outcomes compared to their urban counterparts, and the problem of how to provide health care and deliver services in rural locations is an ongoing challenge. Telehealth services can efficiently and effectively improve access to healthcare for people living in rural and remote areas of Australia. However, telehealth services are not mainstream or routinely available in many rural and remote locations. The barriers to integration of telehealth into mainstream practice have been well described, but not the factors that may influence the success and sustainability of a service. Our aim was to collate, review and synthesise the available literature regarding telehealth services in rural and remote locations of Australia, and to identify the factors associated with their sustained success. METHODS: A systematic literature review of peer-reviewed and grey literature was undertaken. Electronic databases were searched for potentially relevant articles. Reference lists of retrieved articles and the grey literature were also searched. Searches identified 970 potentially eligible articles published between 1988 and 2015. Studies and manuscripts of any type were included if they described telehealth services (store-and-forward or real-time videoconferencing) to provide clinical service or education and training related to health care in rural or remote locations of Australia. Data were extracted according to pre-defined criteria and checked for completeness and accuracy by a second reviewer. Any disagreements were resolved with discussion with a third researcher. All articles were appraised for quality and levels of evidence. Data were collated and grouped into categories including clinical speciality, disciplines involved, geographical location and the role of the service. Data relating to the success or sustainability of services were grouped thematically. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 116 articles that described 72 discrete telehealth services. Telehealth services in rural and remote Australia are described and we have identified six key factors associated with the success and sustainability of services: vision, ownership, adaptability, economics, efficiency and equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth has the potential to address many of the key challenges to providing health in Australia, with its substantial land area and widely dispersed population. This review collates information regarding the telehealth services in Australia and describes models of care and characteristics of successful and sustainable services. We identified a wide variety of telehealth services being provided in rural and remote areas of Australia. There is great potential to increase this number by scaling up and replicating successful services. This review provides information for policy makers, governments and public and private health services that wish to integrate telehealth into routine practice and for telehealth providers to enhance the sustainability of their service.",Australia/Pacific; Education; Medical; Video Meta Results Raw,Bradford NK and Caffery LJ and Smith AC,,,0,213
233,Memory and obstructive sleep apnea: A meta-analysis,"Study Objectives: To examine episodic memory performance in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Design: Meta-analysis was used to synthesize results from individual studies examining the impact of OSA on episodic memory performance. The performance of individuals with OSA was compared to healthy controls or normative data. Participants: Forty-two studies were included, comprising 2,294 adults with untreated OSA and 1,364 healthy controls. Studies that recorded information about participants at baseline prior to treatment interventions were included in the analysis. Measurements: Participants were assessed with tasks that included a measure of episodic memory: immediate recall, delayed recall, learning, and/or recognition memory. Results: The results of the meta-analyses provide evidence that individuals with OSA are significantly impaired when compared to healthy controls on verbal episodic memory (immediate recall, delayed recall, learning, and recognition) and visuo-spatial episodic memory (immediate and delayed recall), but not visual immediate recall or visuo-spatial learning. When patients were compared to norms, negative effects of OSA were found only in verbal immediate and delayed recall. Conclusions: This meta-analysis contributes to understanding of the nature of episodic memory deficits in individuals with OSA. Impairments to episodic memory are likely to affect the daily functioning of individuals with OSA.

235,Timing Game- Based Practice in a Reading Comprehension Strategy Tutor,"Game-based practice within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) can be optimized by examining how properties of practice activities influence learning outcomes and motivation. In the current study, we manipulated when game-based practice was available to students. All students (n = 149) first completed lesson videos in iSTART-2, an ITS focusing on reading comprehension strategies. They then practiced with iSTART-2 for two 2-hour sessions. Students' first session was either in a game or nongame practice environment. In the second session, they either switched to the alternate environment or remained in the same environment. Students' comprehension was tested at pretest and posttest, and motivational measures were collected. Overall, students' comprehension increased from pretest to posttest. Effect sizes of the pretest to posttest gain suggested that switching from the game to nongame environment was least effective, while switching from a nongame to game environment or remaining in the game environment was more effective. However, these differences between the practice conditions were not statistically significant, either on comprehension or motivation measures, suggesting that for iSTART-2, the timing of game-based practice availability does not substantially impact students' experience in the system.",Video Meta Results Raw,Jacovina ME and Jackson GT and Snow EL and McNamara DS,,,0,215
236,A Meta-Analysis of Mobile Technology Supporting Individuals With Disabilities,"Mobile technology has become ubiquitous in the education and support of individuals with disabilities. While this practice is supported under the Universal Design for Learning framework, research in the area has yet to establish a solid evidence base. The majority of the studies in existence are single-subject design studies with a dearth of replication to support their results, and many do not meet the Council for Exceptional Children's Standards for Evidence-Based Practices in Special Education guidelines. The following is a meta-analysis of studies that have been conducted in the area of using mobile technology to support individuals with disabilities. Types of mobile technology, how technology is used, and the effectiveness of its use with this population are explored. The results indicated although there is some evidence of effectiveness to support the use of mobile technology, more research in the area is needed.","mobile technology; disabilities; meta-analysis; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; DEVELOPMENTAL-DISABILITIES; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; 2 STUDENTS; VIDEO; IPAD; CHILDREN; INCREASE; SKILLS; TEACH; Education, Special; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Cumming TM and Rodriguez CD,,,0,216
237,I'm just trolling: The role of normative beliefs in aggressive behaviour in online gaming,"Based on the social-cognitive information processing model and the theory of normative beliefs, this study tests if garners normalise aggression in games, and whether these normative beliefs explain their aggressive behaviour in games. Experimental cross sectional, worldwide data was collected through an online survey of garners (N = 1646). Participants were randomly assigned to read a vignette describing an instance of verbal harassment occurring either online (within a multiplayer game) or offline (within a board game cafe) and were asked how acceptable and tolerable they found the harassment. There was a significant moderate main effect of context which indicated that harassment was perceived as more normal in the online gaming scenario. Normative beliefs about cyberaggression significantly predicted both general and prejudiced cyberaggression. Additionally, normative beliefs partially mediated the relationship between age and general cyberaggression (small effect) and gender and general cyberaggression (large effect). As normative beliefs are dynamic and modifiable, cyberaggression prevention and intervention efforts should include modification of beliefs which support the legitimacy and acceptability of cyberaggression in games. These findings provide insight into how gamer culture around acceptability of trash talk relates to toxicity in games and suggest directions for further research.","Cyberaggression; Cyberbullying; Online gaming; Normative beliefs; VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR; INTERNET; ADULTS; DISINHIBITION; METAANALYSIS; PERSONALITY; HARASSMENT; FEELINGS; MEDIATOR; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Hilvert-Bruce Z and Neill JT,,,0,217

Weather VATS lobectomy has equivalent or better clinical effect compared with open lobectomy for early lung cancer patients remains controversial. The purpose is to assess the value of VATS compared with thoracotomy for stage Ⅰ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched databases of EMBASE, PubMed, and ScienceDirect for relevant articles published between January 1990 and January 2013. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or comparative studies of VATS lobectomy and open lobectomy for clinical stage Ⅰ NSCLC. Data on operation time, intra-operative blood loss, length of chest tube drainage and hospital stay, complications incidence and 5 year survival rate were meta-analyzed using Review Manager 5.0. RESULTS: 20 studies with 3457 clinical stage Ⅰ NSCLC patients were included. There was no difference in operation time between the two groups (P = 0.14), but distinct advantages in terms of intra-operative blood loss, chest drainage time, hospital stay and complication incidence were found in the VATS group (P < 0.01). Moreover, the 5 year survival rate of VATS group was significantly higher than thoracotomy group (OR 1.82, 95% CI, 1.43-2.31, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared with thoracotomy group, VATS achieved better surgical and oncological outcomes and was a more favorable treatment for stage Ⅰ NSCLC patients.",Lobectomy; Meta-analysis; Non-small cell lung cancer; Thoracotomy; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Chen FF and Zhang D and Wang YL and Xiong B,,,0,218
239,A METAANALYSIS OF COMPUTER-BASED INSTRUCTION IN NURSING-EDUCATION,"Although dozens of studies regarding computer-based instruction (CBI) in nursing education have been conducted over the last 25 years, little has been done to summarize these studies quantitatively. In the current study, the authors used Glass's techniques of meta-analysis (Glass, McGaw, & Smith, 1981) to integrate statistically findings from 29 comparative studies concerning CBI. A clear majority of these studies favored CBI over conventional methods of instruction. The overall achievement effect size for 26 studies that quantified outcomes was 0.45, a medium-sized effect. Two study feature variables-type of CBI and required versus elective course- related to eff ect size. Interactive video applications of CBI produced larger effects than tutorial, computer-managed, and simulation applications, and CBI implementations in elective courses showed larger effects then implementations in required courses. Few studies reported on outcomes of retention, attitudes, and time to learn. The results demonstrate a need for more and better reported research to identify instructional qualities that lead to positive student outcomes.",Video Meta Results Raw,Cohen PA and Dacanay LS,,,1,219
240,An examination of concussion education programmes: a scoping review methodology,"OBJECTIVES: The primary purpose was to review the literature on concussion education programmes. The secondary purpose was to inform knowledge translation strategies for concussion researchers and practitioners. DESIGN: Research on concussion education programmes is relatively new. As a result, the current study implemented a scoping review methodology, which is a type of literary search used to provide a preliminary assessment of the size and scope of a body of literature, as well as identify strengths, weaknesses and gaps in the research. METHODS: A five-stage process for conducting a scoping review was followed for this study: (a) identifying the research questions, (b) identifying relevant studies, (c) identifying the study selection criteria, (d) charting the data and (e) reporting the results. RESULTS: Concussion education programmes have been developed and implemented with populations ranging in age from 9 to 49 years and have used interactive oral presentations, educational videos and computer-based learning programmes. Although the content of these programmes varied, the topics generally addressed salient aspects of concussion injury and recovery. Quantitative instruments have been the preferred methods for assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Education programmes aimed at improving participants' long-term concussion knowledge, behaviours and attitudes of concussions are needed. Researchers must consider using a knowledge translation framework to enhance concussion education programmes. The application of such a framework can lead to novel and interesting ways of disseminating information about concussive injury and recovery.",concussion education; education programs; knowledge translation strategies; researchers; Brain Concussion; Learning; Medical Education; Digital Video; Literature Review; Video Meta Results Raw,Caron JG and Bloom GA and Falcão WR and Sweet SN,,,0,220
241,Combined effects of note-taking/-reviewing on learning and the enhancement through interventions: A meta-analytic review,"Meta-analyses of 33 studies were conducted to examine (1) how much the combination of taking and reviewing notes contributes to school learning, and (2) whether interventions in the note-taking/- reviewing procedure enhance note-taking/-reviewing effects, and if so, how much and under what conditions. Syntheses of findings from note-taking/-reviewing versus no note-taking/- reviewing comparison studies indicated that the overall effects of note-taking/-reviewing were substantial. The advantage of note-taking with intervention over without intervention was modest but significantly greater than zero. This intervention effect was moderated by two variables: presence of provided notes and academic level of participants. Providing a framework or instructor's notes was more effective in the enhancement of note-taking/-reviewing effects than pre-training or verbal instruction only. The participants at lower academic levels gained greater benefits from interventions compared with the participants at a higher academic level.

247,Virtual Reality as a Vehicle to Empower Motor-Cognitive Neurorehabilitation,"In this paper, we advocate the combination of four key ingredients that we believe are necessary to design long-lasting effective treatments for neurorehabilitation: (i) motor-cognitive training, (ii) evidence-based neuroscience principles, in particular those related to body perception, (iii) motivational games, and (iv) empowerment techniques. Then, we propose virtual reality (VR) as the appropriate medium to encompass all the requirements mentioned above. VR is arguably one of the most suitable technologies for neurorehabilitation able to integrate evidence-based neurorehabilitation techniques and neuroscience principles into motivating training approaches that promote self-management by empowering patients to own their recovery process. We discuss the advantages and challenges of such an approach on several exemplary applications and outline directions for future developments. We strongly believe that the combination of positive psychology and positive technology mediated by VR-based interventions can heavily impact the rehabilitation outcomes of motor-cognitive functions along all the stages of the rehabilitation path.","virtual reality; neurorehabilitation; motor-cognitive training; motivation; empowerment; neuroscience; stroke; STROKE PATIENTS; VIDEO GAMES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SELF-MANAGEMENT; FOLLOW-UP; RECOVERY; REHABILITATION; METAANALYSIS; INTERVENTION; IMPAIRMENT; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Perez-Marcos D and Bieler-Aeschlimann M and Serino A,,,0,223
248,The effects of two digital educational games on cognitive and non-cognitive math and reading outcomes,"Digital educational games play an increasingly important role in education. However, multiple questions about the effectiveness of educational games with respect to cognitive and non-cognitive effects remain unclear. The current study, a longitudinal, quasi-experiment with 336 first graders, examined the effects of two digital educational games, Number Sense Game (NSG) and Reading Game (RG). The NSG trained early numerical skills, the RG supported emergent reading. Children were pseudo-randomly assigned to either an experimental condition, comprising eight weeks of intensive game-based training, or a control condition in which they took part in regular education without game-based practice. A pretest-posttest design was used to examine the effects of the intervention on cognitive (digit comparison, number line estimation, letter knowledge, math and reading competence) and non-cognitive outcomes (math and reading anxiety). Delayed cognitive effects on math and reading competence were also investigated two months after the intervention. Furthermore, we examined variances of the impact of the training on cognitive outcomes as a consequence of differences in children's prior knowledge, prior affect and socioeconomic status. For cognitive outcomes, results revealed that children who played a game performed better on number line estimation and reading competence, whereas no significant differences were observed for digit comparison, letter knowledge and math competence. Also, children who played a game showed better scores in the delayed reading posttest, but not in the delayed math posttest. For non-cognitive outcomes, game training did not affect math or reading anxiety. Regarding individual differences, children with less prior knowledge in the game play condition performed better on the number line estimation posttest compared to children in the control condition. Children with more prior knowledge in the game play condition still scored better on this test compared to the control condition, but the difference between the conditions was smaller.","Elementary education; Improving classroom teaching; Interactive learning environments; Multimedia systems; PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL; COMPUTER GAMES; NUMBER SENSE; ANXIETY; INTERVENTION; ACHIEVEMENT; CHILDREN; METAANALYSIS; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education & Educational Research; Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Vanbecelaere S and Van den Berghe K and Cornillie F and Sasanguie D and Reynvoet B and Depaepe F,,,0,224
249,"Cognitive remediation for adolescents with 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS): A preliminary study examining effectiveness, feasibility, and fidelity of a hybrid strategy, remote and computer-based intervention","Background: 22q11DS is a multiple anomaly syndrome involving intellectual and behavioral deficits, and increased risk for schizophrenia. As cognitive remediation (CR) has recently been found to improve cognition in younger patients with schizophrenia, we investigated the efficacy, feasibility, and fidelity of a remote, hybrid strategy, computerized CR program in youth with 22q11DS. Methods: A longitudinal design was implemented in which 21 participants served as their own controls. Following an eight month baseline period in which no interventions were provided, cognitive coaches met with participants remotely for CR via video conferencing three times a week over a targeted 8 month timeframe and facilitated their progress through the intervention, offering task-specific strategies. A subset of strategies were examined for fidelity. Outcomes were evaluated using a neurocognitive test battery at baseline, pre-treatment and post-treatment. Results: All participants adhered to the intervention. The mean length of the treatment phase was 7.96 months. A moderately high correlation (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.73) was found for amount and type of strategies offered by coaches. Participants exhibited significant improvements (ES=.36-.55, p <=.009) in working memory, shifting attention and cognitive flexibility. All significant models were driven by improvements in pre to post-treatment scores. Conclusions: Based on our preliminary investigation, a remote, hybrid strategy, computerized CR program can be implemented with 22q11DS youth despite geographic location, health, and cognitive deficits. It appears effective in enhancing cognitive skills during the developmental period of adolescence, making this type of CR delivery useful for youth with 22q11DS transitioning into post-school environments.

250,ENED-GEM: A Conceptual Framework Model for Psychological Enjoyment Factors and Learning Mechanisms in Educational Games about the Environment,"Based on a thorough review of psychological literature, this article seeks to develop a model of game enjoyment and environmental learning (ENvironmental EDucational Game Enjoyment Model, ENED-GEM) and delineate psychological processes that might facilitate learning and inspire behavioral change from educational games about the environment. A critically acclaimed digital educational game about environmental issues (Fate of the World by Red Redemption/Soothsayer Games) was used as a case study. Two hundred forty-nine reviews of the game from the popular gaming and reviewing platform known as Steam were analyzed by means of a thematic content analysis in order to identify key player enjoyment factors believed to be relevant to the process of learning from games, as well as to gain an understanding of positive and negative impressions about the game's general content. The end results of the thematic analysis were measured up to the suggested ENED-GEM framework. Initial results generally support the main elements of the ENED-GEM, and future research into the importance of these individual core factors is outlined.","educational games; environmental games; motivation; immersion; flow; semantic memory; episodic memory; perceived behavioral control; COMPUTER GAMES; VIDEO GAMES; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; ONLINE GAME; IMMERSION; DESIGN; BOARD; PLAY; METAANALYSIS; SIMULATIONS; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Fjaellingsdal KS and Klockner CA,,,0,226

252,South Asian Heart Risk Assessment (SAHARA): Randomized Controlled Trial Design and Pilot Study,"Background: People of South Asian origin suffer a high burden of premature myocardial infarction (MI). South Asians form a growing proportion of the Canadian population and preventive strategies to mitigate the risk of MI in this group are needed. Prior studies have shown that multimedia interventions are effective and feasible in inducing health behavior changes among the obese, smokers, and among those who are sedentary. Objective: Among at-risk South Asians living in Canada, our objectives are to determine: (1) the feasibility of a culturally tailored multimedia intervention to induce positive behavioral changes associated with reduced MI risk factors, and (2) the effectiveness and acceptability of information communicated by individualized MI and genetic risk score (GRS) reports. Methods: The South Asian HeArt Risk Assessment (SAHARA) pilot study enrolled 367 individuals of South Asian origin recruited from places of worship and community centers in Ontario, Canada. MI risk factors including the 9p21 genetic variant status were provided to all participants after the baseline visit. Participants were randomly allocated to receive a multimedia intervention or control. The intervention group selected health goals and received personalized health messages to promote adherence to their selected goals. After 6 months, all participants had their MI risk factors repeated. The methods and results of this study are reported based on the CONSORT-EHEALTH guidelines. Results: The mean age of participants was 53.8 years (SD 11.4), 52.0% (191/367) were women, and 97.5% (358/367) were immigrants to Canada. The mean INTERHEART risk score was 13.0 (SD 5.8) and 73.3% (269/367) had one or two copies of the risk allele for the 9p21 genetic variant. Both the intervention and control groups made some progress in health behavior changes related to diet and physical activity over 6 months. Participants reported that their risk score reports motivated behavioral changes, although half of the participants could not recall their risk scores at the end of study evaluation. Some components of the multimedia intervention were not widely used such as logging onto the website to set new health goals, and participants requested having more personal interactions with the study team. Conclusions: Some, but not all, components of the multimedia intervention are feasible and have the potential to induce positive health behavior changes. MI and GRS reports are desired by participants although their impact on inducing sustained health behavior change requires further evaluation. Information generated from this pilot study has directly informed the design of another randomized trial designed to reduce MI risk among South Asians.",Video Meta Results Raw,Samaan Z and Schulze KM and Middleton C and Irvine J and Joseph P and Mente A and Shah BR and Pare G and Desai D and Anand SS,,,0,228
253,Different Perspectives: Spatial Ability Influences Where Individuals Look on a Timed Spatial Test,"Learning in anatomy can be both spatially and visually complex. Pedagogical investigations have begun exploration as to how spatial ability may mitigate learning. Emerging hypotheses suggests individuals with higher spatial reasoning may attend to images differently than those who are lacking. To elucidate attentional patterns associated with different spatial ability, eye movements were measured in individuals completing a timed electronic mental rotation test (EMRT). The EMRT was based on the line drawings of Shepherd and Metzler. Individuals deduced whether image pairs were rotations (same) or mirror images (different). It was hypothesized that individuals with high spatial ability (HSA) would demonstrate shorter average fixation durations during problem solving and attend to different features of the EMRT than low spatial ability (LSA) counterparts. Moreover, question response accuracy would be associated with fewer fixations and shorter average response times, regardless of spatial reasoning ability. Average fixation duration in the HSA group was shorter than LSA (F(1,8) = 7.99; P=0.022). Importantly, HSA and LSA individuals looked to different regions of the EMRT images (Fisher Exact Test: 12.47; P=0.018); attending to the same locations only 34% of the time. Correctly answered questions were characterized by fewer fixations per question (F(1, 8) = 18.12; P=0.003) and shorter average response times (F(1, 8) = 23.89; P=0.001). The results indicate that spatial ability may influence visual attention to salient areas of images and this may be key to problem solving processes for low spatial individuals.

256,The effect of simulator fidelity on acquiring non-technical skills: a randomized non-inferiority trial,"As simulator fidelity (i.e., realism) increases from low to high, the simulator more closely resembles the real environment, but it also becomes more expensive. It is generally assumed that the use of high-fidelity simulators results in better learning; however, the effect of fidelity on learning non-technical skills (NTS) is unknown. This was a non-inferiority trial comparing the efficacy of high- vs low-fidelity simulators on learning NTS. Thirty-six postgraduate medical trainees were recruited for the trial. During the pre-test phase, the trainees were randomly assigned to manage a scenario using either a high-fidelity simulator (HFS) or a low-fidelity simulator (LFS), followed by expert debriefing. All trainees then underwent a video recorded post-test scenario on a HFS, and the NTS were assessed between the two groups. The primary outcome was the overall post-test Ottawa Global Rating Scale (OGRS), while controlling for overall pre-test OGRS scores. Non-inferiority between the LFS and HFS was based on a non-inferiority margin of greater than 1. For our primary outcome, the mean (SD) post-test overall OGRS score was not significantly different between the HFS and LFS groups after controlling for pre-test overall OGRS scores [3.8 (0.9) vs 4.0 (0.9), respectively; mean difference, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, -0.4 to 0.8; P = 0.48]. For our secondary outcomes, the post-test total OGRS score was not significantly different between the HFS and LFS groups after controlling for pre-test total OGRS scores (P = 0.33). There were significant improvements in mean overall (P = 0.01) and total (P = 0.003) OGRS scores from pre-test to post-test. There were no significant associations between postgraduate year (P = 0.82) and specialty (P = 0.67) on overall OGRS performance. This study suggests that low-fidelity simulators are non-inferior to the more costly high-fidelity simulators for teaching NTS to postgraduate medical trainees.",TECHNOLOGY-ENHANCED SIMULATION; CRISIS-RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; RESUSCITATION; ANESTHESIA; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; SCIENCE; COST; Anesthesiology; Anesthesiology; Video Meta Results Raw,Gu Y and Witter T and Livingston P and Rao P and Varshney T and Kuca T and Bould MD,,,0,231
257,"Video gameplay, personality and academic performance","The relationship between video gameplay, video game genre preference, personality, and GPA was investigated in an online correlational study with university students. In addition to administering self-report measures of GPA and personality, we asked three different questions regarding styles of video gameplay. The first asked the average time spent playing video games per week (habitual players), the second asked the total time spent playing favorite video games (selective players), and the third asked the number of different video games played in a year (diverse players). Students who were medium in selective player style (spent 11-50 h) had significantly higher GPAs than students low on selective player style (spent 0-10 h). Students high on habitual playing style (7 or more hours a week) showed significantly lower levels of Conscientiousness compared to students low on habitual playing style (0-1 h a week). Students who were high on the diverse style (i.e., 7 or more games played a year) showed significantly higher Openness scores than students low on the diverse style (0-3 games a year). Finally, several notable relations were found between video game genre preference, GPA, and personality. Results are discussed in terms of the positive implications of video gameplay on academic performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

258,ADHD Rehabilitation through Video Gaming: A Systematic Review Using PRISMA Guidelines of the Current Findings and the Associated Risk of Bias,"Empirical research studies have highlighted the need to investigate whether video game can be useful as a tool within a neuropsychological rehabilitation program for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients. However, little is known about the possible gains that this kind of video game-based interventions can produce and even if these gains can be transferred to real life abilities. The present paper aims to uncover key information related to the use of video game in ADHD neuropsychological rehabilitation/intervention by focusing on its gains and its capability to transfer/generalize these gains to real life situation via a systematic review of the empirical literature. The PRISMA guidelines were adopted. Internet-based bibliographic searches were conducted via seven major electronic databases (i.e., PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Core Collection BIOSIS Citation Index, MEDLINE, SciELO Citation Index, and PubMed) to access studies examining the association between video game interventions in ADHD patients and behavioral and cognitive outcomes. A total of 14 empirical studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. The studies reported the attention, working memory, and the behavioral aspects as the main target of the intervention. Cognitive and behavioral gains were reported after the video game training (VGT). However, many bias related to the choice of outcome instruments, sampling and blindness of assessors, weaken the results power. Additional researches are important to clarify the effects and stability of the VGT programs, and an important effort should be made to construct better methods to assess improvements on everyday cognitive abilities and real world functioning.",ADHD; PRISMA; neuropsychological rehabilitation; real life; systematic review; video game intervention; Video Meta Results Raw,Strahler Rivero T and Herrera Nuñez LM and Uehara Pires E and Amodeo Bueno OF,,,0,233

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of VR for educating health professionals and improving their knowledge, cognitive skills, attitudes, and satisfaction. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the effectiveness of VR in pre- and postregistration health professions education following the gold standard Cochrane methodology. We searched 7 databases from the year 1990 to August 2017. No language restrictions were applied. We included randomized controlled trials and cluster-randomized trials. We independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, and then, we compared the information in pairs. We contacted authors of the studies for additional information if necessary. All pooled analyses were based on random-effects models. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to rate the quality of the body of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies (2407 participants) were included. Meta-analysis of 8 studies found that VR slightly improves postintervention knowledge scores when compared with traditional learning (standardized mean difference [SMD]=0.44; 95% CI 0.18-0.69; I2=49%; 603 participants; moderate certainty evidence) or other types of digital education such as online or offline digital education (SMD=0.43; 95% CI 0.07-0.79; I2=78%; 608 participants [8 studies]; low certainty evidence). Another meta-analysis of 4 studies found that VR improves health professionals' cognitive skills when compared with traditional learning (SMD=1.12; 95% CI 0.81-1.43; I2=0%; 235 participants; large effect size; moderate certainty evidence). Two studies compared the effect of VR with other forms of digital education on skills, favoring the VR group (SMD=0.5; 95% CI 0.32-0.69; I2=0%; 467 participants; moderate effect size; low certainty evidence). The findings for attitudes and satisfaction were mixed and inconclusive. None of the studies reported any patient-related outcomes, behavior change, as well as unintended or adverse effects of VR. Overall, the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE criteria ranged from low to moderate. We downgraded our certainty of evidence primarily because of the risk of bias and/or inconsistency. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence suggesting that VR improves postintervention knowledge and skills outcomes of health professionals when compared with traditional education or other types of digital education such as online or offline digital education. The findings on other outcomes are limited. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of immersive and interactive forms of VR and evaluate other outcomes such as attitude, satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, and clinical practice or behavior change.",virtual reality; health professions education; randomized controlled trials; systematic review; meta-analysis; INGUINAL-HERNIA REPAIR; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; TRAINEES; STUDENTS; IMPROVE; SURGERY; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Kyaw BM and Saxena N and Posadzki P and Vseteckova J and Nikolaou CK and George PP and Divakar U and Masiello I and Kononowicz AA and Zary N and Tudor Car L,,,0,234

261,Predicting and influencing training success: Spatial abilities and instructional design,"Comments on an article by J. Langlois et al. (see record [rid]2015-48724-006[/rid]). Langlois et al. proposed that spatial abilities may be a valuable predictor for the successful performance of technical skills such as surgical procedures. Spatial abilities, generally defined, include the capability to mentally represent and manipulate three-dimensional objects. Langlois et al.’s systematic review reveals that higher scores on such tests of spatial abilities correlate with a higher quality of technical skill performance in beginner and intermediate learners in health care settings. Technical skills in this context refer to the performance of surgical procedures or other uses of medical tools. The process of learning technical skills can be divided into three basic stages: an early stage in which the learner first tries to comprehend the problem; an intermediate stage which the learner repeatedly practices the task, and a final stage in which the learner comes to master the task sufficiently that it becomes automatic. simple analogy would refer to moving to a new city and learning to navigate from home to work.

263,Accreditation of offending behaviour programmes in HM Prison Service: ‘What Works’ in practice,"Purpose. This study assessed the short-term impact of offending behaviour programmes in relation to certain key features of programme delivery identified by an accreditation system. The aim was to further inform the debate on 'What Works' in practice by establishing whether well-delivered programmes are more effective. Method. The sample consisted of 5,255 offenders serving custodial sentences in prisons across England and Wales who completed one of two accredited cognitive skills programmes during the financial year 2001/2002. The relationship between a battery of assessment measures, tutor experience, drop-out rates, audit observations and the quality of programme delivery was explored. Results. A positive short-term impact was observed on the majority of assessment measures across both programmes. Patterns of change were broadly similar across gender, age, and ethnic groupings. This short-term impact of the programmes was significantly greater for a group of high-need prisoners and at those sites where tutors were delivering more frequently. Tutor delivery rates were also found to be related to drop-out rates and the quality of programme delivery. Attempts to establish a relationship between ratings of tutor performance from video-monitoring and the short-term impact of the course were unsuccessful. However, at the programme site level, positive correlations were observed between the quality of delivery and other measures of the site's performance. Conclusion. This study shows that programmes do have a short-term impact and that this is greater for higher-need prisoners and at sites where tutors were delivering more frequently. Furthermore, the accreditation system has highlighted key aspects of programme delivery which do appear to influence the short-term effectiveness of the programmes.",Video Meta Results Raw,Blud L and Travers R and Nugent F and Thornton D,,,0,237
264,The relationship between Algebra Nation usage and high-stakes test performance for struggling students,"Although the use of technology in the K12 classroom has been shown to have a positive impact, research on the use of open education resources (OER) is relatively limited, especially research focusing on low-achieving students. The present study examines the relationship between usage of Algebra Nation, a self-guided system that provided instructional videos and practice problems, and the performance of students who had failed the state-administered Algebra I end-of-course (EOC) assessment the previous year. Indicators of usage of Algebra Nation consisted of logins, video views, and practice questions answered. Path analyses and logistic regressions were used to evaluate relationships between usage indicators and algebra scores, controlling for number of absences, free/reduced lunch eligibility, Hispanic/Latino origin, race, and gender. The results indicate that higher levels of logins, video views, and practice questions answered were related to higher scores when the students re-took the assessment. Logins and practice questions were also related to increases in odds of passing the Algebra I EOC assessment, but not video views. The results suggest that there may be benefits to technology use in the form of an OER adopted by students and teachers on an informal basis and link self-regulated learning strategies to student achievement.",Algebra; educational technology; high-stakes tests; open educational resources; student achievement; virtual learning environments; INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS; METAANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGY; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Leite WL and Cetin-Berber DD and Huggins-Manley AC and Collier ZK and Beal CR,,,0,238
265,How to effectively obtain informed consent in trauma patients: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Obtaining adequate informed consent from trauma patients is challenging and time-consuming. Healthcare providers must communicate complicated medical information to enable patients to make informed decisions. This study aimed to explore the challenges of obtaining valid consent and methods of improving the quality of the informed consent process for surgical procedures in trauma patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of relevant English-language full-text original articles retrieved from PubMed (1961-August 2018) that had experimental or observational study design and involved adult trauma patients. Studies involving informed consent in clinical or research trials were excluded. Titles and abstracts of searched articles were reviewed and relevant data were extracted with a structured form. Results were synthesized with a narrative approach. RESULTS: A total of 2044 articles were identified in the initial search. Only eight studies were included in the review for narrative synthesis. Six studies involved orthopedic surgeries, one involved nasal bone surgeries, and one involved trauma-related limb debridement. Only one study was conducted in an emergency department. Information recall was poor for trauma patients. Risk recall and comprehension were greater when written or video information was provided than when information was provided only verbally. Patient satisfaction was also greater when both written and verbal information were provided than when verbal information alone was provided; patients who received video information were more satisfied than patients who received written or verbal information. CONCLUSIONS: Many articles have been published on the subject of informed consent, but very few of these have focused on trauma patients. More empirical evidence is needed to support the success of informed consent for trauma patients in the emergency department, especially within the necessarily very limited time frame. To improve the informed consent process for trauma patients, developing a structured and standardized informed consent process may be necessary and achievable; its effectiveness would require evaluation.

266,Development and Validation of a Parent-Based Program for Preventing Gaming Disorder: The Game Over Intervention,"Since the inclusion of gaming disorder in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a condition for further study, there has been an increasing consensus that problematic gaming can be detrimental to mental health, yet efforts in preventing such problems from emerging have been limited. To address this gap, we developed the Game Over Intervention (GOI), a parent-based program designed based on the frameworks of ecological systems theory and self-determination theory. This study aimed to test the efficacy of the new program using the method of a randomized controlled trial, with the control condition being a program for effective learning. Participants were the parents of upper primary school students, with 163 (77% women; M-age = 42.70) and 199 (83% women; M-age = 41.82) partaking in the intervention and the control conditions, respectively. Participants rated their children's gaming time, exposure to violent video games, and symptoms of gaming disorder at three time points: baseline, one week after intervention, and three months after intervention. The results indicate a general reduction in these three criteria across the three-month period. Our study provides tentative evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the GOI in mitigating some gaming-related problems.","addiction; compulsive gaming; intervention; pathological gaming; problematic gaming; prevention; video game; VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES; INTERNET ADDICTION; SELF-ESTEEM; ADOLESCENTS; ASSOCIATION; PLAY; METAANALYSIS; PERSONALITY; MOTIVATIONS; BEHAVIORS; Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Video Meta Results Raw",Li AY and Chau CL and Cheng C,,,0,240
267,Environmental scan and evaluation of best practices for online systematic review resources,"Objective: Online training for systematic review methodology is an attractive option due to flexibility and limited availability of in-person instruction. Librarians often direct new reviewers to these online resources, so they should be knowledgeable about the variety of available resources. The objective for this project was to conduct an environmental scan of online systematic review training resources and evaluate those identified resources. Methods: The authors systematically searched for electronic learning resources pertaining to systematic review methods. After screening for inclusion, we collected data about characteristics of training resources and assigned scores in the domains of (1) content, (2) design, (3) interactivity, and (4) usability by applying a previously published evaluation rubric for online instruction modules. We described the characteristics and scores for each training resource and compared performance across the domains. Results: Twenty training resources were evaluated. Average overall score of online instructional resources was 61%. Online courses (n=7) averaged 73%, web modules (n=5) 64%, and videos (n=8) 48%. The top 5 highest scoring resources were in course or web module format, featured high interactivity, and required a longer (>5hrs) time commitment from users. Conclusion: This study revealed that resources include appropriate content but are less likely to adhere to principles of online training design and interactivity. Awareness of these resources will allow librarians to make informed recommendations for training based on patrons' needs. Future online systematic review training resources should use established best practices for e-learning to provide high-quality resources, regardless of format or user time commitment.",OF-THE-LITERATURE; NURSING-EDUCATION; METAANALYSIS; VIDEOS; Information Science & Library Science; Information Science & Library Science; Video Meta Results Raw,Parker RM and Boulos LM and Visintini S and Ritchie K and Hayden J,,,0,241
268,How talk becomes text: Investigating the concept of oral rehearsal in early years' classrooms,"The principle that emergent writing is supported by talk, and that an appropriate pedagogy for writing should include planned opportunities for talk is well researched and well understood. However, the process by which talk becomes text is less clear. The term 'oral rehearsal' is now commonplace in English classrooms and curriculum policy documents, yet as a concept it is not well theorised. Indeed, there is relatively little reference to the concept of oral rehearsal in the international literature, and what references do exist propose differing interpretations of the concept. At its most liberal, the term is used loosely as a synonym for talk; more precise definitions frame oral rehearsal, for example, as a strategy for reducing cognitive load during writing; for post-hoc reviewing of text; for helping writers to 'hear' their own writing; or for practising sentences aloud as a preliminary to writing them down. Drawing on a systematic review of the literature and video data from an empirical study, the paper will offer a theoretical conceptualisation of oral rehearsal, drawing on existing understanding of writing processes and will illustrate the ways in which young writers use oral rehearsal before and during writing. © 2009 SES.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Early Childhood Education; Childrens Writing; Oral Language; Writing Strategies; Writing Processes; Beginning Writing; Early years; Oral rehearsal; Talk; Writing; Video Meta Results Raw",Myhill D and Jones S,,,0,242
269,Can cooperative video games encourage social and motivational inclusion of at-risk students?,"Can the challenges encountered in cooperative video games encourage classroom inclusion? And can this experience be translated into curriculum engagement? This study describes a 3 week intervention with game-based learning activities in eight lower secondary classrooms (n=190). The intervention combined the use of the co-op action role-playing game Torchlight II and analogue gamification aimed at including 32 students challenged by social difficulties and lack of motivation. The video game was used to create more inclusive classrooms by increasing students' opportunities for participation through collaboration in teams. The students also participated in game-related Danish (L1) and Mathematics activities. Effects on social well-being, learning and motivational patterns were measured through teacher assessment combined with the Children's Perceived Locus of Causality-scales. The results show multidimensional effects including positive impact on at-risk students' well-being and reduced experiences of external regulation to participate in Mathematics and Danish. The qualitative analysis not only confirms the positive findings, but also shows how the intervention created ambiguities surrounding the relationship between game activities and curriculum-related assignments. The findings indicate that the impact of game-based classrooms is not due to their fun element, but rather how they enable reframing of social participation and students' engagement with the curriculum.",SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY; LEARNING-DISABILITIES; PERCEIVED LOCUS; COMPUTER GAMES; SERIOUS GAMES; ONLINE; EDUCATION; METAANALYSIS; FRIENDSHIPS; CAUSALITY; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Hanghoj T and Lieberoth A and Misfeldt M,,,0,243

We recommend that technology-based training for older adults should: (1) be highly structured, (2) provide feedback and adaptive guidance, (3) include metacognitive prompts, (4) incorporate principles derived from cognitive load theory and cognitive theory of multimedia learning, and (5) include a user interface that is simple and consistent throughout the course. With a focus on organizations as well as business schools, we then discuss contextual variables expected to enhance older learners' training motivation or improve their transfer of training. Finally, we will recommend areas worthy of exploration that might reveal age-specific differences in technology-based instruction (TBI) design.",Video Meta Results Raw,Wolfson NE and Cavanagh TM and Kraiger K,,,0,245

274,Targeted training modifies oscillatory brain activity in schizophrenia patients,"Effects of both domain-specific and broader cognitive remediation protocols have been reported for neural activity and overt performance in schizophrenia (SZ). Progress is limited by insufficient knowledge of relevant neural mechanisms. Addressing neuronal signal resolution in the auditory system as a mechanism contributing to cognitive function and dysfunction in schizophrenia, the present study compared effects of two neuroplasticity-based training protocols targeting auditory-verbal or facial affect discrimination accuracy and a standard rehabilitation protocol on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) oscillatory brain activity in an auditory paired-click task. SZ were randomly assigned to either 20 daily 1-hour sessions over 4 weeks of auditory-verbal training (N = 19), similarly intense facial affect discrimination training (N = 19), or 4 weeks of treatment as usual (TAU, N = 19). Pre-training, the 57 SZ showed smaller click-induced posterior alpha power modulation than did 28 healthy comparison participants, replicating Popov et al. (2011b). Abnormally small alpha decrease 300-800 ms around S2 improved more after targeted auditory-verbal training than after facial affect training or TAU. The improvement in oscillatory brain dynamics with training correlated with improvement on a measure of verbal learning. Results replicate previously reported effects of neuroplasticity-based psychological training on oscillatory correlates of auditory stimulus differentiation, encoding, and updating and indicate specificity of cortical training effects.

275,Transanal total mesorectal excision: a systematic review of the experimental and clinical evidence,"Achieving a clear distal or circumferential resection margins with laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) may be laborious, especially in obese males and when operating on advanced distal rectal tumors with a poor response to neoadjuvant treatment. Transanal (TaTME) is a new natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery modality in which the rectum is mobilized transanally using endoscopic techniques with or without laparoscopic assistance. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of publications on this new technique in PubMed and Embase databases from January, 2008, to July, 2014. Experimental and clinical studies written in English were included. Experimental research with TaTME was done on pigs with and without survival models and on human cadavers. In these studies, laparoscopic or transgastric assistance was frequently used resulting in an easier upper rectal dissection and in a longer rectal specimen. To date, 150 patients in 16 clinical studies have undergone TaTME. In all but 15 cases, transabdominal assistance was used. A rigid transanal endoscopic operations/transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEO/TEM) platform was used in 37 patients. Rectal adenocarcinoma was the indication in all except for nine cases of benign diseases. Operative times ranged from 90 to 460 min. TME quality was deemed intact, satisfactory, or complete. Involvement in circumferential resection margins was detected in 16 (11.8 %) patients. The mean lymph node harvest was equal or greater than 12 in all studies. Regarding morbidity, pneumoretroperitoneum, damage to the urethra, and air embolism were reported intraoperatively. Mean hospital stay varied from 4 to 14 days. Postoperative complications occurred in 34 (22.7 %) patients. TaTME with TEM is feasible in selected cases. Oncologic safety parameters seem to be adequate although the evidence relies on small retrospective series conducted by highly trained surgeons.

276,Assessment of the modeling competence: A systematic review and synthesis of empirical research,"We provide an analysis of the existing literature on the assessment of modeling as a scientific competence focusing on empirical research findings. Out of 802 searched citations, a total of 23 publications from science teaching and learning met the inclusion criteria. The analysis was based on the types of instruments used (interviews, questionnaires, videos) to assess the different aspects of scientific modeling (e.g. modeling practices; modeling product; meta-knowledge; cognitive processes during modeling). The results indicate that specific aspects of the modeling competence tend to be evaluated by specific types of assessment instruments and that assessment of other important aspects of the modeling competence is scarce. We suggest that this may be occurring due to the lack of a unifying framework for conceptualizing the modeling competence. In addition, these findings provide insights into certain challenges and confounding factors involved in designing new assessment instruments for each aspect of the modeling competence. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Assessment approaches; Modeling competence; Science education; Video Meta Results Raw,Nicolaou CT and Constantinou CP,,,0,249

This topic is very broad and there is an extensive pool of solutions in the literature. For the last few years, works on enhancing Quality of service at MAC layer in wireless networks, have attracted tremendous research efforts. In this paper, we examine the QoS issue of MAC layer in Ad hoc networks. We present a state-of-the-art review and a comparison of typical enhancements of distributed versions of both 802.11 and 802.11e standards, designed first to work in infrastructure wireless networks. We start our work by highlighting problems of deploying the original algorithms in a distributed architecture such as MANETs. Then, we propose an enhancement of the 802.11e in order to improve the QoS and correct the reactivity of this standard when network conditions become highly disturbed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Lakrami F and El-Kamili M and Elkamoun N,,,0,250
279,Sex differences on g and non-g intellectual performance reveal potential sources of STEM discrepancies,"The analysis of sex differences in cognitive abilities is largely confusing because these differences are masked by the pervasive influence of the general factor of intelligence (g). In this study a battery of five reasoning tests (abstract [AR], numerical [NR], verbal [VR], mechanical [MR], and spatial [SR]) was completed by a sample of 3233 young and old adolescents representative of the population. Using a latent variable approach, mean differences on the general factor were estimated after examining measurement invariance. Results show that the difference, favoring boys in latent g increases with age from two to four IQ points. Further, boys outperform girls in all the subtests and the observed differences were generally explained by g. However, mechanical reasoning is a systematic and strong exception to this finding. For the young adolescents, the observed difference in MR is equivalent to 10 IQ points, and this difference increases to 13 IQ points for the old adolescents. Only 1 (young) or 2 (old) IQ points of the sex difference in MR can be accounted for by g. The findings suggest that the persistent - and usually neglected average large advantage of boys in mechanical reasoning (MR) - orthogonal to g - might be behind their higher presence in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) disciplines. A new look at this relevant social issue is proposed in this study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Video Meta Results Raw,Lemos GC and Abad FJ and Almeida LS and Colom R,,,0,251
280,Effect of Diagnosis on Outcomes in the Setting of Enhanced Recovery Protocols,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of enhanced recovery protocols in colectomy reduces length of stay and morbidity, but it remains unknown whether benefits vary by clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: Outcomes after colectomy in the setting of enhanced recovery protocols were compared for 3 diagnoses: 1) neoplasm, 2) diverticulitis, and 3) IBD. DESIGN: This was a retrospective registry-based cohort study. SETTINGS: Novel enhanced recovery variables were released in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program in 2014. PATIENTS: Patients with enhanced recovery variable data undergoing elective colectomy (July 2014 to December 2015) for neoplasm, diverticulitis, or IBD were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest was prolonged length of stay. Additional outcomes included surgical site infection, death/serious morbidity, reoperation, readmission, and days to achieve per os pain control, tolerance of a diet, and return of bowel function. RESULTS: We identified 4620 patients with neoplasm, 1730 patients with diverticulitis, and 593 patients with IBD. Patients undergoing colectomy for IBD were more likely to have prolonged length of stay (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.46-2.69), death/serious morbidity (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.13-2.32), and readmission (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.15-2.08) compared with patients with neoplasm. Patients with IBD took longer than patients with neoplasm or diverticulitis to achieve per os pain control (mean, 4.2 days vs 3.4 and 3.5 days, p < 0.001) and tolerate a diet (mean, 4.1 days vs 3.7 and 3.5 days, p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences in outcomes between patients with neoplasm and diverticulitis were seen. LIMITATIONS: There may be heterogeneity among implemented enhanced recovery protocols. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing colectomy for neoplasm and diverticulitis have improved outcomes in comparison with patients undergoing colectomy for IBD. Knowledge of expected outcomes for patients with different diagnoses may inform clinician and patient expectations.

281,Assessing the Reliability and Validity of Television and Game Violence Exposure Measures,"This study evaluated whether common self-report measures of television and game violence exposure represent reliable and valid measurement tools. Three self-report measuresdirect estimates, user-rated favorites, and agency-rated favoriteswere assessed in terms of test-retest reliability, criterion validity (their relationship with coded media diaries), and construct validity (their relationship with aggression and gender). A total of 238 adolescents participated in a two-wave survey and completed two media diaries. For game violence, the three self-report measures were reliable and valid. For television violence, only direct estimates achieved test-retest reliability and construct validity. Criterion validity could not be established for the television violence measures because the media diary was not a valid criterion for television violence. Our findings indicate that both direct estimates and favorites are valid measures for game violence, whereas for television violence, only direct estimates are valid. We conclude with a discussion about ways to further improve upon and reconceptualize media violence exposure measurement.",aggression; games; reliability; television; validity; MEDIA-EFFECTS RESEARCH; PARENT-CHILD COMMUNICATION; VIDEO GAMES; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; SENSATION SEEKING; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; TIME; METAANALYSIS; CHALLENGES; Communication; Communication; Video Meta Results Raw,Fikkers KM and Piotrowski JT and Valkenburg PM,,,0,253
282,Player conceptualizations of creativity in digital entertainment games,"Creativity has been widely studied across various disciplines such as psychology and education from a variety of perspectives and has been argued to provide a range of different benefits such as the development of transferrable skills. However, not much is known about how creativity is conceptualized within digital entertainment games from the perspective of the player. In addition to providing a scoping review of the field, this study aims to address current gaps in the literature by answering the research question: how do players conceptualize creativity within digital entertainment games? Data from 24 semistructured interviews and 14 narrative surveys with regular players of various genres of digital games were analyzed using qualitative methodology. Thematic analysis was performed, resulting in three main categories of conceptualizations: ways of thinking, constructing in games, and games as an art form. By providing an insight into how players view creativity in digital games, this article aims to illuminate this understudied facet of player experience and pave the way for future studies seeking to explore how digital games may promote creativity in those who play them.",Creativity; digital games; game-based learning; player experience; qualitative; semistructured interviews; thematic analysis; videogames; VIDEO GAMES; SKILLS; INCREASE; MODEL; Communication; Communication; Video Meta Results Raw,Hall J and Stickler U and Herodotou C and Iacovides I,,,0,254

285,Textbook treatments of electrostatic potential maps in general and organic chemistry,"Electrostatic potential maps (EPMs) allow for representation of key molecular-level information in a relatively simple and inexpensive format. As these visualizations become more prevalent in instruction, it is important to determine how students are exposed to them and supported in their use. A systematic review of current general and organic chemistry textbooks (N = 45) determined how frequently EPMs were presented in texts, how well distributed EPMs were across chapters, whether EPMs were included in end-of-chapter problems, and the types of conceptual instructional support provided to students when first exposed to them. Analysis demonstrated great variance in the use of EPMs. Most, but not all, textbooks presented at least one image, yet the prevalence and integration across texts varied greatly, owing in part to content differences between general and organic texts. Many texts provided minimal conceptual support and did not include EPMs in end-of-chapter problem sets. Overall, little consensus emerged as to how often EPMs should be used, and the sorts of instructional supports or student practice offered to scaffold the use of EPMs. These findings suggest a need for examining the supports that foster effective comprehension and use of EPMs, and more generally, obtaining data that inform the design and implementation of emerging instructional supports. © 2013 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.",Chemical Education Research; First-Year Undergraduate/General; Multimedia-Based Learning; Second-Year Undergraduate; Textbooks/Reference Books; Video Meta Results Raw,Hinze SR and Williamson VM and Deslongchamps G and Shultz MJ and Williamson KC and Rapp DN,,,0,256
286,Threshold Concepts as Focal Points for Supporting Student Learning,"Multimedia learning is widely used in life science education where the use of pictures and text can bring complex structures and processes to life. However the impact on academic performance and deeper understanding is not well documented. We therefore carried out a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of multimedia resources in tertiary level life science education. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted; studies were selected based on stringent pre-set criteria, and data were extracted for meta-analysis. In total, 17 studies were used in the meta-analyses with a total population of 2,290 students. The results show that, when used as a substitute for laboratory practicals, multimedia improved student learning gains assessed with an end-of-year examination, (mean difference 7.06, plus or minus 4.61). Although it did not improve short-term learning gains in this scenario, multimedia improved learning gains in 10 of the 16 sub-group comparisons made across all the studies. Overall, multimedia learning was more effective than many traditional educational methods although the numbers of studies included in the analysis were ultimately considered to be small due to many exclusions from the studies included in the analysis. Therefore, more good quality trials are required to evaluate a broader range of scenarios relevant to modern practices. Studies would benefit from being rigorous in design with good quality reporting of all aspects of methodology and study results.

288,"Exergaming for Children and Adolescents: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats","Exergaming, or active video gaming, has become an emerging trend in fitness, education and health sectors. It is defined as digital games that require bodily movements to play, stimulating an active gaming experience to function as a form of physical activity (PA). Since exergaming is becoming more popular, claims have been made on the usefulness of exergaming. It has, for example, been entitled as being the future of fitness by the American College of Sports Medicine, promoting PA and health in children and adolescents. However, research also suggests that long-term engagement in exergaming is difficult to achieve, and there is a noticeable reservation towards exergaming by parents, teachers and caregivers. To provide an overview and to outline the future directions of exergaming, the aim of this review was to critically illustrate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of exergaming to promote PA and health in children and youth. The available evidence indicates that exergaming has the potential to improve health via an increase in PA. However, it seems that this potential is frequently underexploited, and further developments such as customized exergames are needed.","active video gaming; serious games; physical activity; physical exercise; sedentary behavior; narrative review; ACTIVE VIDEO GAMES; VIGOROUS PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; NO CONVINCING EVIDENCE; REHABILITATIVE OUTCOMES; HEALTH; EXERCISE; METAANALYSIS; YOUTH; MOTIVATION; EDUCATION; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Benzing V and Schmidt M,,,0,259

With increasing frequency, QHR has been receiving half of mixed-method articles, with the other half the quantitative component presumably submitted to a Journal that accepts quantitative articles. A new article enhancements feature is added now, which will allow authors to submit additional content related to their articles. This content might be video files, audio files, large data sets, or other important supportive data to supplement an article, and would be reviewed with the article. Meta analyses and extensive reference lists or long tables from articles can be placed in the supplementary file, so that concern about article length will become less problematic.

291,Using a Multimedia Social Skills Intervention to Increase Social Engagement of Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) display impairments in social interactions and communication that appear at early ages. Fewer social engagements of children with ASD with peers often lead to long-term negative outcomes, such as social isolation and restricted language and cognitive skills. Although there is a clear need for social skills training for children with ASD, evidence-based practices are often not implemented for young children in school settings. The authors describe the Superheroes Social Skills program, a social skills intervention that combines multiple evidence-based practices, for use with young children with ASD. A case example is provided to describe the implementation and utility of the program for addressing social engagement skills of children with ASD and peers. Results of the case example suggest that the intervention contributed to greater engagement of children with ASD with peers during a free-play period.",Video Meta Results Raw,Radley KC and Jenson WR and Clark E and Hood JA and Nicholas P,,,0,261

293,Laparoscopic skill assessment of practicing surgeons prior to enrollment in a surgical trial of a new laparoscopic procedure,"Background Outcomes of surgical trials hinge on surgeon selection and their underlying expertise. Assessment of expertise is paramount. We investigated whether surgeons' performance measured by the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) assessment program could predict their performance in a surgical trial. Methods As part of a prospective multi-institutional study of minimally invasive inguinal lymphadenectomy (MILND) for melanoma, surgical oncologists with no prior MILND experience underwent pre-trial FLS assessment. Surgeons completed MILND training, began enrolling patients, and submitted videos of each MILND case performed. Videos were scored with the global operative assessment of laparoscopic skills (GOALS) tool. Associations between baseline FLS scores and participant's trial performance metrics were assessed. Results Twelve surgeons enrolled patients; their median total baseline FLS score was 332 (range 275-380, max possible 500, passing [270). Participants enrolled 87 patients in the study (median 6 per surgeon, range 1-24), of which 72 (83%) videos were adequate for scoring. Baseline GOALS score was 17.1 (range 9.6-21.2, max possible score 30). Inter-rater reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.85). FLS scores correlated with improved GOALS scores (r = 0.57, p = 0.05) and with decreased operative time (r = -0.6, p = 0.02). No associations were found with the degree of patient recruitment (r = 0.02, p = 0.7), lymph node count (r = 0.01, p = 0.07), conversion rate (r = -0.06, p = 0.38) or major complications( r = -0.14, p = 0.6). Conclusions FLS skill assessment of surgeons prior to their enrollment in a surgical trial is feasible. Although better FLS scores predicted improved operative performance and operative time, other trial outcome measures showed no difference.

294,Development and validation of a training module on the use of acetic acid for the detection of Barrett's neoplasia,"Background and study aims Acetic acid chromoendoscopy (AAC) enhances the ability to correctly identify Barrett's neoplasia, and is increasingly used by both expert and nonexpert endoscopists. Despite its increasing use, there is no validated training strategy to achieve competence. The aims of our study were to develop a validated training tool in AAC-assisted lesion recognition, to assess endoscopists' baseline knowledge of AAC-assisted lesion recognition, and to evaluate the efficacy and impact of this training tool. Methods A validated assessment of 40 images and 20 videos was developed. A total of 13 endoscopists with experience of Barrett's endoscopy but no formal training in AAC were recruited to the study. Participants underwent: baseline assessment 1, online training, assessment 2, interactive seminar, assessment 3. Results Baseline assessment demonstrated a sensitivity of 83% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 83 %. The online training intervention significantly improved sensitivity to 95% and NPV to 94% (P < 0.01). Further improvement was seen after a 1-day interactive seminar including live cases, with sensitivity increasing to 98% and NPV to 97%. Conclusions The data demonstrate the need for training in AAC-assisted lesion recognition as baseline performance, even by Barrett's experts, was poor.

In this investigation, a meta-analysis was conducted to determine the influence of visual feedback on motor learning. All available studies testing the utility of visual feedback were coded and meta-analyzed. A comparison was made between participants learning a motor skill with verbal feedback compared to participants learning with verbal and visual feedback. Overall, the weighted mean effect size of visual feedback was (.21) demonstrating a small effect. Implications for theory, practice, and policy are discussed.

299,Differences between multimedia and text-based assessments of emotion management: An exploration with the multimedia emotion management assessment (MEMA),"People process emotional information using visual, vocal, and verbal cues. However, emotion management is typically assessed with text based rather than multimedia stimuli. This study (N=427) presents the new multimedia emotion management assessment (MEMA) and compares it to the text-based assessment of emotion management used in the MSCEIT. The text-based and multimedia assessment showed similar levels of cognitive saturation and similar prediction of relevant criteria. Results demonstrate that the MEMA scores have equivalent evidence of validity to the text-based MSCEIT test scores, demonstrating that multimedia assessment of emotion management is viable. Furthermore, our results inform the debate as to whether cognitive saturation in emotional intelligence (EI) measures represents noise or substance. We find that cognitive ability associations with EI represent substantive variance rather than construct-irrelevant shared variance due to reading comprehension ability required for text-based items.",Video Meta Results Raw,MacCann C and Lievens F and Libbrecht N and Roberts RD,,,0,268
300,"Effects of computer gaming on cognition brain structure, and function: a critical reflection on existing literature","Video gaming as a popular form of leisure activity and its effect on cognition, brain function, and structure has come into focus in the field of neuroscience. Visuospatial cognition and attention seem to benefit the most, whereas for executive functions, memory, and general cognition, the results are contradictory. The particular characteristics of video games driving these effects remain poorly understood. We critically discuss major challenges for the existing research, namely, the lack of precise definitions of video gaming, the lack of distinct choice of cognitive ability under study, and the lack of standardized study protocols. Less research exists on neural changes in addition to cognitive changes due to video gaming. Existing studies reveal evidence for the involvement of similar brain regions in functional and structural changes. There seems to be a predominance in the hippocampal, prefrontal, and parietal brain regions; however, studies differ immensely, which makes a meta-analytic interpretation vulnerable. We conclude that theoretical work is urgently needed.

301,Interaction in distance education and online learning: Using evidence and theory to improve practice,"In a recent meta-analysis of distance and online learning, Bernard et al. (2009) quantitatively verified the importance of three types of interaction: among students, between the instructor and students, and between students and course content. In this paper we explore these findings further, discuss methodological issues in research and suggest how these results may foster instructional improvement. We highlight several evidence-based approaches that may be useful in the next generation of distance and online learning. These include principles and applications stemming from the theories of self-regulation and multimedia learning, research-based motivational principles and collaborative learning principles. We also discuss the pedagogical challenges inherent in distance and online learning that need to be considered in instructional design and software development.

303,Internet gaming disorder in children and adolescents: a systematic review,"AimInternet gaming disorder (IGD) is a serious disorder leading to and maintaining pertinent personal and social impairment. IGD has to be considered in view of heterogeneous and incomplete concepts. We therefore reviewed the scientific literature on IGD to provide an overview focusing on definitions, symptoms, prevalence, and aetiology. MethodWe systematically reviewed the databases ERIC, PsyARTICLES, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, and PubMed for the period January 1991 to August 2016, and additionally identified secondary references. ResultsThe proposed definition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition provides a good starting point for diagnosing IGD but entails some disadvantages. Developing IGD requires several interacting internal factors such as deficient self, mood and reward regulation, problems of decision-making, and external factors such as deficient family background and social skills. In addition, specific game-related factors may promote IGD. Summarizing aetiological knowledge, we suggest an integrated model of IGD elucidating the interplay of internal and external factors. InterpretationSo far, the concept of IGD and the pathways leading to it are not entirely clear. In particular, long-term follow-up studies are missing. IGD should be understood as an endangering disorder with a complex psychosocial background.",VIDEO GAME ADDICTION; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL MODEL; EXECUTIVE CONTROL NETWORK; COMPUTER GAME; RISK-FACTORS; PATHOLOGICAL INTERNET; PSYCHIATRIC-SYMPTOMS; WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; EXCESSIVE INTERNET; Clinical Neurology; Pediatrics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Pediatrics; Video Meta Results Raw,Paulus FW and Ohmann S and Von Gontard A and Popow C,,,0,271
304,Accuracy in categorizing perceptually ambiguous groups: A review and meta-analysis,"Since the 1940s, social psychologists have conducted research testing whether it is possible to accurately identify members of perceptually ambiguous groups. This study quantitatively reviews the research on the perception of ambiguous groups to better understand the human capacity to accurately identify others based on very subtle nonverbal cues. Standard random-effects meta-analytic techniques were used to examine the distinctions between different target groups in terms of their identifiability, as well as to compare rates of accuracy across perceptual modalities (e.g., photographs, audio, video) and other study design differences. Overall, the accuracy of identifying targets was significantly better than chance guessing (i.e., 64.5%). Furthermore, stimulus modality was found to be a moderator of accuracy. Other moderators (e.g., time of exposure, analytic approach) were identified and examined. These data help to document and characterize broad trends in the proliferating and expanding study of the perception and categorization of ambiguous social groups.

305,Social Interventions Targeting Social Relations Among Older People at Nursing Homes: A Qualitative Synthesized Systematic Review,"Social relations are part of the complex set of factors affecting health and well-being in old age. This systematic review seeks to uncover whether social interventions have an effect on social and health-related measures among nursing home residents. The authors screened PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO for relevant peer-reviewed literature. Interventions were included if (1) they focused primarily on social relations or related terms such as loneliness, social support, social isolation, social network, or being involuntarily alone either as the base theory of the intervention or as an outcome measure of the intervention; (2) they were implemented at nursing homes (or similar setting); (3) they had a narrative activity as its core (as opposed to dancing, gardening or other physical activity); (4) their participants met either physically or nonphysically, ie, via video-conference or the like; and if (5) they targeted residents at a nursing home. The authors systematically appraised the quality of the final selection of studies using the Mixed Methods Assessments Tool (MMAT) version 2011 and did a qualitative synthesis of the final study selection. A total of 10 studies were included. Reminiscence therapy was the most common intervention. Studies also included video-conference, cognitive, and support group interventions. All studies found the social interventions brought about positive trends on either/or the social and health-related measures included. Despite limited and very diverse evidence, our systematic review indicated a positive social and health-related potential of social interventions for older people living in nursing homes or similar institutions.",social relations; social support; loneliness; social isolation; nursing homes; older people; interventions; social interventions; outcome assessment; LONG-TERM-CARE; REMINISCENCE THERAPY; SUPPORT NETWORKS; LONELINESS; DEPRESSION; HEALTH; ADULTS; MORTALITY; DEMENTIA; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Mikkelsen AS and Petersen S and Dragsted AC and Kristiansen M,,,0,273
307,Systematic review of the information and communication technology features of web- and mobile-based psychoeducational interventions for depression,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the information and communication technology (ICT) features of psychoeducational interventions for depression delivered via the Internet or via mobile technology. METHODS: Web- and mobile-based psychoeducational intervention studies published from 2004 to 2014 were selected and reviewed by two independent coders. RESULTS: A total of 55 unique studies satisfied the selection criteria. The review revealed a diverse range of ICTs used to support the psychoeducational programs. Most interventions used websites as their main mode of delivery and reported greater use of communication tools compared to effective approaches like tailoring or interactive technologies games, videos, and self-monitoring tools. Many of the studies relied on medium levels of clinician involvement and only a few were entirely self-guided. CONCLUSION: Programs that reported higher levels of clinician involvement also reported using more communication tools, and reported greater compliance to treatment. Future experimental studies may help unpack the effects of technology features and reveal new ways to automate aspects of clinician input. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: There is a need to further examine ways ICTs can be optimized to reduce the burden on clinicians whilst enhancing the delivery of proven effective therapeutic approaches.","Psychoeducation; Depression; Web-based; Mobile; Communication technology; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; INTERNET-BASED TREATMENT; SELF-HELP INTERVENTION; PRIMARY-CARE; CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS; ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION; HEALTH INTERVENTIONS; UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; BRIEF ADVICE; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw",Zhao D and Lustria ML and Hendrickse J,,,0,274
308,Videoassisted anterior surgical approaches to the craniocervical junction: rationale and clinical results,"PURPOSE: In this narrative review, we aim to give an update on the anatomic fundamentals of endoscopic assisted surgery to the craniocervical junction (transnasal, transoral and transcervical), and to report on the available clinical results. METHODS: A non-systematic review and reporting on the anatomical and clinical results of endoscopic assisted approaches to the craniocervical junction (CVJ) is performed. RESULTS: Pure endonasal and cervical endoscopic approaches still have some disadvantages, including the learning curve and the lack of 3-dimensional perception of the surgical field. Endoscopically assisted transoral surgery with 30° endoscopes represents an emerging alternative to standard microsurgical techniques for transoral approaches to the anterior CVJ. Used in conjunction with traditional microsurgery and intraoperative fluoroscopy, it provides a safe and improved method for anterior decompression with or without a reduced need for extensive soft palate splitting, hard palate resection, or extended maxillotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Transoral (microsurgical or video-assisted) approach with sparing of the soft palate still remains the gold standard compared to the \pure\' transnasal and transcervical approaches due to the wider working channel provided by the former technique. Transnasal endoscopic approach alone appears to be superior when the CVJ lesion exceeds the upper limit of the inferior third of the clivus. Combined transnasal and transoral procedures can be tailored according to the specific pathological and radiological findings.'",Endoscopic assisted approaches; Occipitocervical junction; Transnasal approach; Transoral approach; Video-assisted approaches; Video Meta Results Raw,Visocchi M and Di Martino A and Maugeri R and González Valcárcel I and Grasso V and Paludetti G,,,0,275

A controlled experiment tested the effect of elaboration during problem-based discussion on recall. Sixty-seven students observed a video-recorded, problem-based discussion. In one experimental condition, a tutor in the video encouraged participants to elaborate by asking elaborative questions. In a second condition, the tutor asked superficial questions. After the discussion, all participants studied a text with relevant new information. Elaborative questions had no significant effect on recall of idea units from the text, p = .39, eta(2) = .01. High-ability students outperformed low-ability students, p = .04, eta(2) = .07, but this effect did not interact with the experimental treatment, p = .22, eta(2) = .02.

310,Deep neural network concepts for background subtraction:A systematic review and comparative evaluation,"Conventional neural networks have been demonstrated to be a powerful framework for background subtraction in video acquired by static cameras. Indeed, the well-known Self-Organizing Background Subtraction (SOBS) method and its variants based on neural networks have long been the leading methods on the large-scale CDnet 2012 dataset during a long time. Convolutional neural networks, which are used in deep learning, have been recently and excessively employed for background initialization, foreground detection, and deep learned features. The top background subtraction methods currently used in CDnet 2014 are based on deep neural networks, and have demonstrated a large performance improvement in comparison to conventional unsupervised approaches based on multi-feature or multi-cue strategies. Furthermore, since the seminal work of Braham and Van Droogenbroeck in 2016, a large number of studies on convolutional neural networks applied to background subtraction have been published, and a continual gain of performance has been achieved. In this context, we provide the first review of deep neural network concepts in background subtraction for novices and experts in order to analyze this success and to provide further directions. To do so, we first surveyed the background initialization and background subtraction methods based on deep neural networks concepts, and also deep learned features. We then discuss the adequacy of deep neural networks for the task of background subtraction. Finally, experimental results are presented for the CDnet 2014 dataset.","Background subtraction; Restricted Boltzmann machines; Auto-encoders networks; Convolutional neural networks; Generative adversarial networks; SELF-ORGANIZING APPROACH; OBJECT DETECTION; LEARNING TECHNIQUES; DENSITY-ESTIMATION; ROBUST-PCA; MODEL; IMAGE; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; APPROXIMATION; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Neurosciences; Computer Science; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw",Bouwmans T and Javed S and Sultana M and Jung SK,,,0,277
312,Feasibility and safety of robot-assisted thoracic surgery for lung lobectomy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of robot-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) lobectomy versus video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for lobectomy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: An electronic search of six electronic databases was performed to identify relevant comparative studies. Meta-analysis was performed by pooling the results of reported incidence of overall morbidity, mortality, prolonged air leak, arrhythmia, and pneumonia between RATS and VATS lobectomy. Subgroup analysis was also conducted based on matched and unmatched cohort studies, if possible. Relative risks (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by means of Revman version 5.3. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective cohort studies were included, with a total of 60,959 patients. RATS lobectomy significantly reduced the mortality rate when compared with VATS lobectomy (RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.38-0.77; P = 0.0006), but this was not consistent with the pooled result of six matched studies (RR = 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-1.07; P = 0.06). There was no significant difference in morbidity between the two approaches (RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.12; P = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: RATS lobectomy is a feasible and safe technique and can achieve an equivalent short-term surgical efficacy when compared with VATS, but its cost effectiveness also should be taken into consideration.",Robot-assisted thoracic surgery; Video-assisted thoracic surgery; Minimally invasive surgery; Lung lobectomy; LEARNING-CURVE; PULMONARY LOBECTOMY; INITIAL-EXPERIENCE; SURGICAL LOBECTOMY; RESECTION; Oncology; Surgery; Oncology; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Wei S and Chen M and Chen N and Liu L,,,0,278

315,Understanding sensitivity: lessons learned from the legacy of Mary Ainsworth,"On the basis of extensive home observations, Ainsworth proposed that a mother's sensitivity to her infant's signals is the primary determinant of attachment security. Although subsequent research has found a relationship between sensitivity and attachment security, the effect sizes are much smaller than those reported by Ainsworth. In addition to the amount of observation time that might account for the effect size difference, we consider Ainsworth's focus on understanding the organizational structure of relationships. We coded 30 minute video records of interactions between 64 mother-infant dyads from semi-structured home observations conducted at 10months of age. Coding consisted of writing a narrative summary of the interactions, annotating a completion of Ainsworth's rating scales of acceptance, accessibility, cooperation and sensitivity and then describing the mother's behavior using the Maternal Behaviour Q-set. Sensitivity scores derived from the Q-sort descriptions were robustly related (r=.65) to secure-insecure classifications in the Strange Situation conducted at 13months. We reflect on the process of assessing Ainsworth's construct of sensitivity.",Video Meta Results Raw,Pederson DR and Bailey HN and Tarabulsy GM and Bento S and Moran G,,,0,280

317,Doctor performance assessment in daily practise: Does it help doctors or not? A systematic review,"Context: Continuous assessment of individual performance of doctors is crucial for life-long learning and quality of care. Policy-makers and health educators should have good insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the methods available. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the feasibility of methods, the psychometric properties of instruments that are especially important for summative assessments, and the effectiveness of methods serving formative assessments used in routine practise to assess the performance of individual doctors. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE (1966-January 2006), PsychINFO (1972-January 2006), CINAHL (1982-January 2006), EMBASE (1980-January 2006) and Cochrane (1966-2006) databases for English language articles, and supplemented this with a hand-search of reference lists of relevant studies and bibliographies of review articles. Studies that aimed to assess the performance of individual doctors in routine practise were included. Two reviewers independently abstracted data regarding study design, setting and findings related to reliability, validity, feasibility and effectiveness using a standard data abstraction form. Results: A total of 64 articles met our inclusion criteria. We observed 6 different methods of evaluating performance: simulated patients; video observation; direct observation; peer assessment; audit of medical records, and portfolio or appraisal. Peer assessment is the most feasible method in terms of costs and time. Little psychometric assessment of the instruments has been undertaken so far. Effectiveness of formative assessments is poorly studied. All systems but 2 rely on a single method to assess performance. Discussion: There is substantial potential to assess performance of doctors in routine practise. The longterm impact and effectiveness of formative performance assessments on education and quality of care remains hardly known. Future research designs need to pay special attention to unmasking effectiveness in terms of performance improvement.

Results from a multicentre comparative study on 512 right-sided colorectal cancers,"Although nowadays considered as feasible and effective surgery in terms of short- and long-term results and oncological radicality, laparoscopic right colectomy is performed by a small number of surgeons, and in the vast majority of cases, this technique was performed with an extracorporeal anastomosis. Current literature failed to solve the controversies between intracorporeal and extracorporeal anastomosis after laparoscopic right colectomy. A multicenter case-controlled study has been designed, including 286 patients who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis (IA) compared with 226 matched patients who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with extracorporeal anastomosis (EA). There was no significant difference in terms of age, sex, BMI, and ASA score between the two groups. Surgical post history, tumor localization, and stage of disease according to AJCC/UICC TNM were similar too. Although similar oncologic radicality in term of number of lymph nodes harvested (25.7 +/- A 10.7 of IA group vs. 24.8 +/- A 8.7 of EA group; p = 0.3), as well as similar operative time (166 +/- A 43.7 min. in IA group vs. 157.5 +/- A 67.2 min in EA group) have been registered, time to flatus was statistically lower after intracorporeal anastomosis (40.8 +/- A 24.3 h in TLRC group vs. 55.2 +/- A 19.2 h in LARC group; p < 0.001) Laparoscopic colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis was associated with a lower rate of post-operative complications (OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.44, 0.95, p = 0.027). However, when stratifying according to clavien classification, the difference was consistently confirmed for less severe (class I and II) complications (OR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.42, 0.94, p = 0.025), but not for class III, IV, and V complications (OR 1.015, 95 % CI 0.64, 1.6, p = 0.95).

323,Impact of gender and genetics on emotion processing in Parkinson's disease - A multimodal study,"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) has been suggested to affect males and females differently. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common and disabling in PD. However, previous studies focusing on emotion recognition in PD have neglected the confounder of gender and lack evidence on the underlying endocrinal and genetic mechanisms. Moreover, while there are many imaging studies on emotion processing in PD, gender-related analyses of neural data are scarce. We therefore aimed at exploring the interplay of the named factors on emotion recognition and processing in PD. Methods: 51 non-demented PD patients (26 male) and 44 age-and gender-matched healthy controls (HC; 25 male) were examined clinically and neuropsychologically including an emotion recognition task (Ekman 60faces test). A subsample of 25 patients and 31 HC underwent task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) comprised of videos of emotional facial expressions. To examine the impact of hormones and genetics on emotion processing, blood samples were taken for endocrinal (testosterone, estradiol, progesterone) and genetic testing (5-HTTLPR, Val158Met COMT polymorphisms). Results: No group or gender differences emerged regarding cognitive abilities. Male but not female PD patients exhibited confined impairments in recognizing the emotion anger accompanied by diminished neural response to facial expressions (e.g. in the putamen and insula). Endocrinologically, fear recognition was positively correlated with estrogen levels in female patients, while on the genetic level we found an effect of Val158Met COMT genotype on the recognition of fear in PD patients. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that impaired emotion processing in PD specifically affects male patients, and that hormones and genetics contribute to emotion recognition performance. Further research on the underlying neural, endocrinological and genetic mechanisms of specific symptoms in PD is of clinical relevance, as it can improve our understanding of the phenomenology and pathobiology of the disease and may allow a more personalized medicine.",Parkinson's disease (PD); Emotion; Gender; Genetics; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; FACIAL EMOTION; AVERSIVE STIMULI; BASAL GANGLIA; RECOGNITION; AMYGDALA; EXPRESSIONS; GENOTYPE; METAANALYSIS; Neuroimaging; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw,Heller J and Mirzazade S and Romanzetti S and Habel U and Derntl B and Freitag NM and Schulz JB and Dogan I and Reetz K,,,0,286

The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies published between 2002 and 2017 were selected. Results showed that VAD improved learners' experience, attitude, and performance, but it did not show its advantage over verbal debriefing on knowledge acquisition. Effective elements included using experienced debriefers, curriculum-embedded simulation, a structured debriefing, and the time between 10 and 90 minutes.

326,"Cognitive load theory, the transient information effect and e-learning","When using modern educational technology, some forms of instruction are inherently transient in that previous information usually disappears to be replaced by current information. Instructional animations and spoken text provide examples. The effects of transience due to the use of animation-based instructions (Experiment 1) and spoken information under audio-visual conditions (Experiment 2) were explored in a cognitive load theory framework. It was hypothesized that for transient information presented in short sections, animations would be superior to static graphics, due to our innate ability to learn by observing. For transient information in long sections, animations should lose their superiority over static graphics, due to working memory overload associated with large amounts of transient information. Similarly, the modality effect under which audio-visual information is superior to visual only information should be obtainable using short segments but disappear or reverse using longer segments due to the working memory consequences of long, transient, auditory information.

327,Mapping the quality of feedback to support students' learning in lower secondary classrooms,"Feedback, talk and joint activities that build on knowledge and shared aims are powerful supports for learning. However, several studies of lower secondary students' perceptions of teachers' support indicate low teacher support. To investigate the quality of learning support, a content analysis instrument (CLASS) was used in analyses of 56 video-recorded lessons from 28 teachers in four lower secondary schools. This has allowed for a mapping of dimensions of quality feedback interactions, and results show significant and very strong inter-item relationships. The lessons analysed are characterized by a positive climate, and teachers emphasize encouragement, but feedback is found to be more encouraging than learning oriented. The results support previous studies based on students' perceptions, but provide insights into practices that are necessary if a goal is to influence teachers' professional learning.",Video Meta Results Raw,Gamlem SM and Munthe E,,,0,290
328,What we know and need to know about the gamification of advertising: A review and synthesis of the advergame studies,"Purpose Advergames, or integrated brand messages within digital games, have received considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. Despite increased use of advergames as a brand promotion strategy by a range of well-known brands, limited understanding exists about a number of issues related to the effective use of such games. This paper aims to critically review the literature on advergames by performing a detailed analysis of existing research in this area and propose an organizing framework. Based on this framework, the authors discuss key issues with current understanding and propose important questions for future research. Design/methodology/approach This literature review follows Webster and Watson's (2002) concept-driven systematic review methodology elaborating on the key antecedents and consequences identified in advergame studies (what we know: current knowledge), followed by the discussion of key factors that should be investigated as antecedents and consequences (literature gaps). Findings This paper presents a review and synthesis of advergame studies based on Terlutter and Capella's (2013) integrated marketing communication framework. It identifies game, individual and social factors and suggests how these factors could affect a consumer's brand-related cognitive, attitudinal and behavioral responses. The authors further propose an advergame framework that identifies two different unit of analysis (antecedents and consequences of game factors and antecedents and consequences of individual and social factors), which can be used by scholars to center their research efforts in a more detailed fashion. Research limitations/implications Research questions posed in this literature review indicate that future research in the area of advergames should focus on investigating the effects of various game, individual and social factors on consumers' cognitive, affective and behavioral responses. Practical implications The advergame framework provided here provides firms with a guide to the factors that may affect their consumers' cognitive, affective and behavioral responses and helps them in developing effective advergames. Originality/value The paper provides a comprehensive review of the advergame literature that has not been done before and develops a general advergame framework that can be applied in all contexts and will guide future studies in the area. Overall, the study helps the researchers to identify critical issues and concepts related to advergames and shapes future research in the field.",Need for cognition; Literature review; Congruence; Persuasion knowledge; Advergame; Brand placement; GAME-PRODUCT CONGRUENCE; LIMITED-CAPACITY MODEL; PERSUASION KNOWLEDGE; BRAND MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCE; MODERATING ROLE; IMPLICIT MEMORY; VIDEO GAMES; PLACEMENT; RESPONSES; Business; Business & Economics; Video Meta Results Raw,Vashisht D and Royne MB and Sreejesh S,,,0,291
329,"Using video and dialogue to generate pedagogic knowledge: teachers, learners and researchers reflecting together on the pedagogy of social research methods","Developments in pedagogical knowledge in the teaching of social research methods have largely been generated through teachers reflecting on their practice. This paper presents an alternative approach to generating data through reflective dialogue between researchers, teachers and learners. The approach incorporates elements of video stimulated recall and reflective dialogue within focus group interviewing. The rationale and affordances are discussed in relation to the goals of discussing teachers’ pedagogical decision-making and learners’ experience of, and response to, various pedagogical practices. The context is a study of capacity-building short courses in advanced social science research methods, specifically courses on: multi-modal analysis, computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software, multi-level modelling, and systematic review. The paper examines the methodological challenges of capturing the everyday realities of methods classrooms for teachers and learners and the affordances of using dialogue on observed teaching sessions to gain further insight into each other’s thinking and action. It concludes with lessons learned about methodological and pedagogical processes and an argument about the value of bringing methods and standpoints together in creative dialogue.

330,Electronic Performance Monitoring and sustained attention: Social facilitation for modern applications,"Electronic Performance Monitoring, or EPM, has been described as the use of electronic systems to monitor and evaluate performance. Research on the effects of EPM has indicated that electronic monitoring may improve employee productivity and performance. However, most of the prior research has utilized computer-based electronic presence to examine the effects of EPM on short-duration, clerical-based tasks. Relatively little is known about how EPM can affect longer-duration sustained attention tasks, like vigilance. The present study was comprised of two experiments that sought to examine the effects of EPM on sustained attention and to provide further evidence that video-based monitoring can be an effective form of EPM. A total of 197 participants (106 in experiment one and 91 in experiment two) completed a 24-minute cognitive-based vigilance task. The results indicated that not only could EPM improve sustained attention, but also that video-based electronic presence was an effective implementation of EPM. However, the results also indicated that the most robust performance effects were associated with employing two forms of video-based electronic presence simultaneously rather than individually. Theoretical implications and practical applications are further discussed.","Vigilance; Video-based monitoring; Performance; Social facilitation; MERE PRESENCE; TASK SATISFACTION; DRIVE THEORY; VIGILANCE; COMPUTER; AUDIENCE; WORK; STRESS; PRODUCTIVITY; METAANALYSIS; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Claypoole VL and Szalma JL,,,0,293
331,Potential of video games in learning Bahasa Melayu vocabulary among international university students in Malaysia: A meta analysis of selected journals,"This study uses a meta analysis to analyze several current articles published by selected journals by focusing on studies related to the potential of video games in Bahasa Melayu vocabulary learning by international students. Among the articles are those in journals such as Computers and Education, Computers in Human Behavior, Education Technology Research Development, Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, Australian Journal of Language and Literacy, Computer Assisted Language Learning, Educational Technology & Society, and Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research published between 2003 and 2011. For this study, only 15 articles were focused on out of 33 articles in journals published between 2003 until 2011. Nevertheless, only 9 articles were identified using the key words video games and language learning. In terms of methodology, most of the articles were literature reviews followed by case studies and experimental studies. Some articles combined quantitative and qualitative approaches. Findings from all the articles reviewed show that video games have potential as effective teaching aids and are capable of motivating students in language learning.

332,Gaming Your Way to Health: A Systematic Review of Exergaming Programs to Increase Health and Exercise Behaviors in Adults,"OBJECTIVE: Adults who are not engaged by traditional exercise methods require a strategy to achieve and maintain sufficient physical activity for health benefits. Exergames, or active videogames, may motivate some adults to engage in physical activity. This review explored the use of exergaming to promote physical activity behaviors and health in adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review of the use of exergaming was conducted. The review included experimental studies with a nonclinical adult population, which measured changes in physical activity behaviors and changes in anthropometric healthy weight indicators. RESULTS: From an initial search that yielded 1644 results, nine articles were found to satisfy the predetermined inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Exergaming provided a novel method for increasing or substituting physical activity in the short term. Although low participation was not associated with anthropometric changes, significant healthy anthropometric changes were associated with moderate to high exergaming participation. CONCLUSIONS: Exergaming may be employed as an effective exercise behavior change strategy in the short term and may have positive health benefits if recommendations are made regarding intensity and duration of play for optimal health outcomes. However, additional research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of exergaming as a long-term health promotion strategy.","Active videogames; Exergaming; Physical activity; Health and wellness; Health promotion; ACTIVE VIDEO GAMES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; WII FIT(TM); BENEFITS; BIKES; Health Policy & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation; Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Street TD and Lacey SJ and Langdon RR,,,0,295
333,Research on Mathematics Instruction with Students with Significant Cognitive Disabilities: Has Anything Changed?,"In 2008, Browder and colleagues published a meta-analysis on mathematics instruction for learners with significant cognitive disabilities and found that most skills taught to these students were only from two of the five strands recommended by the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (i.e., Number and Operations, and Measurement). A review of the literature since Browder et al. yielded an additional 29 studies. When results from both reviews were compared, a greater percentage of studies taught skills from three strands (i.e., Number and Operations, Geometry, and Algebra), whereas the percentage teaching skills from the Measurement strand decreased and the percentage teaching skills from the Data Analysis and Probability strand was unchanged. In addition, a systematic evaluation of the studies' instructional components found evidence to support the use of systematic instruction, in vivo instruction, system of least prompts strategy, constant time delay strategy, and task-analytic instruction as evidence-based practices for teaching mathematics to learners with significant cognitive disabilities. Implications for practice include the use of systematic instruction and in vivo procedures, the need for practitioners to have a deep understanding of mathematics, and the importance of relevancy when teaching a variety of mathematics skills.","mathematics; systematic instruction; task analysis; severe disabilities; autism; SIMULTANEOUS PROMPTING PROCEDURE; COMPUTER-BASED INSTRUCTION; EARLY NUMERACY SKILLS; TEACH ADDITION FACTS; HIGH-SCHOOL-STUDENTS; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES; VIDEO MODELS; YOUNG-ADULTS; NUMBER LINES; MODERATE; Education, Special; Rehabilitation; Education & Educational Research; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Hudson ME and Rivera CJ and Grady MM,,,0,296
334,EMDR Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Preliminary Research,"This article reports the results of two experiments, each investigating a different eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) protocol for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and each with two young adult male participants with long-standing unremitting OCD. Two adaptations of Shapiro's (2001) phobia protocol were developed, based on the theoretical view that OCD is a self-perpetuating disorder, with OCD compulsions and obsessions and current triggers reinforcing and maintaining the disorder. Both adaptations begin by addressing current obsessions and compulsions, instead of working on past memories; one strategy delays the cognitive installation phase; the other uses mental video playback in the desensitization of triggers. The four participants received 14-16 one-hour sessions, with no assigned homework. They were assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), with scores at pretreatment in the extreme range (mean = 35.3). Symptom improvement was reported by participants after 2 or 3 sessions. Scores at posttreatment were in the subclinical/mild range for all participants (mean = 8.5). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 4-6 months, indicating maintenance of treatment effects (mean = 7.5). Symptom reduction was 70.4% at posttreatment and 76.1% at follow-up for the Adapted EMDR Phobia Protocol and 81.4% at posttreatment and at follow-up for the Adapted EMDR Phobia Protocol with Video Playback. Theoretical implications are discussed, and future research is recommended.",Video Meta Results Raw,Marr J,,,0,297
335,Strategy Selection Versus Flexibility: Using Eye-Trackers to Investigate Strategy Use During Mental Rotation,"Spatial researchers have been arguing over the optimum cognitive strategy for spatial problem-solving for several decades. The current article aims to shift this debate from strategy dichotomies to strategy flexibility-a cognitive process, which although alluded to in spatial research, presents practical methodological challenges to empirical testing. In the current study, participants' eye movements were tracked during a mental rotation task (MRT) using the Tobii x60 eye-tracker. Results of a latent profile analysis, combining different eye movement parameters, indicated two distinct eye-patterns-fixating and switching patterns. The switching eye-pattern was associated with high mental rotation performance. There were no sex differences in eye-patterns. To investigate strategy flexibility, we used a novel application of the changepoint detection algorithm on eye movement data. Strategy flexibility significantly predicted mental rotation performance. Male participants demonstrated higher strategy flexibility than did female participants. Our findings highlight the importance of strategy flexibility in spatial thinking and have implications for designing spatial training techniques. The novel approaches to analyzing eye movement data in the current paper can be extended to research beyond the spatial domain.","cognitive; sex differences; spatial; eye-movement; changepoint analysis; LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SPATIAL ABILITY; VISUAL WORLD; COMPREHENSION; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION; COMPONENTS; MOVEMENTS; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Nazareth A and Killick R and Dick AS and Pruden SM,,,0,298
336,Active exergames to improve cognitive functioning in neurological disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Exergames represent a way to perform physical activity through active video games, serving as potentially useful tool in the field of neurorehabilitation. However, little is known regarding the possible role of exergames in improving cognitive functions in persons suffering from neurological disabilities. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search for relevant articles was carried out on PubMed/Medline, Scopus, PEDro, and Google Scholar. Only randomized controlled studies and non-randomized but controlled studies were retained. The following additional inclusion criteria were applied: studies focused on physical activity interventions carried out by means of exergames; populations targeted were affected by neurological disabilities; and reported results were related to cognitive outcomes. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMD) and pooled results using a random effects meta-analysis. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 520 abstracts screened, thirteen studies met the criteria to be included yielding a total of 465 participants, 233 randomized to exergames, and 232 allocated to the alternative or no intervention. The included studies varied in terms of studied populations (e.g., multiple sclerosis, post-stroke hemiparesis, Parkinson's disease, dementia, dyslexia, Down syndrome), type and duration of interventions, and cognitive outcome measures. Exergames significantly improved executive functions (SMD=0.53, P=0.005; 8 studies, N.=380) and visuo-spatial perception (SMD=0.65, P<0.0001; 5 studies, N.=209) when compared to the alternative or no intervention. There were no significant differences for attention (SMD=0.57, P=0.07; 7 studies, N.=250) and global cognition (SMD=0.05, P=0.80; 6 studies, N.=161). CONCLUSIONS: Exergames are a highly-flexible tool for rehabilitation of both cognitive and motor functions in adult populations suffering from various neurological disabilities and developmental neurological disorders. Additional high-quality clinical trials with larger samples and more specific cognitive outcomes are needed to corroborate these preliminary findings. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Exergames could be considered either as a supplemental treatment to conventional rehabilitation, or as strategy to extend benefits of conventional programs at home.",Video games; Neurological disorders; Rehabilitation; Cognition; VIRTUAL-REALITY; UPPER EXTREMITY; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; CEREBRAL-PALSY; OLDER-ADULTS; VIDEO-GAMES; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; SUBACUTE STROKE; LOW-COST; CHILDREN; Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw,Mura G and Carta MG and Sancassiani F and Machado S and Prosperini L,,,0,299
337,How Visual Displays Affect Cognitive Processing,"We regularly consult and construct visual displays that are intended to communicate important information. The power of these displays and the instructional messages we attempt to comprehend when using them emerge from the information included in the display and by their spatial arrangement. In this article, we identify common types of visual displays and the kinds of inferences that each type of display is designed to promote. In particular, we outline different types of semantic and pictorial displays. Then, we describe four main ways in which visual displays can affect cognitive processing including selection, organization, integration, and processing efficiency and how semantic and pictorial displays support these types of processing. We conclude with seven recommendations for designing visual displays and possible directions for future research.","Visual display; Graphic organizer; Visual representation; Cognitive processing; Multimedia learning; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; GRAPHIC ORGANIZERS; SEDUCTIVE DETAILS; KNOWLEDGE MAPS; TEXT; COMPREHENSION; INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK; VISUALIZATIONS; METAANALYSIS; Psychology, Educational; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",McCrudden MT and Rapp DN,,,1,300
338,Towards a conceptual framework demonstrating the effectiveness of audiovisual patient descriptions (patient video cases): a review of the current literature,"BACKGROUND: Technological advances have enabled the widespread use of video cases via web-streaming and online download as an educational medium. The use of real subjects to demonstrate acute pathology should aid the education of health care professionals. However, the methodology by which this effect may be tested is not clear. METHODS: We undertook a literature review of major databases, found relevant articles relevant to using patient video cases as educational interventions, extracted the methodologies used and assessed these methods for internal and construct validity. RESULTS: A review of 2532 abstracts revealed 23 studies meeting the inclusion criteria and a final review of 18 of relevance. Medical students were the most commonly studied group (10 articles) with a spread of learner satisfaction, knowledge and behaviour tested. Only two of the studies fulfilled defined criteria on achieving internal and construct validity. The heterogeneity of articles meant it was not possible to perform any meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have not well classified which facet of training or educational outcome the study is aiming to explore and had poor internal and construct validity. Future research should aim to validate a particular outcome measure, preferably by reproducing previous work rather than adopting new methods. In particular cognitive processing enhancement, demonstrated in a number of the medical student studies, should be tested at a postgraduate level.",Video Meta Results Raw,Roland D and Coats T and Matheson D,,,1,301
339,ATM crime detection using image processing integrated video surveillance: a systematic review,"Integrating image processing in video surveillance systems is a challenging task that has been attempted for the past several decades. Despite being susceptible to crime, automated teller machine (ATM) surveillance system has not been fully integrated with image processing application for detecting criminal activity. On the other hand, the conventional state of the art image processing algorithms available for occluded and covered face detection, human abnormal behavior analysis and illegal object detection may not work for ATM having different environment (i.e. illumination and camera view), abnormal gestures, and crime devices. This article reviews the previous research works on all possible image processing applications that can be used in the ATM surveillance camera. The review embarks with the aim of (1) categorizing the studies, (2) analyzing their weaknesses and strengths, (3) highlighting significant research findings and (4) providing future research directions. To achieve these goals, this review summarizes the information based on abnormality detection, features, system framework and methodology, image acquisition, sample specification, performance analysis and project funding. Furthermore, the survey evaluates the studies from the point of view of their applicability, suitability, and usage in dynamic environment such as ATM. Viewing as a whole, despite having huge potential, a full-fledged video surveillance system integrated with image processing methods has not been found in the existing literature for ATM. The findings of this review may help the future researchers to develop dynamic and multipurpose algorithms for surveillance system that can detect and prevent ATM crime. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Automated teller machine; ATM crime; Image processing methods; Video surveillance; Face occlusion detection; Abnormal activity detection; Illegal object detection; FACE OCCLUSION DETECTION; SKIN-COLOR; RECOGNITION; BOUNDARY; MODEL; PCA; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Computer Science; Behavioral research; Cameras; Crime; Face recognition; Monitoring; Object detection; Object recognition; Processing; Security systems; Video signal processing; Automated teller machines; Face occlusion detections; Image processing - methods; Automatic teller machines; Video Meta Results Raw",Sikandar T and Ghazali KH and Rabbi MF,,,0,302
340,Visuospatial training improves elementary students' mathematics performance,"BackgroundAlthough spatial ability and mathematics performance are highly correlated, there is scant research on the extent to which spatial ability training can improve mathematics performance. AimsThis study evaluated the efficacy of a visuospatial intervention programme within classrooms to determine the effect on students' (1) spatial reasoning and (2) mathematics performance as a result of the intervention. SampleThe study involved grade six students (ages 10-12) in eight classes. There were five intervention classes (n=120) and three non-intervention control classes (n=66). MethodsA specifically designed 10-week spatial reasoning programme was developed collaboratively with the participating teachers, with the intervention replacing the standard mathematics curriculum. The five classroom teachers in the intervention programme presented 20hr of activities aimed at enhancing students' spatial visualization, mental rotation, and spatial orientation skills. ResultsThe spatial reasoning programme led to improvements in both spatial ability and mathematics performance relative to the control group who received standard mathematics instruction. ConclusionsOur study is the first to show that a classroom-based spatial reasoning intervention improves elementary school students' mathematics performance.","spatial ability; spatial reasoning; mathematics performance; MENTAL ROTATION; SPATIAL VISUALIZATION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SKILLS; ACHIEVEMENT; CHILDREN; ABILITY; DISSOCIATION; METAANALYSIS; ORIENTATION; Psychology, Educational; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Lowrie T and Logan T and Ramful A,,,0,303
341,Objective assessment of surgical operative performance by observational clinical human reliability analysis (OCHRA): a systematic review,"Background Both morbidity and mortality data (MMD) and learning curves (LCs) do not provide information on the nature of intraoperative errors and their mechanisms when these adversely impact on patient outcome. OCHRA was developed specifically to address the unmet surgical need for an objective assessment technique of the quality of technical execution of operations at individual operator level. The aim of this systematic review was to review of OCHRA as a method of objective assessment of surgical operative performance. Methods Systematic review based on searching 4 databases for articles published from January 1998 to January 2019. The review complies with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and includes original publications on surgical task performance based on technical errors during operations across several surgical specialties. Results Only 26 published studies met the search criteria, indicating that the uptake of OCHRA during the study period has been low. In 31% of reported studies, the operations were performed by fully qualified consultant/attending surgeons and by surgical trainees in 69% in approved training programs. OCHRA identified 7869 consequential errors (CE) during the conduct of 719 clinical operations (mean = 11 CEs). It also identified 'hazard zones' of operations and proficiency-gain curves (P-GCs) that confirm attainment of persistent competent execution of specific operations by individual trainee surgeons. P-GCs are both surgeon and operation specific. Conclusions Increased OCHRA use has the potential to improve patient outcome after surgery, but this is a contingent progress towards automatic assessment of unedited videos of operations. The low uptake of OCHRA is attributed to its labor-intensive nature involving human factors (cognitive engineering) expertise. Aside from faster and more objective peer-based assessment, this development should accelerate increased clinical uptake and use of the technique in both routine surgical practice and surgical training.",Observational clinical human reliability analysis (OCHRA); Objective assessment of surgical operative performance; Technical error; Task performance; Hazard zones of operations; Proficiency-gain curves; RECTAL-CANCER; TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE; COMPETENCE ASSESSMENT; PROFICIENCY-GAIN; ERRORS; SKILLS; SURGERY; RESECTION; IDENTIFICATION; TRAINEES; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Tang B and Cuschieri A,,,0,304

343,When (and how) interacting with technology-enhanced storybooks helps dual language learners,"In a meta-analysis, Takacs, Swart, and Bus (2015) found that when children listen to multimedia electronic storybooks, comprehension is higher than when listening to a traditional oral reading of the story. However, adding interactive features reduced the benefit, and for at-risk children, the interactive features reduced comprehension to below that when listening to the reading. Here we report a contrasting effect. Namely, a type of interactive feature that we call simulation has a large positive benefit on story comprehension in a multimedia environment for dual language learners. In addition, we show that combining simulation with a modicum of support in the native language (in this case, Spanish) produces additional benefits on reading comprehension. That is, when children are poor decoders but have good English-language skills, or when they are good decoders but have poor English-language skills, adding Spanish support to simulation makes up for the deficit and increases performance when reading in English. We trace the differences between our findings and those reported by Takacs et al. to the types of interaction used. In the Takacs et al. findings, the interactive features did not enhance story meaning. In the current research, simulation was specifically designed to highlight meaning. Thus, simulation and Spanish support may be effective for improving comprehension when dual language learners are reading in English.

344,The brain network for deductive reasoning: a quantitative meta-analysis of 28 neuroimaging studies,"Over the course of the past decade, contradictory claims have been made regarding the neural bases of deductive reasoning. Researchers have been puzzled by apparent inconsistencies in the literature. Some have even questioned the effectiveness of the methodology used to study the neural bases of deductive reasoning. However, the idea that neuroimaging findings are inconsistent is not based on any quantitative evidence. Here, we report the results of a quantitative meta-analysis of 28 neuroimaging studies of deductive reasoning published between 1997 and 2010, combining 382 participants. Consistent areas of activations across studies were identified using the multilevel kernel density analysis method. We found that results from neuroimaging studies are more consistent than what has been previously assumed. Overall, studies consistently report activations in specific regions of a left fronto-parietal system, as well as in the left BG. This brain system can be decomposed into three subsystems that are specific to particular types of deductive arguments: relational, categorical, and propositional. These dissociations explain inconstancies in the literature. However, they are incompatible with the notion that deductive reasoning is supported by a single cognitive system relying either on visuospatial or rule-based mechanisms. Our findings provide critical insight into the cognitive organization of deductive reasoning and need to be accounted for by cognitive theories.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Cognitive Processes; Logical Thinking; Spatial Ability; Brain Hemisphere Functions; Diagnostic Tests; Evidence; Visual Perception; Meta Analysis; Video Meta Results Raw",Prado J and Chadha A and Booth JR,,,0,307

346,"A Comparison of Online, Video Synchronous, and Traditional Learning Modes for an Introductory Undergraduate Physics Course","While the equivalence between online and traditional classrooms has been well-researched, very little of this includes college-level introductory Physics. Only one study explored Physics at the whole-class level rather than specific course components such as a single lab or a homework platform. In this work, we compared the failure rate, grade distribution, and withdrawal rates in an introductory undergraduate Physics course across several learning modes including traditional face-to-face instruction, synchronous video instruction, and online classes. Statistically significant differences were found for student failure rates, grade distribution, and withdrawal rates but yielded small effect sizes. Post-hoc pair-wise test was run to determine differences between learning modes. Online students had a significantly lower failure rate than students who took the class via synchronous video classroom. While statistically significant differences were found for grade distributions, the pair-wise comparison yielded no statistically significance differences between learning modes when using the more conservative Bonferroni correction in post-hoc testing. Finally, in this study, student withdrawal rates were lowest for students who took the class in person (in-person classroom and synchronous video classroom) than online. Students that persist in an online introductory Physics class are more likely to achieve an A than in other modes. However, the withdrawal rate is higher from online Physics courses. Further research is warranted to better understand the reasons for higher withdrawal rates in online courses. Finding the root cause to help eliminate differences in student performance across learning modes should remain a high priority for education researchers and the education community as a whole.","Grade distribution; Online; Physics; Withdrawal rate; DISTANCE EDUCATION; CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION; EMPIRICAL LITERATURE; COMMUNITY-COLLEGES; METAANALYSIS; OUTCOMES; HOMEWORK; SYSTEM; WEB; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Faulconer EK and Griffith J and Wood B and Acharyya S and Roberts D,,,0,309
347,Effects of Video Game Training on Measures of Selective Attention and Working Memory in Older Adults: Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Video game training with older adults potentially enhances aspects of cognition that decline with aging and could therefore offer a promising training approach. Although, previous published studies suggest that training can produce transfer, many of them have certain shortcomings. This randomized controlled trial (RCT; Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02796508) tried to overcome some of these limitations by incorporating an active control group and the assessment of motivation and expectations. Seventy-five older volunteers were randomly assigned to the experimental group trained for 16 sessions with non-action video games from Lumosity, a commercial platform (http://www.lumosity.com/) or to an active control group trained for the same number of sessions with simulation strategy games. The final sample included 55 older adults (30 in the experimental group and 25 in the active control group). Participants were tested individually before and after training to assess working memory (WM) and selective attention and also reported their perceived improvement, motivation and engagement. The results showed improved performance across the training sessions. The main results were: (1) the experimental group did not show greater improvements in measures of selective attention and working memory than the active control group (the opposite occurred in the oddball task); (2) a marginal training effect was observed for the N-back task, but not for the Stroop task while both groups improved in the Corsi Blocks task. Based on these results, one can conclude that training with non-action games provide modest benefits for untrained tasks. The effect is not specific for that kind of training as a similar effect was observed for strategy video games.

348,Learning by Preparing-to-Teach and Teaching: A Meta-Analysis,"The present research meta-analytically examined the effects of preparing-to-teach and subsequent teaching (relative to mere studying without teaching expectancy) on the acquisition of domain knowledge. The synthesis of 28 studies indicated that the estimated effect sizes (Hedges' gs) were 0.35 for preparing-to-teach and 0.56 for teaching with preparing-to-teach. Both preparing-to-teach and teaching with preparing-to-teach were effective in promoting deep learning (as well as surface learning) and even after a delay. The learning benefits of teaching with preparing-to-teach were larger when students expected and engaged in an interactive teaching activity than when they expected and engaged in a non-interactive teaching activity. The mere expectation of interactive teaching also produced larger learning effects than the expectation of non-interactive teaching. These results suggest that preparing-to-teach and teaching, interactive teaching after preparing to do so in particular, are useful for enhancing learning.","learning by teaching; teaching expectancy; explaining to others; meta-analysis; EXPLANATIONS; KNOWLEDGE; BENEFITS; VIDEO; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Kobayashi K,,,0,311
349,The modality effect in a mobile learning environment: Learning from spoken text and real objects,"The finding that under split-attention conditions students learn more from a picture and spoken text than from a picture and written text (ie, the modality effect) has consistently been found in many types of computer-assisted multimedia learning environments. Using 58 fifth-grade and sixth-grade elementary school children as participants, we investigated whether the modality effect can also be found in a mobile learning environment (MLE) on plants' leaf morphology, in which students had to learn by integrating information from text and real plants in the physical environment. A single factor experimental design was used to examine the hypothesis that students in a mixed-mode condition with real plants and spoken text (STP condition) would pay more attention to the real plants, and achieve higher performance on retention, comprehension, and transfer tests than the single-mode condition with real plants and written text (WTP condition). Whereas we found that participants in the STP condition paid more attention to observing the plants, and achieved a higher score on the transfer test than participants in the WTP condition, no differences were found between the conditions for retention and comprehension test performance.",COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY; TRANSIENT INFORMATION; SPLIT-ATTENTION; DESIGN; METAANALYSIS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Liu TC and Lin YC and Gao Y and Paas F,,,0,312
351,Serious Gaming and Gamification Education in Health Professions: Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: There is a worldwide shortage of health workers, and this issue requires innovative education solutions. Serious gaming and gamification education have the potential to provide a quality, cost-effective, novel approach that is flexible, portable, and enjoyable and allow interaction with tutors and peers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of serious gaming/gamification for health professions education compared with traditional learning, other types of digital education, or other serious gaming/gamification interventions in terms of patient outcomes, knowledge, skills, professional attitudes, and satisfaction (primary outcomes) as well as economic outcomes of education and adverse events (secondary outcomes). METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Educational Resources Information Centre, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was conducted from 1990 to August 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, and assessed the study quality and extracted data. A meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. Therefore, a narrative synthesis is presented. RESULTS: A total of 27 RCTs and 3 cluster RCTs with 3634 participants were included. Two studies evaluated gamification interventions, and the remaining evaluated serious gaming interventions. One study reported a small statistically significant difference between serious gaming and digital education of primary care physicians in the time to control blood pressure in a subgroup of their patients already taking antihypertensive medications. There was evidence of a moderate-to-large magnitude of effect from five studies evaluating individually delivered interventions for objectively measured knowledge compared with traditional learning. There was also evidence of a small-to-large magnitude of effect from 10 studies for improved skills compared with traditional learning. Two and four studies suggested equivalence between interventions and controls for knowledge and skills, respectively. Evidence suggested that serious gaming was at least as effective as other digital education modalities for these outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether one type of serious gaming/gamification intervention is more effective than any other. There was limited evidence for the effects of serious gaming/gamification on professional attitudes. Serious gaming/gamification may improve satisfaction, but the evidence was limited. Evidence was of low or very low quality for all outcomes. Quality of evidence was downgraded due to the imprecision, inconsistency, and limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Serious gaming/gamification appears to be at least as effective as controls, and in many studies, more effective for improving knowledge, skills, and satisfaction. However, the available evidence is mostly of low quality and calls for further rigorous, theory-driven research.",video games; education; professional; review; NURSING-STUDENTS; SIMULATION GAME; VIDEO GAMES; SKILLS; PERFORMANCE; OUTCOMES; IMPACT; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Gentry SV and Gauthier A and L'Estrade Ehrstrom B and Wortley D and Lilienthal A and Tudor Car L and Dauwels-Okutsu S and Nikolaou CK and Zary N and Campbell J and Car J,,,0,313
352,The feasibility of a Two-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy,"Background: This study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy with two incisions. Methods: A total of 73 patients (male 47, female 26; mean age 61.2 +/- 12.00 years old) who underwent major pulmonary resection, through VATS, using two incisions were included in this study. The thoracoscopy port was placed at the 7th or the 8th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line, and the working port, 3 similar to 5 cm long, at the 5th intercostal space, on the operator's side. Results: The preoperative diagnosis was benign lung disease in 8 patients (11.0%) and malignant lung disease in 65 (89.0%). Two patients (3.1%) needed a third port during surgery due to severe pleural adhesion, and conversion to thoracotomy was needed in 5 (6.8%), due to bleeding at pulmonary arterial branch (n = 3), anthracofibrotic lymph nodes around pulmonary artery (n = 1), and severe pleural adhesion (n = 1). The mean duration of the operation in the 66 patients, completed by a two-incision VATS lobectomy, was 163.4 +/- 30.40 minutes. In 56 cases, which were completed by a two-incision VATS lobectomy for primary lung cancer, a total number of dissected lymph nodes per patient were 20.2 +/- 11.2. The chest tube was removed on postoperative day 5.4 +/- 2.8, and there was no occurrence of major perioperative morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: Two-incision VATS lobectomy is applicable in the selected cases, and may obtain similar results with the conventional VATS lobectomy, through a certain period of learning curve.",Video Meta Results Raw,Kim HK and Sung HK and Lee HJ and Choi YH,,,0,314
353,Good Newbie or Poor Newbie? Determinants of Video Game Skill Acquisition at an Early Stage,"For several years now, game-based learning is deemed as one of the most innovative approaches in educational practice. Nevertheless, little research has been undertaken examining individual determinants of skill acquisition in video games. The presented paper offers empirical data from a nine-week training curriculum for novices in a racing simulation game. Regression analyses revealed that general video game experience and real-world driving experience significantly predicted both initial and later performance. Additionally, perceptual speed also became strongly influential after consistent training. Conversely, while achievement was affected at least occasionally by divided attention, focused attention and dispositions towards aggressive driving showed no effects. Although preliminary, these results provide evidence that those learners without certain beneficial skills may struggle with cutting-edge virtual learning scenarios. Thus, both individual assistance as well as early promotion of video game literacy might be needed to make full use of the potential of game-based learning.",Video Meta Results Raw,Koban K and Liebold B and Ohler P,,,0,315

METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted to compare thoracoscopic surgery and sternotomy for myasthenia gravis patients with regard to long-term effect and short-term safety. RESULTS: A total of 23 trials were included in our research. No significant differences were detected with regard to myasthenic crisis, wound infection, and muscle weakness improvement. VATS led to less blood loss than TS (standardized mean difference, -1.233; 95% confidence interval, -1.425--1.041; P < 0.001), less risk of pulmonary infection (relative risk, 1.035; 95% confidence interval, 1.001-1.070; P = 0.043), and a shorter hospital stay. TS had a shorter operative time than VATS (standardized mean difference, 0.239; 95% confidence interval, 0.113-0.365; P < 0.001). VATS and TS achieved similar mean specimen weights and complete stable remission rates. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies, VATS increases surgical safety and achieves an equal surgical efficacy to TS, but TS has a shorter operative time.",Myasthenia gravis; sternotomy; video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Gung Y and Zhang H and Li S and Wang Y,,,0,317
357,Distance learning for updating health professionals in palliative care: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: To review literature regarding online educational initiatives in palliative care which are targeted to update health professionals and prepare distance courses suitable for a Brazilian context. METHODS: 7 databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, LILACS, SCIELO, CINAHL, Science Direct and Scopus) were reviewed for published papers between January 2004 and August 2014 using the PRISMA methodology. Included studies focused on health professionals and had at least part of the course in a distance learning approach. RESULTS: The UK, the USA, Canada and Australia stood out within the palliative care research papers. Among the 590 articles chosen, only 14 papers were included in this review due to the inclusion criteria. 9 used a mixed approach and 5 used online methods. The length of the courses, however, varied extensively and several methods were found to have been employed for teaching purposes, including videos, audio, images, poetry and simulation cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although the literature is abundant in this area, there is limited research exploring the construction process of courses and how they can be applied to countries with limited resources. It is important to highlight, however, that the mixed teaching strategy, which allows for theoretical and practical activities at a low cost, is imperative for countries with limited resources in healthcare. Thus, this review can support new initiatives around the world, particularly in the low-income and middle-income countries.",distance learning; e-learning; distance education; palliative care; health professional; OF-LIFE CARE; IMPACT; COMPETENCES; FACULTY; PROGRAM; PILOT; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Taroco Jr AL and Valente TC and Carbogim CS,,,0,318
358,"It's the deceiver, not the receiver: No individual differences when detecting deception in a foreign and a native language","Individual differences in lie detection remain poorly understood. Bond and DePaulo's meta-analysis examined judges (receivers) who were ascertaining lies from truths and senders (deceiver) who told these lies and truths. Bond and DePaulo found that the accuracy of detecting deception depended more on the characteristics of senders rather than the judges' ability to detect lies/truths. However, for many studies in this meta-analysis, judges could hear and understand senders. This made language comprehension a potential confound. This paper presents the results of two studies. Extending previous work, in Study 1, we removed language comprehension as a potential confound by having English-speakers (N = 126, mean age = 19.86) judge the veracity of German speakers (n = 12) in a lie detection task. The twelve lie-detection stimuli included emotional and non-emotional content, and were presented in three modalities-audio only, video only, and audio and video together. The intelligence (General, Auditory, Emotional) and personality (Dark Triads and Big 6) of participants was also assessed. In Study 2, a native German-speaking sample (N = 117, mean age = 29.10) were also tested on a similar lie detection task to provide a control condition. Despite significantly extending research design and the selection of constructs employed to capture individual differences, both studies replicated Bond and DePaulo's findings. The results of Study1 indicated that removing language comprehension did not amplify individual differences in judge's ability to ascertain lies from truths. Study 2 replicated these results confirming a lack of individual differences in judge's ability to detect lies. The results of both studies suggest that Sender (deceiver) characteristics exerted a stronger influence on the outcomes of lie detection than the judge's attributes.",lie detection; detecting deception; foreign languages; sender characteristics; native language; Deception; Foreign Languages; Interpersonal Communication; Judgment; Theory of Mind; Cognitive Ability; Intelligence; Personality; Native Language; Truth; Video Meta Results Raw,Law MK and Jackson SA and Aidman E and Geiger M and Olderbak S and Kleitman S,,,0,319
359,Development of an incarceration-specific overdose prevention video: Staying Alive on the Outside,"Objectives: The first 2 weeks following release from prison are associated with extraordinary risk of fatal drug overdose. However, bystanders can reverse opioid overdoses using rescue breathing and naloxone, an overdose antidote. We reviewed overdose prevention and naloxone administration training videos for incarceration specific and behaviour change theory-specific content and then developed a video that addressed these gaps. Design: Systematic review of educational videos and community-based participatory video development process. Setting: Community-based organisations, correctional health programmes. Method: Video development proceeded as a community-informed, iterative process of creating and testing the acceptability of a new DVD among end-user populations, community and correctional staff. Data collection and video development advisory process included three focus groups with opioid users and formerly incarcerated individuals, two consultations with national expert groups and overdose prevention programme staff and ongoing informal presentations to correctional staff and leadership. Results: Of nine eligible and reviewed videos, three contained theory-based learning components, and only one also contained peer-based content; none directly addressed post-incarceration overdose prevention. The created 19-minute film, Staying Alive on the Outside, uses interviews, conversation and model training sessions by peers, who candidly discuss the challenges of re-entry from prison, opioid addiction and relapse and misconceptions about opioid tolerance and overdose. Viewers learn strategies to avoid overdose while using opioids and what to do in an overdose. Peer \learners\' and peer \'trainers\' model the dissemination of education and naloxone administration. Conclusion: The DVD is currently used in several prisons and jails; a multi-site evaluation of programme effectiveness is discussed.'","Rhode Island; ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Drug Abuse; Focus Groups; Recidivism; Addictive Behavior; Semi Structured Interviews; At Risk Persons; Peer Teaching; Institutionalized Persons; Prevention; Training; Community Organizations; Program Development; Misconceptions; Theories; Video Technology; Death; Models; Teaching Methods; Coping; Correctional Institutions; Peer Influence; Video Meta Results Raw",Green TC and Bowman SE and Ray M and McKenzie M and Lord SE and Rich JD,,,0,320
360,Long-term early development research in congenital heart disease (LEADER-CHD): a study protocol for a prospective cohort observational study investigating the development of children after surgical correction for congenital heart defects during the first 3 years of life,"Introduction Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. Studies on the development of children with CHD point towards deficits in motoric, cognitive and language development. However, most studies are cross-sectional and there is a gap in the knowledge concerning developmental trajectories, risk and protective factors and a lack of research concerning environmental predictors. Specifically, no studies have so far considered the importance of early caregiving experiences and child temperament for the development of children with CHD. Methods In a single-centre prospective cohort study, cognitive, motoric and language development of 180 children after corrective surgery for a simple transposition of the great arteries (TGA), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) or ventricular septal defect (VSD) will be assessed at ages 12, 24 and 36 months with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development 3rd Edition (BSID-III). At age 12 months, a free-play video observation will be conducted to investigate the relationship between primary caregiver and child, and child temperament will be assessed with the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised Short Version. Medical information will be obtained from patient records and demographic information via questionnaires. Analysis Frequency and severity of developmental delays will be reported descriptively. Differences between groups (TGA, TOF, VSD) will be subjected to repeated-measures analysis across time points. Multiple regressions will be applied for the analysis of predictors at each time point. For the analysis of differential developmental trajectories, mixed-model analysis will be applied. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the local medical ethics committee. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Parents have the option to be debriefed about BSID-III results after each assessment and about the study results after project completion. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences.","HYPOTHERMIC CIRCULATORY ARREST; FLOW CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS; VENTRICULAR SEPTAL-DEFECT; NEONATAL CARDIAC-SURGERY; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; BRAIN-INJURY; COARCTATION REPAIR; INFANCY; METAANALYSIS; ADOLESCENTS; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Ferentzi H and Pfitzer C and Rosenthal LM and Berger F and Schmitt KR,,,0,321
362,Virtual reality using games for improving physical functioning in older adults: a systematic review,"The use of virtual reality through exergames or active video game, i.e. a new form of interactive gaming, as a complementary tool in rehabilitation has been a frequent focus in research and clinical practice in the last few years. However, evidence of their effectiveness is scarce in the older population. This review aim to provide a summary of the effects of exergames in improving physical functioning in older adults. A search for randomized controlled trials was performed in the databases EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsyInfo, Cochrane data base, PEDro and ISI Web of Knowledge. Results from the included studies were analyzed through a critical review and methodological quality by the PEDro scale. Thirteen studies were included in the review. The most common apparatus for exergames intervention was the Nintendo Wii gaming console (8 studies), followed by computers games, Dance video game with pad (two studies each) and only one study with the Balance Rehabilitation Unit. The Timed Up and Go was the most frequently used instrument to assess physical functioning (7 studies). According to the PEDro scale, most of the studies presented methodological problems, with a high proportion of scores below 5 points (8 studies). The exergames protocols and their duration varied widely, and the benefits for physical function in older people remain inconclusive. However, a consensus between studies is the positive motivational aspect that the use of exergames provides. Further studies are needed in order to achieve better methodological quality, external validity and provide stronger scientific evidence.",Video Meta Results Raw,Molina KI and Ricci NA and de Moraes SA and Perracini MR,,,0,322
363,C-MAC videolaryngoscope versus Macintosh laryngoscope for tracheal intubation: A systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The C-MAC laryngoscope (C-MAC) is a videolaryngoscope that uses a modified Macintosh blade. Although several anecdotal reports exist, it remains unclear whether the C-MAC is superior to the Macintosh laryngoscope for tracheal intubation in the adult population. DESIGN: Systematic review, meta-analysis. SETTING: Operating room, intensive care unit. MEASUREMENTS: For inclusion in our analysis, studies had to be prospective randomised trials which compared the C-MAC with the Macintosh laryngoscope for tracheal intubation in the adult population. Data on success rates, intubation time, glottic visualisation and incidence of external laryngeal manipulations (ELM) during tracheal intubation were extracted from the identified studies. In subgroup analysis, we separated those parameters to assess the influence of the airway condition (normal or difficult) and laryngoscopists (novice or experienced). We conducted a trial sequential analysis (TSA). MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen articles with 18 trials met the inclusion criteria. The C-MAC provided better glottic visualisation compared to the Macintosh (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14). TSA corrected the CI to 1.01-1.19; thus, total sample size reached the required information size (RIS). Success rates and intubation time did not differ significantly between the laryngoscopes. TSA showed that total sample size reached the RIS for success rates. The TSA Z curve surpassed the futility boundary. The C-MAC required less ELM compared to the Macintosh (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.96). TSA corrected the CI to 0.67-1.03; 52.3% of the RIS was achieved. In difficult airways, the C-MAC showed superior success rates, glottic visualisation, and less ELM compared to the Macintosh. Among experienced laryngoscopists, the C-MAC offered better glottic visualisation with less ELM than the Macintosh. CONCLUSIONS: The C-MAC provided better glottic visualisation and less ELM (GRADE: Very Low or Moderate), with improved success rates, glottic visualisation, and less ELM in difficult airways.",C-MAC; Macintosh laryngoscope; Tracheal intubation; VIDEO LARYNGOSCOPE; CERVICAL-SPINE; ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; Anesthesiology; Anesthesiology; Video Meta Results Raw,Hoshijima H and Mihara T and Maruyama K and Denawa Y and Mizuta K and Shiga T and Nagasaka H,,,0,323
365,Effectiveness of Digital Education on Communication Skills Among Medical Students: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis by the Digital Health Education Collaboration,"BACKGROUND: Effective communication skills are essential in diagnosis and treatment processes and in building the doctor-patient relationship. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of digital education in medical students for communication skills development. Broadly, we assessed whether digital education could improve the quality of future doctors' communication skills. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and searched seven electronic databases and two trial registries for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs (cRCTs) published between January 1990 and September 2018. Two reviewers independently screened the citations, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias. We also assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessment (GRADE). RESULTS: We included 12 studies with 2101 medical students, of which 10 were RCTs and two were cRCTs. The digital education included online modules, virtual patient simulations, and video-assisted oral feedback. The control groups included didactic lectures, oral feedback, standard curriculum, role play, and no intervention as well as less interactive forms of digital education. The overall risk of bias was high, and the quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. For skills outcome, meta-analysis of three studies comparing digital education to traditional learning showed no statistically significant difference in postintervention skills scores between the groups (standardized mean difference [SMD]=-0.19; 95% CI -0.9 to 0.52; I2=86%, N=3 studies [304 students]; small effect size; low-quality evidence). Similarly, a meta-analysis of four studies comparing the effectiveness of blended digital education (ie, online or offline digital education plus traditional learning) and traditional learning showed no statistically significant difference in postintervention skills between the groups (SMD=0.15; 95% CI -0.26 to 0.56; I2=86%; N=4 studies [762 students]; small effect size; low-quality evidence). The additional meta-analysis of four studies comparing more interactive and less interactive forms of digital education also showed little or no difference in postintervention skills scores between the two groups (SMD=0.12; 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.33; I2=40%; N=4 studies [893 students]; small effect size; moderate-quality evidence). For knowledge outcome, two studies comparing the effectiveness of blended online digital education and traditional learning reported no difference in postintervention knowledge scores between the groups (SMD=0.18; 95% CI: -0.2 to 0.55; I2=61%; N=2 studies [292 students]; small effect size; low-quality evidence). The findings on attitudes, satisfaction, and patient-related outcomes were limited or mixed. None of the included studies reported adverse outcomes or economic evaluation of the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: We found low-quality evidence showing that digital education is as effective as traditional learning in medical students' communication skills training. Blended digital education seems to be at least as effective as and potentially more effective than traditional learning for communication skills and knowledge. We also found no difference in postintervention skills between more and less interactive forms of digital education. There is a need for further research to evaluate the effectiveness of other forms of digital education such as virtual reality, serious gaming, and mobile learning on medical students' attitude, satisfaction, and patient-related outcomes as well as the adverse effects and cost-effectiveness of digital education.",randomized controlled trials; effectiveness; systematic review; communication skills; medical education; SIMULATION; ONLINE; PROFESSIONS; ATTITUDES; BENEFITS; RISK; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Kyaw BM and Posadzki P and Paddock S and Car J and Campbell J and Tudor Car L,,,0,324
366,"Trait Complex, Cognitive Ability, and Domain Knowledge Predictors of Baccalaureate Success, STEM Persistence, and Gender Differences","Prediction of academic success at postsecondary institutions is an enduring issue for educational psychology. Traditional measures of high-school grade point average and high-stakes entrance examinations are valid predictors, especially of 1st-year college grades, yet a large amount of individual-differences variance remains unaccounted for. Studies of individual trait measures (e.g., personality, self-concept, motivation) have supported the potential for broad predictors of academic success, but integration across these approaches has been challenging. The current study tracks 589 undergraduates from their 1st semester through attrition or graduation (up to 8 years beyond their first semester). Based on an integrative trait-complex approach to assessment of cognitive, affective, and conative traits, patterns of facilitative and impeding roles in predicting academic success were predicted. We report on the validity of these broad trait complexes for predicting academic success (grades and attrition rates) in isolation and in the context of traditional predictors and indicators of domain knowledge (Advanced Placement [AP] exams). We also examine gender differences and trait complex by gender interactions for predicting college success and persistence in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Inclusion of trait-complex composite scores and average AP exam scores raised the prediction variance accounted for in college grades to 37%, a marked improvement over traditional prediction measures. Math/Science Self-Concept and Mastery/Organization trait complex profiles were also found to differ between men and women who had initial STEM major intentions but who left STEM for non-STEM majors. Implications for improving selection and identification of students at-risk for attrition are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Ackerman PL and Kanfer R and Beier ME,,,0,325
367,Effects of game‐based learning on students' mathematics achievement: A meta‐analysis,"This meta‐analysis investigated the effects of learning video games on mathematics achievement of PreK‐12th‐grade students compared with traditional classroom instructional methods. Results from the 24 collected studies showed heterogeneity among effect sizes, both in magnitude and direction. Using a random effects model, a small but marginally significant overall effect ( d¯RE=0.13,p=.02) suggested that mathematics video games contributed to higher learning gains as compared with traditional instructional methods. In addition, moderator analyses were mixed in terms of statistical significance and explored effect‐size heterogeneity across effects using grade level, instrument type, length of game‐based intervention, country, publication type, and study year characteristics. Overall findings indicate that video games are a slightly effective instructional strategy for teaching mathematics across PreK‐12th‐grade levels.

368,Gender-Stereotyping and Cognitive Sex Differences in Mixed- and Same-Sex Groups,"Sex differences in specific cognitive abilities are well documented, but the biological, psychological, and sociocultural interactions that may underlie these differences are largely unknown. We examined within a biopsychosocial approach how gender stereotypes affect cognitive sex differences when adult participants were tested in mixed-or same-sex groups. A total of 136 participants (70 women) were allocated to either mixed-or same-sex groups and completed a battery of sex-sensitive cognitive tests (i.e., mental rotation, verbal fluency, perceptual speed) after gender stereotypes or gender-neutral stereotypes (control) were activated. To study the potential role of testosterone as a mediator for group sex composition and stereotype boost/threat effects, saliva samples were taken before the stereotype manipulation and after cognitive testing. The results showed the typical male and female advantages in mental rotation and verbal fluency, respectively. In general, men and women who were tested in mixed-sex groups and whose gender stereotypes had not been activated performed best. Moreover, a stereotype threat effect emerged in verbal fluency with reduced performance in gender stereotyped men but not women. Testosterone levels did not mediate the effects of group sex composition and stereotype threat nor did we find any relationship between testosterone and cognitive performance in men and women. Taken together, the findings suggest that an interaction of gender stereotyping and group sex composition affects the performance of men and women in sex-sensitive cognitive tasks. Mixed-sex settings can, in fact, increase cognitive performance as long as gender-stereotyping is prevented.",Video Meta Results Raw,Hirnstein M and Andrews LC and Hausmann M,,,0,327
369,Use of simulation-based learning among perioperative nurses and students: A scoping review,"Objectives: Simulation-based learning has been extensively explored, especially in baccalaureate nursing programmes. Recently, simulation-based learning has been introduced in perioperative nursing. The aim of this scoping review is to investigate work published on the use of simulation-based learning in the field of perioperative nursing. Design and data sources: A scoping review was conducted using the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley to identify a broad range of relevant literature, regardless of study design. A comprehensive and systematic search was performed using Medline, CINAHL, Eric, Svemed +, PsychINFO and Embase in May 2016 and then was updated in February 2018. Each database was searched for literature published between 1st January 2005 and 8th February 2018. Review method. Two authors independently assessed literature eligibility and extracted data to answer our research question 'What is known about the use of simulation-based learning in the field of perioperative nursing?' Results: Nine articles and one doctoral thesis were included in the review. There appears to be a paucity of research or results-oriented evidence regarding the use of simulation-based learning in the field of perioperative nursing. Different goals of simulation-based learning were reported. It was difficult to confirm whether these goals had been reached as none of the articles included control groups, and no evaluations had been undertaken against Kirkpatrick's level 3 to see changes in participants' behaviours, and level 4, to determine whether the training had a positive impact on, for example, patient outcomes. Conclusion: Owing to the lack of research and the inadequate descriptions of design and method in simulation based learning in most of the articles included, there is little evidence in the existing literature to guide practitioners of this learning in the field of perioperative nursing. This indicates a need for further research in this area.","Simulation-based learning; Perioperative nursing; Scoping review; Education; Students; NURSING-STUDENTS; NONTECHNICAL SKILLS; EDUCATION; FIDELITY; PERFORMANCE; VIDEO; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Nursing; Education & Educational Research; Nursing; Video Meta Results Raw",Kaldheim HK and Bergland A and Olnes MA and Hofso K and Dihle A and Creutzfeldt J and Zhang C and Steindal SA,,,0,328
370,Digital storytelling in health professions education: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Digital stories are short videos that combine stand-alone and first-person narratives with multimedia. This systematic review examined the contexts and purposes for using digital storytelling in health professions education (HPE) as well as its impact on health professionals' learning and behaviours. METHODS: We focused on the results of HPE studies gleaned from a larger systematic review that explored digital storytelling in healthcare and HPE. In December 2016, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ERIC. We included all English-language studies on digital storytelling that reported at least one outcome from Levels 2 (learning) or 3 (behaviour) of The New World Kirkpatrick Model. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion and extracted data. RESULTS: The comprehensive search (i.e., digital storytelling in healthcare and HPE) resulted in 1486 unique titles/abstracts. Of these, 153 were eligible for full review and 42 pertained to HPE. Sixteen HPE articles were suitable for data extraction; 14 focused on health professionals' learning and two investigated health professionals' learning as well as their behaviour changes. Half represented the undergraduate nursing context. The purposes for using digital storytelling were eclectic. The co-creation of patients' digital stories with health professionals as well as the creation and use of health professionals' own digital stories enhanced learning. Patients' digital stories alone had minimal impact on health professionals' learning. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the need for high-quality research on the impact of digital storytelling in HPE, especially on health professionals' behaviours.

We searched 13 electronic databases including randomized controlled trials, cluster randomized controlled trials, and controlled before and after studies. Of the 1426 abstracts identified, 23 studies (reported in 22 papers) met the inclusion criteria. Video interventions led to improvements in stigmatising attitudes. Video was found to be more effective than other interventions, such as classical face-to-face educational sessions or simulation of hallucinations. According to results of two studies, social contact delivered via video achieved similar destigmatization effect to that delivered via a live intervention. Although the quality of studies as well as the form of video interventions varied, the findings suggest that video is a promising destigmatization tool among young people; however, more studies in this area are needed. There was a lack of evidence for interventions outside of school environments, in low- and middle-income countries, and studies, which looked at long-term outcomes or measured impact on actual behaviour and implicit attitudes. The review generates recommendations for video interventions targeted at young people.",Stigma; Discrimination; Media; Adolescents; Psychiatry; HEALTH-RELATED STIGMA; HELP-SEEKING; DOCUMENTARY FILM; PUBLIC STIGMA; REDUCE STIGMA; ATTITUDES; CONTACT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ADOLESCENTS; EDUCATION; Psychiatry; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Janoušková M and Tušková E and Weissová A and Trančík P and Pasz J and Evans-Lacko S and Winkler P,,,1,330
372,Food cue reactivity and craving predict eating and weight gain: a meta-analytic review,"According to learning-based models of behavior, food cue reactivity and craving are conditioned responses that lead to increased eating and subsequent weight gain. However, evidence supporting this relationship has been mixed. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis to assess the predictive effects of food cue reactivity and craving on eating and weight-related outcomes. Across 69 reported statistics from 45 published reports representing 3,292 participants, we found an overall medium effect of food cue reactivity and craving on outcomes (r = 0.33, p < 0.001; approximately 11% of variance), suggesting that cue exposure and the experience of craving significantly influence and contribute to eating behavior and weight gain. Follow-up tests revealed a medium effect size for the effect of both tonic and cue-induced craving on eating behavior (r = 0.33). We did not find significant differences in effect sizes based on body mass index, age, or dietary restraint. However, we did find that visual food cues (e.g. pictures and videos) were associated with a similar effect size to real food exposure and a stronger effect size than olfactory cues. Overall, the present findings suggest that food cue reactivity, cue-induced craving and tonic craving systematically and prospectively predict food-related outcomes. These results have theoretical, methodological, public health and clinical implications.",Craving; cue reactivity; eating behavior; food; weight gain; Video Meta Results Raw,Boswell RG and Kober H,,,0,331
373,OBSERVER RATING VERSUS THREE-DIMENSIONAL MOTION ANALYSIS OF LOWER EXTREMITY KINEMATICS DURING FUNCTIONAL SCREENING TESTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,"Background: Functional assessments are conducted in both clinical and athletic settings in an attempt to identify those individuals who exhibit movement patterns that may increase their risk of non-contact injury. In place of highly sophisticated threedimensional motion analysis, functional testing can be completed through observation. Hypothesis/purpose: To evaluate the validity of movement observation assessments by summarizing the results of articles comparing human observation in real-time or video play-back and three-dimensional motion analysis of lower extremity kinematics during functional screening tests. Study Design: Systematic review Methods: A computerized systematic search was conducted through Medline, SPORTSdiscus, Scopus, Cinhal, and Cochrane health databases between February and April of 2014. Validity studies comparing human observation (real-time or video play-back) to three-dimensional motion analysis of functional tasks were selected. Only studies comprising uninjured, healthy subjects conducting lower extremity functional assessments were appropriate for review. Eligible observers were certified health practitioners or qualified members of sports and athletic training teams that conduct athlete screening. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) was used to appraise the literature. Results are presented in terms of functional tasks. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Across these studies, two-legged squats, single-leg squats, drop-jumps, and running and cutting manoeuvres were the functional tasks analysed. When compared to three-dimensional motion analysis, observer ratings of lower extremity kinematics, such as knee position in relation to the foot, demonstrated mixed results. Single-leg squats achieved target sensitivity values (> 80%) but not specificity values (> 50%). Drop-jump task agreement ranged from poor ( 80%). Two-legged squats achieved 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Mean underestimations as large as 19 degrees (peak knee flexion) were found in the results of those assessing running and side-step cutting manoeuvres. Variables such as the speed of movement, the methods of rating, the profiles of participants and the experience levels of observers may have influenced the outcomes of functional testing. Limitations: The small number of studies used limits generalizability. Furthermore, this review used two dimensional videoplayback for the majority of observations. If the movements had been rated in real-time three dimensional video, the results may have been different. Conclusions: Slower, speed controlled movements using dichotomous ratings reach target sensitivity and demonstrate higher overall levels of agreement. As a result, their utilization in functional screening is advocated.",Video Meta Results Raw,Maclachlan L and White SG and Reid D,,,0,332
374,Can post-hoc video review of robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy predict portal/superior mesenteric vein margin status in pancreatic adenocarcinoma?,"Background: Achieving margin negative resection is a significant determinant of outcome in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA). However, because of the fibrotic nature of PDA, it can be difficult to discriminate fibrosis from active disease intra-operatively. We sought to determine if post-hoc video review of robotic pancreatico-duodenectomy (RPD) could predict the portal/superior mesenteric vein (PV/SMV) margin status on final pathology. Methods: Experienced pancreatic surgeons, blinded to patient and operative variables, reviewed the PV/SMV margin for available RPD videos of consecutive PDA patients from 9/2012 through 6/2017. Results: 107 RPD videos were reviewed. Of 76 patients (71%) predicted to have a negative vein margin on video review, 20 patients (26%) had a pathologic positive margin. 25 of 31 patients (81%) predicted to have positive margin on video review were positive on pathology. The specificity of video prediction was 90.3% with a sensitivity of 55.6% and an accuracy of 75.7%. Conclusion: Post-hoc video review prediction is unable to reliably predict a positive (R1) margin at the portal vein/SMV, suggesting that intra-operative clinical assessment may be suboptimal in determining the need for more extensive resections.",NEOADJUVANT THERAPY; PORTAL-VEIN; SERUM CA-19-9; RESECTION; CANCER; SURVIVAL; OUTCOMES; METAANALYSIS; INVOLVEMENT; FOLFIRINOX; Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery; Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Jung JP and Zenati MS and Hamad A and Hogg ME and Simmons RL and Zureikat AH and Zeh HJ and Boone BA,,,0,333
375,The Utilization of Video Technology in Surgical Education: A Systematic Review,"Background: The use of surgical video has great potential to enhance surgical education, but there exists limited information about how to effectively use surgical videos. We performed a systematic review of video technology in surgical training and provided evidence-based recommendations for its effective use. Materials and methods: A systematic review of literature on surgical video in residency education was conducted. All articles meeting inclusion criteria were evaluated for technical characteristics pertaining to video usage. Included studies were critically appraised using a quality-scoring system. Recommendations were provided for the effective implementation of video in surgical education based on associations with improved training outcomes. Results: Twenty articles met inclusion criteria. In these studies, the source of video acquisition was primarily laparoscopy (40.0% of papers), and the main perspective of video was endoscopy (45.0%). Features of videos included supplementation with other educational tools (55.0%), schematic diagrams or images (50.0%), audio (40.0%), and narration (25.0%). Videos were primarily viewed preoperatively (60.0%) or postoperatively (50.0%). The intended viewer for videos was usually residents (70.0%) but also included attendings/faculty (30.0%). When compared with a nonvideo training group, video training was associated with improved resident knowledge (100%), improved operative performance (81.3%), and greater participant satisfaction (100%). Conclusions: Based on this review, we recommend that surgical training programs incorporate schematics and imaging into video, supplement video with other education tools, and utilize audio in video. For video review, we recommend that residents review video preoperatively and postoperatively for learning and that attendings review video postoperatively for assessment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

376,Understanding spatial transformations: similarities and differences between mental rotation and mental folding,"Mental rotation and mental folding, two widely used measures of spatial ability, both require the dynamic spatial transformation of objects with respect to their internal spatial structure. Traditionally, however, these two skills have been considered quite distinct, based primarily on factor analyses of psychometric data. This paper reviews the similarities and differences between mental rotation and mental folding from a variety of perspectives, including their definitions, component cognitive processes, neurological bases, developmental trajectories, malleability, predictive validity, and psychometric properties. We conclude that mental rotation and mental folding are similar in many respects. However, the tasks differ in whether they require rigid or non-rigid transformations of objects. In addition, mental rotation shows robust sex-related differences whereas mental folding does not. We also identify specific questions for which research is lacking.",Video Meta Results Raw,Harris J and Hirsh-Pasek K and Newcombe NS,,,0,335
377,Augmenting inpatient treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder with a computerised cognitive bias modification procedure targeting appraisals (CBM-App): protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Introduction Influential theories of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suggest that dysfunctional appraisals of trauma play a key role in the maintenance of symptoms, and this suggestion is increasingly supported by research. Experimental studies have indicated that a simple computerised cognitive training procedure, here termed cognitive bias modification-appraisals (CBM-App), can modify trauma-relevant appraisals and reduce analogue trauma symptoms among healthy volunteers. This suggests the possibility that CBM-App could improve outcomes in PTSD via targeting the key process of dysfunctional appraisals, for example, if applied as an adjunct to treatment. Methods and analysis The study is a randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. It is planned to randomise 80 patients admitted for treatment for PTSD to an inpatient treatment clinic to complete either sessions of CBM-App or a sham-training control condition, the peripheral vision task. Both interventions comprise eight sessions scheduled over a 2-week period and are completed in addition to the standard treatment programme in the clinic. Outcome assessment occurs pretraining, after 1 week of training, post-training, at discharge from the inpatient clinic and 6 weeks and 3 months postdischarge. The primary outcome is dysfunctional trauma-relevant appraisals at post-training, measured using a scenario completion task. Secondary outcomes include symptom measures and hair cortisol. Outcome analyses will be primarily via mixed linear models and conducted with both intention to treat and per protocol samples. Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the Ethics Committee for the Faculty of Psychology, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum (approval no 204) and the Ethics Committee for the Faculty of Medicine, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum (approval no 15-5477). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will inform future clinical and experimental studies into targeting maladaptive appraisals for the reduction of PTSD symptoms.","INTRUSIVE MEMORIES; PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; ANXIETY; METAANALYSIS; DEPRESSION; THERAPY; ADULTS; INVENTORY; SURVIVORS; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Woud ML and Blackwell SE and Cwik JC and Margraf J and Holmes EA and Steudte-Schmiedgen S and Herpertz S and Kessler H,,,0,336
379,A preliminary investigation of a school-based musical theater intervention program for children with intellectual disabilities,"The presence of an intellectual disability may cause a child to have significant deficits in social skills and emotion regulation abilities across development. A vital next step is to find interventions that can be delivered in the school environment and across disability categories that target socioemotional factors. The current study investigated the feasibility of delivering a school-based musical theater program to students with intellectual disability across a range of school settings. A within-group repeated-measures design was used to analyze pre- and post-video recordings of the intervention program, which were coded for six domains of socioemotional ability across all participants (n = 47). Results showed that significant gains across all domains were observed. However, these gains related to school- and individual-level student factors, such as grade level, severity of disability, and baseline social skill ability.","intellectual disability; special education; socioemotional functioning; musical theater intervention; SOCIAL-SKILLS DEVELOPMENT; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; LEARNING-DISABILITIES; THERAPY; ADOLESCENTS; STUDENTS; METAANALYSIS; ENGAGEMENT; PEERS; Education, Special; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Zyga O and Russ SW and Meeker H and Kirk J,,,0,337
380,Video Feedforward for Rapid Learning of a Picture-Based Communication System,"This study examined the efficacy of video self modeling (VSM) using feedforward, to teach various goals of a picture exchange communication system (PECS). The participants were two boys with autism and one man with Down syndrome. All three participants were non-verbal with no current functional system of communication; the two children had long histories of PECS failure. A series of replications, with different length baselines, was used to examine whether video self modeling could replace the PECS method of teaching to achieve the same goals. All three participants showed rapid learning of their target behavior when introduced to their self modeling videos, and effects generalized without the need for further intervention. We conclude that VSM, using feedforward, can provide a fast, simple way of teaching the use of a picture-based communication system without the need for prompts or intensive operant conditioning. VSM may provide an accessible, easy-to-use alternative to common methods of teaching augmentative and alternative communication systems.",Video Meta Results Raw,Smith J and Hand L and Dowrick PW,,,0,338
381,Predictors of performance improvements within a cognitive remediation program for schizophrenia,"Cognitive impairment is regarded a core feature of schizophrenia and is associated with low psychosocial functioning. There is rich evidence that cognitive remediation can improve cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia. However, little is known about what predicts individual remediation success. Some studies suggest that baseline cognitive impairment might be a limiting factor for training response. Aim of the current study was to further examine the role of cognitive and symptom variables as predictors of remediation success. We studied a total sample of 32 patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder who were engaged in a computer-based cognitive training program (CogPack). A pre-training test battery provided cognitive measures of selective attention, executive functioning, processing speed, verbal memory, and verbal intelligence along with measures for positive and negative symptoms. Training response was defined as improvement on training tasks. Correlation analyses revealed no significant relationship between any of the baseline cognitive or symptom measures and improvement rates. However, better baseline cognition was associated with a higher percentage of tasks with initial ceiling effects. We conclude that not carefully tailoring task difficulty to patients' cognitive abilities constitutes a much more severe threat to cognitive remediation success than cognitive impairment itself.

382,Effectiveness of home-based virtual reality on vestibular rehabilitation outcomes: a systematic review,"Background: A 2015 systematic review evaluated the efficacy of utilizing virtual reality in vestibular rehabilitation programs. However, the biggest limitation with most of the included virtual reality systems was the associated cost of the equipment. In addition, home-based exercises are the preferred method of vestibular rehabilitation treatments. Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of home-based virtual reality systems on vestibular rehabilitation outcomes. Methods: The following databases were examined: CINAHL Complete, ProQuest Medical Database, and PubMed. The following search terms were utilized: ‘video OR computer’ AND ‘vestibular’ AND ‘home’. The evidence level for all of the included articles was evaluated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence and the methodological rigor for all of the included articles was evaluated using a 10-item tool created by Medlicott and Harris. Results: Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven articles were selected for inclusion in this systematic review. This systematic review found that home-based virtual reality interventions were able to effectively achieve the primary objectives of vestibular rehabilitation and that the use of these interventions was equally as effective as the use of a traditional vestibular rehabilitation program. In addition, it may be most beneficial to combine virtual reality with traditional vestibular rehabilitation. Conclusions: Clinicians should consider using a combination of virtual reality and traditional vestibular rehabilitation when treating individuals who have been diagnosed with a vestibular dysfunction. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Home exercise program; systematic review; vertigo; vestibular rehabilitation; virtual reality; DYNAMIC VISUAL-ACUITY; DIZZINESS; BALANCE; HYPOFUNCTION; RECOVERY; THERAPY; VERTIGO; ADULTS; Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw,Kinne BL and Owens KJ and Rajala BA and Ticknor SK,,,0,340
383,FLIPPING THE CLASSROOM WITH TECHNOLOGY,"The traditional one-size-fits-all of education often results in limited concept engagement, restricted teacher student interaction, and severe consequences. With the prevalence of communication technologies for producing and posting online video and multimedia, as well as the increased capacity of students' access to technology, these innovations have paved the way for advancing the flipped classroom model away from the traditional classroom, and into a hybrid or blending learning environment. Flipped classroom is a reversed teaching model that delivers instruction outside of the classroom, through interactive, teacher-created videos, lessons and multimedia, moving the homework and in-class projects to the \laboratory\'. Moving lectures and discourse to the outside of the classroom provides teachers additional one-on-one time with each student",thereby allowing the classroom to be truly student-centered. Students have the opportunity to ask questions and work through problems with the guidance of their teachers and the support of their peers - creating a collaborative learning environment. This paper will provide both a meta-analysis of flipped classroom models as well as provided strategies for implementation of educational technologies aligned with course examples. The goals are to give teachers more time to spend one-on-one helping students,Weiss C and Blue C,,,1,341
384,A Scoping Review of Digital Gaming Research Involving Older Adults Aged 85 and Older,"Background: Interest in the use of digital game technologies by older adults is growing across disciplines from health and gerontology to computer science and game studies. The objective of this scoping review was to examine research evidence involving the oldest old (persons 85 years of age or greater) and digital game technology. Materials and Methods: PubMed, CINHAL, and Scopus were searched, and 46 articles were included in this review. Results: Results highlighted that 60 percent of articles were published in gerontological journals, whereas only 8.7 percent were published in computer science journals. No studies focused directly on the oldest old population. Few studies included sample sizes greater than 100 participants. Seven primary and 34 secondary themes were identified, of which Hardware Technology and Assessment were the most common. Conclusions: Existing evidence demonstrates the paucity of studies engaging older adults 85 years of age and above regarding the use of digital gaming and highlights a new understudied cohort for further research focus. Recommendations for future research include intentional recruitment and proportionate representation of participants 85 years of age, large sample sizes, and explicit mention of specific numbers of participants 85 years of age, which are necessary to advance knowledge in this area.

385,Online Training for Teachers Delivering Evidence-Based Preventive Interventions,"This study investigated the perceived feasibility and pattern of implementation following an online training for teachers delivering an integrated intervention encompassing two school-based universal preventive interventions: Promoting Alternative THinking Strategies (PATHS) curriculum and the PAX Good Behavior Game (GBG). Forty-five teachers from three urban elementary schools completed an online training consisting of didactics and video demonstration and received in-person coaching across a 31-week implementation period. Data from 65 teachers from three schools who received in-person training and coaching provided a benchmark for comparison. Most teachers in the online training + in-person coaching (OLT + IPC) condition reported that the technology was easy to use and that the course was as effective as an in-person workshop. Teachers in the OLT + IPC group reported positive attitudes regarding PATHS and the PAX GBG that generally were not significantly different from attitudes reported by teachers who received in-person training + in-person coaching (IPT + IPC). Importantly, teachers in the OLT + IPC condition achieved a high level of implementation quality similar to that demonstrated by teachers in the IPT + IPC condition. The frequency of intervention delivery by OLT + IPC teachers was also not significantly different than that of IPT + IPC teachers. These findings provide evidence that the internet is a promising component in a training sequence designed to teach teachers to deliver evidence-based preventive interventions.",Video Meta Results Raw,Becker KD and Bohnenkamp J and Domitrovich C and Keperling JP and Ialongo NS,,,0,343

387,Interventions to promote informed consent for patients undergoing surgical and other invasive healthcare procedures,"BACKGROUND: Achieving informed consent is a core clinical procedure and is required before any surgical or invasive procedure is undertaken. However, it is a complex process which requires patients be provided with information which they can understand and retain, opportunity to consider their options, and to be able to express their opinions and ask questions. There is evidence that at present some patients undergo procedures without informed consent being achieved. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects on patients, clinicians and the healthcare system of interventions to promote informed consent for patients undergoing surgical and other invasive healthcare treatments and procedures. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases using keywords and medical subject headings: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 5, 2012), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1950 to July 2011), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to July 2011) and PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to July 2011). We applied no language or date restrictions within the search. We also searched reference lists of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and cluster randomised trials of interventions to promote informed consent for patients undergoing surgical and other invasive healthcare procedures. We considered an intervention to be intended to promote informed consent when information delivery about the procedure was enhanced (either by providing more information or through, for example, using new written materials), or if more opportunity to consider or deliberate on the information was provided. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors assessed the search output independently to identify potentially-relevant studies, selected studies for inclusion, and extracted data. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the included trials, and meta-analyses of outcomes where there were sufficient data. MAIN RESULTS: We included 65 randomised controlled trials from 12 countries involving patients undergoing a variety of procedures in hospitals. Nine thousand and twenty one patients were randomised and entered into these studies. Interventions used various designs and formats but the main data for results were from studies using written materials, audio-visual materials and decision aids. Some interventions were delivered before admission to hospital for the procedure while others were delivered on admission.Only one study attempted to measure the primary outcome, which was informed consent as a unified concept, but this study was at high risk of bias. More commonly, studies measured secondary outcomes which were individual components of informed consent such as knowledge, anxiety, and satisfaction with the consent process. Important but less commonly-measured outcomes were deliberation, decisional conflict, uptake of procedures and length of consultation.Meta-analyses showed statistically-significant improvements in knowledge when measured immediately after interventions (SMD 0.53 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.69) I(2) 73%), shortly afterwards (between 24 hours and 14 days) (SMD 0.68 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.93) I(2) 85%) and at a later date (15 days or more) (SMD 0.78 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.06) I(2) 82%). Satisfaction with decision making was also increased (SMD 2.25 (95% CI 1.36 to 3.15) I(2) 99%) and decisional conflict was reduced (SMD -1.80 (95% CI -3.46 to -0.14) I(2) 99%). No statistically-significant differences were found for generalised anxiety (SMD -0.11 (95% CI -0.35 to 0.13) I(2) 82%), anxiety with the consent process (SMD 0.01 (95% CI -0.21 to 0.23) I(2) 70%) and satisfaction with the consent process (SMD 0.12 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.32) I(2) 76%). Consultation length was increased in those studies with continuous data (mean increase 1.66 minutes (95% CI 0.82 to 2.50) I(2) 0%) and in the one study with non-parametric data (control 8.0 minutes versus intervention 11.9 minutes, interquartile range (IQR) of 4 to 11.9 and 7.2 to 15.0 respectively). There were limited data for other outcomes.In general, sensitivity analyses removing studies at high risk of bias made little difference to the overall results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Informed consent is an important ethical and practical part of patient care. We have identified efforts by researchers to investigate interventions which seek to improve information delivery and consideration of information to enhance informed consent. The interventions used consistently improve patient knowledge, an important prerequisite for informed consent. This is encouraging and these measures could be widely employed although we are not able to say with confidence which types of interventions are preferable. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the high levels of heterogeneity associated with many of the main analyses although we believe there is broad evidence of beneficial outcomes for patients with the pragmatic application of interventions. Only one study attempted to measure informed consent as a unified concept.",Video Meta Results Raw,Kinnersley P and Phillips K and Savage K and Kelly MJ and Farrell E and Morgan B and Whistance R and Lewis V and Mann MK and Stephens BL and Blazeby J and Elwyn G and Edwards AG,,,0,345
388,Interventions to Improve Fraction Skills for Students With Disabilities: A Meta-Analysis,"Proficiency with fractions is one of the most significant predictors of later mathematics achievement. However, there are currently no meta-analyses that assess the literature base on fractions for students with or at risk for disabilities using quality indicators. We applied the 2014 Council for Exceptional Children Standards for Evidence-Based Practices in Special Education (CEC EBP) to 21 studies, both single-case and group designs, with instructionally based fraction interventions, published from 1986 to 2017. Ten of the included studies met all of the CEC EBP quality indicators, and effect sizes ranged from g = −0.26 to 11.51 across interventions. Publication bias was mixed but limited across the research base. Included studies examined the effects of anchored instruction, explicit instruction, graduated instruction, strategy instruction, and video modeling; explicit instruction was determined to be an evidence-based practice when applying the CEC EBP standards. We offer limitations and directions for future research in this area. © The Author(s) 2019.","REGULATED STRATEGY-DEVELOPMENT; SPECIAL-EDUCATION; SCHOOL-STUDENTS; MATH INSTRUCTION; RISK; BIAS; PERFORMANCE; LEARNERS; IMPACT; Education, Special; Rehabilitation; Education & Educational Research; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Ennis RP and Losinski M,,,0,346

390,Updates on Minimally Invasive Surgery in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"OPINION STATEMENT: Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become widely used since the 1990s and has become a standard treatment approach mainly for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. The few randomized controlled trials providing evidence of the effectiveness of VATS lobectomy at present are supported by a large number of propensity-matched studies, several high-quality meta-analyses, and outcome studies. These studies provide comprehensive data demonstrating the lower morbidity, shorter chest tube duration, and shorter hospital stay of VATS than thoracotomy during the postoperative course. Moreover, VATS shows equivalent oncological outcome as thoracotomy and therefore should be performed for lobectomy as much as possible. Importantly, VATS has recently been applied to advanced cases and previously contraindicated complex procedures such as bronchoplasty and chest wall resection. Attention has also been paid to reduced port surgery performed by frontier surgeons. Thus, the indications of VATS have seen a significant expansion. This major development logically negates any hesitation to change to the VATS technique as any doubt will likely constrain its wider applications. Preparation of scientific learning environments is necessary and should be actively pursued to adopt new skills instead of debating between the choice of \VATS or open.\''",Lung cancer; Minimally invasive surgery; Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS); ASSISTED THORACIC-SURGERY; PROPENSITY-MATCHED ANALYSIS; THORACOSCOPIC LOBECTOMY; VATS LOBECTOMY; THORACOTOMY; SEGMENTECTOMY; CARCINOMA; EFFICACY; Oncology; Oncology; Video Meta Results Raw,Ikeda N,,,0,348
391,Pain empathy in schizophrenia: an fMRI study,"Although it has been proposed that schizophrenia is characterized by impaired empathy, several recent studies found intact neural responses on tasks measuring the affective subdomain of empathy. This study further examined affective empathy in 21 schizophrenia outpatients and 21 healthy controls using a validated pain empathy paradigm with two components: (i) observing videos of people described as medical patients who were receiving a painful sound stimulation treatment; (ii) listening to the painful sounds (to create regions of interest). The observing videos component incorporated experimental manipulations of perspective taking (instructions to imagine 'Self' vs 'Other' experiencing pain) and cognitive appraisal (information about whether treatment was 'Effective' vs 'Not Effective'). When considering activation across experimental conditions, both groups showed similar dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI) activation while merely observing others in pain. However, there were group differences associated with perspective taking: controls showed relatively greater dACC and AI activation for the Self vs Other contrast whereas patients showed relatively greater activation in these and additional regions for the Other vs Self contrast. Although patients demonstrated grossly intact neural activity while observing others in pain, they showed more subtle abnormalities when required to toggle between imagining themselves vs others experiencing pain.",Video Meta Results Raw,Horan WP and Jimenez AM and Lee J and Wynn JK and Eisenberger NI and Green MF,,,0,349
392,Self-controlled technologies to support skill attainment in persons with an autism spectrum disorder and/or an intellectual disability: a systematic literature review,"Persons with an autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability have difficulties in processing information, which impedes the learning of daily living skills and cognitive concepts. Technological aids support learning, and if used temporarily and in a self-controlled manner, they may contribute to independent societal participation. This systematic review examines the studies that applied self-controlled technologies. The 28 relevant studies showed that skills and concepts are learned through prompting, interaction with devices, and practicing in (realistic) virtual environments. For attaining cognitive concepts, advanced technologies such as virtual reality are effective. Five studies focussed on cognitive concepts and two on emotion concepts. More research is necessary to examine the generalization of results and effect of using technology for learning cognitive and emotional concepts. Implications for Rehabilitation Persons with a moderate to mild intellectual disability and/or with autism can use self-controlled technology to learn new activities of daily living and cognitive concepts (e.g. time perception and imagination). Specific kinds of technologies can be used to learn specific kinds of skills (e.g. videos on computers or handheld devices for daily living skills; Virtual Reality for time perception and emotions of others). For learning new cognitive concepts it is advisable to use more advanced technologies as they have the potential to offer more features to support learning.",Autism spectrum disorder; difficulties processing information; intellectual disability; self-controlled technologies; Video Meta Results Raw,den Brok WL and Sterkenburg PS,,,0,350
393,Videogame interventions and spatial ability interactions,"Numerous research studies have been conducted on the use of videogames as tools to improve one’s cognitive abilities. While meta-analyses and qualitative reviews have provided evidence that some aspects of cognition such as spatial imagery are modified after exposure to videogames, other evidence has shown that matrix reasoning measures of fluid intelligence do not show evidence of transfer from videogame training. In the current work, we investigate the available evidence for transfer specifically to nonverbal intelligence and spatial ability measures, given recent research that these abilities may be most sensitive to training on cognitive and working memory tasks. Accordingly, we highlight a few studies that on the surface provide evidence for transfer to spatial abilities, but a closer look at the pattern of data does not reveal a clean interpretation of the results. We discuss the implications of these results in relation to research design and statistical analysis practices.

394,Changes in the self during cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety disorder: A systematic review,"consistent feature across cognitive-behavioural models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the central role of the self in the emergence and maintenance of the disorder. The strong emphasis placed on the self in these models and related empirical research has also been reflected in evidence-based treatments for the disorder. This systematic review provides an overview of the empirical literature investigating the role of self-related constructs (e.g., self-beliefs, self-images, self-focused attention) proposed in cognitive models of SAD, before examining how these constructs are modified during and following CBT for SAD. Forty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Guided by Stopa's (2009a, b) model of self, most studies examined change in self-related content, followed by change in self-related processing. No study examined change in self-structure. Pre-to post-treatment reductions were observed in self-related thoughts and beliefs, self-esteem, self-schema, self-focused attention, and self-evaluation. Change in self-related constructs predicted and/or mediated social anxiety reduction, however relatively few studies examined this. Papers were limited by small sample sizes, failure to control for depression symptoms, lack of waitlist, and some measurement concerns. Future research directions are discussed.

395,The malleability of spatial skills: a meta-analysis of training studies,"Having good spatial skills strongly predicts achievement and attainment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields (e.g., Shea, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2001; Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2009). Improving spatial skills is therefore of both theoretical and practical importance. To determine whether and to what extent training and experience can improve these skills, we meta-analyzed 217 research studies investigating the magnitude, moderators, durability, and generalizability of training on spatial skills. After eliminating outliers, the average effect size (Hedges's g) for training relative to control was 0.47 (SE = 0.04). Training effects were stable and were not affected by delays between training and posttesting. Training also transferred to other spatial tasks that were not directly trained. We analyzed the effects of several moderators, including the presence and type of control groups, sex, age, and type of training. Additionally, we included a theoretically motivated typology of spatial skills that emphasizes 2 dimensions: intrinsic versus extrinsic and static versus dynamic (Newcombe & Shipley, in press). Finally, we consider the potential educational and policy implications of directly training spatial skills. Considered together, the results suggest that spatially enriched education could pay substantial dividends in increasing participation in mathematics, science, and engineering.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Age Differences; Prediction; Control Groups; Generalization; Science Education; Transfer of Training; Graduate Students; Spatial Ability; Gender Differences; Engineering Education; Skill Development; Effect Size; Classification; Mathematics Education; Meta Analysis; Video Meta Results Raw",Uttal DH and Meadow NG and Tipton E and Hand LL and Alden AR and Warren C and Newcombe NS,,,0,353
396,Siblings' sex is linked to mental rotation performance in males but not females,"Research has consistently found sex differences in mental rotation. Twin research has suggested that females with male co-twins perform better than females with female co-twins on mental rotation. Because twins share both pre-natal and post-natal environments, it is not possible to test whether this advantage is due to in-uterine transmission of testosterone from males to females or due to socialisation processes. The present study explored whether the advantage of females with brothers can be observed in non-twin siblings. Participants (N = 1799) were assessed on mental rotation. The observed group differences were overall small: males performed significantly better than females; females with sisters performed similarly to females with brothers; importantly, males with brothers performed significantly better than both female groups. The results suggest that sex differences in mental rotation are driven by the group of males with brothers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

397,The influence of a learning to forgive programme on negative affect among mentally disordered offenders,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials and meta-analyses provide some evidence for effectiveness of forgiveness therapy delivered individually or in groups. To date, however, forgiveness therapy has not been evaluated with mentally disordered offenders. Given the high prevalence of experienced and perpetrated trauma among such people, this population may particularly benefit from such an intervention. AIM: The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and impact of a 'learn to forgive' group programme among mentally disordered offenders on a specialist secure hospital setting. METHODS: We conducted a non-randomised trial with 36 offenders with mental disorders and 29 comparison patients. The intervention group engaged in a six-week manual-based 'learn to forgive' treatment programme, while the comparison group watched a 90-minute video on forgiveness. Both groups completed measures of anger, depression, stress, forgiveness and satisfaction with life at baseline and then 6 and 18 weeks later. A repeated measures mixed-effects model was used to investigate the association between affective outcomes and type of intervention received, after adjusting for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: The group completion rate was over 90%. The treatment and comparison groups were similar on baseline demographic and criminological measures, but the treatment group had higher baseline anger and depression scores. While both groups showed improved capacity to forgive and reduced negative affect over time, those in the 'learn to forgive' programme showed significantly more improvement in forgiveness and on anger measures. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Forgiveness training can be delivered effectively to offenders with mental disorders in clinical settings. Its range of benefits, including reduction I in anger as well as improved capacity to forgive, suggest that it may have longer term implications for personal safety and reintegration into mainstream societal settings.

398,Laparoscopic radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy for left-sided pancreatic cancer using the ligament of Treitz approach,"Background Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (Lap-DP) for benign lesions or those with low malignant potential has been proven safe and effective, and its performance is now widespread [1-3]. Lap-DP for left-sided pancreatic cancer (PC) is also being increasingly performed. According to some reports, Lap-DP has superior short-term outcomes (blood loss, postoperative hospital stay) and comparable oncological outcomes and overall survival with those of open distal pancreatectomy (Op-DP) [4-6]. PC has highly malignant potential; thus, complete resection and sufficient regional lymphadenectomy with tumor-free margins are very important. Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS) is an accepted standard Op-DP technique for PC and is reportedly useful for achieving R0 resection and radical lymphadenectomy [7-10]. However, laparoscopic RAMPS (Lap-RAMPS) is not yet popular because of its technical difficulty and lack of adequate evidence. Few reports have described the detailed surgical technique of Lap-RAMPS [11-13]. We employ Lap-RAMPS using the ligament of Treitz approach with the benefit of a laparoscopic view and herein describe the usability of this laparoscopic procedure with a video. Methods Our indication for Lap-RAMPS is left-sided PC located >= 1 cm away from the origin of the splenic artery (SPA) without invasion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), celiac artery (CA), common hepatic artery (CHA), or portal vein (PV). We apply either anterior or posterior RAMPS to achieve tumor-free margins. Therefore, the left adrenal gland and the nerve plexus around the SMA and CA are resected depending on the extent of the cancer. Three patients underwent Lap-RAMPS for left-sided PC using the ligament of Treitz approach from April to December 2016. This video shows our Lap-RAMPS procedure performed in a 67-year-old man with pancreatic body cancer who was being followed up for autoimmune pancreatitis. The tumor was suspected to have invaded the SPA, splenic vein, and retroperitoneum but was not close to the SMA, CA, CHA, or PV. The patient was put in the supine position with his legs opened, and the operation was performed using five trocars. Early in the operation, we incised the retroperitoneum just beside the ligament of Treitz, and the inferior vena cava and left renal vein (LRV) were exposed with resection of Gerota's fascia under a good laparoscopic view. The left adrenal gland was resected in this case to obtain sufficient tumor-free margins. The origin of the SMA was easily identified above the LRV. The most posterior dissection was carried out early in the operation, making it easy and safe to determine the resected margin and enabling curative resection with sufficient regional lymphadenectomy. After division of the pancreas with a linear stapler, the lymph nodes around the SMA and CA were safely removed. Results The operative time was 358 min, and the estimated blood loss was 1 ml. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 10. Pathological examination revealed invasive ductal carcinoma (stage III, T3N1M0 according to the 7th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control system) with tumor-free margins. In all three patients, the median operative time and blood loss were 358 (328-451) min and minimal (minimal to 1 ml). One patient underwent anterior RAMPS and the other two patients, including the case mentioned above, underwent posterior RAMPS. One patient developed a grade B pancreatic fistula according to the International Study Group for Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) classification, but he recovered promptly with conservative treatment. No life-threatening complications occurred. The median postoperative hospital stay was 14 (10-16) days. Conclusions Lap-RAMPS using the ligament of Treitz approach is feasible and extremely helpful in performing minimally invasive, curative resection for well-selected left-sided PC.",Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy; Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy; RAMPS; Pancreatic cancer; OPEN DISTAL PANCREATECTOMY; DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA; BODY; METAANALYSIS; TAIL; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Ome Y and Hashida K and Yokota M and Nagahisa Y and Michio O and Kawamoto K,,,0,356
399,A review of research and a meta-analysis of the seductive detail effect,"Seductive details constitute interesting but irrelevant information that are not necessary to achieve the instructional objective. The seductive detail effect occurs when people learn more deeply from instructional messages that exclude rather than include these details. This effect is mainly explained by assuming an overloading of the working memory, attention distraction, schema interference or coherence disruption. This review presents 39 experimental effects in the form of text passages, illustrations and other kinds of seductive details. This meta-analysis reveals a significant seductive detail effect with small to medium (retention performance) and medium (transfer performance) effects. Furthermore, empirical evidence for moderating effects and various explanations of the seductive detail effect are reviewed. Empirical data supports, but also calls into question, each of the four explanations. The review concludes by discussing the theoretical and practical implications, as well as the limitations and future directions of this research. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Seductive detail; Coherence principle; Working memory; Attention distraction; Schema interference; Video Meta Results Raw; Unsorted; HETTE,Rey GD,,,1,357
400,"Vision-based motion detection, analysis and recognition of epileptic seizures--a systematic review","The analysis of human motion from video has been the object of interest for many application areas, these including surveillance, control, biomedical analysis, video annotation etc. This paper addresses the advances within this topic in relation to epilepsy, a domain where human motion is with no doubt one of the most important elements of a patient's clinical image. It describes recent achievements in vision-based detection, analysis and recognition of human motion in epilepsy for marker-based and marker-free systems. An overview of motion-characterizing features extracted so far is presented separately. The objective is to gain existing knowledge in this field and set the route marks for the future development of an integrated decision support system for epilepsy diagnosis and disease management based on automated video analysis. This review revealed that the quantification of motion patterns of selected epileptic seizures has been studied thoroughly while the recognition of seizures is currently in its beginnings, but however feasible. Moreover, only a limited set of seizure types have been analyzed so far, indicating that a holistic approach addressing all epileptic syndromes is still missing.",Video Meta Results Raw,Pediaditis M and Tsiknakis M and Leitgeb N,,,0,358

Sixty-three 2nd graders (mean age 7.83) and sixty 4th graders (mean age 9.82) were administered a 2-D animal and a 3-D cube mental rotation test, a mathematics ability test, together with a self report questionnaire devised to measure gender-stereotyped beliefs in both typical masculine, and feminine fields. Results indicated that boys scored higher than girls in mental rotation, but not in mathematics. They also highlighted that both sexes hold gender-stereotyped beliefs, and that mental rotation ability was significantly related with mathematics ability of fourth graders; however, there was no significant relationship with mathematics ability of second graders and mental rotation ability. The discussion focuses on sex differences in mental rotation, mathematics, gender-stereotyped beliefs and their relationships in childhood.","Mental rotation; Mathematics; Stereotypes; Sex; Primary school children; SEX-DIFFERENCES; SPATIAL ABILITY; TEST-PERFORMANCE; YOUNG-CHILDREN; 4TH GRADERS; MATH; THREAT; METAANALYSIS; ACHIEVEMENT; DIFFERENCE; Psychology, Educational; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Moe A,,,0,359
403,Debriefing after simulation-based non-technical skill training in healthcare: a systematic review of effective practice,"Non-technical skills training in healthcare frequently uses high-fidelity simulation followed by a facilitated discussion known as debriefing. This type of training is mandatory for anaesthesia training in Australia and New Zealand. Debriefing by a skilled facilitator is thought to be essential for new learning through feedback and reflective processes. Key elements of effective debriefing need to be clearly identified to ensure that the training is evidence-based. We undertook a systematic review of empirical studies where elements of debriefing have been systematically manipulated during non-technical skills training. Eight publications met the inclusion criteria, but seven of these were of limited generalisability. The only study that was generalisable found that debriefing by novice instructors using a script improved team leader performance in paediatric resuscitation. The remaining seven publications were limited by the small number of debriefers included in each study and these reports were thus analogous to case reports. Generally, performance improved after debriefing by a skilled facilitator. However, the debriefer provided no specific advantage over other post-experience educational interventions. Acknowledging their limitations, these studies found that performance improved after self-led debrief, no debrief (with experienced practitioners), standardised multimedia debrief or after reviewing a DVD of the participants' own eye-tracking. There was no added performance improvement when review of a video recording was added to facilitator-led debriefing. One study reported no performance improvement after debriefing. Without empirical evidence that is specific to the healthcare domain, theories of learning from education and psychology should continue to inform practices and teaching for effective debriefing.",after action review; debrief; education; feedback; simulation; Video Meta Results Raw,Garden AL and Le Fevre DM and Waddington HL and Weller JM,,,0,360
404,Therapeutic videoconferencing interventions for the treatment of long-term conditions,"We conducted a systematic review of literature relating to videoconferencing in therapeutic interventions for chronic conditions. Two hundred articles were reviewed in detail, 35 of which were relevant to the study. Of these, eight were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the remainder were service evaluations, pilot studies and case studies. Two major themes emerged, relating specifically to videoconferencing: clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. There were 14 studies which measured clinical outcomes of interventions for chronic conditions delivered by videoconferencing. A range of evidence, including four RCTs of high quality, indicates that interventions for a variety of conditions, including psychological and physical, delivered by videoconferencing produce similar outcomes to treatment delivered in-person. Evidence suggests that levels of patient satisfaction with telerehabilitation are high and that the formation of a good therapeutic alliance is possible. Several papers reported that clinical staff showed lower levels of satisfaction in using telerehabilitation than patients. It is feasible to use videoconferencing as a means of delivering therapeutic interventions for people with chronic conditions in rural communities.",Video Meta Results Raw,Steel K and Cox D and Garry H,,,0,361
405,Exergaming in older adults: a scoping review and implementation potential for patients with heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity can improve exercise capacity, quality of life and reduce mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure (HF). Adherence to exercise recommendations in patients with HF is low. The use of exercise games (exergames) might be a way to encourage patients with HF to exercise especially those who may be reluctant to more traditional forms of exercise. No studies have been conducted on patients with HF and exergames. AIM: This scoping review focuses on the feasibility and influence of exergames on physical activity in older adults, aiming to target certain characteristics that are important for patients with HF to become more physically active. METHODS: A literature search was undertaken in August 2012 in the databases PsychInfo, PUBMED, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL. Included studies evaluated the influence of exergaming on physical activity in older adults. Articles were excluded if they focused on rehabilitation of specific limbs, improving specific tasks or describing no intervention. Fifty articles were found, 11 were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Exergaming was described as safe and feasible, and resulted in more energy expenditure compared to rest. Participants experienced improved balance and reported improved cognitive function after exergaming. Participants enjoyed playing the exergames, their depressive symptoms decreased, and they reported improved quality of life and empowerment. Exergames made them feel more connected with their family members, especially their grandchildren. CONCLUSION: Although this research field is small and under development, exergaming might be promising in order to enhance physical activity in patients with HF.

406,Emotion regulation and well-being in primary classrooms situated in low-socioeconomic communities,"Background Although emotion is central to most models of children's well-being, few studies have looked at how well-being is related to the ways in which children regulate their emotions. Aims The aim of this study was to examine the associations among children's emotion regulation strategy choice and their emotional expression, behaviour, and well-being. The study also investigated whether contextual factors influenced the emotion regulation strategies children chose to use. Sample Participants (N = 33) were selected from four Year 5/6 composite classrooms situated in low-socioeconomic urban communities in New Zealand. Method Questionnaires were used to measure children's well-being and teacher-reported emotional and behavioural problems. Emotional expression and emotion regulation strategies were measured through video-recorded observations in the classroom. A total of 1,184 instances of emotion regulation strategy use were coded using a framework based on Gross' process model of emotion regulation. Results The findings highlight the complexity of the relations among emotion regulation, emotion expression, and well-being. Some strategies, such as Cognitive Reappraisal, were effective at upregulating negative emotion in the short term, yet not strongly associated with well-being. Others, such as Situation Modification: Physical, were positively associated with well-being, yet not with an immediate change in a child's emotional experience. The findings also suggest children flexibly use different strategies in relation to different contextual demands. Conclusion These findings may be used to guide future intervention efforts which target emotion regulation strategy use as well as those which focus on teachers' support of children during emotionally challenging situations.","child well-being; children from disadvantaged backgrounds; Emotion; emotion regulation; primary classrooms; self-regulation; video observations; SELF-REGULATION; COPING STRATEGIES; EFFORTFUL CONTROL; CHILDREN; METAANALYSIS; ADOLESCENTS; ACHIEVEMENT; ADJUSTMENT; ATTENTION; EXPOSURE; Psychology, Educational; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Somerville MP and Whitebread D,,,0,363
407,Treatment and assessment of neglect after stroke - From a physiotherapy perspective: A systematic review,"The aim of the review was to determine, from a physiotherapeutic perspective, existing tools that assess neglect and whether there was support for the positive effect of physiotherapeutic interventions on neglect after stroke. The review was based on publicized randomized controlled studies and reviews about neglect and stroke. The databases PubMed (Medline), Ahmed, Cinahl, PeDRO and PsycINFO were queried from 1980 until March 2007. A checklist from the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU) was used to evaluate the quality of randomized controlled studies; a model for analysis of systematic reviews from SBU was used for reviews. Specific training for the neglect syndrome was recommended. There was moderate evidence for spatio-motor cueing and scanning training towards the effected side. The literature also indicated that trunk rotation or repeated neck muscle vibrations when associated with an extensive training programme, mental imagery training, video feedback training and prism adaptation could be recommended for the rehabilitation of stroke patients with neglect. Treatment with Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) has shown some promising results. None of the tools designed to assess neglect evaluated physical performance. From a physiotherapeutic point of view, there is limited evidence for treatment of patients with neglect after stroke and the way neglect should be assessed. Scanning training and activation of the affected hemisphere with spatio-motor cueing can be effectual. Several assessment tools in combination are recommended. Further randomized controlled trials with larger samples concerning physiotherapeutic interventions are warranted, in order to evaluate new techniques targeting cognitive processes contributing to clinical manifestations of neglect.",Assessment tool; Hemi-inattention; Inattention; Neglect; Stroke; Systematic reviews; Treatment; Visual perception; association; cerebrovascular accident; CINAHL; clinical assessment tool; clinical trial; cognitive therapy; guided imagery; human; MEDLINE; movement therapy; neck muscle; neglect; physical performance; physiotherapy; PsycINFO; review; spatial discrimination; systematic review; Video Meta Results Raw,Vahlberg B and Hellstrom K,,,0,364
408,Pancreaticoduodenectomy for invasive pancreatic cancer,"Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the only treatment option that potentially provides a cure for pancreatic head cancer. Various arrangements and modifications have been proposed to achieve pathological margin negative (R0) resection safely. In this article, we introduce a standard procedure for PD, including pancreaticogastrostomy with invagination and mattress sutures (video clip provided), for invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreatic head, with a description of the need-to-know pitfalls for Board-certified HBP surgeons in Japan. The important points in performing PD for pancreatic cancer are: (1) While dissecting connective tissue and nerve plexus as well as lymph nodes, maintain a dissection plane to expose the surfaces of vessels or other organs to be preserved to achieve R0 resection: i.e., while dissecting the anterior surface of the inferior vena cava and the right side of the superior mesenteric artery, these vessels should be completely exposed with the connective tissue and nerve plexuses being attached to the resection side. (2) There should be early interruption of the afferent blood supply via the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery to reduce blood loss by avoiding congestion of the pancreatic head and to increase the operative safety (video clip provided). (3) Eligibility for PD should be carefully evaluated because there are many \resectable\' but not many \'curable\' cases. In addition",the clinical significance of various modifications of the surgical techniques used for PD are also discussed.',Takahashi H and Ohigashi H and Ishikawa O,,,0,365
409,Learning curves for cardiothoracic and vascular surgical procedures--a systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the learning curve (LC) literature and identify the LC of cardiothoracic and vascular surgical procedures. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND: The LC describes an observation that a learner's performance improves over time during acquisition of new motor skills. Measuring the LC of surgical procedures has important implications for surgical innovation, education, and patient safety. Numerous studies have investigated LCs of isolated operations in cardiothoracic and vascular surgeries, but a lack of uniformity in the methods and variables used to measure LCs has led to a lack of systematic reviews. METHODS: The MEDLINE®, EMBASE™, and PsycINFO® databases were systematically searched until July 2013. Articles describing LCs for cardiothoracic and vascular procedures were included. The type of procedure, statistical analysis, number of participants, procedure setting, level of participants, outcomes, and LCs were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies investigated LCs in cardiothoracic and vascular surgeries. Based on operating time, the LC for coronary artery bypass surgery ranged between 15 and 100 cases; for endoscopic vessel harvesting and other cardiac vessel surgery between 7 and 35 cases; for valvular surgery, which included repair and replacement, between 20 and 135 cases; for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, between 15 and 35 cases; for vascular neurosurgical procedures between 100 and 500 cases, based on complications; for endovascular vessel repairs between 5 and 40 cases; and for ablation procedures between 25 and 60 cases. However there was a distinct lack of standardization in the variables/outcome measures used, case selection, prior experience, and supervision of participating surgeons and a range of statistical analyses to compute LCs was noted. CONCLUSION: LCs in cardiothoracic and vascular procedures are hugely variable depending on the procedure type, outcome measures, level of prior experience, and methods/statistics used. Uniformity in methods, variables, and statistical analysis is needed to derive meaningful comparisons of LCs. Acknowledgment and application of learning processes other than those reliant on volume-outcomes relationship will benefit LC research and training of surgeons.",Assessment; learning curve; medical education; surgery; training; Video Meta Results Raw,Arora KS and Khan N and Abboudi H and Khan MS and Dasgupta P and Ahmed K,,,0,366
410,Smartphone adapters for flexible Nasolaryngoscopy: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Flexible nasolaryngoscopy is an essential component of the otolaryngological physical exam. Historically, the ability to create and share video recordings of these endoscopic exams has been limited by poor mobility of fixed endoscopy towers. The advent of smartphone endoscope adapters has allowed physicians to create and share video recordings of endoscopy in a wide variety of locations that would not have previously been feasible. This paper sought to review the literature on the effect of smartphone endoscope adapters on patient care, patient satisfaction, and resident learning. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. A systematic literature search was performed for all relevant English language studies (1946-2017) using Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE. The study protocol was registered with the PROSPERO database. RESULTS: A total of 91 abstracts were identified and screened by two independent reviewers. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, three studies were selected and subjected to full-text extraction as well as quality assessment. These studies demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and quality of smartphone adapter-recorded videos, and a benefit of these devices on resident education. Due to the heterogeneity of included studies' methods and measures, a meta-analysis was not possible, so a qualitative synthesis of the literature results was performed. CONCLUSION: Despite a paucity of data on the subject, the present study provided a comprehensive review of the literature, and suggested overall high diagnostic accuracy, quality, and enhancement of resident education with the use of smartphone endoscope adapters for flexible nasolaryngoscopy.

411,Conversation therapy for agrammatism: Exploring the therapeutic process of engagement and learning by a person with aphasia,"Background & Aims: A recent systematic review of conversation training for communication partners of people with aphasia has shown that it is effective, and improves participation in conversation for people with chronic aphasia. Other research suggests that people with aphasia are better able to learn communication strategies in an environment which closely mirrors that of expected use, and that cognitive flexibility may be a better predictor of response to therapy than severity of language impairment. This study reports results for a single case, one of a case series evaluation of a programme of conversation training for agrammatism that directly involves a person with aphasia (PWA) as well as their communication partner. It explores how a PWA is able to engage with and learn from the therapy, and whether this leads to qualitative change in post-therapy conversation behaviours. Methods & Procedures: A 55-year-old man with chronic agrammatism and his wife took part in eight weekly sessions of conversation therapy, adapted from Supporting Partners of People With Aphasia in Relationships and Conversation (SPPARC). Language and conversation were assessed before and after therapy, and the couple’s views on conversation and disability were elicited. Conversation analysis was used to analyse: (1) pre-therapy conversation patterns, (2) how the PWA engaged and learned during therapy and the forms of facilitation that aided this process, and (3) qualitative change in post-therapy conversation behaviour. Outcomes & Results: After therapy, the PWA showed increased insight and acceptance of the use of strategies such as writing and drawing in the face of conversational difficulty. However, use was prompted by his wife and was rarely spontaneous. Conclusions & Implications: This single case study suggests that conversation training based around an experiential learning process is able to engage a PWA directly in learning about the effects of aphasia on conversation. Key facilitators were self-study via video and experience of practising conversation whilst receiving online feedback from a speech and language therapist. However, increased insight did not automatically change conversation behaviour. Although he better understood the effects of his aphasia on conversations with his wife, learning stopped short of the ultimate goal of the conversation training programme; the spontaneous use of strategies worked on in therapy when faced with conversation breakdown. One explanation may be that limited cognitive flexibility lead to problems with switching from one strategy to another.

412,Gamification for health promotion: systematic review of behaviour change techniques in smartphone apps,"OBJECTIVE: Smartphone games that aim to alter health behaviours are common, but there is uncertainty about how to achieve this. We systematically reviewed health apps containing gaming elements analysing their embedded behaviour change techniques. METHODS: Two trained researchers independently coded apps for behaviour change techniques using a standard taxonomy. We explored associations with user ratings and price. DATA SOURCES: We screened the National Health Service (NHS) Health Apps Library and all top-rated medical, health and wellness and health and fitness apps (defined by Apple and Google Play stores based on revenue and downloads). We included free and paid English language apps using 'gamification' (rewards, prizes, avatars, badges, leaderboards, competitions, levelling-up or health-related challenges). We excluded apps targeting health professionals. RESULTS: 64 of 1680 (4%) health apps included gamification and met inclusion criteria; only 3 of these were in the NHS Library. Behaviour change categories used were: feedback and monitoring (n=60, 94% of apps), reward and threat (n=52, 81%), and goals and planning (n=52, 81%). Individual techniques were: self-monitoring of behaviour (n=55, 86%), non-specific reward (n=49, 82%), social support unspecified (n=48, 75%), non-specific incentive (n=49, 82%) and focus on past success (n=47, 73%). Median number of techniques per app was 14 (range: 5-22). Common combinations were: goal setting, self-monitoring, non-specific reward and non-specific incentive (n=35, 55%); goal setting, self-monitoring and focus on past success (n=33, 52%). There was no correlation between number of techniques and user ratings (p=0.07; rs=0.23) or price (p=0.45; rs=0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Few health apps currently employ gamification and there is a wide variation in the use of behaviour change techniques, which may limit potential to improve health outcomes. We found no correlation between user rating (a possible proxy for health benefits) and game content or price. Further research is required to evaluate effective behaviour change techniques and to assess clinical outcomes.

413,"College students' attitudes toward chemistry, conceptual knowledge and achievement: structural equation model analysis","Students' success in introductory college-level chemistry courses is important for them to continue to more advanced science courses and to progress toward science-related careers. Previous studies indicate that both cognitive and non-cognitive variables are relevant for student success. In this study, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to predict students' achievement in chemistry from both cognitive (math ability, prior conceptual knowledge in chemistry) and non-cognitive (attitude toward chemistry) measures. The purpose of this study is to investigate which of three alternative SEM models best represents the relationships among these variables and achievement in chemistry, and what proportion of variance in chemistry achievement can be explained. Results provide support for using a SEM model with all three predictors, with 69% of the variance in chemistry achievement explained. Both prior conceptual knowledge and attitude toward chemistry contribute a significant unique portion to the prediction of chemistry achievement when controlling for math ability. The results suggest that instructors can improve students' achievement in chemistry not only by focusing on helping them to build conceptual knowledge, but also by fostering their positive attitude toward chemistry. This study also has implications for SEM researchers, both to further replicate the study in other contexts, and to add other potentially relevant predictors. Instrument developers may also use the modeling strategy as a springboard for optimizing assessment tools.",Video Meta Results Raw,Xu X and Villafane SM and Lewis JE,,,0,370
414,Oral & Maxillofacial surgery is ready for patient-centred eHealth interventions - the outcomes of a scoping review,"Within the field of oral and maxillofacial (OMF) surgery, eHealth is expected to be a tool to improve quality of care. The aim of this study is to map the research of patient-centred eHealth interventions within OMF surgery by means of a scoping review. After a systematic literature search, relevant studies on patient-centred eHealth interventions for OMF-surgery patients were selected. The interventions were mapped based on their key components, target population and outcome measures. To gain insight in the research phase of evaluation, the framework of the Medical Research Council (MRC) was used. Forty-one papers were included, comprising 34 unique interventions. Nineteen interventions were designed for head and neck cancer patients, 11 interventions concernd video-teleconsultation. According to the MRC framework, 26 papers fitted into the feasibility and piloting phase of research, 8 into the evaluation phase, 7 were in the development phase. No implementation studies were found. This scoping review can be a starting point for those who are interested in applying and evaluating eHealth in their practice. Since many feasibility and pilot studies were found on similar interventions, a more extensive collaboration with and connecting to each other is recommended to catalyze the implementation of eHealth in daily practice. Profound involvement of patients in developing and evaluating eHealth interventions is essential to achieve true patient-centred OMF surgery.","eHealth; internet; patient-centred care; oral & maxillofacial; NECK-CANCER PATIENTS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; TELEMEDICINE SYSTEM; INFORMATION-SYSTEM; MOBILE APPLICATION; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; FOLLOW-UP; E-MAIL; HEAD; Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Surgery; Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw",van den Bosch SC and van de Voort NE and Xi T and Kool RB and Bergé SJ and Faber MJ,,,0,371
415,Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Group Support Decrease Stress in Adolescents with Cardiac Diagnoses: A Randomized Two-Group Study,"Adolescents with cardiac diagnoses face unique challenges that can cause psychosocial distress. This study compares a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program to a video online support group for adolescents with cardiac diagnoses. MBSR is a structured psycho-educational program which includes yoga, meditation, cognitive restructuring, and group support. A published feasibility study by our group showed significant reduction in anxiety following this intervention. Participants were randomized to MBSR or video online support group, and completed measures of anxiety, depression, illness-related stress, and coping pre- and post-6-session interventions. Qualitative data were obtained from post-intervention interviews. A total of 46 teens participated (mean 14.8 years; 63% female). Participants had congenital heart disease and/or cardiac device (52%), or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (48%). Illness-related stress significantly decreased in both groups. Greater use of coping skills predicted lower levels of depression in both groups post-study completion. Higher baseline anxiety/depression scores predicted improved anxiety/depression scores in both groups. Each group reported the benefits of social support. The MBSR group further expressed benefits of learning specific techniques, strategies, and skills that they applied in real-life situations to relieve distress. Both the MBSR intervention and video support group were effective in reducing distress in this sample. Qualitative data elucidated the added benefits of using MBSR techniques to manage stress and symptoms. The video group format is useful for teens that cannot meet in person but can benefit from group support. Psychosocial interventions with stress management techniques and/or group support can reduce distress in adolescents with cardiac diagnoses.",Adolescent; Cardiac; Psychosocial; Intervention; Mindfulness; CONGENITAL HEART-DISEASE; IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATORS; HOSPITAL ANXIETY; DEPRESSION SCALE; OF-LIFE; PREVALENCE; METAANALYSIS; PREDICTORS; RESPONSES; AGE; Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Pediatrics; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Pediatrics; Video Meta Results Raw,Freedenberg VA and Hinds PS and Friedmann E,,,0,372

Implementation of integrated programs which could manage the whole process of patient treatment including preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative care is thought to be essential partner for successful application of minimally invasive thoracic surgery for lung cancer treatment. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), so called \fast-track\' programs pursue the adequate and efficient delivery of health care services therefore to improve postoperative outcomes and reduce medical cost.

Increasing task interdependence in cooperative educational videogames to encourage collaboration,"Complex, multimedia software such as educational videogames offer a wide range of elements to modify learner behavior. The adjustment of such software might support learning, especially in complex settings like collaborative or cooperative scenarios. Coming from a theoretical background of educational psychology, our experiment seeks to implement the \jigsaw strategy\' within educational videogames. We conducted an experiment with sixty participants to compare conditions with or without increased task interdependence through the jigsaw strategy (i.e.",the distribution of game elements and essential information).

Four cohorts of medical students (N = 723) were followed from admission to employment. Procedural knowledge about interpersonal behavior at the time of admission was valid for both internship performance (7 years later) and job performance (9 years later) and showed incremental validity over cognitive factors. Mediation analyses supported the conceptual link between procedural knowledge about interpersonal behavior, translating that knowledge into actual interpersonal behavior in internships, and showing that behavior on the job.

420,Systematising the field of mobile assisted language learning,"This study provides a systematic review of mobile assisted language (MALL) research within the specifc area of second language acquisition (SLA) during the period of 2005-2012 in terms of research approaches, theories and methods, technology, and the linguistic knowledge and skills' results. The fndings show a shift from the prevailing SMS-based language learning in 2005-2008 towards the use of more advanced multimedia and intelligent learning systems in the last years. Many highly cited studies focus on design of mobile language learning systems and experimental evaluation of their effectiveness. Studies often draw on mature pedagogic models and methods. However, descriptive and small-scale experimental studies dominate. In terms of theoretical approaches and frameworks, there is a lack of specifc reference to mobile learning conceptual and theoretical models, which makes it diffcult to distinguish any specifc mobile learning theories from other learning theories.

423,Atypical Reward-Driven Modulation of Mimicry-Related Neural Activity in Autism,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social functioning and difficulties in forming social bonds. According to the social motivation theory of ASD, people with ASD fail to attend social stimuli because they do not experience them as rewarding, resulting in deficits in social cognition. In neurotypical (NT) individuals, more rewarding faces have been shown to elicit greater spontaneous facial mimicry. This association between reward and mimicry is reduced in people with high autistic traits, suggesting that altered reward processing might explain the deficits in spontaneous facial mimicry observed in individuals with ASD. In a previous study, we observed that learned reward value of a face modulates mimicry-related neural response to it and that this modulation is reduced in people with high autistic traits. Using an identical evaluative conditioning paradigm where neutral faces were conditioned with high and low rewards, we tested the modulating effect of reward value on mimicry-related brain activity in a group of adults with and without ASD. We focused on the activity in a cluster within the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) identified through an independent meta-analysis of 139 neuroimaging studies of mimicry, in response to passively viewing videos of the conditioned faces. The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response contrast of high- vs. low-reward faces was reduced in participants with ASD compared to NT controls. The extent of reward-driven modulation was negatively correlated with autistic traits across the whole sample. Our results indicate that the mimicry-related brain response is less modulated by learned reward value in individuals with ASD when compared to NT controls. In previous studies, we found in a similar sample that being mimicked by faces was associated with less reward-related brain response in individuals ASD compared to an NT sample, suggesting that the link between reward and mimicry is affected in both directions in ASD. Together, this reduced bidirectional link between reward and mimicry can point to a potential mechanism underlying some of the social cognitive features of ASD.",autism; reward; mimicry; mirror system; fMRI; inferior frontal gyrus; social; conditioning; HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; FACIAL MIMICRY; MECHANISMS; IMITATION; FMRI; FACE; RECOGNITION; EXPRESSIONS; EMPATHY; IMPACT; Psychiatry; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Neufeld J and Hsu CT and Chakrabarti B,,,0,379

428,Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus open thoracotomy in pulmonary metastasectomy: a meta-analysis of observational studies,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary metastasectomy via a traditional open thoracotomy is effective for the treatment of patients with pulmonary metastases. However, whether video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) achieves similar clinical effects in terms of survival rates remains unclear. We conducted this meta-analytic study to compare VATS with open thoracotomy for pulmonary metastasectomy. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed from inception to December 2014. The overall and recurrence-free survival rates were measured in terms of hazard ratios (HRs) with VATS and open thoracotomy as the main outcomes. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in our meta-analysis, which included 337 patients in the VATS group and 485 patients in the open thoracotomy group. The overall survival rate in the VATS group was statistically significantly higher than that in the open thoracotomy group [HR, 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55-0.87; P = 0.002]. The VATS group still had a higher overall survival rate after exclusion of the one low-quality study (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59-1.03), but the result was not statistically significant (P = 0.075). No difference in the recurrence-free survival rate was found between the two groups (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69-1.08). The subgroup analysis showed no difference between the two groups in either the overall survival rate (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-1.04) or the recurrence-free survival rate (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.59-1.08) in patients with metastases from colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: VATS is an alternative surgical approach for pulmonary metastasectomy in patients with resectable pulmonary metastases. Further large prospective studies are needed to identify the indications for VATS in patients with pulmonary metastases.",Pulmonary metastasis; Survival; Thoracotomy; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Meng D and Fu L and Wang L and Dai Y and Lv W and Zhang J and Hu J,,,0,382
429,Effect of availability of video laryngoscopy on the use of fiberoptic intubation in school-aged children with microtia,"BackgroundWith the increasing popularity of video laryngoscopy during intubation of pediatric patients with normal or difficult airways, fiberoptic-assisted tracheal intubation, traditionally considered the gold standard for difficult intubation, may become underused. AimWe aimed to assess the use of airway management techniques before and after introduction of video laryngoscopy in a cohort of school-aged children with microtia, who are at increased risk of difficult intubation. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed intubation devices used for all pediatric patients with microtia who had undergone reconstructive ear surgery at a single institution during the period January 2008 to December 2012. In each case, we identified the original airway management technique and success rate, as well as success rate for subsequent rescue techniques. The use of fiberoptic-assisted tracheal intubation was compared before and after introduction of a pediatric blade for the Pentax-AWS video laryngoscope. ResultsThis study included 537 consecutive intubation procedures; 264 before and 273 after introduction of the pediatric airway scope. Elective use of fiberoptic-assisted tracheal intubation for anticipated difficult intubation was significantly less after introduction of the pediatric airway scope (before: 19 of 79, 24% vs after: 3 of 79, 4%; odds ratio 8.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.27 to 28.39; P=.0003), which achieved a 100% success rate when used as the primary technique in both routine and difficult airways. All 5 cases of failed direct laryngoscopy were rescued by the pediatric airway scope, thus eliminating emergency use of fiberscopy. ConclusionIntroduction of a pediatric video laryngoscope resulted in a substantial decrease in the use of fiberoptic-assisted tracheal intubation. This change in intubation method might not influence the success rate of intubation in experienced hands but could be relevant for novice users.",airway management; congenital microtia; intubation; laryngoscopy; pediatrics; METAANALYSIS; AIRWAY; Anesthesiology; Pediatrics; Anesthesiology; Pediatrics; Video Meta Results Raw,Kondo I and Kobayashi H and Suga Y and Suzuki A and Kiyama S and Uezono S,,,0,383
430,Informant-related effects of neurofeedback and cognitive training in children with ADHD including a waiting control phase: a randomized-controlled trial,"There is controversy regarding the clinical efficacy of neurofeedback (NF) and computerized cognitive training (CogT) as treatments for ADHD. Meta-analyses claim that probably blinded teachers observe smaller effects than parents, because they are less biased. We investigated informant-specific effects by manipulating the involvement of informants, by controlling for waiting time effects, and by adding a blinded outcome measure. Seventy-seven children with ADHD were randomly allocated to slow cortical potential NF or to individualized CogT (of attention, working memory or inhibition). The training was conducted in schools (NF: n = 19, CogT: n = 19) or in outpatient clinics (NF: n = 19, CogT: n = 20). Three assessments were scheduled: baseline, followed by a waiting period, pre-training, and post-training. Multivariate Analyses of Variance were conducted to assess parent- and teacher-rated changes in ADHD symptoms and executive functions (EF), and changes according to standardized classroom observations. Both treatments resulted in significant improvements according to informants, with larger effects for parents (ADHD symptoms: parent η p2 = .32; teacher η p2 = .10), and according to observations (η p2 = .19). The setting had no effect on outcome. Considerable waiting time effects were revealed for ADHD symptom ratings by both informants, for EF ratings only by teachers. Changed classroom behavior was uncorrelated with teacher-rated changes. Overall, the results do not support the notion that teachers are more objective while being as sensitive to change as parents. The three sources seem to contribute differential and mostly unrelated pieces of information to the evaluation of treatments.","ADHD; Informant discrepancy; Neurofeedback; PC-supported cognitive training; Blinding; Randomizedcontrolled trial; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES; WORKING-MEMORY; PARENT; SYMPTOMS; TEACHER; RATINGS; METHYLPHENIDATE; METAANALYSIS; Psychology, Developmental; Pediatrics; Psychiatry; Psychology; Pediatrics; Psychiatry; Randomized-controlled trial; Video Meta Results Raw",Minder F and Zuberer A and Brandeis D and Drechsler R,,,0,384
431,When We Should Worry More: Using Cognitive Bias Modification to Drive Adaptive Health Behaviour,"A lack of behavioural engagement in health promotion or disease prevention is a problem across many health domains. In these cases where people face a genuine danger, a reduced focus on threat and low levels of anxiety or worry are maladaptive in terms of promoting protection or prevention behaviour. Therefore, it is possible that increasing the processing of threat will increase worry and thereby enhance engagement in adaptive behaviour. Laboratory studies have shown that cognitive bias modification (CBM) can increase or decrease anxiety and worry when increased versus decreased processing of threat is encouraged. In the current study, CBM for interpretation (CBM-I) is used to target engagement in sun protection behaviour. The goal was to investigate whether inducing a negative rather than a positive interpretation bias for physical threat information can enhance worry elicited when viewing a health campaign video (warning against melanoma skin cancer), and consequently lead to more adaptive behaviour (sun protection). Participants were successfully trained to either adopt a positive or negative interpretation bias using physical threat scenarios. However, contrary to expectations results showed that participants in the positive training condition reported higher levels of worry elicited by the melanoma video than participants in the negative training condition. Video elicited worry was, however, positively correlated with a measure of engagement in sun protection behaviour, suggesting that higher levels of worry do promote adaptive behaviour. These findings imply that more research is needed to determine under which conditions increased versus decreased processing of threat can drive adaptive worry. Various potential explanations for the current findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Notebaert L and Chrystal J and Clarke PJ and Holmes EA and MacLeod C,,,0,385

An updated meta-analysis reveals that exposure to violent video games is significantly linked to increases in aggressive behaviour, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, and cardiovascular arousal, and to decreases in helping behaviour. Experimental studies reveal this linkage to be causal. Correlational studies reveal a linkage to serious, real-world types of aggression. Methodologically weaker studies yielded smaller effect sizes than methodologically stronger studies, suggesting that previous meta-analytic studies of violent video games underestimate the true magnitude of observed deleterious effects on behaviour, cognition, and affect.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Cognitive Processes; Correlation; Violence; Influences; Aggression; Video Games; Meta Analysis; Affective Behavior; Video Meta Results Raw",Anderson CA,,,0,386
433,Using Video Tutorials to Learn Maya 3D for Creative Outcomes: A Case Study in Increasing Student Satisfaction by Reducing Cognitive Load,"This study tracked the transition from traditional front-of-class software demonstration of Autodesk's Maya 3D to the introduction of video tutorials over a five-year period. It uses Mayer and Moreno's (2003) theory of multimedia learning to frame the analysis of results. It found that students' preference for the video tutorial increased over the course of the study. Students' preference for video tutorials was correlated with a reduction in cognitive load, increase in satisfaction with the learning experience and subsequent reduction in frustration with the software. While there was no apparent change in measurable outcomes, students' satisfaction rating with the video tutorial in preference to other learning media suggests more efficient learning was achieved. As a consequence of the findings, the traditional demonstration was discontinued. Overall, the introduction of video tutorials for learning Maya 3D reduced frustration and freed up time for more creative pursuits - the primary purpose for learning the software.",Video Meta Results Raw,Wyeld T,,,0,387
434,"Knowledge of Nonverbal Cues, Gender, and Nonverbal Decoding Accuracy","The Test of Nonverbal Cue Knowledge (TONCK), a paper and pencil test measuring explicit knowledge of nonverbal cue meanings and uses, was developed and found to be reliable and to have predictive ability. In four studies, participants were given the TONCK and one or more tests of accuracy in decoding nonverbal cues: the adult faces and voices tests of the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy 2 (DANVA) and the video and audio tests of the Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity (PONS), as well as a test of general cognitive ability (the Wonderlic Personnel Test). Results are reported for the four studies individually and also in a meta-analytic summary. Females scored higher than males on the TONCK and on the PONS, and the TONCK predicted accuracy on the PONS and DANVA. Knowledge of nonverbal cues did not account for the gender difference in decoding ability on the PONS. Cognitive ability was related to the TONCK but did not compromise relations with other variables.

C. Nash's (1979) hypothesis that individuals will perform better on cognitive tasks when their self-concepts match the gender stereotyping of the tasks. Meta-analytic techniques were used to estimate the average effect sizes and to determine the significance of the combined probabilities. The influence of Ss' sex and age, date of study, type of spatial task, and type of self-concept measure on these associations was also examined. In general, the results from spatial and mathematical tasks, which are usually stereotyped as masculine, support Nash's hypothesis. Higher masculine and lower feminine self-concept scores were associated with better performance. These relations were observed more consistently for females than for males. There was some evidence of better spatial and mathematical performance among adolescent boys who described themselves as feminine. Nash's hypothesis was not supported for verbal tasks. There was no evidence that androgyny, defined either as high masculine and high feminine scores or as a balance between masculine and feminine scores, is associated with better cognitive performance.

439,Moderators in psychotherapy meta-analysis,"Psychotherapy meta-analyses sometimes generate heterogeneous results, partially due to key methodological characteristics which vary between studies (e.g., psychotherapy conditions are contrasted with structurally different control conditions). Examining these potential moderator variables can help explain heterogeneous results within and between psychotherapy meta-analyses. The present manuscript provides an overview of moderators that are highly relevant to test the generalizability of effects across psychotherapy trials. These moderators mainly fall into one of the following groups: (a) structural equivalence of interventions, (b) preferences/allegiances, (c) therapist effects, and (d) sample representativeness. Individual moderators include: Bona fide psychotherapy, proximity to psychological interventions, psychotherapy orientation, pre-training of therapists, supervision, caseload of therapists, dosage, homework, patient preferences, researcher and therapist allegiance, therapist effects in nested designs, aspects of sample representativeness, multiple outcomes, and time of assessment. Our analysis of 15 psychotherapy meta-analyses published in 2016 suggests that the structural equivalence of psychotherapeutic conditions, patient and therapist preferences/allegiances, therapist effects and nested data structures as well as sample representativeness were often neglected and little-discussed as potential moderators. The manuscript describes further conceptual and methodological challenges when conducting moderator analyses such as the categorization of psychological treatments and the importance of interrater coding. We encourage meta-analysts to consider moderators which have previously shown utility in explaining heterogeneous results in the psychotherapy literature. Clinical or methodological significance of this article: Relevant moderator variables help explain heterogeneous results in psychotherapy meta-analyses. Though these variables are often overlooked, they should be regularly incorporated in meta-analyses.","cognitive behavior therapy; culture and psychotherapy; experiential; existential; humanistic psychotherapy; outcome research; process research; psychoanalytic; psychodynamic therapy; psychotherapist training; supervision; development; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIALS; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; USUAL CLINICAL CARE; PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS; LONGITUDINAL METAANALYSIS; YOUTH PSYCHOTHERAPIES; META-REGRESSION; OLDER-ADULTS; Psychology, Clinical; Psychology; experiential/existential/humanistic psychotherapy; psychoanalytic/psychodynamic therapy; psychotherapist training/supervision/development; Video Meta Results Raw",Spielmans GI and Flückiger C,,,0,391
441,"What tests and measures should be added to the SCAT3 and related tests to improve their reliability, sensitivity and/or specificity in sideline concussion diagnosis? A systematic review","OBJECTIVES: Several iterations of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) have been published over the past 16 years. Our goal was to systematically review the literature related to the SCAT and provide recommendations for improving the tool. To achieve this goal, five separate but related searches were conducted and presented herein. DESIGN: Systematic literature review. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SPORTDiscus and PubMed. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original, empirical, peer-reviewed findings published in English and included sports-related concussion (SRC). Review papers, case studies, editorials and conference proceedings/abstracts were excluded. The age range for the ChildSCAT was 5-12 years and for the Adult SCAT was 13 years and above. RESULTS: Out of 2961 articles screened, a total of 96 articles were included across the five searches. Searches were not mutually exclusive. The final number of articles included in the qualitative synthesis for each search was 21 on Adult SCAT, 32 on ChildSCAT, 21 on sideline, 8 on video/observation and 14 on oculomotor. SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS: The SCAT is the most widely accepted and deployable sport concussion assessment and screening tool currently available. There is some degree of support for using the SCAT2/SCAT3 and ChildSCAT3 in the evaluation of SRC, with and without baseline data. The addition of an oculomotor examination seems indicated, although the most valid method for assessing oculomotor function is not clear.

443,Looking in the Heads of Experienced Teachers Do They Use the Wide Range of Principles of Effective Teaching when Analysing Lessons?,"This study aimed to examine whether principles of effective teaching constitute essential criteria for a systematic and successful analysis of lessons. After watching a video of a complete lesson, the participants (each of nine experienced and pre-service teachers) were asked to analyse this lesson in terms of effectiveness for pupils' learning in the form of an open dialogue. Their comments were analysed by means of a qualitative content analysis and revealed that the experienced teachers independently used the wide range of principles of effective teaching and differed significantly from the pre-service teachers in this regard. Particularly striking were the large differences in the activation of knowledge about these five principles: goal orientation, relating cognitive activities to prior knowledge, classroom climate/learning atmosphere, clarity, and using appropriate examples. These differences point to specific development tasks, in order to improve the analytical skills of student teachers within teacher education.",VIDEO; METAANALYSIS; ABILITY; SKILLS; LEARN; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Ploeger W and Krepf M and Scholl D and Seifert A,,,0,394
444,Factors associated with telemonitoring use among patients with chronic heart failure,"Background: In adults with chronic heart failure (HF; defined as people with previously diagnosed left ventricular dysfunction) telemonitoring randomized controlled trials (RCTs) failed to consistently demonstrate improved clinical outcomes. We aimed to examine if patient and HF characteristics are associated with device preferences and use. Methods: Using a cross-sectional, multicenter, international design, ambulatory and hospitalized adults with HF in Ohio, California, and Denmark viewed a six-minute video of telemonitoring configurations (tablet, smart phone, and key fob) and completed questionnaires. Comparative analyses were performed and when significant, pairwise comparisons were performed using Bonferroni-adjusted significance levels. Results: Of 206 participants, 48.2% preferred smart phones for telemonitoring, especially when traveling (54.8%), with new/ worsening symptoms (50%), for everyday use (50%), and connecting with doctors (48.5%). Participants preferred two-way communication and a screen with words over voice or number pads. Of device purposes, allowing for nurse communication ranked highest, followed by maintaining overall health. Very few patient and HF factors were associated with device preferences. Patients with higher health literacy (p = 0.007), previous/current device use history (p = 0.008), higher education level (p = 0.035), and married/cohabitating status (p = 0.023) had higher perceptions of ease of using devices. Those who were asymptomatic or had mild HF had higher self-confidence for health devices (p = 0.024) and non-white patients perceived devices as more useful (p = 0.033). Conclusion: Telemonitoring use may be enhanced by simple plug-and-play type devices, two-way communication, and features that meet patients' personal learning and use needs.",Remote monitoring; mobile health; smart phones; telehealth apps; heart failure; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SELF-CARE; HEALTH; VALIDITY; OUTCOMES; HOSPITALIZATIONS; METAANALYSIS; TELEHEALTH; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Albert NM and Dinesen B and Spindler H and Southard J and Bena JF and Catz S and Kim TY and Nielsen G and Tong K and Nesbitt TS,,,0,395
445,Interventions to improve patient education regarding multifactorial genetic conditions: a systematic review,"The careful education of patients with complex genetic disease is essential. However, healthcare providers often have limited time to spend providing thorough genetic education. Furthermore, the number of healthcare professionals possessing strong genetics training may be inadequate to meet increasing patient demands. Due to such constraints, several interventions have been investigated over the past decade to identify potential resources for the facilitation of this specific type of patient education. This systematic literature review of these interventions for patient education attempts to elucidate the answer to the question: is there sufficient evidence for best practice for delivering genetic information to patients with multifactorial conditions? The various interventions (CD-ROM, group counseling, video/decision aid, and miscellaneous) were analyzed in terms of quality criteria and achievement of specific outcomes and were rated according to the Stetler model for evidence-based practice. Seven main outcomes were evaluated: (1) objective and subjective knowledge assessment, (2) psychological measures (general anxiety, depression, stress, cancer worry), (3) satisfaction/effectiveness of intervention, (4) time spent in counseling (time spent on basic genetic information vs. specific concerns), (5) decision-making/intent to undergo genetic testing, (6) treatment choice and value of that choice, and, finally (7) risk perception. Overall, the computer interventions resulted in more significant findings that were beneficial than any other category followed by the video category, although the group and miscellaneous categories did not measure all of the outcomes reported by the other two categories. Nevertheless, while these groups had neutral or negative findings in some of the outcomes, the computer intervention group showed significant improvement in genetics knowledge, psychological measures, satisfaction/effectiveness, time spent with counselor, and decision/intent to undergo testing.",Video Meta Results Raw,Meilleur KG and Littleton-Kearney MT,,,1,396
446,Training Cesarean Section: A Scoping Review,"STATEMENT: This study is a scoping review that reviews the existing literature on educational strategies in training of cesarean section. A systematic search was carried out in relevant databases, identifying 28 studies for inclusion. Thematic analysis revealed the following training strategies: simulation-based training (team training, in situ training, technical training), simulators (low-fidelity simulators, high-fidelity simulators), clinical training, e-learning or videos, classroom-based learning (lectures, small groups), and assessment (assessment programs/interventions, assessment of learners). Simulation-based training provides a unique milieu for training in a safe and controlled environment. Simulation-based team training is widely accepted and used in obstetrics and improves nontechnical skills, which are important in emergency cesarean section. High-fidelity simulators are advanced and realistic, but because of the expense, low-fidelity simulators may provide a reasonable method for training surgical skills. The literature in training and assessment of surgical skills in relation to cesarean section is sparse, and more studies are warranted.",Cesarean section; education; simulation; technical skills; nontechnical skills; obstetrics; TEACH ONE; SEE ONE; DELIVERY INTERVAL; OPERATING-ROOM; SIMULATION; SKILLS; OBSTETRICS; REALITY; PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Zetner DB and Petersen I and Konge L and Thinggaard E,,,0,397
447,Effectiveness of digital resuscitation training in improving knowledge and skills: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials,"AIM: This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of digital resuscitation training in improving knowledge and skill compared with standard resuscitation training. METHODS: We searched through the CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ERIC, ProQuest Dissertations and Thesis, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus from inception of our review until 5 March 2018. The quality of individual and overall evidence was evaluated according to the risk of bias, Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and Grade of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, respectively. Meta-analyses were performed with the Review Manger software. Z-statistics were used to evaluate the overall effect of training, and I2 test was used to assess heterogeneity. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were used for additional meta-analyses. RESULTS: Amongst the 15,528 studies retrieved, 20 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected from 13 countries across different ethnicities. More than half (52%) of the trials had a low risk of bias, and MERSQI scores ranged from 13.5 to 15.5. The overall quality of evidence was very low according to GRADE criteria. Meta-analyses revealed that trainees in digital resuscitation training had better knowledge scores but poorer chest compression rates than that of trainees in standard resuscitation training. Digital resuscitation trainings were non-inferior to standard resuscitation trainings in skill performance scores. Subgroup analyses suggested that digital resuscitation training might consider using blended learning approach with virtual patient, computer-screen based, learning theories and video-recorded assessment, especially for basic life support trainings amongst health professionals. CONCLUSION: Despite the wide variation in digital resuscitation trainings, evidence suggesting the use of digital resuscitation training for improving knowledge and skills is inadequate. Well-designed non-inferiority RCTs in multiple settings with follow-up data and large sample size are needed to ensure the robustness of the evidence.",Digital resuscitation training; Systematic review; Meta-analysis; Knowledge; Skills; ADVANCED LIFE-SUPPORT; CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION; SELF-INSTRUCTION; VIRTUAL PATIENTS; CPR; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; RETENTION; FIDELITY; QUALITY; Critical Care Medicine; Emergency Medicine; General & Internal Medicine; Emergency Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw,Lau Y and Nyoe RS and Wong SN and Ab Hamid ZB and Leong BS and Lau ST,,,0,398
448,What would you demand beyond mathematics? Teachers' promotion of students' self-regulated learning and metacognition,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether primary school teachers' promotion of students' self-regulated learning (SRL) and metacognition changed during the course of a professional development (PD) program that focused on improving the quality of their implementation of mathematical tasks. The study involved three primary school teachers in a private school. The PD program design required teachers to reflect critically on their own practice and learning. Classroom observations and meetings with the teachers were part of the program. A SRL observation instrument was used for coding 36 lessons observed during one academic year. The findings revealed that the program did not have a substantial impact on teachers' promotion of students' SRL. In fact, the amount of time teachers had been in the PD program had only a weak correlation with their promotion of students' SRL and metacognition. The subcomponents of SRL were considered in the interpretation of the results. Possible directions are discussed for further research on developing teachers' promotion of students' SRL while focusing on improving the quality of implementation of mathematical tasks.",Self-regulated learning; Metacognition; Teacher professional development; Classroom observation; Quality of implementation of tasks; KNOWLEDGE; VIDEO; METAANALYSIS; THINKING; REFORM; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Ader E,,,0,399
449,The perceptual – Cognitive skills of combat sports athletes: A systematic review,"The aim of this review is to provide evidence of how practicing combat sports can shape the perceptual—cognitive skills of athletes. This is because they must be adept at selecting the relevant stimuli in order to anticipate the attack and decide how counterattack their opponent in order to achieve victory. A systematic search was conducted on PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science via the combination of specific keywords. 31 research articles were included. Different aspects of perceptual–cognitive skills were analysed, such as complex cognitive skills and basic cognitive functions. The investigations were divided by the methods and stimuli used. The results are reported in three chapters: one analysed the research conducted with realistic stimuli (videos/pictures), another chapter investigated the studies with simulated scenarios, while the last chapter examined the basic cognitive functions. Following this is a chapter which, instead, analysed an important aspect for future studies: perceptual–cognitive training. The studies revealed better general anticipation skills with real and simulated stimuli, and better cognitive functions with regards to attention for experts than novices. However, a comprehensive analysis is needed to understand the results which emerged from the investigation. Moreover, the review aims to encourage possible future research in the topic area.

450,The impact of pedagogical agent gesturing in multimedia learning environments: A meta-analysis,"A meta-analysis consisting of 20 experiments (N = 3841) on the influence of pedagogical agent (PA) gesturing in multimedia environments revealed that gestures have a small-to-medium impact on near transfer of knowledge (g = 0.39), retention of learning (g = 0.28), and agent persona (g = 0.44), but a minimal impact on reducing cognitive load (g = 0.13). Moderator analysis discovered that humanoid agents had a small effect on decreasing cognitive load (g = 0.24), while character agents had a minimal to small effect on increasing cognitive load (g = - 0.18). Interestingly, a deeper analysis found that the differences in effect sizes for near transfer and retention might be due to the learning outcome measured and not the design of the PA. Overall, the findings revealed that PA gestures are beneficial for student learning and perception in multimedia learning environments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Meta-Analysis; Pedagogical agents; Gesture; Persona; Cognitive load; COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY; STUDENTS LEARN; SPEECH; LANGUAGE; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; DESIGN; WORKS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Davis RO,,,1,401

The influence was obtained through processing data from several previous research results with similar problems through the meta-analysis method. Data analysis was carried out in a quantitative manner by percentage. The research unit uses written documents in the form of journals and research reports on interactive learning media. The results of the study showed an average value of effect size of 0.64 (SD = 1.06). This means that interactive learning media has an effect of 23.89% on science learning outcomes for students. Interactive learning media type which gives the biggest influence of 39.44% is interactive multimedia. The concentration of science lessons which has the biggest effect size was Biology of 41.77%, and the biggest effect size there was on the elementary school of 38.88%.","Interactive Learning Media; Effect Size; Science Learning Outcomes; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Sahronih S and Purwanto A and Sumantri MS,,,1,402
452,The Future of Virtual Reality in Education: A Future Oriented Meta Analysis of the Literature,"Many have elaborated on the potential of virtual reality (VR) in learning. This article attempts at organizing the literature in this issue in order to better identify indicators that can account for future valid trends, and seeks to bring to attention how authors who wrote about the future of VR in education confused futures' terms and produced excessive expectations about its applicability in learning. The majority of writers missed the difference between \probable\' trends and \'possible\' trends as well as between \'wild\' and \'preferable\' scenarios. Therefore",the aim of this article is twofold: a. to clarify the difference between these future approaches; and b. to develop a valid forecast of a \'wild future\' for VR in education. It seems that VR could suggest a wild paradigm in learning. The wild turnabout identifies the potential of VR not as an accessory to learning but as an IQ and cognitive booster.',Passig D,,,0,403
453,Efficacy of virtual patients in medical education: A meta-analysis of randomized studies,"A meta-analysis was performed to assess the Effect Size (ES) from randomized studies comparing the effect of educational interventions in which Virtual patients (VPs) were used either as an alternative method or additive to usual curriculum versus interventions based on more traditional methods. Meta-analysis was designed, conducted and reported according to QUORUM statement on quality of reporting of meta-analyses. Twelve randomized controlled studies were retrieved, assessing a total of 25 different outcomes. Under a random-effect model, meta-analysis showed a clear positive pooled overall effect for VPs compared to other educational methods (Odds Ratio: 2.39; 95% C.I. 1.48 ÷ 3.84). A positive effect has been documented both when VPs have been used as an additive resource (O.R.: 2.55; C.I. 1.36 ÷ 4.79) and when they have been compared as an alternative to a more traditional method (O.R.: 2.19; 1.06 ÷ 4.52). When grouped for type of outcome, the pooled ES for studies addressing communication skills and ethical reasoning was lower than for clinical reasoning outcome. There is evidence that VPs are effective but further research is needed to clarify which is their best possible integration in curricula and their value and cost/benefit ratio with respect to other active learning methods. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

455,Intervention to reduce hypoglycemia fear in parents of young kids using video-based telehealth (REDCHiP),"Objective To evaluate the efficacy of a new video-based telehealth intervention to reduce hypoglycemia fear in parents of young children with type 1 diabetes. Methods We randomized 42 parents to either immediate treatment (reducing emotional distress for childhood hypoglycemia in parents, REDCHiP; n = 22) or a waitlist control (WAITLIST; n = 21) condition. REDCHiP parents completed a 10-session video-based telehealth intervention, while WAITLIST parents continued in usual care. After 14-weeks, WAITLIST parents completed the telehealth treatment. We examined for between group changes in parental hypoglycemia fear and parenting stress (n = 18 per condition), 3-month maintenance of treatment effects for parents randomized to REDCHiP (n = 15), and pre-post changes for the entire sample (n = 36). Results Mostly mothers participated (97.6%). They reported a mean age of 35.2 +/- 5.0 years at pre-treatment. Children were 4.4 +/- 1.4 years old and 59.5% boys. Between group comparisons showed a significant reduction in hypoglycemia fear (P = .04) and a trend toward reduction in parenting stress-frequency (P = .092) for REDCHiP parents compared to WAITLIST parents. After the three-month maintenance period, REDCHiP parents reported significant reductions in hypoglycemia fear, parenting stress-frequency, and parenting stress-difficulty (P's < .01) compared to pre-treatment. When all parents received the telehealth treatment, we also observed significant reductions in hypoglycemia fear, parenting stress-frequency, and parenting stress-difficulty (P's < .001), and sensitivity analyses revealed a significant reduction in child glycated hemoglobin for children who entered the treatment above target (P < .05). Conclusion Our new video-based telehealth intervention appears to reduce hypoglycemia fear and parenting stress and may help parents of very young children with T1D to better achieve optimal child glycemic control when children are above target.",fear; hypoglycemia; parents; preschoolers; telehealth; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR THERAPY; GLYCEMIC CONTROL; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SELF-EFFICACY; TYPE-1; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; ADHERENCE; AWARENESS; METAANALYSIS; Endocrinology & Metabolism; Pediatrics; Endocrinology & Metabolism; Pediatrics; Video Meta Results Raw,Patton SR and Clements MA and Marker AM and Nelson EL,,,0,405
456,Computerized cognitive behavioural therapy and the therapeutic alliance: A qualitative enquiry,"Objectives. Computerized cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) for depression has a growing evidence base, and is recommended as a treatment choice for depression in recent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2009) guidelines to health services in England and Wales. cCBT programs are designed to translate the evidence-based tasks and techniques of CBT into an accessible, multimedia format, but it is less clear whether they also translate critical common factors of therapy, which may be necessary for engagement and associated with therapeutic outcomes. This study investigates whether and to what extent three widely used cCBT programs for depression incorporate and convey key features that serve to establish, develop, and maintain a therapeutic alliance with program users. Design. This study adopted a qualitative approach to develop a thematic framework of alliance features specific to cCBT. Method. Three online cCBT programs designed to treat mild-to-moderate depression were investigated for alliance-related themes and sub-themes. Results. The analysis revealed substantial evidence of therapeutic alliance features across the sample of cCBT programs, the prevalence and quality of which varied across relational stages. Conclusions. cCBT programs build on traditional self-help tools, offering unique relational features. Findings raise theoretical implications, in addition to guidance for future cCBT program development and service provision.",Video Meta Results Raw,Barazzone N and Cavanagh K and Richards DA,,,0,406
457,Minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy: reflections after more than 2400 cases performed,"Background The minimally invasive video-assisted approach was developed for primary hyperparathyroidism in 1997 and the year after for thyroid disease. Since then, the technique has been adopted worldwide, and indications moved from the initial benign disease to low-risk and intermediate-risk carcinoma, demonstrating a level of oncologic radicality comparable to the conventional open approach when inclusion criteria are strictly respected. Methods Between 1998 and 2014, 2412 minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomies (MIVAT) were performed in our department. The indication for surgery in 825 patients (34.3 %) was a malignant tumor, in particular, a papillary carcinoma in 800 patients. Among them, 528 patients operated on between 2000 and 2009 had a mean complete follow-up of 7.5 (standard deviation, 2.3) years. Results A total thyroidectomy was performed in 1788 patients (74.1 %) and a hemithyroidectomy in 564 (23.4 %). Also performed was central compartment lymphadenectomy in 31 patients (1.3 %) and parathyroidectomy for the presence of a solitary parathyroid adenoma in 29 (1.2 %). Mean duration of the procedure was 41 (standard deviation, 14) minutes. After a mean follow-up of 7. 5 years, 528 patients who underwent MIVAT for low-risk or intermediate-risk papillary carcinoma presented a cure rate of 85 % (undetectable thyroglobulin), comparable with the 80 % rate reported in patients who had undergone open thyroidectomy during the same period. Conclusions After a long experience and a considerable number of procedures performed in a single center, MIVAT is confirmed as a safe operation, with a complication rate comparable with open thyroidectomy. MIVAT offers a cure rate for the treatment of low-risk and intermediate-risk malignancies that is comparable with an open procedure when inclusion criteria are strictly respected.",Video Meta Results Raw,Miccoli P and Biricotti M and Matteucci V and Ambrosini CE and Wu J and Materazzi G,,,0,407
458,The state of the art and future directions of robotic-assisted thoracic surgery,"Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has been widely adopted in early-stage lung cancer as an oncologically sound and minimally invasive approach with certain proven short-term advantages over open thoracotomy especially in terms of postoperative morbidity. Nevertheless, VATS is associated with visual and mechanical limitations, many of which were overcome with the introduction of robotic surgical techniques. Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) can approximate the visual perspective of open surgery, while utilizing instruments that mimic the maneuverability of the human wrist and provide magnified three-dimensional imaging. The added cost in addition to the effort required of surgeons to master RATS may be ultimately compensated by enhanced surgical efficiency, access to rapidly developing technical innovations, and the potential for improved patient outcomes.",State of the art; Future directions; Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery; CELL LUNG-CANCER; LEARNING-CURVE; THORACOSCOPIC LOBECTOMY; PULMONARY RESECTION; SURGICAL LOBECTOMY; EARLY EXPERIENCE; LOWER MORBIDITY; DATABASE; METAANALYSIS; OUTCOMES; Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Video Meta Results Raw,Shulman RM and Abbas AE,,,0,408
459,Differences in cognitive performance in nondemented Parkinson's disease: A latent profile analysis of cognitive subtypes,"Introduction: Cognitive impairments are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients without dementia. These deficits are quite heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to recognize and treat them. For this reason, many authors have attempted to classify patients into more homogeneous groups with diverse results. The present study was designed to analyze the cognitive heterogeneity in PD patients using a novel data-driven approach, latent profile analysis (LPA), to classify patients according to cognitive characteristics. This methodology, which has been used in previous studies focused on motor and psychiatric symptomatology, seems to be better than traditional cluster analysis for the establishment and comparison between different subgroups because it does not require prior decision making about some theoretical or methodological aspects. Method: LPA was applied to 71 PD patients evaluated with a broad neuropsychological battery including different memory and executive function tests. The clusters obtained from the analysis were described by making comparisons with a control group of 51 healthy subjects matched in age, sex, and educational level. Results: The LPA resulted in a four-cluster solution, which could be described as: (a) executive dysfunction (32.4%), (b) memory and executive dysfunction (28.2%), (c) memory dysfunction (23.9%), and (d) noncognitive dysfunction (15.5%). These four PD cluster differ in age and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. However, there were no differences between clusters in disease duration, clinical impression of severity index, depression, and cognitive reserve. Conclusions: LPA is a very interesting method for the establishment of more homogeneous groups of PD patients based on their neuropsychological characteristics. Moreover, the distinction between different cognitive profiles will allow us to design interventions better adapted to each patient.","Cognitive impairment; cognitive heterogeneity; cognitive profiles; episodic memory; executive function; latent profile analysis; memory; Parkinson's disease; semantic memory; CLINICAL HETEROGENEITY; SPATIAL ABILITY; IMPAIRMENT; DEMENTIA; METAANALYSIS; DISORDERS; DIAGNOSIS; SEVERITY; CAMPAIGN; SPECTRUM; Psychology, Clinical; Clinical Neurology; Psychology; Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw",Alonso-Recio L and Martin-Plasencia P and Ruiz M and Manuel Serrano J,,,0,409

462,"Measuring cognitive load: performance, mental effort and simulation task complexity","ContextInterest in applying cognitive load theory in health care simulation is growing. This line of inquiry requires measures that are sensitive to changes in cognitive load arising from different instructional designs. Recently, mental effort ratings and secondary task performance have shown promise as measures of cognitive load in health care simulation. ObjectivesWe investigate the sensitivity of these measures to predicted differences in intrinsic load arising from variations in task complexity and learner expertise during simulation-based surgical skills training. MethodsWe randomly assigned 28 novice medical students to simulation training on a simple or complex surgical knot-tying task. Participants completed 13 practice trials, interspersed with computer-based video instruction. On trials 1, 5, 9 and 13, knot-tying performance was assessed using time and movement efficiency measures, and cognitive load was assessed using subjective rating of mental effort (SRME) and simple reaction time (SRT) on a vibrotactile stimulus-monitoring secondary task. ResultsSignificant improvements in knot-tying performance (F-(1.04,F-24.95)=41.1, p<0.001 for movements; F-(1.04,F-25.90)=49.9, p<0.001 for time) and reduced cognitive load (F-(2.3,F-58.5)=57.7, p<0.001 for SRME; F-(1.8,F-47.3)=10.5, p<0.001 for SRT) were observed in both groups during training. The simple-task group demonstrated superior knot tying (F-(1,F-24)=5.2, p=0.031 for movements; F-(1,F-24)=6.5, p=0.017 for time) and a faster decline in SRME over the first five trials (F-(1,F-26)= 6.45, p=0.017) compared with their peers. Although SRT followed a similar pattern, group differences were not statistically significant. ConclusionsBoth secondary task performance and mental effort ratings are sensitive to changes in intrinsic load among novices engaged in simulation-based learning. These measures can be used to track cognitive load during skills training. Mental effort ratings are also sensitive to small differences in intrinsic load arising from variations in the physical complexity of a simulation task. The complementary nature of these subjective and objective measures suggests their combined use is advantageous in simulation instructional design research.

464,Are You Insulting Me? Exposure to Alcohol Primes Increases Aggression Following Ambiguous Provocation,"Considerable research has shown that alcohol consumption can increase aggression and produce extremes in other social behaviors. Although most theories posit that such effects are caused by pharmacological impairment of cognitive processes, recent research indicates that exposure to alcohol-related constructs, in the absence of consumption, can produce similar effects. Here we tested the hypothesis that alcohol priming is most likely to affect aggression in the context of ambiguous provocation. Experiment 1 showed that exposure to alcohol primes increased aggressive retaliation but only when an initial provocation was ambiguous; unambiguous provocation elicited highly aggressive responses regardless of prime exposure. Experiment 2 showed that alcohol prime exposure effects are relatively short-lived and that perceptions of the provocateur's hostility mediated effects of prime exposure on aggression. These findings suggest modification and extension of existing models of alcohol-induced aggression.",Video Meta Results Raw,Pedersen WC and Vasquez EA and Bartholow BD and Grosvenor M and Truong A,,,0,413

The review shows that: effective teaching methods encompassing broad geoscience study still need extensive research; whilst some valuable materials have been developed for the teaching of systems approaches to geoscience, these need to be evaluated in different curriculum contexts; different methodologies for teaching spatial awareness in geoscience need to be more widely applied and researched; approaches for the effective teaching of geological time should be further developed and tested; there is much scope for the development and evaluation of approaches to geoscience fieldwork; geoscience misconceptions are widespread and need further identification and review; and studies of the effectiveness of professional development in geoscience education should be implemented more widely, including their impact in the classroom. The review indicates that geoscience education will progress most effectively through: extending geoscience learning to all children; educating teachers in effective implementation of new curriculum initiatives; evaluating the progress of the initiatives and using the results to refine them; and researching the whole process to demonstrate its effectiveness and to ensure wide dissemination on the basis of well?founded research findings.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Holistic Evaluation; Geology; Professional Development; Curriculum Development; Scientific Methodology; Earth Science; Spatial Ability; Misconceptions; Literature Reviews; Teaching Methods; Meta Analysis; Research Needs; Trend Analysis; Field Studies; Video Meta Results Raw",King C,,,0,414

467,Developmental Interventions to Address the STEM Gender Gap: Exploring Intended and Unintended Consequences,"Women and girls in the United States continue to be underrepresented in STEM, particularly in engineering and technology fields. This gap has been attracting recent attention from those motivated to ensure that girls and women have access to a full range of personally satisfying careers as well as from those concerned with developing a rich talent pool to meet national workforce needs. This chapter is focused on interventions that have been designed to address this STEM gender gap. We begin by documenting the STEM gender gap and then review change mechanisms emerging from theories of gender development that may be harnessed in intervention efforts. In addition, we provide a taxonomy of intervention goals which we then use to organize an illustrative review of sample interventions. After commenting on some of the findings and limitations of past work, we offer suggestions for enhancing the systematic evaluation of intervention programs that include careful selection of comparison groups, a broad array of STEM outcome measures, assessment of potentially unintended consequences, and meta-analyses.",Video Meta Results Raw,Liben LS and Coyle EF,,,0,416
468,Psychological effects of risk glorification in the media: Towards an integrative view,"Media contents that glorify risk-taking (e.g., video games that simulate illegal street racing, TV depictions of dangerous extreme sports or stunts) are becoming increasingly popular. Theory and research suggest that risk glorification is associated with risk-taking among the audience. Until recently the evidence was limited in three ways: First, most studies, being correlational, did not permit clear causal inferences. Second, we did not know the strength of the effect of different types of media and different types of risk-taking outcomes. Third, early research did little to isolate the underlying psychological processes that mediate the pernicious effects of risk glorifying media formats. In order to address these open questions we review the results of an experimental programme of research and the findings of a comprehensive meta-analysis. The main findings are that (a) the risky media contents do indeed have causal force; (b) according to our meta-analysis active participation in risk glorifying media interfaces has a larger effect than passive consumption; (c) psychological processes include the priming of risk-related constructs, effects of risk-positive situational heuristic cues, perceived social norms, personal risk habituation, and changes in the recipient’s self-concept. To integrate these findings we propose a theoretical framework derived from broad-range socio-cognitive models. We conclude with a discussion of possible directions for future research.

469,Signaling text-picture relations in multimedia learning: The influence of prior knowledge,"Multimedia integration signals highlight correspondences between text and pictures with the aim of supporting learning from multimedia. A recent meta-analysis revealed that only learners with low domain-specific prior knowledge benefit from multimedia integration signals. To more thoroughly investigate the influence of prior knowledge on the multimedia signaling effect in a more ecologically valid context, we conducted a quasi-experimental field study with 8th graders. They learned with a digital multimedia textbook in 1 of the 2 versions: (a) a basic version with signals that supported only the selection and organization of information from either text or pictures or (b) an extended version with additional multimedia integration signals to support the integration of information from text and pictures (e.g., color coding, deictic references). Results of a contrast analysis revealed that low-prior-knowledge learners learned better with the extended version compared with the basic version, whereas adding multimedia integration signals was detrimental for learning outcomes of high-prior-knowledge learners. This expertise reversal effect could only partially be explained by cognitive load measures, in that high-prior-knowledge learners had higher extraneous cognitive load in the condition with multimedia integration signals. The results suggest a need for a more individualized multimedia design that considers students' prior knowledge. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Germany; ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Grade 8; Cognitive Processes; Illustrations; Correlation; Quasiexperimental Design; Middle School Students; Foreign Countries; Pretests Posttests; Cognitive Ability; Meta Analysis; Statistical Analysis; Layout (Publications); Cues; Science Instruction; Eye Movements; Introductory Courses; Time on Task; Regression (Statistics); Color; Multimedia Materials; Prior Learning; Comparative Analysis; Chemistry; Reading Comprehension; Reading Processes; Textbooks; Cueing; Expertise reversal effect; Multimedia learning; Prior knowledge; Signaling; Video Meta Results Raw",Richter J and Scheiter K and Eitel A,,,0,418

471,Counter striking psychosis: Commercial video games as potential treatment in schizophrenia? A systematic review of neuroimaging studies,"Schizophrenia is a severe, chronic, and strongly disabling neuropsychiatric disorder, characterized by cognitive decline, positive and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms respond well to antipsychotic medication and psycho-social interventions, in contrast to negative symptoms and neurocognitive impairments. Cognitive deficits have been linked to a poorer outcome and hence specific cognitive remediation therapies have been proposed. Their effectiveness is nowadays approved and neurobiological correlates have been reconfirmed by brain imaging studies. Interestingly, recent MRI work showed that commercial video games modified similar brain areas as these specialized training programs. If gray matter increases and functional brain modulations would translate in better cognitive and every day functioning, commercial video game training could be an enjoyable and economically interesting treatment option for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. This systematic review summarizes advances in the area with emphasis on imaging studies dealing with brain changes upon video game training and contrasts them to conventional cognitive remediation. Moreover, we discuss potential challenges therapeutic video game development and research would have to face in future treatment of schizophrenia.",Schizophrenia; Positive and negative symptoms; Video games; Cognitive remediation therapy; Brain plasticity; MRI; Video game addiction; Video game induced violence; Computer Games; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Therapeutic Processes; Video Meta Results Raw,Suenderhauf C and Walter A and Lenz C and Lang UE and Borgwardt S,,,0,420
472,Women match men when learning a spatial skill,"Meta-analytic studies have concluded that although training improves spatial cognition in both sexes, the male advantage generally persists. However, because some studies run counter to this pattern, a closer examination of the anomaly is warranted. The authors investigated the acquisition of a basic skill (spatial selective attention) using a matched-pair two-wave longitudinal design. Participants were screened with the use of an attentional visual field task, with the objective of selecting and matching 10 male–female pairs, over a wide range (30% to 57% correct). Subsequently, 20 participants 17–23 years of age (selected from 43 screened) were trained for 10 hr (distributed over several sessions) by playing a first-person shooter video game. This genre is known to be highly effective in enhancing spatial skills. All 20 participants improved, with matched members of the male–female pairs achieving very similar gains, independent of starting level. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the learning trajectory of women is not inferior to that of men when acquiring a basic spatial skill. Training methods that develop basic spatial skills may be essential to achieve gender parity in both basic and complex spatial tasks.

474,"The dynamic influence of emotions on game-based creativity: An integrated analysis of emotional valence, activation strength, and regulation focus","Emotion has been identified as an important predictor of creativity, but little attention has been put on investigating how emotion, especially that considers regulation focus, may dynamically influence male and female students' creativity in game-based situations. To explore the dynamic relationship between various types of emotions and creativity during game playing, 266 college students were included and the Creativity Game-based Evaluation System (CGES) was developed in this study. Four types of emotions integrating perspectives of valence (positive vs. negative), activation (high vs low), and regulatory focus (prevention vs. promotion) were investigated in this study: the positive-low activation-prevention emotion (P-L-Pre) (calm and relaxed), the positive-high activation-promotion emotion (P-H-Pro) (happy and elated), the negative-high activation-prevention emotion (N-H-Pre) (nervous and anxious), and the negative-high activation-promotion emotion (N-H-Pro) (frustrated and angry). The results revealed that, although there was a slight gender difference in game-based creativity, the prediction patterns of emotions in game-based creativity were very similar among participants with different genders. Specifically, emotions during game playing can better predict creativity than those of the baseline; moreover, the P-H-Pro emotion can facilitate performance on creativity, whereas the N-H-Pro emotion can decrease creativity performance. Thus, providing appropriate challenges to induce highly-activated and promotion-focused positive emotions are critical for the success of games designed to improve creativity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

475,Active Learning in Flipped Life Science Courses Promotes Development of Critical Thinking Skills,"Although development of critical thinking skills has emerged as an important issue in undergraduate education, implementation of pedagogies targeting these skills across different science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines has proved challenging. Our goal was to assess the impact of targeted interventions in 1) an introductory cell and molecular biology course, 2) an intermediate-level evolutionary ecology course, and 3) an upper-level biochemistry course. Each instructor used Web-based videos to flip some aspect of the course in order to implement active-learning exercises during class meetings. Activities included process-oriented guided-inquiry learning, model building, case studies, clicker-based think-pair-share strategies, and targeted critical thinking exercises. The proportion of time spent in active-learning activities relative to lecture varied among the courses, with increased active learning in intermediate/upper-level courses. Critical thinking was assessed via a pre/posttest design using the Critical Thinking Assessment Test. Students also assessed their own learning through a self-reported survey. Students in flipped courses exhibited gains in critical thinking, with the largest objective gains in intermediate and upper-level courses. Results from this study suggest that implementing active-learning strategies in the flipped classroom may benefit critical thinking and provide initial evidence suggesting that underrepresented and first-year students may experience a greater benefit.","STUDENT SELF-ASSESSMENT; BIOLOGY COURSES; OWN INCOMPETENCE; HIGHER-EDUCATION; CLASS SIZE; FACULTY; METAANALYSIS; PEER; INSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Styers ML and Van Zandt PA and Hayden KL,,,0,424
476,Gamification of Cognitive Assessment and Cognitive Training: A Systematic Review of Applications and Efficacy,"Background: Cognitive tasks are typically viewed as effortful, frustrating, and repetitive, which often leads to participant disengagement. This, in turn, may negatively impact data quality and/or reduce intervention effects. However, gamification may provide a possible solution. If game design features can be incorporated into cognitive tasks without undermining their scientific value, then data quality, intervention effects, and participant engagement may be improved. Objectives: This systematic review aims to explore and evaluate the ways in which gamification has already been used for cognitive training and assessment purposes. We hope to answer 3 questions: (1) Why have researchers opted to use gamification? (2) What domains has gamification been applied in? (3) How successful has gamification been in cognitive research thus far? Methods: We systematically searched several Web-based databases, searching the titles, abstracts, and keywords of database entries using the search strategy (gamif* OR game OR games) AND (cognit* OR engag* OR behavi* OR health* OR attention OR motiv*). Searches included papers published in English between January 2007 and October 2015. Results: Our review identified 33 relevant studies, covering 31 gamified cognitive tasks used across a range of disorders and cognitive domains. We identified 7 reasons for researchers opting to gamify their cognitive training and testing. We found that working memory and general executive functions were common targets for both gamified assessment and training. Gamified tests were typically validated successfully, although mixed-domain measurement was a problem. Gamified training appears to be highly engaging and does boost participant motivation, but mixed effects of gamification on task performance were reported. Conclusions: Heterogeneous study designs and typically small sample sizes highlight the need for further research in both gamified training and testing. Nevertheless, careful application of gamification can provide a way to develop engaging and yet scientifically valid cognitive assessments, and it is likely worthwhile to continue to develop gamified cognitive tasks in the future.",Video Meta Results Raw,Lumsden J and Edwards EA and Lawrence NS and Coyle D and Munafo MR,,,0,425
477,The CRISP colorectal cancer risk prediction tool: an exploratory study using simulated consultations in Australian primary care,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) with colonoscopy is meant to be reserved for people at increased risk, however, currently there is a mismatch between individuals' risk of CRC and the type of CRC screening they receive. This paper describes the development and optimisation of a Colorectal cancer RISk Prediction tool ('CRISP') for use in primary care. The aim of the CRISP tool is to increase risk-appropriate CRC screening. METHODS: CRISP development was informed by previous experience with developing risk tools for use in primary care and a systematic review of the evidence. A CRISP prototype was used in simulated consultations by general practitioners (GPs) with actors as patients. GPs were interviewed to explore their experience of using CRISP, and practice nurses (PNs) and practice managers (PMs) were interviewed after a demonstration of CRISP. Transcribed interviews and video footage of the 'consultations' were qualitatively analyzed. Themes arising from the data were mapped onto Normalization Process Theory (NPT). RESULTS: Fourteen GPs, nine PNs and six PMs were recruited from 12 clinics. Results were described using the four constructs of NPT: 1) Coherence: Clinicians understood the rationale behind CRISP, particularly since they were familiar with using risk tools for other conditions; 2) Cognitive participation: GPs welcomed the opportunity CRISP provided to discuss healthy and unhealthy behaviors with their patients, but many GPs challenged the screening recommendation generated by CRISP; 3) Collective Action: CRISP disrupted clinician-patient flow if the GP was less comfortable with computers. GP consultation time was a major implementation barrier and overall consensus was that PNs have more capacity and time to use CRISP effectively; 4) Reflexive monitoring: Limited systematic monitoring of new interventions is a potential barrier to the sustainable embedding of CRISP. CONCLUSIONS: CRISP has the potential to improve risk-appropriate CRC screening in primary care but was considered more likely to be successfully implemented as a nurse-led intervention.",Colorectal cancer; Colorectal cancer risk assessment; Colorectal cancer risk prediction; Primary care; Cancer screening; General practitioners; Bowel cancer screening; NORMALIZATION PROCESS THEORY; COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; SCREENING PRACTICES; GENERAL-PRACTICE; HEALTH; TRIAL; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK; WOMEN; Medical Informatics; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Walker JG and Bickerstaffe A and Hewabandu N and Maddumarachchi S and Dowty JG and CRECRC and Jenkins M and Pirotta M and Walter FM and Emery JD,,,0,426

479,Do active video games benefit the motor skill development of non-typically developing children and adolescents: A systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: The use of interactive video gaming, known as 'exergames' or 'active video games (AVG)' may provide an opportunity for motor skill development. Youth with non-typical patterns of development may have deficits in gross motor skill capacities and are therefore an intervention target. The aim was to determine the effectiveness of AVG use on motor skill development in non-typically developing children and adolescents. DESIGN: Review article. METHODS: The PRISMA protocol was used to conduct a systematic review of EBSCOhost, Embase, Gale Cengage, Informit, Ovid, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases. A total of 19 articles met inclusion criteria (non-typically developing participants such as those with a learning or developmental delay aged 3-18, use of an AVG console, assessed one or more gross motor skills). Studies were excluded if gross motor skill outcomes encompassed fine motor skills or reflected mobility related to daily living. RESULTS: Interventions included children and adolescents with eight different conditions. The Nintendo Wii was the most utilised gaming platform (14/19 studies). Studies examined a combination of skills, with most examining balance (15/19), five studies examining ball skills, and other gross motor skills such as coordination (3 studies), running (3 studies) and jumping (3 studies). There was strong evidence that AVG's improved balance. AVG's also appeared to benefit participants with Cerebral Palsy. CONCLUSIONS: AVG's could be a valuable tool to improve gross motor skills of non-typically developing children. There is scope for further exploration, particularly of ball, coordination and locomotor skills and varying platforms to draw more conclusive evaluations.",AVG; Motor skill; Balance; Object control; Locomotor; HEMIPLEGIC CEREBRAL-PALSY; NINTENDO WII FIT; VIRTUAL-REALITY; COORDINATION DISORDER; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; BALANCE CONTROL; COMPUTER GAME; DOWN-SYNDROME; REHABILITATION; Sport Sciences; Sport Sciences; Video Meta Results Raw,Page ZE and Barrington S and Edwards J and Barnett LM,,,0,428
480,ADHD rehabilitation through video gaming: A systematic review using PRISMA guidelines of the current findings and the associated risk of bias,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 7[173] of Frontiers in Psychiatry (see record [rid]2016-59782-001[/rid]). Modifications on the original paper are presented for pages 4, 10, and 11. They were made to address the requests of the researchers whose papers were evaluated in the original systematic review. Some corrections refer to mistakes made when data were transferred from tables to text (tables were correct, but some data were mistyped on the text). Other modifications can be classified as more detailed explanations, and they should clarify misunderstandings about the bias analysis or technical video game characteristics.] Empirical research studies have highlighted the need to investigate whether video game can be useful as a tool within a neuropsychological rehabilitation program for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients. However, little is known about the possible gains that this kind of video game-based interventions can produce and even if these gains can be transferred to real life abilities. The present paper aims to uncover key information related to the use of video game in ADHD neuropsychological rehabilitation/intervention by focusing on its gains and its capability to transfer/generalize these gains to real life situation via a systematic review of the empirical literature. The PRISMA guidelines were adopted. Internet-based bibliographic searches were conducted via seven major electronic databases (i.e., PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Core Collection BIOSIS Citation Index, MEDLINE, SciELO Citation Index, and PubMed) to access studies examining the association between video game interventions in ADHD patients and behavioral and cognitive outcomes. A total of 14 empirical studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. The studies reported the attention, working memory, and the behavioral aspects as the main target of the intervention. Cognitive and behavioral gains were reported after the video game training (VGT). However, many bias related to the choice of outcome instruments, sampling and blindness of assessors, weaken the results power. Additional researches are important to clarify the effects and stability of the VGT programs, and an important effort should be made to construct better methods to assess improvements on everyday cognitive abilities and real world functioning.

483,How Reliable Are Therapeutic Competence Ratings? Results of a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"AbstractAssessments of psychotherapeutic competencies play a crucial role in research and training. However, research on the reliability and validity of such assessments is sparse. This study aimed to provide an overview of the current evidence and to provide an average interrater reliability (IRR) of psychotherapeutic competence ratings. A systematic review was conducted, and 20 studies reported in 32 publications were collected. These 20 studies were included in a narrative synthesis, and 20 coefficients were entered into the meta-analysis. Most primary studies referred to cognitive-behavioral therapies and the treatment of depression, used the Cognitive Therapy Scale, based ratings on videos, and trained the raters. Our meta-analysis revealed a pooled ICC of 0.82, but at the same time severe heterogeneity. The evidence map highlighted a variety of variables related to competence assessments. Further aspects influencing the reliability of competence ratings and regarding the considerable heterogeneity are discussed in detail throughout the manuscript.

484,Neural basis of video gaming: A systematic review,"Background: Video gaming is an increasingly popular activity in contemporary society, especially among young people, and video games are increasing in popularity not only as a research tool but also as a field of study. Many studies have focused on the neural and behavioral effects of video games, providing a great deal of video game derived brain correlates in recent decades. There is a great amount of information, obtained through a myriad of methods, providing neural correlates of video games. Objectives: We aim to understand the relationship between the use of video games and their neural correlates, taking into account the whole variety of cognitive factors that they encompass. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using standardized search operators that included the presence of video games and neuro-imaging techniques or references to structural or functional brain changes. Separate categories were made for studies featuring Internet Gaming Disorder and studies focused on the violent content of video games. Results: A total of 116 articles were considered for the final selection. One hundred provided functional data and 22 measured structural brain changes. One-third of the studies covered video game addiction, and 14%focused on video game related violence. Conclusions: Despite the innate heterogeneity of the field of study, it has been possible to establish a series of links between the neural and cognitive aspects, particularly regarding attention, cognitive control, visuospatial skills, cognitive workload, and reward processing. However, many aspects could be improved. The lack of standardization in the different aspects of video game related research, such as the participants’ characteristics, the features of each video game genre and the diverse study goals could contribute to discrepancies in many related studies.

Recently, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided gallbladder drainage with a lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) has been introduced for these patients. We performed a systematic review and pooled-data analysis in this field. A comprehensive review of case series on gallbladder drainage with EUS-guided LAMS placement was performed. Only case series with at least five patients were considered. The rates of technical success, clinical success, and adverse events were computed. Overall, nine case series with a total of 226 patients were identified. The stent was positioned successfully in 215 cases [95.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=92.3-98]. Clinical success was achieved in 207 patients, corresponding to a 91.6% (95% CI=88-95.2) rate at intention-to-treat analysis and 96.3% (95% CI=93.7-99) at per-protocol analysis. A total of 24 (10.6%) adverse events occurred, including 11 (4.9%) cases during the procedure, and 13 (5.7%) observed at follow-up (median=6 months; range: 2-12 months). A surgical approach was required in only 25% of patients with a major adverse event. No case of procedure-related death was reported.

486,Cross-sectional Survey on Lobectomy Approach (X-SOLA),"BACKGROUND: Lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be performed either through open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). To improve the understanding of current attitudes of the thoracic community toward VATS lobectomy, the Collaborative Research Group conducted the Cross-sectional Survey on Lobectomy Approach (X-SOLA) study. We surveyed a large cohort of lobectomy-performing thoracic surgeons to examine their adoption of VATS lobectomy and their opinions of this technique vs conventional open thoracotomy. METHODS: Participants included thoracic surgeons identified through an international index search from the Web of Science and the cardiothoracic surgery network. A confidential questionnaire was e-mailed in June 2012. Nonresponders were given two reminder e-mails at monthly intervals. RESULTS: The questionnaire, completed by 838 thoracic surgeons within a 3-month period, identified 416 surgeons who only performed lobectomy through open thoracotomy and 422 surgeons who performed VATS or robotic VATS. Of those who performed VATS, 95% agreed with the definition of \true\' VATS lobectomy according to the Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial.

487,Evidence for effective uses of dynamic visualisations in science curriculum materials,"Dynamic visualisations capture aspects of scientific phenomena that are difficult to communicate in static materials and benefit from well-designed scaffolds to succeed in classrooms. We review research to clarify the impacts of dynamic visualisations and to identify instructional scaffolds that mediate their success. We use meta-analysis to synthesise 47 independent comparisons between dynamic and static materials and 76 comparisons that test the effect of specific instructional scaffolds. These studies show that dynamic visualisations are better than static visuals at promoting conceptual inferences about science, consistent with the success of inquiry instruction in science. To realise this potential of dynamic visualisations, instruction needs to help students use the dynamic visualisation to make sense of their own ideas. Scaffolds that are most successful include prompts for reflection, prompts to distinguish among parts of the visualisation, visual cues that identify salient features, multiple visualisations presented sequentially, and interactive features that govern the pacing of activities. We extract guidelines from this research to help researchers plan future studies of visualisations, designers create and refine instructional materials using visualisations, and practitioners customise instruction that features visualisations.",Video Meta Results Raw,McElhaney KW and Chang HY and Chiu JL and Linn MC,,,0,435
488,Effectiveness of mobile technologies delivering Ecological Momentary Interventions for stress and anxiety: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: Mobile technologies may be suitable for delivering Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) to treat anxiety in real-time. This review aims to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of EMI for treating anxiety conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four databases and the reference lists of previous studies were searched. A total of 1949 abstracts were double screened for inclusion. Sufficient studies were available to undertake a quantitative meta-analysis on EMIs on generalized anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: The 15 randomized trials and randomized controlled trials examined anxiety (n = 7), stress (n = 3), anxiety and stress (n = 2), panic disorder (n = 2), and social phobia (n = 1). Eight EMIs comprised self-monitoring integrated with therapy modules, seven comprised multimedia content, and three comprised self-monitoring only. The quality of studies presented high risk of biases. Meta-analysis (n = 7) demonstrated that EMIs reduced generalized anxiety compared to control and/or comparison groups (Effect Size (ES) = 0.32, 95% CI, 0.12-0.53). Most EMIs targeting stress were reported effective relative to control as were the two EMIs targeting panic disorders. The EMI targeting social phobia was not effective. DISCUSSION: EMIs have potential in treating both anxiety and stress. However, few high-quality trials have been conducted for specific anxiety disorders. Further trials are needed to assess the value of EMI technologies for anxiety in enhancing existing treatments. CONCLUSION: This study found a small significant effect of EMI studies on reducing generalized anxiety. Studies on stress demonstrated EMI was effective compared to control, with the small number of studies on panic and social phobia demonstrating mixed results.",anxiety; anxiety disorders; mobile health; psychological stress; telemedicine; Video Meta Results Raw,Loo Gee B and Griffiths KM and Gulliver A,,,0,436

Many empirical studies have examined the effects of read-aloud accommodations; however, the results are mixed. With a variance-known hierarchical linear modeling approach, based on 114 effect sizes from 23 studies, a meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effects of read-aloud accommodations for students with and without disabilities. In general, both students with disabilities and students without disabilities benefited from the read-aloud accommodations, and the accommodation effect size for students with disabilities was significantly larger than the effect size for students without disabilities. Further, this meta-analysis reveals important factors that influence the effects of read-aloud accommodations. For instance, the accommodation effect was significantly stronger when the subject area was reading than when the subject area was math. The effect of read-aloud accommodations was also significantly stronger when the test was read by human proctors than when it was read by video/audio players or computers. Finally, the implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Li H,,,0,439

Any primary studies were included that focussed on allied health and distance delivery regardless of education topic or study design. Two independent reviewers extracted data and critically appraised the selected studies. RESULTS: The search returned 5257 results. With removal of duplicate references, we reviewed 3964 article titles and abstracts; n = 206 appeared potentially eligible and were scrutinised via full text screening; n = 14 were included. Studies were published between 1997 and 2016, were of varied methodological quality and were predominantly from Australia, USA and Canada with a focus on satisfaction of learners with the delivery method or on measures of educational outcomes. Technologies used to deliver distance education included video conference, teleconference, web based platforms and virtual reality. Early papers tended to focus more on the technology characteristics than educational outcomes. Some studies compared technology based delivery to face to face modes and found satisfaction and learning outcomes to be on par. Only three studies reported on practice change following the educational intervention and, despite a suggestion there is a link between the constructs, none measured the relationship between access to continuing professional development and workforce retention. CONCLUSION: Technology based options of delivery have a high utility, however the complex inter-relatedness of time, use, travel, location, costs, interactivity, learning outcomes and educational design suggest a need for more sophisticated consideration by educational providers.

493,Validity of cognitive load measures in simulation-based training: A systematic review,"Background Cognitive load theory (CLT) provides a rich framework to inform instructional design. Despite the applicability of CLT to simulation-based medical training, findings from multimedia learning have not been consistently replicated in this context. This lack of transferability may be related to issues in measuring cognitive load (CL) during simulation. The authors conducted a review of CLT studies across simulation training contexts to assess the validity evidence for different CL measures. Method PRISMA standards were followed. For 48 studies selected from a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and ERIC databases, information was extracted about study aims, methods, validity evidence of measures, and findings. Studies were categorized on the basis of findings and prevalence of validity evidence collected, and statistical comparisons between measurement types and research domains were pursued. Results CL during simulation training has been measured in diverse populations including medical trainees, pilots, and university students. Most studies (71%; 34) used self-report measures; others included secondary task performance, physiological indices, and observer ratings. Correlations between CL and learning varied from positive to negative. Overall validity evidence for CL measures was low (mean score 1.55/5). Studies reporting greater validity evidence were more likely to report that high CL impaired learning. Conclusions The authors found evidence that inconsistent correlations between CL and learning may be related to issues of validity in CL measures. Further research would benefit from rigorous documentation of validity and from triangulating measures of CL. This can better inform CLT instructional design for simulation-based medical training.",Video Meta Results Raw,Naismith LM and Cavalcanti RB,,,0,441
494,Gamification and Adherence to Web-Based Mental Health Interventions: A Systematic Review,"Background: Adherence to effective Web-based interventions for common mental disorders (CMDs) and well-being remains a critical issue, with clear potential to increase effectiveness. Continued identification and examination of \active\' technological components within Web-based interventions has been called for. Gamification is the use of game design elements and features in nongame contexts. Health and lifestyle interventions have implemented a variety of game features in their design in an effort to encourage engagement and increase program adherence. The potential influence of gamification on program adherence has not been examined in the context of Web-based interventions designed to manage CMDs and well-being. Objective: This study seeks to review the literature to examine whether gaming features predict or influence reported rates of program adherence in Web-based interventions designed to manage CMDs and well-being. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to manage CMDs or well-being and incorporated gamification features. Seven electronic databases were searched. Results: A total of 61 RCTs met the inclusion criteria and 47 different intervention programs were identified. The majority were designed to manage depression using cognitive behavioral therapy. Eight of 10 popular gamification features reviewed were in use. The majority of studies utilized only one gamification feature (n=58) with a maximum of three features. The most commonly used feature was story/theme. Levels and game leaders were not used in this context. No studies explicitly examined the role of gamification features on program adherence. Usage data were not commonly reported. Interventions intended to be 10 weeks in duration had higher mean adherence than those intended to be 6 or 8 weeks in duration. Conclusions: Gamification features have been incorporated into the design of interventions designed to treat CMD and well-being. Further research is needed to improve understanding of gamification features on adherence and engagement in order to inform the design of future Web-based health interventions in which adherence to treatment is of concern. Conclusions were limited by varied reporting of adherence and usage data.'",Video Meta Results Raw,Brown M and O'Neill N and van Woerden H and Eslambolchilar P and Jones M and John A,,,0,442
496,Strategy Training Eliminates Sex Differences in Spatial Problem Solving in a STEM Domain,"Poor spatial ability can limit success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ( STEM) disciplines. Many initiatives aim to increase STEM achievement and degree attainment through selective recruitment of high-spatial students or targeted training to improve spatial ability. The current study examines an alternative approach to increasing achievement that includes problem-solving strategy training. In this study, we examined how training in multiple problem-solving strategies affects science achievement and its relations to sex and spatial ability. We compared 3 interventions that trained either mental imagery strategies, analytic problem-solving strategies, or their combination in the context of a college chemistry course. As predicted, students adopted more analytic strategies after analytic training, and women used significantly more analytic strategies than men after instruction. Training in the combined use of mental imagery and analytic strategies eliminated sex differences in achievement, but training in a single type of strategy resulted in a male achievement advantage. Our work demonstrates that achievement is dependent not only on spatial ability but also on strategy choice, and that strategy training offers a viable route to improving the performance of female students.",Video Meta Results Raw,Stieff M and Dixon BL and Ryu M and Kumi BC and Hegarty M,,,0,443
499,A Pilot Study Examining Trainee Treatment Session Fidelity when Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) Is Implemented in Community Settings,"Research supports the impact of empirically based treatments, such as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), on producing positive treatment outcomes for clients. However, achieving outcomes in community settings that are similar to those found in research settings can be challenging, and little research has been conducted on how to best train community providers to implement PCIT with fidelity. This study assessed trainee implementation fidelity to the PCIT protocol in community settings. Session fidelity was reviewed for trainees using pre-established session integrity checklists and post hoc video review of key sessions. Analyses revealed that trainees maintained strong overall session fidelity, although fidelity percentages varied by session type and treatment phase. Results also highlight those session content items that are frequently left out by trainees during implementation. Implications of these findings, limitations, and future directions for research and PCIT workshops and consultation are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Travis JK and Brestan-Knight E,,,0,444
500,Participation can make a difference to be competitive in sports: A systematic review on the relation between complex motor development and self-controlled learning settings,"The purpose of the study was to provide an empirically based argument that grounds the relation between potentials of athletic performance and participatory settings within the autonomous inner logic of competitive sports. Therefore, the present paper systematically reviewed the empirical evidence of the association between complex motor learning and performance, and self-controlled practice conditions. Six electronic databases, reference lists and citations of full-text articles were searched for English and German language peer-reviewed articles. The search string multiply combined different terms relating to motor learning AND self-control. Two reviewers evaluated the full-text articles and critically appraised the included studies. Thirty-one studies with 1273 participants met the inclusion criteria. The vast majority of the studies reported significant learning advantages for experimental groups under self-controlled practice conditions compared to experimenter-imposed yoked groups. No study showed adverse effects. Thereby, the effects of self-controlled practice conditions have been shown to be relatively generalised to a variety of participatory variables and target groups. Advantages in accuracy, form and performance were more frequently reported than advantages in consistency. Despite increasing research efforts, the explanatory underpinnings behind the learning benefits remain debatable. The evidence indicates that complex motor learning and motor performance are typically enhanced when learners are given the opportunity to take part in decisions and therefore presents profitable implications for coaches and anyone responsible in competitive sports. However, in order to become a professional effective argument, the social context and the status of reasoning in changing habits need to be considered.","Cognitive psychology; decision making; feedback; motivation; motor learning; practice; AUTONOMY SUPPORT; CONTROLLED FEEDBACK; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK; ADDITIVE BENEFITS; VIDEO FEEDBACK; EXTERNAL FOCUS; EXPECTANCIES; SATISFACTION; PREFERENCES; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism; Psychology, Applied; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Jaitner D and Mess F,,,0,445
501,Effects of short-term video-based interventions and instructions on teachers' feedback skills to support students' self-regulated learning,"It was investigated whether teachers' feedback skills to support students' self-regulated learning (SRL) can be improved by short-term video-based interventions and/or direct instructions that were adapted to a SRL framework. Forty pre-service and 40 in-service teachers were assigned to a video + instruction or an instruction-only condition. Highest improvements were expected for the combination of the two interventions. However, results indicated that functional feedback to support SRL benefited most from instruction-only, while the reduction of dysfunctional feedback was highest in the video + instruction condition. The findings have practical implications for the design of interventions to improve teachers' feedback skills.","Improving teachers' feedback skills; Video-based interventions; Text-; picture comprehension; PROFESSIONAL VISION; TASK-PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; EXPERIENCE; EDUCATION; METAANALYSIS; PERCEPTION; MOTIVATION; MODEL; TEXT; Psychology, Educational; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Baadte C,,,0,446
502,Does training with 3D videos improve decision-making in team invasion sports?,"We examined the effectiveness of video-based decision training in national youth handball teams. Extending previous research, we tested in Study 1 whether a three-dimensional (3D) video training group would outperform a two-dimensional (2D) group. In Study 2, a 3D training group was compared to a control group and a group trained with a traditional tactic board. In both studies, training duration was 6weeks. Performance was measured in a pre- to post-retention design. The tests consisted of a decision-making task measuring quality of decisions (first and best option) and decision time (time for first and best option). The results of Study 1 showed learning effects and revealed that the 3D video group made faster first-option choices than the 2D group, but differences in the quality of options were not pronounced. The results of Study 2 revealed learning effects for both training groups compared to the control group, and faster choices in the 3D group compared to both other groups. Together, the results show that 3D video training is the most useful tool for improving choices in handball, but only in reference to decision time and not decision quality. We discuss the usefulness of a 3D video tool for training of decision-making skills outside the laboratory or gym.",Video Meta Results Raw,Hohmann T and Obeloeer H and Schlapkohl N and Raab M,,,0,447

What documented effects do these measures have? Empirical studies describing and assessing cognitive accessibility measures were identified by searches of 13 databases. Data were extracted and methodological quality was assessed. Findings were analyzed and recommendations for practice and research were made. Twenty-nine articles with considerable variations in studied accessibility measures, diagnoses, methods, outcome measures, and quality were included. They address the use of Internet, e-mail, telephone, chat, television, multimedia interfaces, texts and pictures, operation of equipment, and entering of information. Although thin, the current evidence base indicates that the accessibility needs, requirements, and preferences of people with cognitive disabilities are diverse. This ought to be reflected in accessibility guidelines and standards. Studies to systematically develop and recommend effective accessibility measures are needed to address current knowledge gaps. © 2014, The Author(s).",Accessibility; Cognitive disabilities; Communication; ICT; Usability; Communication; Multimedia systems; Accessibility; Accessibility guidelines; Accessibility measures; Cognitive disability; Electronic communications; ICT; Scientific literature; Usability; Transportation; Video Meta Results Raw,Borg J and Lantz A and Gulliksen J,,,0,448
504,A systematic review of strategies and computer-based intervention (CBI) for reading comprehension of children with autism,"This paper presents a systematic review of relevant published studies on reading comprehension for children with autism, focusing on vocabulary instruction and text comprehension instruction from years 2000 to 2011. This systematic review attempts to address three specific research questions: strategies of vocabulary instruction and text comprehension instruction used, computer-based intervention (CBI) used or developed during study, and the effectiveness of using CBI for teaching children with autism. There are five strategies of vocabulary instruction and seven strategies of text comprehension instruction. Results indicate that two strategies of vocabulary instruction, multimedia methods and explicit instruction were found to be more commonly used than the other three. On the same note, question answering strategy of text comprehension instruction was discovered to be used more often than the other six. Results also indicate that children with autism can benefit from the strategies of reading comprehension and that the use of CBI as a mode of instruction for reading comprehension improved learning of children. This is clearly evident judging from the performance of children between pre-tests and post-tests of studies in which CBI was used. However, due to heterogeneity of participants, this is not always the case; a few studies reported no improvement in the learning of children with autism.

505,A meta-analysis of heritability of cognitive aging: minding the \missing heritability\' gap',"The etiologies underlying variation in adult cognitive performance and cognitive aging have enjoyed much attention in the literature, but much of that attention has focused on broad factors, principally general cognitive ability. The current review provides meta-analyses of age trends in heritability of specific cognitive abilities and considers the profile of genetic and environmental factors contributing to cognitive aging to address the 'missing heritability' issue. Our findings, based upon evaluating 27 reports in the literature, indicate that verbal ability demonstrated declining heritability, after about age 60, as did spatial ability and perceptual speed more modestly. Trends for general memory, working memory, and spatial ability generally indicated stability, or small increases in heritability in mid-life. Equivocal results were found for executive function. A second meta-analysis then considered the gap between twin-based versus SNP-based heritability derived from population-based GWAS studies. Specifically, we considered twin correlation ratios to agnostically re-evaluate biometrical models across age and by cognitive domain. Results modestly suggest that nonadditive genetic variance may become increasingly important with age, especially for verbal ability. If so, this would support arguments that lower SNP-based heritability estimates result in part from uncaptured non-additive influences (e.g., dominance, gene-gene interactions), and possibly gene-environment (GE) correlations. Moreover, consistent with longitudinal twin studies of aging, as rearing environment becomes a distal factor, increasing genetic variance may result in part from nonadditive genetic influences or possible GE correlations. Sensitivity to life course dynamics is crucial to understanding etiological contributions to adult cognitive performance and cognitive aging.","Lifespan development; Cognitive aging; Specific cognitive abilities; Twins; Missing heritability; Meta-analysis; Aging; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive Aging; Databases, Bibliographic; Genetic Variation; Humans; Twin Studies as Topic; Aging; Cognitive Ability; Etiology; Gerontology; Life Span; Executive Function; Video Meta Results Raw",Reynolds CA and Finkel D,,,0,450
506,A meta-analysis of self-regulated learning in work-related training and educational attainment: What we know and where we need to go,"Researchers have been applying their knowledge of goal-oriented behavior to the self-regulated learning domain for more than 30 years. This review examines the current state of research on self-regulated learning and gaps in the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning of work-related knowledge and skills. Self-regulation theory was used as a conceptual lens for deriving a heuristic framework of 16 fundamental constructs that constitute self-regulated learning. Meta-analytic findings (k = 430, N = 90,380) support theoretical propositions that self-regulation constructs are interrelated—30% of the corrected correlations among constructs were .50 or greater. Goal level, persistence, effort, and self-efficacy were the self-regulation constructs with the strongest effects on learning. Together these constructs accounted for 17% of the variance in learning, after controlling for cognitive ability and pretraining knowledge. However, 4 self-regulatory processes—planning, monitoring, help seeking, and emotion control—did not exhibit significant relationships with learning. Thus, a parsimonious framework of the self-regulated learning domain is presented that focuses on a subset of self-regulatory processes that have both limited overlap with other core processes and meaningful effects on learning. Research is needed to advance the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning in an increasingly complex and knowledge-centric work environment. Such investigations should capture the dynamic nature of self-regulated learning, address the role of self-regulation in informal learning, and investigate how trainees regulate their transfer of training.

507,The effects of input-enhanced instruction on Iranian EFL learners' production of appropriate and accurate suggestions,"This study investigates the relative effectiveness of four types of input-enhanced instruction on the development of Iranian EFL learners' production of pragmatically appropriate and grammatically accurate suggestions. Over a 16-week course, input delivered through video clips was enhanced differently in four intact classes: (1) metapragmatic explanation (n = 21), (2) form-comparison (n = 21), (3) typographically enhanced input along with input flooding (n = 25) and (4) meaning-focused (n = 28). The four treatment groups were compared with a control group (n = 15) on pre-test and post-test performance, each test comprising two production tasks: leaving a message on an answerphone and sending an email. The results revealed that the treatment groups improved on the post-test in comparison to the pre-test, outperforming the control group. Although this improvement was significant for all four treatment groups on the email task, the form-comparison and the metapragmatic explanation groups performed significantly better than the other two treatment groups on the answerphone task. This study proposes that pedagogic treatment in this area of research is better operationalised by degree of input enhancement than by dichotomies such as explicit versus implicit or deductive versus inductive learning.",interlanguage pragmatics; speech act of suggesting; pragmatic instruction; input enhancement; INTERLANGUAGE PRAGMATIC DEVELOPMENT; L2 INSTRUCTION; METAANALYSIS; EXPLICIT; ADVICE; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Ghavamnia M and Eslami-Rasekh A and Dastjerdi HV,,,0,452
508,The effect of cognitive-based training for the healthy older people: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: From the perspective of disease prevention, the enhancement of cognitive function among the healthy older people has become an important issue in many countries lately. This study aim to investigate the effect of cognitive-based training on the overall cognitive function, memory, attention, executive function, and visual-spatial ability of the healthy older people. METHODS: Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL of selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and previous systematic reviews were searched for eligible studies. The population focused on this study were healthy older people who participated in randomized controlled trials that investigated the effectiveness of cognitive-based training. The outcomes including change in overall cognitive function, memory, attention, executive function, and visual-spatial ability. RESULTS: We collected a total of 31 RCTs, the results showed that cognitive-based training has a moderate effect on overall cognitive function (g = 0.419; 95%CI = 0.205-0.634) and executive function (g = 0.420; 95%CI = 0.239-0.602), and a small effect on the memory (g = 0.354; 95%CI = 0.244-0.465), attention (g = 0.218; 95%CI = 0.125-0.311), and visual-spatial ability (g = 0.183;95%CI = 0.015-0.352) in healthy older people. Subgroup analysis indicated the intervention characteristics of ≧3 times each week (p = 0.042), ≧8 total training weeks (p = 0.003) and ≧24 total training sessions (p = 0.040) yields a greater effect size. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-based training is effective for the healthy older people.

509,Physical activity and cardiovascular prevention: Is healthy urban living a possible reality or utopia?,"Favoring correct lifestyles is the most important measure to contrast cardiovascular diseases and the epidemic of high cardiovascular risk conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Lifestyle is a broad expression that includes diet, physical exercise, and psychological and socio-economic factors, each of which must be taken into due consideration because of their intertwining influences, which may be a barrier to healthy changes at both the individual and population levels. While physical activity has probably received less attention in the last decades, it is likely the most important among the modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Improving the habitual physical activity level is an achievable goal, and even small improvements may have important favorable effects on health. Strategies at the population level have to be urgently taken, and involve not only public health, but also administrators and politicians, starting from a rethinking of our cities.

510,The Effectiveness of Technology-Mediated Dance Interventions and Their Impact on Psychosocial Factors in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Engaging in physical activity contributes to healthy aging; however, adherence to exercise programs is often low among older adults. Technology-mediated dance systems, which can be used at home, and dance as a way of keeping physically active have been receiving attention as a means of not only enabling physical activity among older people but may also address key psychosocial factors that are amenable to change. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of technology-mediated dance interventions and their impact on psychosocial factors in older adults (aged 65 or older). Methods: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials from January 2000 to February 2017 using key search terms. Two independent reviewers screened articles using predetermined selection criteria. Risk of bias of selected articles was assessed in accordance with the Cochrane guidelines. Results: From an overall 264 articles, six articles (five studies) were found, which assessed the impact of technology-mediated dance interventions on psychosocial factors in older adults. Studies' quality ratings were low, with exception of one study that was considered of moderate quality. None of the studies considered psychosocial factors as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes assessed fear of falling, depression, and training enjoyment, but no study showed evidence of an effective impact on these variables. The meta-analysis revealed low quality evidence that there was little or no difference above that of the comparison groups for fear of falling (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.37 to 0.33; P = 0.91; five trials). Similarly, there was little or no difference on depression (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.47; P = 0.83; three trials). Conclusion: Existing evidence to support the effectiveness of technology-mediated dance interventions and their impact on psychosocial factors in older adults is weak and with a high risk for bias. The findings of this review may inform future, more rigorous research in the area.","Dance; Technology; Older adults; Seniors; Dance Dance Revolution; StepMania; Psychosocial; Quality of life; Fear of falling; Depression; Enjoyment; Randomized controlled trials; INTERACTIVE VIDEO DANCE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; EXERCISE PROGRAM; FALL RISK; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; PARKINSON DISEASE; EXERGAMES; BALANCE; Health Policy & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation; Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Silva PA and Cochrane A and Farrell H,,,0,455
511,Exploring Differences Among Video Gamers With and Without Depression: Contrasting Emotion Regulation and Mindfulness,"Video games are a leisure activity with mass appeal for individuals of all ages. However, for some individuals, playing video games may become problematic and addictive, resulting in negative consequences affecting their physical, social, and psychological well-being. Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has estimated prevalence rates of around 3 percent and has been strongly associated with several psychopathologies, including depression. Given that emotion regulation (ER) and mindfulness are fluid constructs that can be enhanced, the potential for intervention and prevention is considerable. Thus, this study sought to, as a first step in determining clinical relevance, explore the differences in ER, mindfulness, and impulsivity among emerging adult gamers who met criteria for IGD, depression, or both IGD and depression (Dep + IGD). A sample of 1,536 gamers (45 percent male, M-age = 20.45 years old) completed an online survey, including an assessment for IGD, depression, difficulties with ER, impulsivity, and mindfulness. Relative to individuals below IGD and depression cutoffs (control), the clinical groups (IGD, depression, and Dep + IGD) reported greater ER difficulties, higher impulsivity, and lower mindfulness. Finally, relative to the IGD + depression group, the other two clinical groups had fewer difficulties with cognitive impulsivity, whereas the depression group reported more difficulties with strategy use. These results suggest that gamers should be considered a heterogeneous group and that comorbid disorders are important considerations when developing targeted treatments for individuals with IGD.","depression; emotion regulation; internet gaming disorder; emerging adults; mindfulness; INTERNET GAMING DISORDER; QUESTIONNAIRE; DIFFICULTIES; METAANALYSIS; PREVALENCE; VALIDATION; CONSTRUCT; SUBSTANCE; VALIDITY; HEALTH; Psychology, Social; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Marchica LA and Mills DJ and Keough MT and Derevensky JL,,,0,456

The present study sought to evaluate the use of a video modeling intervention for increasing positive peer interactions among four preschool boys who were assessed as having poor social skills. The video modeling intervention was evaluated in a delayed multiple probe across participants design. The video depicted successful entry of a peer in a play routine and maintenance of positive play behavior by the peer. Positive outcomes were achieved for two participants and variable outcomes for the remaining two children. Teachers and parents rated the intervention as acceptable. The results suggest an improvement in the amount of time engaged in positive social interactions with peers for two of the four participants with the onset of the video modeling intervention. The findings are discussed in relation to implications for early childhood practice and future research in the area.,Video Meta Results Raw,Green VA and Drysdale H and Boelema T and Smart E and van der Meer L and Achmadi D and Prior T and O'Reilly M and Diddert R and Lancioni G,,,0,457
513,Simulated presence therapy for dementia,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a common and serious neuropsychiatric syndrome, characterised by progressive cognitive and functional decline. The majority of people with dementia develop behavioural disturbances, also known as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Several non-pharmacological interventions have been evaluated to treat BPSD in people with dementia. Simulated presence therapy (SPT), an intervention that uses video or audiotape recordings of family members played to the person with dementia, is a possible approach to treat BPSD. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of SPT on behavioural and psychological symptoms and quality of life in people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS (the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library) (9 February 2016), MEDLINE Ovid SP (1946 to 6 January 2017), Embase Ovid SP (1972 to 6 January 2017), PsycINFO Ovid SP (1806 to 6 January 2017), CINAHL via EBSCOhost (1980 to 6 January 2017), LILACS via BIREME (all dates to 6 January 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov) (all dates to 6 January 2017), and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal (apps.who.int/trialsearch) (all dates to 6 January 2017). We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles to identify any additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, including cross-over studies, that evaluated the efficacy of SPT, consisting of personalised audio or videotape recordings of family members, in people with any form of dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. No meta-analyses were conducted because of substantial heterogeneity among the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials with 144 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two of the trials had a randomised cross-over design, one was a cross-over trial which we classified as quasi-randomised.Participants in the included studies were people with dementia living in nursing homes. They were predominantly women and had a mean age of over 80 years. SPT was performed using an audio or video recording prepared by family members or surrogates. It varied in its content, frequency of administration and duration. All the studies compared multiple treatments. In one study, SPT was compared with two other interventions; in the other two studies, it was compared with three other interventions. Specifically, SPT was compared to usual care, personalised music (two studies), a 'placebo' audiotape containing the voice of a person (two studies), and one-to-one social interaction performed by trained research assistants (one study). In terms of outcomes evaluated, one study considered agitation and withdrawn behaviour (both assessed with three methods); the second study evaluated verbal disruptive behaviour (assessed with three methods); and the third study evaluated physically agitated behaviour and verbally agitated behaviour (the method used was not clearly described).According to the GRADE criteria, the overall quality of the evidence was very low due to very small numbers of participants and risk of bias in the included studies; (none of the trials was at low risk of selection bias; all the trials were at high risk of performance bias; one trial was at high risk of attrition bias; and all had unclear selective reporting).Because of variation in the participants, the format of SPT, the comparison interventions, and the measures used to assess outcomes, we judged the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis.Within each trial, the effect of SPT on behaviour, compared to usual care, was mixed and depended on the measure used. Two trials which included a personalised music intervention reported no significant differences between simulated presence and music on behavioural outcomes. Because the overall quality of the evidence was very low, we were very uncertain regarding all the resultsNone of the studies evaluated quality of life or any of our secondary outcome measures (performance of activities of daily living, dropout and carer burden). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of SPT for treating behavioural and psychological symptoms and improving quality of life of people with dementia. New high-quality studies are needed to investigate the effect of SPT.","NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS; PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PHARMACOLOGICAL-TREATMENT; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIOR; PEOPLE; INTERVENTION; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Abraha I and Rimland JM and Lozano-Montoya I and Dell'Aquila G and Vélez-Díaz-Pallarés M and Trotta FM and Cruz-Jentoft AJ and Cherubini A,,,0,458

515,Resist Forgetting: Effects of Aerobic and Resistance Exercise on Prospective and Retrospective Memory,"Previous research indicates that an acute bout of exercise enhances retrospective memory (i.e., memory for previously learned information, facts, and events). However, the vast majority of this research has used aerobic exercise, and few studies have examined the effects of acute bouts of resistance exercise (strength training). Moreover, researchers have yet to examine the effects of either aerobic or resistance exercise on prospective memory (i.e., the ability to remember to execute tasks in the future). Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of acute bouts of aerobic and resistance exercise on prospective and retrospective memory. A between-groups experimental design was used in which 120 students were randomly assigned to watch viral videos for 30 min while performing moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or sitting (control). Three prospective memory tests and two retrospective memory tests were assigned before the exercise phase. Participants were instructed to execute one prospective memory test during the exercise phase and to execute the remaining prospective and retrospective memory tests after the exercise phase. Relative to aerobic exercise, sitting enhanced prospective memory performance during the exercise phase. In contrast, relative to sitting and aerobic exercise, resistance exercise enhanced performance on one of the prospective memory tests that required execution after the exercise phase. These results indicate that prospective memory is diminished during acute bouts of aerobic exercise (likely due to distraction) but is enhanced shortly after resistance exercise. Thus, resistance exercise may represent a viable strategy for improving prospective memory.","cardiovascular exercise; strength training; cognition; memory; prospective memory; MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS; ACUTE PHYSICAL-EXERCISE; WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; OLDER-ADULTS; PERFORMANCE; METAANALYSIS; TASKS; YOUNG; BOUT; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism; Psychology, Applied; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Cuttler C and Connolly CP and LaFrance EM and Lowry TM,,,0,460
516,A systematic review and meta-analysis on pulmonary resections by robotic video-assisted thoracic surgery,"Background: Pulmonary resection by robotic video-assisted thoracic surgery (RVATS) has been performed for selected patients in specialized centers over the past decade. Despite encouraging results from case-series reports, there remains a lack of robust clinical evidence for this relatively novel surgical technique. The present systematic review aimed to assess the short-and long-term safety and efficacy of RVATS. Methods: Nine relevant and updated studies were identified from 12 institutions using five electronic databases. Endpoints included perioperative morbidity and mortality, conversion rate, operative time, length of hospitalization, intraoperative blood loss, duration of chest drainage, recurrence rate and longterm survival. In addition, cost analyses and quality of life assessments were also systematically evaluated. Comparative outcomes were meta-analyzed when data were available. Results: All institutions used the same master-slave robotic system (da Vinci, Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, California) and most patients underwent lobectomies for early-stage non-small cell lung cancers. Perioperative mortality rates for patients who underwent pulmonary resection by RVATS ranged from 0-3.8%, whilst overall morbidity rates ranged from 10-39%. Two propensity-score analyses compared patients with malignant disease who underwent pulmonary resection by RVATS or thoracotomy, and a meta-analysis was performed to identify a trend towards fewer complications after RVATS. In addition, one cost analysis and one quality of life study reported improved outcomes for RVATS when compared to open thoracotomy. Conclusions: Results of the present systematic review suggest that RVATS is feasible and can be performed safely for selected patients in specialized centers. Perioperative outcomes including postoperative complications were similar to historical accounts of conventional VATS. A steep learning curve for RVATS was identified in a number of institutional reports, which was most evident in the first 20 cases. Future studies should aim to present data with longer follow-up, clearly defined surgical outcomes, and through an intention-to-treat analysis.",Video Meta Results Raw,Cao C and Manganas C and Ang SC and Yan TD,,,0,461
517,Locomotion improves children's spatial search: A meta-analytic review,"This meta-analysis quantitatively summarized the developmental influence and the effects of locomotor experience as well as the benefits of locomotor practice, locomotor assistance, and active searching patterns on children's search performance. Based on specific criteria, a search of a database and reference lists identified 19 studies, including 1,029 children (510 boys and 519 girls) from 4 to 144 months of age. Outcome measures of spatial performance were converted to 83 effect sizes that reflected the effects of specific experimental characteristics. Analyses of variance indicated that with older children, locomotor activities are more important to their spatial searching. Locomotor status, searching patterns, locomotor assistance, test conditions, and test reliability were identified as moderator variables. In addition, locomotor training significantly improved children's spatial search. The results supported the hypothesis that children's development of spatial search skills is influenced by locomotor experience.

518,Do measures of cognitive load explain the spatial split-attention principle in multimedia learning environments? A systematic review,"The spatial split-attention principle suggests that presenting related words and pictures spatially close to one another will improve learning compared with a spatially distant design, and two meta-analyses have shown support for the principle. However, it is not clear why the principle occurs. It has been theorized that integrated graphic designs lower the extraneous cognitive load imposed on learners, however, there has not been a systematic review to examine the evidence for this claim. In this study, we systematically review the literature around the spatial split-attention principle in multimedia learning environments to examine if measures of cognitive load support the theoretical prediction. Our analysis of 41 comparisons found that measures of cognitive load largely do not support the extraneous cognitive load explanation, nor did we find compelling evidence that integrated graphic designs significantly influence any measure of cognitive load compared with spatially distant designs. We propose an alternative explanation for the principle in which integrated graphic designs may facilitate the allocation of germane resources and integrative cognitive processing rather than reduce extraneous cognitive load and discuss a theoretical foundation for testing this hypothesis.

519,Response inhibition and Internet Gaming Disorder: A meta-analysis,"Previous research has demonstrated that Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) has multiple negative effects in psychological functioning and health. This makes the identification of its underpinnings, such as response inhibition, essential for the development of relevant interventions that target these core features of the disorder resulting in more effective treatment. Several empirical studies have evaluated the relationship between response inhibition deficits and IGD using neurocognitive tasks, but provided mixed results. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies using three neurocognitive tasks, the Go/No Go, the Stroop, and the Stop-Signal tasks, to integrate existing research and estimate the magnitude of this relationship. We found a medium overall effect size (d = 0.56, 95% CI [0.32, 0.80]) indicating that compared with healthy individuals, individuals with IGD are more likely to exhibit impaired response inhibition. This finding is in alignment with literature on inhibition and addictive and impulsive behaviors, as well as with neuroimaging research. Theoretical implications regarding the conceptualization of IGD as a clinical disorder, shared commonalities with externalizing psychopathology, and clinical implications for treatment are discussed.

520,The role of pre-training interventions in learning: A meta-analysis and integrative review,"Learning is one of the main goals of any training program. Much research has focused on how learning may be enhanced through effective training design. We compiled the extant literature exploring the efficacy of five common pre-training interventions in promoting learning. Meta-analytic results (k =159; total N =13,684) reveal consistent positive effects for the role of such interventions in learning. Attentional advice and goal orientation (as compared with meta-cognitive strategies, advance organizers and preparatory information) yielded the most consistent learning gains. Results suggest intervention format, implementation, and match to learning outcome are important considerations. Recommendations are provided for interventions which are useful in promoting cognitive, skill-based, and affective learning gains.

522,Usability Evaluation Methods for Gesture-Based Games: A Systematic Review,"Background: Gestural interaction systems are increasingly being used, mainly in games, expanding the idea of entertainment and providing experiences with the purpose of promoting better physical and/or mental health. Therefore, it is necessary to establish mechanisms for evaluating the usability of these interfaces, which make gestures the basis of interaction, to achieve a balance between functionality and ease of use. Objective: This study aims to present the results of a systematic review focused on usability evaluation methods for gesture-based games, considering devices with motion-sensing capability. We considered the usability methods used, the common interface issues, and the strategies adopted to build good gesture-based games. Methods: The research was centered on four electronic databases: IEEE, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Springer, and Science Direct from September 4 to 21, 2015. Within 1427 studies evaluated, 10 matched the eligibility criteria. As a requirement, we considered studies about gesture-based games, Kinect and/or Wii as devices, and the use of a usability method to evaluate the user interface. Results: In the 10 studies found, there was no standardization in the methods because they considered diverse analysis variables. Heterogeneously, authors used different instruments to evaluate gesture-based interfaces and no default approach was proposed. Questionnaires were the most used instruments (70%, 7/10), followed by interviews (30%, 3/10), and observation and video recording (20%, 2/10). Moreover, 60% (6/10) of the studies used gesture-based serious games to evaluate the performance of elderly participants in rehabilitation tasks. This highlights the need for creating an evaluation protocol for older adults to provide a user-friendly interface according to the user's age and limitations. Conclusions: Through this study, we conclude this field is in need of a usability evaluation method for serious games, especially games for older adults, and that the definition of a methodology and a test protocol may offer the user more comfort, welfare, and confidence.",Video Meta Results Raw,Simor FW and Brum MR and Ebertz Schmidt JD and Rieder R and Bertoletti De Marchi AC,,,0,466

525,Feasibility of endoscopic mucosa-submucosa clip closure method (with video),"Background and study aims We developed a new endoscopic closure technique using just conventional endoclips. The feasibility of endoscopic mucosa-submucosa clip closure method was evaluated in this clinical pilot study. Patients and methods This study involved consecutive 25 patients who underwent colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection. Endoclips were placed at the edge of the mucosal defect. Each arm of the endoclip gripped the mucosa and submucosa, respectively. The direction in which the endoclip grips were placed was parallel to the short axis of the defect. Several endoclips were applied in this way. As a result, the mucosal defect was significantly reduced in size. Additional clips were placed to achieve complete closure. Results Mean size of resected specimen was 31.2 +/- 11 mm. The success rate was 96% (24/25). Mean procedure time was 9.6 +/- 4.4 minutes. Mean number of endoclips was 9.3 +/- 3.7. No complications were observed in any of the patients after the procedure. Conclusion Endoscopic mucosa-submucosa clip closure method could close mucosal defect of size around 2-4cm completely using just conventional endoclips, and it seems easy, simple and low cost.",THE-SCOPE CLIP; SUTURING METHOD; DISSECTION; RESECTION; DEFECTS; METAANALYSIS; OUTCOMES; Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Video Meta Results Raw,Nishizawa T and Banno S and Kinoshita S and Mori H and Nakazato Y and Hirai Y and Kubosawa Y and Sunata Y and Matsushita M and Uraoka T,,,0,468
526,Development and Validation of Objective and Quantitative Eye Tracking-Based Measures of Autism Risk and Symptom Levels,"Objective: The primary aim of this study was to develop and validate eye tracking based measures for estimating autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk and quantifying autism symptom levels. Method: Eye tracking data were collected from youth during an initial evaluation visit, with administrators blinded to all clinical information. Consensus diagnoses were given by the multidisciplinary team. Participants viewed a 5-minute video that included 44 dynamic stimuli from 7 distinct paradigms while gaze was recorded. Gaze metrics were computed for temporally defined regions of interest. Autism risk and symptom indices aggregated gaze measures showing significant bivariate relationships with ASD diagnosis and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2) symptom severity levels in a training sample (75%, n = 150). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and nonparametric correlations were used to cross-validate findings in a test sample (25%; n = 51). Results: Most children (n = 201, 92%) completed a valid eye tracking assessment (ages 1.6-17.6; 80% male; ASD n = 91, non-ASD n -= 110). In the test subsample, the autism risk index had high accuracy for ASD diagnosis (area under the curve [AUG] = 0.86, 95% CI =0.75-0.95), whereas the autism symptom index was strongly associated with ADOS-2 total severity scores (r = 0.41, p .001). Conclusion: Eye tracking measures appear to be useful quantitative, objective measures of ASD risk and autism symptom levels. If independently replicated and scaled for clinical use, eye tracking based measures could be used to inform clinical judgment regarding ASD identification and to track autism symptom levels.","autism spectrum disorder; eye tracking; gaze; risk assessment; diagnosis; DIAGNOSTIC OBSERVATION SCHEDULE; COMBINING INFORMATION; SOCIAL ATTENTION; MULTIPLE SOURCES; METAANALYSIS; SEVERITY; ACCURACY; SCORES; ASD; Psychology, Developmental; Pediatrics; Psychiatry; Psychology; Pediatrics; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw",Frazier TW and Klingemier EW and Parikh S and Speer L and Strauss MS and Eng C and Hardan AY and Youngstrom EA,,,0,469

529,Developing the Storyline for an Advance Care Planning Video for Surgery Patients: Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Engagement from Stakeholder Summit to State Fair,"BACKGROUND: Patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) methods and social learning theory (SLT) require intensive interaction between researchers and stakeholders. Advance care planning (ACP) is valuable before major surgery, but a systematic review found no extant perioperative ACP tools. Consequently, PCOR methods and SLT can inform the development of an ACP educational video for patients and families preparing for major surgery. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to develop and test acceptability of an ACP video storyline. DESIGN: The design is a stakeholder-guided development of the ACP video storyline. Design-thinking methods explored and prioritized stakeholder perspectives. Patients and family members evaluated storyboards containing the proposed storyline. SETTING/SUBJECTS: The study was conducted at hospital outpatient surgical clinics, in-person stakeholder summit, and the 2014 Maryland State Fair. MEASUREMENTS: Measurements are done through stakeholder engagement and deidentified survey. RESULTS: Stakeholders evaluated and prioritized evidence from an environmental scan. A surgeon, family member, and palliative care physician team iteratively developed a script featuring 12 core themes and worked with a medical graphic designer to translate the script into storyboards. For 10 days, 359 attendees of the 2014 Maryland State Fair evaluated the storyboards and 87% noted that they would be \very comfortable\' or \'comfortable\' seeing the storyboard before major surgery",89% considered the storyboards \'very helpful\' or \'helpful,Aslakson RA and Schuster AL and Lynch TJ and Weiss MJ and Gregg L and Miller J and Isenberg SR and Crossnohere NL and Conca-Cheng AM and Volandes AE and Smith TJ and Bridges JF,,,0,472
530,Computerised cognitive training for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life,"BACKGROUND: Increasing age is associated with a natural decline in cognitive function and is also the greatest risk factor for dementia. Cognitive decline and dementia are significant threats to independence and quality of life in older adults. Therefore, identifying interventions that help to maintain cognitive function in older adults or to reduce the risk of dementia is a research priority. Cognitive training uses repeated practice on standardised exercises targeting one or more cognitive domains and is intended to maintain optimum cognitive function. This review examines the effect of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks on the cognitive function of healthy adults aged 65 or older. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks for the maintenance or improvement of cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life. SEARCH METHODS: We searched to 31 March 2018 in ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois) and performed additional searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP (www.apps.who.int/trialsearch) to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were cognitively healthy people, and at least 80% of the study population had to be aged 65 or older. Experimental interventions adhered to the following criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive intervention - including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality - that involved repeated practice on standardised exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function; duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or inactive control interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We performed preliminary screening of search results using a 'crowdsourcing' method to identify RCTs. At least two review authors working independently screened the remaining citations against inclusion criteria. At least two review authors also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs. Where appropriate, we synthesised data in random-effect meta-analyses, comparing computerised cognitive training (CCT) separately with active and inactive controls. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE methods to describe the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We identified eight RCTs with a total of 1183 participants. Researchers provided interventions over 12 to 26 weeks; in five trials, the duration of intervention was 12 or 13 weeks. The included studies had a moderate risk of bias. Review authors noted a lot of inconsistency between trial results. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes.We compared CCT first against active control interventions, such as watching educational videos. Because of the very low quality of the evidence, we were unable to determine any effect of CCT on our primary outcome of global cognitive function or on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, speed of processing, executive function, and working memory.We also compared CCT versus inactive control (no interventions). Negative SMDs favour CCT over control. We found no studies on our primary outcome of global cognitive function. In terms of our secondary outcomes, trial results suggest slight improvement in episodic memory (mean difference (MD) -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.73 to -0.07; 150 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence) and no effect on executive function (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.15; 292 participants; 2 studies; low-quality evidence), working memory (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.27; 60 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence), or verbal fluency (MD -0.11, 95% CI -1.58 to 1.36; 150 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence). We could not determine any effects on speed of processing at trial endpoints because the evidence was of very low quality.We found no evidence on quality of life, activities of daily living, or adverse effects in either comparison. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence from the included studies to suggest that 12 or more weeks of CCT improves cognition in healthy older adults. However, our limited confidence in the results reflects the overall quality of the evidence. Inconsistency between trials was a major limitation. In five of the eight trials, the duration of intervention was just three months. The possibility that longer periods of training could be beneficial remains to be more fully explored.","RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; GAMES ENHANCES ASPECTS; OLDER-ADULTS EVIDENCE; WORKING-MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EXERCISE PROGRAM; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; LEISURE ACTIVITIES; BRAIN RESERVE; SINGLE-BLIND; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Gates NJ and Rutjes AW and Di Nisio M and Karim S and Chong LY and March E and Martínez G and Vernooij RW,,,0,473
531,The effects of hypertext glosses on L2 vocabulary acquisition: a meta-analysis,"This study examines (1) the effects of hypertext gloss use on L2 vocabulary acquisition in computerized reading contexts; (2) which specific combination of either text-only (single) or text + visual (multiple) hypertext glosses is more effective on L2 vocabulary acquisition; and (3) potential moderators to systematically account for between study variation. In addition, it aims to synthesize characteristics of studies, technology use, and research methods from empirical research studies for a comprehensible and insightful review of the effect of hypertext glosses on L2 vocabulary acquisition. Meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize overall findings of empirical studies by calculating a standardized mean difference effect size. On the basis of 35 weighted mean effect sizes, the magnitude of text + visual (multiple) hypertext gloss combination was moderately effective on L2 vocabulary acquisition when L2 learners were given two conditions: text-only and text + visual hypertext glosses. The results revealed that studies with large samples (Mes = 0.43) provided a bigger effect size. In addition, the variable of learner proficiency was found statistically significant: the impact of multiple hypertext glosses was likely more on L2 vocabulary acquisition of beginning learners. Test type formats were also found as a significant factor across the studies.",Video Meta Results Raw,Yun J,,,0,474

The mean weighted effect size on learning outcome is d = 0.37 (95% CI 0.25-0.49). Moderator analyses indicate even more substantial effect sizes when the animation is representational rather than decorational (d = 0.40, 95% CI 0.26-0.53), when the animation is highly realistic, e.g., video-based (d = 0.76, 95% CI 0.39-1.13), and/or when procedural-motor knowledge is to be acquired (d = 1.06, 95% CI 0.72-1.40). The results are in line with contemporary theories of cognitive load and multimedia learning, and they have practical implications for instructional design.

Despite this, identification of contextual factors such as participant characteristics and targeted outcomes that moderate the effectiveness of VMO has not previously been explored. The purpose of this study was to meta-analytically evaluate the evidence base of VMO with individuals with disabilities to determine if participant characteristics and targeted outcomes moderate the effectiveness of the intervention. Findings indicate that VMO is highly effective for participants with autism spectrum disorder (IRD=.83) and moderately effective for participants with developmental disabilities (IRD=.68).

537,Young adults learning executive function skills by playing focused video games,"The goal of this focused review is to examine the potential of using computer games as vehicles for improving cognitive skills in young adults, particularly the cognitive development of executive function skills, such as being able to shift attention efficiently from one task to another (i.e., shifting). On the disappointing side, this review finds a lack of convincing evidence that off-the-shelf games (often designed for entertainment) promote executive function skills. In addition, there is a lack of consistent evidence that long-term exposure to brain training games, such as offered in Lumosity, improves performance on non-game measures of executive function such as shifting (Bainbridge & Mayer, 2018). However, on the encouraging side, this review finds promising evidence for the benefits of playing a focused computer game that is designed to provide repeated practice on a targeted executive function skill (e.g., shifting) in a variety of contexts, at progressively increasing levels of challenge, and with clear feedback (Parong et al., 2017). The most promising direction for games aimed at fostering the cognitive development of executive function skills is to create mini-games that target a specific skill and are grounded in cognitive theories of skill learning.","Games for learning; Cognitive skill training; Executive function; Brain training; Cognitive consequences; COGNITIVE CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; CHILDREN; INTERVENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; REFLECTION; IMPACT; SCHOOL; ADHD; Psychology, Developmental; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Mayer RE and Parong J and Bainbridge K,,,0,477
538,Using a serious game to promote community-based awareness and prevention of neglected tropical diseases,"A serious game is presented which embodies an approach to disease prevention and management that is community-based and incorporates principles of the One Health framework-a broader view of healthcare that encompasses people, animals and the environment. The game focuses specifically on two related neglected and emerging infectious tropical diseases, namely Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) and American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL). It seeks to inform and encourage changes in behaviours and attitudes in local populations, while involving multidisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals and researchers. The design of the learning outcomes, gameplay, client interface, and architecture of the game are discussed in detail, along with the process of collaboration among a team of computer scientists, designers, medical researchers, and practitioners which underpinned the development of the game. An expert study conducted to gather feedback from a multidisciplinary group of participants comprising medical researchers, veterinarians, healthcare service administrators, and community healthcare providers is presented which forms part of our initial assessment of this approach. The results of this study and their implications for the design of similar health-related serious games are also discussed. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

539,Revised Approach to the Role of Fatigue in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Prevention: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analyses,"BackgroundCauses of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are multifactorial. Anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention should thus be approached from a multifactorial perspective as well. Training to resist fatigue is an underestimated aspect of prevention programs given that the presence of fatigue may play a crucial role in sustaining an ACL injury.ObjectivesThe primary objective of this literature review was to summarize research findings relating to the kinematic and kinetic effects of fatigue on single-leg landing tasks through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Other objectives were to critically appraise current approaches to examine the effects of fatigue together with elucidating and proposing an optimized approach for measuring the role of fatigue in ACL injury prevention.MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted in the databases PubMed (1978-November 2017), CINAHL (1992-November 2017), and EMBASE (1973-November 2017). The inclusion criteria were: (1) full text, (2) published in English, German, or Dutch, (3) healthy subjects, (4) average age 18years, (5) single-leg jump landing task, (6) evaluation of the kinematics and/or kinetics of the lower extremities before and after a fatigue protocol, and (7) presentation of numerical kinematic and/or kinetic data. Participants included healthy subjects who underwent a fatigue protocol and in whom the effects of pre- and post-fatigue on three-dimensional lower extremity kinematic and kinetics were compared. Methods of data collection, patient selection, blinding, prevention of verification bias, and study design were independently assessed.ResultsTwenty studies were included, in which four types of single-leg tasks were examined: the single-leg drop vertical jump, the single-leg drop landing, the single-leg hop for distance, and sidestep cutting. Fatigue seemed to mostly affect initial contact (decreased angles post-fatigue) and peak (increased angles post-fatigue) hip and knee flexion. Sagittal plane variables at initial contact were mostly affected under the single-leg hop for distance and sidestep cutting conditions whilst peak angles were affected during the single-leg drop jump.ConclusionsTraining to resist fatigue is an underestimated aspect of prevention programs given that the presence of fatigue may play a crucial role in sustaining an ACL injury. Considering the small number of variables affected after fatigue, the question arises whether the same fatigue pathways are affected by the fatigue protocols used in the included laboratory studies as are experienced on the sports field.",LANDING BIOMECHANICS; LOWER-LIMB; PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; ATTENTIONAL FOCUS; DECISION-MAKING; SPORTS INJURIES; MUSCLE FATIGUE; VIDEO ANALYSIS; REACTION-TIME; Sport Sciences; Sport Sciences; Video Meta Results Raw,Benjaminse A and Webster KE and Kimp A and Meijer M and Gokeler A,,,0,479

NAC efficacy was estimated as progression (grade I), stabilization (grade II), partial effect (grade III), prominent efficacy (grade IV), and complete response (grade V). In 59 women, histopathologic verification of BC response to NAC was performed according to the Miller-Payne classification with the same scores as were used in the evaluation of scintigraphic response.ResultsAfter two to three cycles of NAC, disease progression was detected in five of 65 (7.7%) patients. In 27 (41.5%) patients SMG detected early stabilization of BC. Only one of these patients achieved prominent (grade IV) response after the end of NAC. Partial (grade III) response after two to three cycles of NAC was seen in 24 (36.9%) patients. One-third of them had grades IV-V response at the end of treatment. The most promising was the group of nine (13.8%) patients with early-grades IV-V response, all of which transformed to complete response at the end of NAC. As per histopathologic verification, early SMG had 85.7% sensitivity, 94.2% specificity, and 93.2% accuracy in predicting complete pathologic response to four to six cycles of NAC.ConclusionAfter two to three cycles of NAC, SMG with Tc-99m-MIBI can determine patients with low, intermediate, and high probability of complete response to five to six cycles of NAC Video Abstract: http://links.lww.com/NMC/A43.",Video Meta Results Raw,Novikov SN and Kanaev SV and Petr KV and Tatyana SY and Elena TA and Ludmila JA and Nikolay ID and Zhanna BV and Pavel KI,,,0,480
541,Assessing the influence of stereotypes on the comprehension of UML sequence diagrams: A family of experiments,"Context: The conventional wisdom states that stereotypes are used to clarify or extend the meaning of model elements and consequently should be helpful in comprehending the diagram semantics. Objective: The main goal of this work is to present a family of experiments that we have carried out to investigate whether the use of stereotypes improves the comprehension of UML sequence diagrams. Method: The family of experiments consists of an experiment and two replications carried out with 78, 29 and 36 undergraduate Computer Science students, respectively. The comprehension of UML sequence diagrams with and without stereotypes was analyzed from three different perspectives borrowed from the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML): semantic comprehension, retention and transfer. In addition, we carried out a meta-analysis study to integrate the different data samples. Results: The statistical analysis and meta-analysis of the data obtained from each experiment separately indicates that the use of the proposed stereotypes helps improving the comprehension of the diagrams, especially when the subjects are not familiar with the domain. Conclusions: The set of stereotypes presented in this work seem to be helpful for a better comprehension of UML sequence diagrams, especially with not well-known domains. Although further research is necessary for strengthening these results, introducing these stereotypes both in academia and industry could be an interesting practice for checking the validity of the results. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

543,Novel Smartphone Interventions Improve Cognitive Flexibility and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Symptoms in Individuals with Contamination Fears,"One type of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by contamination fears and compulsive cleansing. Few effective treatments are available for this debilitating condition. Compulsive symptoms, such as excessive washing, are believed to be mediated by cognitive inflexibility-arguably the most striking cognitive impairment in OCD. In this study, we investigated the effects of two novel smartphone interventions on cognitive flexibility and OCD symptoms in healthy individuals with OCD-like contamination fears. In the first intervention, participants watched a brief video recording of themselves engaging in handwashing on a smartphone, four times a day, for a total of one week (N= 31). The second intervention was similar except that participants watched themselves repeatedly touching a disgust-inducing object (N= 31). In a third (control) \intervention\'",participants watched themselves performing sequential hand movements (N= 31).

544,Jogos eletrônicos e a cognição em idosos—Uma revisão sistemática = Electronic games and elderly cognition—A systematic review,"Academic discussions about the electronic games have increased considerably in recent years. Much has been discussed about the effects of multiple genres of electronic games available on the market. Some surveys are using video games as tools for cognitive rehabilitation of individuals affected by some pathology or trauma, as well as in the elderly with cognitive decline. Given this scenario, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of video games in healthy older adults’ cognition. The method used to elaborate this paper was a systematic review following the steps proposed by the Prisma model. The research was conducted through the virtual databases Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS) and US National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health (Pubmed). The results highlight positive effects after exposure of the elderly to electronic games on attention, memory, reasoning, perception, and executive functions.

546,"Impact of computer-mediated, obesity-related nutrition education interventions for adolescents: A systematic review","Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate recent research regarding the use of computer-based nutrition education interventions targeting adolescent overweight and obesity. Methods: Online databases were systematically searched using key words, and bibliographies of related articles were manually searched. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied and included studies evaluated for their ability to achieve their objectives and for quality using the Nutrition Evidence Library appraisal guidelines for research design and implementation. Results: Of the 15 studies included, 10 were randomized controlled trials. Two studies targeted weight loss, 2 targeted weight maintenance, and 11 targeted dietary improvement with or without physical activity. At least half of in-school (60%) and nonschool interventions (80%) exhibited significantly positive effects on nutrition-or obesity-related variables. Small changes in diet, physical activity, knowledge, and self-efficacy were shown; however, few results were sustained long term. Conclusions: Recommendations included application of health behavior theory and computer tailoring for feedback messages. Future research should include thorough description of intervention content (messages, theory, multimedia, etc.), application of rigorous methodology, as well as consideration of covariates such as parental involvement and gender. With further research and evidentiary support, this approach to obesity-related nutrition education has the potential to be successful. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

547,"The Effectiveness of Educational Intervention in Improving Primary Health-Care Service Providers’ Knowledge, Identification, and Management of Elder Abuse and Neglect: A Systematic Review","Elder abuse and neglect (EAN) occurrence is expected to increase in many countries due to rapidly aging populations, yet it is still unrecognized and underreported. Gaps were identified in the knowledge and skills to intervene EAN among health-care service providers. It is still unclear whether educating health-care service providers on EAN improve the identification and management of EAN cases. A systematic review was conducted on the effectiveness of educational intervention designed to improve primary health-care service providers' (PHSPs) knowledge, attitude, and practice in managing EAN cases. We performed a comprehensive and systematic search for original studies in the following major electronic databases (ScienceDirect, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and specialist registers (Cochrane Central Controlled Trials Register) with a set of search terms. Studies included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies on EAN education intervention that aimed to improve knowledge, attitude, and management skills of the PHSPs. There were no publication period restrictions until June 2018 and written in English. Overall, three RCTs and 10 observational studies were selected. These studies were grouped based on the type of the study, methodological quality (six moderate risk of bias and seven serious risk of bias), and the type of educational intervention (seven face-to-face educational intervention, two educational videos, two simulation-based training, and two online educational training). The education programs in the selected studies range from brief didactic to experiential learning. EAN educational intervention among primary care service providers potentially result in increasing awareness and knowledge on EAN. However, there is a lack of evidence on the changes of attitude and practice.",elder abuse; intervention; treatment; primary health care; education; knowledge; attitude; practice; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; SIMULATION; PHYSICIANS; ATTITUDES; STUDENTS; SKILLS; Criminology & Penology; Family Studies; Social Work; Criminology & Penology; Family Studies; Social Work; Video Meta Results Raw,Mohd Mydin FH and Yuen CW and Othman S,,,0,486
548,Effects of Exergaming on Preschoolers' Executive Functions and Perceived Competence: A Pilot Randomized Trial,"Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a child-centered exergaming program and a traditional teacher-led physical activity (PA) program on preschoolers' executive functions and perceived competence. Methods: Sixty children aged 4-5 years from an urban childcare center in China completed an 8-week exergaming/traditional PA intervention. After baseline measurements of executive functions and perceived competence (i.e., perceived physical competence and social acceptance), children were randomly assigned to either an exergaming group or traditional PA group (30 children per group). Exergaming and traditional PA programs were offered 20 min/session by trained instructors for 8 weeks. Post-intervention measures were identical to baseline measures. Results: In general, children's executive functions, perceived physical competence, and perceived social acceptance were enhanced over time. Analysis of variance revealed significant time by group interaction effects for executive functions, F(1, 58) = 12.01, p = 0.01, and perceived social acceptance, F(1, 58) = 6.04, p = 0.02, indicating that the exergaming intervention group displayed significantly greater increases in executive functions and perceived social acceptance in comparison with traditional PA children. In addition, children's executive functions and perceived physical and social competence significantly improved from baseline to post-intervention. However, there was no significant difference in the increase of children's perceived physical competence across groups over time. Conclusion: The results suggested exergaming to be beneficial in enhancing young children's executive functions and perceived social acceptance compared to the traditional PA program. More diverse samples with a longer intervention duration in preschool children in urban areas are warranted.","active video games; cognitive functions; perceived physical competence; perceived social acceptance; preschool children; ACTIVE VIDEO GAME; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; INTERACTIVE DANCE; CHILDREN; METAANALYSIS; FITNESS; OBESITY; IMPACT; ACHIEVEMENT; OVERWEIGHT; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Xiong S and Zhang P and Gao Z,,,0,487
549,Cognitive intervention for persons with mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis,"Cognitive training for persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has become a hot topic. However to date it remains controversial whether persons with MCI can really benefit from cognitive intervention. We aim to further investigate this by using meta-analysis of seventeen clinical studies of cognitive intervention for MCI. The results demonstrate that after training, patients with MCI improve significantly both in overall cognition and overall self-ratings. Specifically, persons with MCI obtain moderate benefits in language, self-rated anxiety and functional ability, and receive mild benefits in episodic memory, semantic memory, executive functioning/working memory, visuo-spatial ability, attention/processing speed, MMSE, self-rated memory problem, quality of life, activities of daily life and self-rated depression. The results also suggest that persons with MCI benefit from the cognitive intervention in the follow-up data. The present meta-analysis demonstrates that cognitive intervention can be a potential efficient method to enhance cognitive and functional abilities in persons with MCI, although the improvements may be domain-specific.",Video Meta Results Raw,Li H and Li J and Li N and Li B and Wang P and Zhou T,,,0,488
550,Flow-Mediated Dilation and Neurocognition: Systematic Review and Future Directions,"BACKGROUND: Previous literature indicates that flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is associated with impaired cognition among patients with stroke. The relationship between FMD and cognition in individuals without cerebrovascular disease has yet to be systematically reviewed. METHODS: The literature was searched using MEDLINE. Exclusion criteria were as follows: focus on neurological disease (e.g., stroke), animal studies, no quantitative measure of endothelial function or cognition, newborn studies, articles with no original data, and articles that are irrelevant to the topic of interest. Neurocognitive tests were categorized in the following domains: executive function, memory (general, working, episodic/semantic, verbal, visual), global cognitive function, information processing speed, language, psychomotor speed, and visual-spatial ability. RESULTS: The search yielded 700 articles, of which 10 articles, consisting of 2791 participants, met the criteria for inclusion. Most studies conclude that impaired FMD is associated with poorer neuropsychological functioning, particularly in executive functioning (effect sizes: r = 0.07-0.58) and working memory tasks (effect sizes: r = 0.19-0.39). No association was found between other subdomains of memory and FMD. Visual spatial tasks, information processing speed, language tasks, and global cognition were not associated with FMD overall; however fewer studies examined these domains. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the absence of cerebrovascular disease, there are links between cognition, particularly executive tasks, and vascular function. Public health implications include the potential value of examining FMD as a predictor of cognitive decline, as well as the potential value of improving cognition through pharmacological and behavioral interventions that improve vascular function.

551,Gender Effects When Learning Manipulative Tasks From Instructional Animations and Static Presentations,"Humans have an evolved embodied cognition that equips them to deal easily with the natural movements of object manipulations. Hence, learning a manipulative task is generally more effective when watching animations that show natural motions of the task, rather than equivalent static pictures. The present study was completed to explore this research domain further by investigating the impact of gender on static and animation presentations. In two experiments, university students were randomly assigned to either a static or animation condition and watched a computer-controlled presentation of a Lego shape being built. After each of two presentations, students were required to reconstruct the task followed by a transfer task. In Experiment 1 the tasks were performed using real Lego bricks (physical environment), and in Experiment 2 by computerized images of the bricks (virtual environment). Results indicated no differences between the two testing environments or an overall advantage for the animated format. However, a number of interactions between gender and presentation format were found. Follow-up analyses indicated that females benefited more than males from using animated presentations.",Video Meta Results Raw,Wong M and Castro-Alonso JC and Ayres P and Paas F,,,0,490
552,Corticosteroids for the treatment of infantile spasms: A systematic review,"Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosteroids are the usual first-line treatment options for infantile spasms. Despite significant differences, these agents are often lumped together in this context. There is a need to systematically explore the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of infantile spasms, especially in comparison to ACTH. This review identified and analyzed corticosteroid clinical trials and summarized their short-term efficacy and tolerability. Primary outcome was cessation of spasms and abolition of hypsarrhythmia on prolonged video electroencephalographic monitoring. Eight corticosteroid clinical trials were found with only 2 fulfilling the criteria for adequate design. The weighted-mean efficacy of corticosteroids to achieve primary outcome was 31% for these 2 methodologically adequate studies. Including reanalyzed data from 3 other studies, the corticosteroid efficacy was found to be 42%. On the basis of the available evidence, the efficacy of high-dose corticosteroids is similar to low-dose ACTH and inferior to high-dose ACTH, the current standard treatment.

553,Quality of Local Excision for Rectal Neoplasms Using Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery Versus Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery: A Multi-institutional Matched Analysis,"BACKGROUND: There are no data comparing the quality of local excision of rectal neoplasms using transanal endoscopic microsurgery and transanal minimally invasive surgery. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of tumor fragmentation and positive margins for patients undergoing local excision of benign and malignant rectal neoplasms using transanal endoscopic microsurgery versus transanal minimally invasive surgery. DESIGN: This was a multi-institutional cohort study using coarsened exact matching. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at high-volume tertiary institutions with specialist colorectal surgeons. PATIENTS: Patients undergoing full-thickness local excision for benign and malignant rectal neoplasms were included. INTERVENTIONS: Transanal endoscopic microsurgery and transanal minimally invasive surgery were the included interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of poor quality excision (composite measure including tumor fragmentation and/or positive resection margin) was measured. RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 428 patients (247 with transanal endoscopic microsurgery and 181 with transanal minimally invasive surgery). Transanal minimally invasive surgery was associated with shorter operative time and length of stay. Poor quality excision was similar (8% vs 11%; p = 0.233). There were also no differences in peritoneal violation (3% vs 3%; p = 0.965) and postoperative complications (11% vs 9%; p = 0.477). Cumulative 5-year disease-free survival for patients undergoing transanal endoscopic microsurgery was 80% compared with 78% for patients undergoing transanal minimally invasive surgery (log rank p = 0.824). The incidence of local recurrence for patients with malignancy who did not undergo immediate salvage surgery was 7% (8/117) for transanal endoscopic microsurgery and 7% (7/94) for transanal minimally invasive surgery (p = 0.864). LIMITATIONS: All of the procedures were also performed at high-volume referral centers by specialist colorectal surgeons with slightly differing perioperative practices and different time periods. CONCLUSIONS: High-quality local excision for benign and rectal neoplasms can be equally achieved using transanal endoscopic microsurgery or transanal minimally invasive surgery. The choice of operating platform for local excisions of rectal neoplasms should be based on surgeon preference, availability, and cost.

554,What is the impact of user affect on motor learning in virtual environments after stroke? A scoping review,"PURPOSE: The purported affective impact of virtual reality (VR) and active video gaming (AVG) systems is a key marketing strategy underlying their use in stroke rehabilitation, yet little is known as to how affective constructs are measured or linked to intervention outcomes. The purpose of this scoping review is to 1) explore how motivation, enjoyment, engagement, immersion and presence are measured or described in VR/AVG interventions for patients with stroke; 2) identify directional relationships between these constructs; and 3) evaluate their impact on motor learning outcomes. METHODS: A literature search was undertaken of VR/AVG interventional studies for adults post-stroke published in Medline, PEDro and CINAHL databases between 2007 and 2017. Following screening, reviewers used an iterative charting framework to extract data about construct measurement and description. A numerical and thematic analytical approach adhered to established scoping review guidelines. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five studies were included in the review. Although the majority (89%; N = 138) of studies described at least one of the five constructs within their text, construct measurement took place in only 32% (N = 50) of studies. The most frequently described construct was motivation (79%, N = 123) while the most frequently measured construct was enjoyment (27%, N = 42). A summative content analysis of the 50 studies in which a construct was measured revealed that constructs were described either as a rationale for the use of VR/AVGs in rehabilitation (76%, N = 38) or as an explanation for intervention results (56%, N = 29). 38 (76%) of the studies proposed relational links between two or more constructs and/or between any construct and motor learning. No study used statistical analyses to examine these links. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a clear discrepancy between the theoretical importance of affective constructs within VR/AVG interventions and actual construct measurement. Standardized terminology and outcome measures are required to better understand how enjoyment, engagement, motivation, immersion and presence contribute individually or in interaction to VR/AVG intervention effectiveness.","Virtual reality; Stroke; Motor learning; Motivation; Enjoyment; Engagement; Immersion; Presence; Scoping review; UPPER EXTREMITY REHABILITATION; REALITY BASED REHABILITATION; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CLINICAL FEASIBILITY; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; ARM FUNCTION; VIDEO GAMES; BALANCE; POSTSTROKE; THERAPY; Engineering, Biomedical; Neurosciences; Rehabilitation; Engineering; Neurosciences & Neurology; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Rohrbach N and Chicklis E and Levac DE,,,0,493
555,Nailing the Coffin Shut on Doubts That Violent Video Games Stimulate Aggression: Comment on Anderson et al. (2010),"Over the past half century the mass media, including video games, have become important socializers of children. Observational learning theory has evolved into social–cognitive information processing models that explain that what a child observes in any venue has both short-term and long-term influences on the child’s behaviors and cognitions. C. A. Anderson et al.’s (2010) extensive meta-analysis of the effects of violent video games confirms what these theories predict and what prior research about other violent mass media has found: that violent video games stimulate aggression in the players in the short run and increase the risk for aggressive behaviors by the players later in life. The effects occur for males and females and for children growing up in Eastern or Western cultures. The effects are strongest for the best studies. Contrary to some critics’ assertions, the meta-analysis of C. A. Anderson et al. is methodologically sound and comprehensive. Yet the results of meta-analyses are unlikely to change the critics’ views or the public’s perception that the issue is undecided because some studies have yielded null effects, because many people are concerned that the implications of the research threaten freedom of expression, and because many people have their identities or self-interests closely tied to violent video games.

Structural equation modeling with a single latent common cognitive factor showed that all cognitive measures shared substantial portions of age-related variance. A mediational model revealed that speed of processing and primary–working memory appear to be important mediators of age-related differences in the other measures. However, not all of the age-related influences were mediated. An examination of quadratic age effects and correlational patterns for subsamples under and over 50 years of age revealed that (a) negative age–cognition relations were significant for the 18- to 50-year-old sample and (b) the age-related decline accelerated significantly over the adult life span for variables assessing speed, reasoning, and episodic memory.

Computer-based psychotherapy treatments may address some of perinatal women's unique mental health treatment needs and barriers. Materials and Methods: We conducted a quantitative survey of pregnant women (12 weeks of gestation) on preferences regarding computer-based therapies compared with traditional therapies (psychotherapy and medication). Nonpregnant women and men served as comparison groups. Participants were provided descriptions of three computer-based therapies: video telehealth therapy (VTT), computer-assisted therapy (CAT), and self-guided online therapy (SGO). Participants were asked to select all options that they would consider for treatment as well as first choice preference. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed current depressive symptomatology, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) assessed psychiatric history. Results: Participants included pregnant females (n=111), nonpregnant females (n=147), and males (n=54). Among pregnant women, 77.5% (n=86) indicated that they would consider some form of computer-based therapy for mental health treatment during pregnancy; VTT was the most commonly considered, followed by CAT and SGO. When asked to select their preferred intervention, traditional talk therapy was the first choice among all three groups, controlling for treatment history and PHQ-9 score. About one-third of pregnant women chose some form of computer-based therapy as their top choice. Conclusions: While computer-based therapies were acceptable to most pregnant women in this sample, traditional talk therapy was the preferred option. Future research should consider how to tailor computer-based therapies to the unique needs of perinatal women.","perinatal; depression; CCBT; internet-based treatment; eHealth; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; FACE-TO-FACE; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; PERINATAL DEPRESSION; PERCEIVED BARRIERS; NEONATAL OUTCOMES; PRETERM BIRTH; METAANALYSIS; INTERNET; TRIAL; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medicine, General & Internal; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Women's Studies; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; General & Internal Medicine; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Women's Studies; Video Meta Results Raw",Hantsoo L and Podcasy J and Sammel M and Epperson CN and Kim DR,,,0,496
558,The misdiagnosis of epilepsy in people with intellectual disabilities: A systematic review,"Purpose: Epilepsy is common in people with intellectual disabilities. Epilepsy can be difficult to diagnose and may be misdiagnosed in around 25% of cases. A systematic review was conducted to explore: (i) How common the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is amongst people with intellectual disabilities. (ii) Reasons for misdiagnosis of epilepsy. (iii) Implications of misdiagnosis. (iv) Improving diagnosis. Methods: Primary studies and systematic reviews published in the English language between 1998 and 2008 were identified from electronic databases, experts, the Internet, grey literature, and citation tracking. Included studies were critically appraised by team members using the appraisal tools produced by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) at the Public Health Resource Unit, Oxford. Results: Eight studies were included in the review and critically appraised: six cohort studies and two case studies. Where data was provided in the cohort studies between 32% and 38% of people with intellectual disabilities were diagnosed as not having epilepsy or as having nonepileptic events. The main reason for misdiagnosis was the misinterpretation of behavioural, physiological, syndrome related, medication related or psychological events by parents, paid carers and health professionals. Conclusions: Those working in epilepsy and intellectual disability services and families must be made more aware of the possibility of misdiagnosis. Future research is needed about the misdiagnosis of epilepsy amongst people with intellectual disabilities and carer knowledge. (C) 2010 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

560,The Impact of Visual Realism on the Authenticity of Educational Simulation: A Comparative Study,"This study investigates the impact of photorealistic/cartoon-like representations of non-player characters on students' perception of an educational simulation. It is a comparative study, with within-subject design, that compares two different versions of an educational simulation, Czechoslovakia 38-89. Several studies of simulation design suggest that high fidelity on both physical and functional levels is required to evoke a real-world experience and maximize the transfer of learning. On the contrary, recent meta-analysis of the instructional effectiveness of educational computer games indicates that there is no argument to support opting for photorealistic visual designs, because more basic designs such as schematic/textual and cartoon-like designs are equally or more effective. However, existing studies do not relate levels of realism to specific domains of knowledge. Arguably, the appropriate level of visual fidelity depends on the learning objectives of the game/simulation. Czechoslovakia 38-89 is a complex educational simulation for high schools that utilizes the principles of digital game-based learning (DGBL). Its educational objective is to present key events from Czechoslovakia's contemporary history and to enable students to \experience\' these events from different actors' perspectives. A core element of Czechoslovakia 38-89 is interviews with \'eyewitnesses\' to various events. During the development of the game",we had to make a key decision on how to visually represent these characters: either as photorealistic videos using real actors (photorealistic) or as cartoon-like animations (cartoon-like).

A total of 279 urban high school students, including 30 with LD in an area related to reading, were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions with instruction occurring at individual computer terminals over a 3-week period. Each of the four conditions contained different configurations of multimedia-based instruction and evidence-based vocabulary instruction. Dependent measures of vocabulary knowledge indicated that students with LD who received vocabulary instruction using CAPs through an explicit instructional methodology and the keyword mnemonic strategy significantly outperformed other students with LD who were taught using the same content, but with multimedia instruction that did not adhere to a specific theoretical design framework. Results for general education students mirrored those for students with LD. Students also completed a satisfaction measure following instruction with multimedia and expressed overall agreement that CAPs are useful for learning vocabulary terms.",Video Meta Results Raw,Kennedy MJ and Deshler DD and Lloyd JW,,,0,499
562,The Effect of Modality and Narration Style on Recall of Online Health Information: Results From a Web-Based Experiment,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using the Internet for health information; however, they are often not able to correctly recall Web-based information (eHealth information). Recall of information is crucial for optimal health outcomes, such as adequate disease management and adherence to medical regimes. Combining effective message strategies may help to improve recall of eHealth information among older adults. Presenting information in an audiovisual format using conversational narration style is expected to optimize recall of information compared to other combinations of modality and narration style. Objective: The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of modality and narration style on recall of health information, and whether there are differences between younger and older adults. Methods: We conducted a Web-based experiment using a 2 (modality: written vs audiovisual information) by 2 (narration style: formal vs conversational style) between-subjects design (N=440). Age was assessed in the questionnaire and included as a factor: younger (= 65 years) age. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental webpages where information about lung cancer treatment was presented. A Web-based questionnaire assessed recall of eHealth information. Results: Audiovisual modality (vs written modality) was found to increase recall of information in both younger and older adults (P=.04). Although conversational narration style (vs formal narration style) did not increase recall of information (P=.17), a synergistic effect between modality and narration style was revealed: combining audiovisual information with conversational style outperformed combining written information with formal style (P=.01), as well as written information with conversational style (P=.045). This finding suggests that conversational style especially increases recall of information when presented audiovisually. This combination of modality and narration style improved recall of information among both younger and older adults. Conclusions: We conclude that combining audiovisual information with conversational style is the best way to present eHealth information to younger and older adults. Even though older adults did not proportionally recall more when audiovisual information was combined with conversational style than younger adults, this study reveals interesting implications for improving eHealth information that is effective for both younger and older adults.",Video Meta Results Raw,Bol N and van Weert JC and de Haes HC and Loos EF and Smets EM,,,0,500
563,Advantages of virtual reality in the rehabilitation of balance and gait: Systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a therapeutic tool facilitating motor learning for balance and gait rehabilitation. The evidence, however, has not yet resulted in standardized guidelines. The aim of this study was to systematically review the application of VR-based rehabilitation of balance and gait in 6 neurologic cohorts, describing methodologic quality, intervention programs, and reported efficacy. METHODS: This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. VR-based treatments of Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, acute and chronic poststroke, traumatic brain injury, and cerebral palsy were researched in PubMed and Scopus, including earliest available records. Therapeutic validity (CONTENT scale) and risk of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCT) (Cochrane Collaboration tool) and non-RCT (Newcastle-Ottawa scale) were assessed. RESULTS: Ninety-seven articles were included, 68 published in 2013 or later. VR improved balance and gait in all cohorts, especially when combined with conventional rehabilitation. Most studies presented poor methodologic quality, lacked a clear rationale for intervention programs, and did not utilize motor learning principles meticulously. RCTs with more robust methodologic designs were widely recommended. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that VR-based rehabilitation is developing rapidly, has the potential to improve balance and gait in neurologic patients, and brings additional benefits when combined with conventional rehabilitation. This systematic review provides detailed information for developing theory-driven protocols that may assist overcoming the observed lack of argued choices for intervention programs and motor learning implementation and serves as a reference for the design and planning of personalized VR-based treatments.

564,AR videos as scaffolding to foster students' learning achievements and motivation in EFL learning,"Augmented reality (AR) is capable of providing students with proper situated scaffolding via overlaying rich media objects on the real-world learning context. This paper examines the potential of AR to address existing problems with insufficient scaffolding in video learning materials for English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. Thus, an AR video-enhanced learning (ARVEL) method was designed to assist students' EFL learning. Furthermore, an experiment was carried out to investigate the influences of the implemented method on students' EFL learning outcomes. The experimental results displayed that the ARVEL method significantly improved the students' learning achievements and intrinsic motivation, and enhanced their satisfaction with EFL learning, compared to the students learning EFL with conventional video-based learning. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Learning experience of English as a foreign language (EFL) is highly related to the experience in actual learning contexts. The significance of providing students with proper assistance in a situated learning environment has been emphasized. Just observing videos might be inadequate for advancing students' reflection on learning tasks in video-based learning. What this paper adds An augmented reality (AR) video-enhanced learning method was proposed to assist students' EFL learning. An AR video-enhanced learning (ARVEL) system was designed based on the implemented method. It was evidenced that the implemented method effectively improved students' learning achievements and motivation. The students display a higher degree of satisfaction with EFL learning than with the video-enhanced learning method. Implications for practice and/or policy The ARVEL method could be a good reference for implementing an EFL learning environment. More kinds of assistance could be designed as scaffolding for assisting students' EFL learning. It is worth probing the influences of the ARVEL on students' learning of more abstract vocabulary and concepts.",AUGMENTED REALITY; COGNITIVE LOAD; TECHNOLOGY; VOCABULARY; KNOWLEDGE; LANGUAGE; ENGLISH; DESIGN; COMPREHENSION; METAANALYSIS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Chen CH,,,0,502

567,A systematic review of telehealth tools and interventions to support family caregivers,"We conducted a systematic review of studies employing telehealth interventions which focused on family caregivers’ outcomes. The Embase, CINHAL, Cochrane and PubMed databases were searched using combinations of keywords including 'telehealth,' 'telemedicine,' 'telecare,' 'telemonitoring,' 'caregiver' and 'family.' The initial search produced 4205 articles, of which 65 articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles included 52 experimental studies, 11 evaluation studies, one case study and one secondary analysis. Thirty-three articles focused on family caregivers of adult and older patients, while 32 articles focused on parental caregivers of paediatric patients. The technologies included video, web-based, telephone-based and telemetry/remote monitoring. Six main categories of interventions were delivered via technology: education, consultation (including decision support), psychosocial/cognitive behavioural therapy (including problem solving training), social support, data collection and monitoring, and clinical care delivery. More than 95% of the studies reported significant improvements in the caregivers’ outcomes and that caregivers were satisfied and comfortable with telehealth. The review showed that telehealth can positively affect chronic disease care, home and hospice care.

568,Uniportal VATS lobectomy,"Uniportal Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (uniportal VATS) lobectomy represents the last evolution of minimally invasive techniques for the surgical treatment of lung cancer. Uniportal VATS was developed from two-ports approach, with two main advantages: only one intercostal space is damaged and the direct view to the target tissue. Improvements in camera systems, instruments and stapler technology have facilitated this development. The operative technique is well defined for the different lobectomies and for the mediastinal lymphadenectomy. The parallel instrumentation achieved during the single port approach mimics the inside maneuvers performed during open surgery, together with the direct view facilitates the dissection and division of the hilar structures and the fissure. This makes possible the direct transition from open surgery to uniportal VATS. Uniportal VATS is feasible and reproducible. This is why its use is spreading in many centers in Spain, Europe and Asia, with good results. Training at centers with major experience or in wetlabs, and the proper patient selection are the best recommendations for the learning curve. In our center, as we gain experience with the approach, we performed advanced cases with similar results to the initial stages. Segmentectomies, bronchovascular reconstructions and selected cases that need chest wall resection were also carried out by uniportal VATS. The last advance is the uniportal VATS lobectomy in non-intubated patients with spontaneous breathing, the less invasive surgical approach in combination with a less invasive anesthetic management.",Video Meta Results Raw,De La Torre M and Gonzalez-Rivas D and Fernandez R and Delgado M and Fieira E and Mendez L,,,0,505

In this study, high school students (n = 41) interacted in a laboratory with a roughly 6-minute-long, black-and-white, instructional animation with \emotionally\' enhanced graphics. The topic was biological wastewater treatment. The enhancements included a) adding static faces for two schematic visual elements and b) changing the neutral appearance of a fish and a river bed to funny appearances. The participants' learning outcomes (assessed by retention and transfer tests) and the participants' state engagement (indexed by generalized positive affect and flow levels) were compared to data from a group of comparable students interacting with the same animation with neutral graphics (n = 37) in a previous study. The two groups did not differ in state engagement (flow: d = -0.16; positive affect: d = 0.03) and transfer test scores (d = 0.13)",but there was a small trend favoring the enhanced graphics in the retention test,Brom C and Hannemann T and Starkova T and Bromova E and Dechterenko F,,,0,506
572,Pre-training interventions to counteract seductive details in virtual reality training programs,"We propose that (a) certain aspects of virtual reality (VR) training programs are seductive details, (b) these seductive details prompt trainee distraction and/or cognitive overload, and (c) pre-training interventions can benefit learning from VR training programs by targeting these mechanisms. In Study 1, we apply a meta-cognitive strategy pre-training intervention, which targets distraction, and a habituation pre-training intervention, which targets cognitive overload. Habituation had no effect, whereas meta-cognitive strategies worsened learning. Qualitative results indicated the meta-cognitive strategy intervention prompted trainees to become more cognitively engaged in the distracting seductive details of the VR training program. In Study 2, we tested an alternative pre-training intervention, attentional advice, to reduce distraction and increase learning. The attentional advice pre-training intervention was successful, as trainees demonstrated greater learning when provided attentional advice. Together, all proposals were supported. VR can contain seductive details that cause distraction, and attentional advice can improve learning by reducing distraction.","pre-intervention; pre-training; seductive details; training; virtual reality training; MULTIMEDIA; GAMIFICATION; METAANALYSIS; FEEDBACK; ELEMENTS; SCIENCE; ADVICE; Industrial Relations & Labor; Psychology, Applied; Management; Business & Economics; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Howard MC and Lee J,,,0,507
574,Using Children's Literature to Strengthen Social and Emotional Learning,"The introductory article to this special edition of School Psychology International, Using Children's Literature to Strengthen Social and Emotional Learning, describes the need for a broader base of support for children's mental health needs. Both nationally and internationally, the limited number of mental health professionals demands alternative options for the delivery of mental health services. Schools are recommended as one proposed venue for providing these services to children and youth. As such, teachers need easy-to-use basic information about mental health resources that are viable, yet rely on minimal professional support and supervision. One option is bibliotherapy, using books and stories to support social emotional needs. From the mental health perspective of both prevention and intervention, bibliotherapy is proposed not just as a professional's therapeutic tool, but also as a layman's resource to address students' basic social emotional needs. We offer resources from a website that includes basic bibliotherapy lesson plans, posters, activities, and video clipsall centered on the five foundational competencies identified by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL). This website [http://education.byu.edu/sociallearning] is geared to educators and mental health professionals who work with elementary school children, ages 5-11.","children's mental health; social emotional learning; social skills; bibliotherapy; classroom intervention; MENTAL-HEALTH-SERVICES; DEPRESSION PREVENTION PROGRAM; BIBLIOTHERAPY; IMPACT; YOUTH; METAANALYSIS; BARRIERS; SEEKING; STIGMA; CARE; Psychology, Educational; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Heath MA and Smith K and Young EL,,,0,508

577,Developmental trends in lineup performance: Adolescents are more prone to innocent bystander misidentifications than children and adults,"We tested developmental trends in eyewitness identification in biased and unbiased lineups. Our main interest was adolescent's lineup performance compared with children and adults. 7-10-year-olds, 11-13-year-olds, 14-16-year-olds, and adults (N = 431) watched a wallet-theft-video and subsequently identified the thief, victim, and witness from simultaneous target-present and target-absent six-person photo lineups. The thief-absent lineup included a bystander previously seen in thief proximity. Research on unconscious transference suggested a selection bias toward the bystander in adults and 11-13-year-olds, but not in younger children. Confirming our hypothesis, adolescents were more prone to bystander bias than all other age groups. This may be due to adolescents making more inferential errors than children, as predicted by fuzzy-trace theory and associative-activation theory, combined with lower inhibition control in adolescents compared with adults. We also replicated a clothing bias for all age groups and age-related performance differences in our unbiased lineups. Consistent with previous findings, participants were generally overconfident in their decisions, even though confidence was a better predictor of accuracy in older compared with younger participants. With this study, we show that adolescents have an increased tendency to misidentify an innocent bystander. Continued efforts are needed to disentangle how adolescents in comparison to other age groups perform in forensically relevant situations.","Identification performance; Unconscious transference; Child witnesses; Adolescent witnesses; Clothing bias; Confidence-accuracy relationship; EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION; UNCONSCIOUS TRANSFERENCE; COGNITIVE INTERVIEW; FALSE MEMORY; RISK-TAKING; ACCURACY; CONFIDENCE; METAANALYSIS; STRESS; CALIBRATION; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Brackmann N and Sauerland M and Otgaar H,,,0,511

579,Reconceptualizing Physical Sex as a Continuum: Are There Sex Differences in Video Game Preference?,"With video games representing a rapidly growing media platform, recent events have highlighted conflicts surrounding gender and games. Previous research has established sex-typed cognitive advantages and game genre preference. Potential explanations of how these align have been inconclusive. Concurrently, research on sex development has suggested that binary categorizations of sex (physical sex; male or female) don’t capture the full variation of individuals and are thus inferior measures of sex. Two studies (one replication study) were conducted which use two continuous markers of physical sex (hormonal 2D:4D finger ratio, and continuous skill-based performance) to predict game preference and playing. Using both statistical effect- and equivalence tests, we present a series of p-curves and several possible interpretations based on meta-analytical cutoffs. In general, we find that binary markers of sex significantly predict game preference, while continuous markers significantly do not. These findings challenge the notion of binary sex differences and suggest a more complex relationship between physical sex and video game preferences. Implications for future research on video game playing and sex are discussed.

580,Smoking Cessation Programs Targeted to Women: A Systematic Review,"The authors of this systematic review aimed to examine tobacco interventions developed to meet the needs of women, to identify sex-and gender-specific components, and to evaluate their effects on smoking cessation in women. The authors searched electronic databases in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, EBSCO, PsychINFO, CINHAL, and EMBASE; the search was not restricted by publication date. Data was extracted from published peer-reviewed articles on participants, setting, treatment models, interventions, length of follow-up, and outcomes. The main outcome variable was abstinence from smoking. A total of 39 studies were identified. In efficacy studies, therapists addressed weight concerns and non-pharmacological aspects of smoking, taught mood/stress management strategies, and scheduled the quit date to be timed to the menstrual cycle. In effectiveness studies, therapists were peer counselors, provided telephone counseling, and/or distributed gendered booklets, videos, and posters. Among efficacy studies, interventions addressing weight gain/concerns showed the most promising results. If medication can support smoking cessation in women and how it interacts with non-pharmacological treatment also warrant further research. For effectiveness studies, the available evidence suggests that smoking should be addressed in low-income women accessing public health clinics. Further attention should be devoted to identifying new settings for providing smoking cessation interventions to women from disadvantaged groups. Women-specific tobacco programs help women stop smoking, although they appear to produce similar abstinence rates as non-sex/gender specific programs. Offering interventions for women specifically may reduce barriers to treatment entry and better meet individual preferences of smokers. Developing approaches that fully account for the multiple challenges treatment-seeking women face is still an area of research.",Video Meta Results Raw,Torchalla I and Okoli CT and Bottorff JL and Qu A and Poole N and Greaves L,,,0,514

In 2015, a sample of 326 pupils aged 9-11 years old from 19 classes at three selected primary schools were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups within the study. During the classes, children in the experimental group performed physical activities two times per day in three to five minutes using Brain Breaks (R) videos for four months, while the control group did not use the videos during the test period.

582,Physical models have gender-specific effects on student understanding of protein structure-function relationships,"Understanding how basic structural units influence function is identified as a foundational/core concept for undergraduate biological and biochemical literacy. It is essential for students to understand this concept at all size scales, but it is often more difficult for students to understand structure-function relationships at the molecular level, which they cannot as effectively visualize. Students need to develop accurate, 3-dimensional mental models of biomolecules to understand how biomolecular structure affects cellular functions at the molecular level, yet most traditional curricular tools such as textbooks include only 2-dimensional representations. We used a controlled, backward design approach to investigate how hand-held physical molecular model use affected students' ability to logically predict structure-function relationships. Brief (one class period) physical model use increased quiz score for females, whereas there was no significant increase in score for males using physical models. Females also self-reported higher learning gains in their understanding of context-specific protein function. Gender differences in spatial visualization may explain the gender-specific benefits of physical model use observed.

583,Designing productively negative experiences with serious game mechanics: Qualitative analysis of game-play and game design in a randomized trial,"Design, rather than medium, ultimately predicts learning outcomes, but the game-based learning literature has had difficulty successfully linking game design decisions to learning behaviours and outcomes. The current research investigates how explicit game design strategies can promote productive negativity (i.e. learning from failure), which has been identified as an important mechanism in both gaming and learning. We performed a randomized controlled trial with undergraduate biology students to investigate how game design might facilitate misconception resolution about random molecular behaviour through productive negativity. Students engaged with either a computer-based interactive simulation (n = 20) or serious game (n = 20) for 30 min, while their computer screens were recorded and click-stream data collected. We described in detail the theoretical framework underpinning our serious game and simulation using the Activity Theory Model of Serious Games (ATMSG); qualitatively coded and analysed video recordings of gameplay; and visually overlaid this data with the ATMSG models to draw conclusions about how game-design decisions influence learning-related behaviours. We found that the serious game resulted in significantly more productively negative experiences, while the interactive simulation allowed for greater exploratory or experimental behaviours. Based on our analyses of the qualitative gameplay data, we were able to recommend three game design strategies to enhance the occurrence of desired game-flow loops (e.g. productive negativity) with respect to an ATMSG framework: 1) including additional game mechanics on the primary game flow axis of the ATMSG framework (i.e. mandatory interactions) limits the exploratory nature of the application; 2) integrating two or more primary-axis mechanics in a game-flow loop increases the frequency of interaction with this loop; and 3) gameplay loops that involve mechanics that fall off the primary-axis (i.e. non-mandatory mechanics) occur less frequently than those which involve primary-axis (i.e. mandatory) mechanics. This study is one of the first to successfully make direct comparisons between students' interactions in a game and a non-game application to provide concrete and actionable serious game design recommendations.","Serious game design; Productive negativity; Misconceptions; Randomized controlled trial; Activity theory model of serious games (ATMSG); CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; MISCONCEPTIONS; COMPUTER; BIOLOGY; INTERVENTION; METAANALYSIS; FRAMEWORK; EDUCATION; FAILURE; SCIENCE; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education & Educational Research; Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Gauthier A and Jenkinson J,,,0,517

Material and methods: This was a prospective randomized study. The primary outcome measure is overall successful intubation. Secondary outcome measures are first attempt successful intubation, Cormacke-Lehane (CL) grade, and indicators of the reasons for unsuccessful intubation at the first attempt with each device. Adult patients who suffered from blunt trauma and required intubation were randomized to video laryngoscopy with C-MAC device or direct laryngoscopy (DL). Results: During a 17-month period, a total of 150 trauma intubations were performed using a C-MAC and DL. Baseline characteristics of patients were similar between the C-MAC and DL group. Overall success for the C-MAC was 69/75 (92%, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.96) while for the DL it was 72/75 (96%, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.98). First attempt success for the C-MAC was 47/75 (62.7%, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.72) while for the DL it was 44/75 patients (58.7%, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.69). The mean time to achieve successful intubation was 33.4 +/- 2.5 s for the C-MAC versus 42.4 +/- 5.1 s for the DL (p = 0.93). There was a statistically significant difference between the DL and C-MAC in terms of visualizing the glottic opening and esophageal intubation in favor of the C-MAC (p = 0.002 and p = 0.013 respectively). Discussion and conclusion: The overall success rates were similar. The C-MAC demonstrated improved glottic view and decrease in esophageal intubation rate.

585,Perceived experience and police officers' ability to detect deception,"Purpose - For police officers, the ability to distinguish between truthful and deceptive statements in interrogations is essential. However, research shows that their classification accuracy is typically rather low. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the ability to detect deception as a function of perceived experience, in a sample of German police officers and police trainees. Design/methodology/approach - The authors had the participants judge ten video recordings of a mock crime with respect to the displayed suspects' truthfulness. Following the assumptions and findings of previous research, the authors expected their manipulation of perceived experience to increase detection accuracy, but expected objective experience not to be correlated with the ability to detect deception. Findings - As expected, police officers and trainees in the experience condition achieved higher accuracy than control participants. On the objective self-report measures of experience, no relationship with classification accuracy was found. Practical implications - The findings suggest that police officers' objective experience does not perfectly translate into subjective experience. A subjective feeling of experience can be sufficient enough to increase detection accuracy, even if one is objectively inexperienced. Originality/value - The manipulation proved to be a simple and efficient method of increasing judgmental accuracy in lie detection without increasing police officers' actual knowledge or changing their beliefs about deception cues.",Video Meta Results Raw,Reinhard MA and Dahm J and Scharmach M,,,0,519

Collect all randomized controlled trials, multi-center studies, clinical controlled trials, clinical trials and other comparative studies of endoscopic thyroidectomy with a large sample size in different databases through an established search strategy, make a systematic analysis of all the included literature. This study selected 12 publications for analysis from more than 800 articles: these included six publications describing cervical thyroidectomy (A) and six publications describing extra-cervical thyroidectomy (B). Conversion to open surgery occurred in 29 patients in group A and only 4 in group B (p < 0.001). The patients in group A experienced shorter hospital stays than patients in group B (1.90 +/- A 0.80 vs. 4.03 +/- A 0.99 days, p < 0.001), and there was shorter operating time in group A (p < 0.001). Hemorrhage occurred in 3 cases in group A and 8 cases in group B (p = 0.04), Seroma occurred in 25 cases in group B but in no cases in group A (p < 0.001). Postoperative cosmetic results evaluated by verbal response scales (VRS) registered showed: group A (3.35 +/- A 0.60) and group B (3.74 +/- A 0.50; p < 0.001). Other complications such as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypocalcemia showed no significant differences. Evaluation of the different surgical approaches for endoscopic thyroidectomy shows that the incidence of hemorrhage and seroma are higher in the extra-cervical group, but the rate of conversion to conventional open surgery is significantly higher in the cervical group. Furthermore, patients who undergo extra-cervical endoscopic thyroidectomy are associated with longer operating time and hospital stays; however, these studies suggest that the extra-cervical surgical approach for endoscopic thyroidectomy is preferable for dealing with more kinds of thyroid tumor and leaving no scars on neck.",Video Meta Results Raw,Chen Geng-Zhen and Zhang Xuan and Shi Wei-Lin and Zhuang Ze-Rui and Chen Xi and Han Hui,,,0,520
587,Offline Digital Education for Medical Students: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis by the Digital Health Education Collaboration,"BACKGROUND: Medical schools in low- and middle-income countries are facing a shortage of staff, limited infrastructure, and restricted access to fast and reliable internet. Offline digital education may be an alternative solution for these issues, allowing medical students to learn at their own time and pace, without the need for a network connection. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of offline digital education compared with traditional learning or a different form of offline digital education such as CD-ROM or PowerPoint presentations in improving knowledge, skills, attitudes, and satisfaction of medical students. The secondary objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of offline digital education, changes in its accessibility or availability, and its unintended/adverse effects on students. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review of the literature by following the Cochrane methodology. We searched seven major electronic databases from January 1990 to August 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster RCTs. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations criteria. RESULTS: We included 36 studies with 3325 medical students, of which 33 were RCTs and three were cluster RCTs. The interventions consisted of software programs, CD-ROMs, PowerPoint presentations, computer-based videos, and other computer-based interventions. The pooled estimate of 19 studies (1717 participants) showed no significant difference between offline digital education and traditional learning groups in terms of students' postintervention knowledge scores (standardized mean difference=0.11, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.32; small effect size; low-quality evidence). Meta-analysis of four studies found that, compared with traditional learning, offline digital education improved medical students' postintervention skills (standardized mean difference=1.05, 95% CI 0.15-1.95; large effect size; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effects of offline digital education on students' attitudes and satisfaction due to missing or incomplete outcome data. Only four studies estimated the costs of offline digital education, and none reported changes in accessibility or availability of such education or in the adverse effects. The risk of bias was predominantly high in more than half of the included studies. The overall quality of the evidence was low (for knowledge, skills, attitudes, and satisfaction) due to the study limitations and inconsistency across the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that offline digital education is as effective as traditional learning in terms of medical students' knowledge and may be more effective than traditional learning in terms of medical students' skills. However, there is a need to further investigate students' attitudes and satisfaction with offline digital education as well as its cost-effectiveness, changes in its accessibility or availability, and any resulting unintended/adverse effects.",medical education; systematic review; meta-analysis; randomized controlled trials; students; medical; COMPUTER-ASSISTED-INSTRUCTION; STANDARD LECTURE; HUMAN-RESOURCES; TUTORIAL; PROGRAM; AUSCULTATION; KNOWLEDGE; WORKFORCE; TRIAL; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Kyaw BM and Posadzki P and Dunleavy G and Semwal M and Divakar U and Hervatis V and Tudor Car L,,,0,521

592,A preliminary investigation on the performance of brain-injured witnesses on target-absent line-up procedures,"The current study was a preliminary investigation that aimed to compare the performance of eyewitnesses with and without a brain injury on two target-absent line-up procedures: a simultaneous procedure and a sequential procedure with confidence ratings. A 2x2 design (N=25) was employed, where both brain-injured (n=15) and non-brain-injured (n=10) participants were shown a short video of a non-violent crime taking place before taking part in either a simultaneous or sequential target-absent line-up. Participants' general cognitive abilities and memory recall accuracy were also measured. Results found no significant differences in false identification rates between brain-injured and non-brain-injured witnesses. It was also found that participants with a greater memory accuracy were in fact more likely to make a false identification. The implications and limitations of the study are discussed.","EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES; CONFIDENCE JUDGMENTS; MEMORY DEFICITS; ADULTS; PERCEPTIONS; OLD; METAANALYSIS; RECOGNITION; ABILITY; Criminology & Penology; Law; Psychiatry; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law; Psychiatry; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Gibert C and Mojtahedi D,,,0,524
594,Examining the Effects of SRSD in Combination with Video Self-Modeling on Writing by Third Grade Students with Learning Disabilities,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an instructional package, Self-Regulated Strategy Development, a cognitive strategy instructional model (POW + TREE), in combination with video self-modeling (VSM) on the improvement on the written expression of three third-grade students with learning disabilities (LD). This manuscript addresses the results of a multiple probe across participants, single-subject design, which data from various components of writing, including essay elements, length of responses, time, and overall writing quality were collected. All students who received the instructional package intervention improved their overall writing performance on opinion essays as measured by the number of opinion essay elements. During the maintenance phase of the intervention, students who received a VSM booster session retained their total number of opinion essay elements at mastery levels. Implications for students with LD, as well as future research considerations, will be discussed.","REGULATED STRATEGY-DEVELOPMENT; SKILLS; INSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; INTERVENTION; METAANALYSIS; KNOWLEDGE; BEHAVIOR; Education, Special; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Miller KM and Little ME,,,0,525
597,Relevant prior knowledge moderates the effect of elaboration during small group discussion on academic achievement,"This study set out to test whether relevant prior knowledge would moderate a positive effect on academic achievement of elaboration during small-group discussion. In a 2 x 2 experimental design, 66 undergraduate students observed a video showing a small-group problem-based discussion about thunder and lightning. In the video, a teacher asked questions to the observing participants. Participants either elaborated by responding to these questions, or did not elaborate, but completed a distraction task after each question. They received either relevant or irrelevant prior knowledge before the discussion. After the discussion, all participants studied a text about thunder and lighting and completed immediate and delayed-recall tests for this text. Elaboration had no main effect on recall, but there was a significant interaction effect between relevant prior knowledge and elaboration. The results suggest that elaboration is helpful for students with more prior knowledge, but harmful for students with less prior knowledge.",Video Meta Results Raw,Van Blankenstein FM and Dolmans DH and Van der Vleuten CP and Schmidt HG,,,0,526
598,"Do angry birds make for angry children? A meta-analysis of video game influences on children’s and adolescents' aggression, mental health, prosocial behavior, and academic performance","The issue of whether video games—violent or nonviolent—'harm' children and adolescents continues to be hotly contested in the scientific community, among politicians, and in the general public. To date, researchers have focused on college student samples in most studies on video games, often with poorly standardized outcome measures. To answer questions about harm to minors, these studies are arguably not very illuminating. In the current analysis, I sought to address this gap by focusing on studies of video game influences on child and adolescent samples. The effects of overall video game use and exposure to violent video games specifically were considered, although this was not an analysis of pathological game use. Overall, results from 101 studies suggest that video game influences on increased aggression (r = .06), reduced prosocial behavior (r = .04), reduced academic performance (r = −.01), depressive symptoms (r = .04), and attention deficit symptoms (r = .03) are minimal. Issues related to researchers’ degrees of freedom and citation bias also continue to be common problems for the field. Publication bias remains a problem for studies of aggression. Recommendations are given on how research may be improved and how the psychological community should address video games from a public health perspective.

599,Teacher Clarity: An Analysis of Current Research and Future Directions,"In the 1960s and 1970s, researchers in Education and related fields conducted a series of studies exploring how teachers' behaviors had effects on students. Of the variables explored in those studies, teacher clarity was identified as the one with the most promise for further exploration. Based partly on that optimistic conclusion, teacher clarity emerged as a significant program of research in both the Education and Communication fields. A recent meta-analysis summarizing such research revealed that teacher clarity has moderate-to-strong correlations with both affective and cognitive learning. Despite such attention, the construct has been plagued by a lack of precision in defining exactly what constitutes teacher clarity. The current chapter presents a framework for understanding teacher clarity by exploring its theoretical foundations and presenting a conceptual framework for defining the construct. Specifically, we suggest that teacher clarity can be thought of as students' perceptions of teachers' communication-related behaviors that assist in selecting, understanding, and remembering information. Those behaviors can be categorized into five general areas: pre-instructional clarity, instructional message clarity, explanatory clarity, presentation clarity, and adaptive clarity. This framework is used to identify potential areas for future research on the topic.",Video Meta Results Raw,Titsworth S and Mazer JP,,,0,528
600,Educational 360-Degree Videos in Virtual Reality: a Scoping Review of the Emerging Research,"360-degree video (or 360° video) is recorded in an omnidirectional form so that viewers can look in any direction while the video plays. Interest in the application of 360° video has been emerging along with the advancement of lower cost technologies and increase in online video content. Little is known about trends in the emerging research for 360° video. A scoping review was conducted through a systematic process to identify trends in peer-reviewed research journal articles. A sample of 12 articles were identified as meeting the research criteria. Findings illuminate the extent and nature of research on educational 360° video along with the benefits and drawbacks for learning. The results show how 360° video was used in nine different content areas to promote immersive learning through virtual reality. Learners indicated enjoyment with the experience of learning with 360° VR video, but the results were mixed regarding the impact on learning. © 2019, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.",360-degree video; Immersive; Literature review; Virtual reality; VR; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Snelson C and Hsu YC,,,0,529

602,"Implementing the Flipped Classroom in a Veterinary Pre-clinical Science Course: Student Engagement, Performance, and Satisfaction","There has been a recent move toward active learning pedagogies in veterinary education, with increasing use of a blended approach that incorporates both online resources and live classroom sessions. In this study, an established veterinary pre-clinical course in introductory animal health was transitioned from a traditional didactic lecture delivery mode to a flipped classroom approach with core content delivered online. This study compared the experiences of two cohorts of students who studied the same course in the different formats in consecutive years. Online learning resources included short video segments and a variety of short problems and activities. Online materials were complemented with weekly small-group case-based learning classes facilitated by academic staff. A mixed methods evaluation strategy was applied using student grades, surveys, and focus groups to compare student academic performance, satisfaction, and engagement between the two cohorts. The flipped classroom cohort achieved significantly higher grades in the written answer section of the final examination. Student satisfaction with learning resources was also higher in this cohort. However, satisfaction with other aspects of the course was largely the same for both cohorts. This study revealed some of the challenges associated with achieving adequate student preparation for class using online resources. The outcomes of this study have implications for veterinary educators considering the design and development of new online learning resources.","blended learning; technology; flipped classroom; videos; active learning; case-based learning; pre-clinical veterinary science; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; HEALTH-PROFESSIONS; VIDEO CLIPS; METAANALYSIS; FUTURE; SKILLS; TOOLS; CALL; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Veterinary Sciences; Education & Educational Research; Veterinary Sciences; Video Meta Results Raw",Dooley LM and Frankland S and Boller E and Tudor E,,,0,531

The aggregate effect, calculated on the basis of 217 experimental comparisons from 33 experimental studies involving a total of 1,058 people, was 0.40 standard deviation (SE = 0.07). The effects of training were greater for programs working with a standard observation form of target skills that were central to the program. Results were more positive for outcome measures that measured positive skills rather than negative ones. In addition, molar outcome measures, which were obtained by means of an assessment scale, showed larger effects than micromeasures, which were scored using event sampling. Finally, recommendations are made for video feedback design and for future research.

What is not known is whether self-reflection is a valid construct for study and whether it has any clinical implications for psychiatric patients deemed to have impaired self-reflection or \insight\'. One design is to contrast the appraisal of another person with that of the self. Although it would be useful to measure this appraisal against a gold standard",that is not always possible.

605,Computerized Cognitive Training in Cognitively Healthy Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Effect Modifiers,"Background: New effective interventions to attenuate age-related cognitive decline are a global priority. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is believed to be safe and can be inexpensive, but neither its efficacy in enhancing cognitive performance in healthy older adults nor the impact of design factors on such efficacy has been systematically analyzed. Our aim therefore was to quantitatively assess whether CCT programs can enhance cognition in healthy older adults, discriminate responsive from nonresponsive cognitive domains, and identify the most salient design factors. Methods and Findings: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO for relevant studies from the databases' inception to 9 July 2014. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of >= 4 h of CCT on performance in neuropsychological tests in older adults without dementia or other cognitive impairment. Fifty-two studies encompassing 4,885 participants were eligible. Intervention designs varied considerably, but after removal of one outlier, heterogeneity across studies was small (I-2 = 29.92%). There was no systematic evidence of publication bias. The overall effect size (Hedges' g, random effects model) for CCT versus control was small and statistically significant, g = 0.22 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.29). Small to moderate effect sizes were found for nonverbal memory, g = 0.24 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.38); verbal memory, g = 0.08 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.15); working memory (WM), g = 0.22 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.35); processing speed, g = 0.31 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.50); and visuospatial skills, g = 0.30 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.54). No significant effects were found for executive functions and attention. Moderator analyses revealed that home-based administration was ineffective compared to group-based training, and that more than three training sessions per week was ineffective versus three or fewer. There was no evidence for the effectiveness of WM training, and only weak evidence for sessions less than 30 min. These results are limited to healthy older adults, and do not address the durability of training effects. Conclusions: CCT is modestly effective at improving cognitive performance in healthy older adults, but efficacy varies across cognitive domains and is largely determined by design choices. Unsupervised at-home training and training more than three times per week are specifically ineffective. Further research is required to enhance efficacy of the intervention.",Video Meta Results Raw,Lampit A and Hallock H and Valenzuela M,,,0,534
607,Development of a Healthy Lifestyle Mobile App for Overweight Pregnant Women: Qualitative Study,"BACKGROUND: Mobile apps are becoming an increasingly ubiquitous platform for delivery of health behavior interventions among overweight and obese perinatal women. However, only a few methodological guidelines on integrating theory, evidence, and qualitative research for their designs are available. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a theory-based, evidence-driven, and user-centered healthy lifestyle app targeting overweight and obese multiethnic pregnant women. METHODS: This paper illustrates how intervention development may be enriched with theoretical basis, systematic review, and qualitative study. An individual face-to-face interview was performed to incorporate the user's involvement in the design. These interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Thematic analysis technique was used for emerging themes. RESULTS: Integrated concepts of social cognitive theory of self-regulation, self-regulation model, and strength model of self-control were selected as bases of the intervention. Evidence from our systematic review and meta-analysis provided the strongest evidence for the development of intervention. We invited 16 obese or overweight pregnant women to participate in a semistructured interview . The following key themes emerged: content, platform, interactivity, format, and functionality. Apps are a favorable technology platform for healthy diet advice, appropriate physical exercise, and weight management because they are user-friendly and convenient. The app used in this study contains culture-specific, pregnancy-related, and credible contents, including educational, professional and peer support, and self-monitoring domains. The design should include aesthetic appeal, visualized features, and interactive multimedia. CONCLUSIONS: A 3-step process integrating theoretical basis, evidence from systematic review, and research findings from target users can be considered a guide for future app development.",mobile apps; overweight; obesity; GESTATIONAL WEIGHT-GAIN; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; DECISION-MAKING; INTERVENTION; MODEL; RECOMMENDATIONS; MULTICENTER; SMARTPHONE; FRAMEWORK; EXERCISE; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Lau Y and Cheng LJ and Chi C and Tsai C and Ong KW and Ho-Lim SS and Wang W and Tan KL,,,0,535
608,Microlearning for patient safety: Crew resource management training in 15-minutes,"Objectives We sought to establish the feasibility of chunking crew resource management (CRM) training into micro-size interventions and to compare different training approaches in the context of micro-learning. Design We evaluated whether participants in micro-learning CRM activities achieved learning objectives following training. In a between-subjects design, groups were observed for behaviour during a simulation that was part of a 15-minute modular intervention and tested for recollection afterwards. Participants The 129 participants recruited for this study were medical students, who already had relevant experience treating patients. Interventions The experimental setting involved three 5-minute components: video, simulation, and debriefing. Different groups viewed videos involving different didactic concepts: one group observed a videotaped concrete example of a medical care team applying a CRM tool (example group), and one group observed a videotaped lecture on the same topic (lecture group). Main outcome measures All simulations were videotaped and coded in detail for the occurrence of and time spent engaging in team behaviour and medical care. Questionnaires were administered before, immediately after, and two weeks after the intervention. We compared the groups' behaviour during the simulation (team cooperation and medical care), retention of knowledge from the training content, and results of the evaluation. Results Both groups exhibited most of the behaviours included in the content of the instructional videos during the simulations and recollected information 2 weeks later. The example group exhibited significantly more of the training content during the simulation and demonstrated better retention 2 weeks later. Although the example group spent more time on team coordination, there was no difference in the number of executed medical measures. Conclusion Delivering CRM training in chunks of relatively short and highly standardised interventions appears feasible. In this study, the form of didactical presentation caused a difference in learning success between groups: a traditional lecture was outperformed by an instructional video demonstrating a practical example.",COMMUNICATION; TEAMWORK; COORDINATION; METAANALYSIS; EDUCATION; CALL; SBAR; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw,Gross B and Rusin L and Kiesewetter J and Zottmann JM and Fischer MR and Prueckner S and Zech A,,,0,536

This article presents findings from a meta-analysis of 11 studies of computer-mediated glosses in second language reading comprehension and incidental vocabulary learning. Computer-mediated glosses had an overall medium effect on second language reading comprehension and a large effect on incidental vocabulary learning. Mean effect sizes varied from medium to large depending upon the level of instruction, text type, and assessment tasks.

We examined this hypothesis by investigating the effects of the World of Words instructional program, a supplemental intervention for children in preschool designed to teach word knowledge and conceptual development through taxonomic categorization and embedded multimedia. Participants in the study included 3- and 4-year-old children from 28 Head Start classrooms in 12 schools, randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Children were assessed on word knowledge, expressive language, conceptual knowledge, and categories and properties of concepts in a yearlong intervention. Results indicated that children receiving the WOW treatment consistently outperformed their control counterparts; further, treatment children were able to use categories to identify the meaning of novel words. Gains in word and categorical knowledge were sustained six months later for those children who remained in Head Start. These results suggest that a program targeted to learning words within taxonomic categories may act as a bootstrap for self-learning and inference generation.",Video Meta Results Raw,Neuman SB and Newman EH and Dwyer J,,,0,539

Yet, reservations exist due to limited authenticity and high production costs. The present paper comprehensively describes a video production process for scripted videos on the topic of student misbehavior in the classroom. In a three step procedure-selection of evidence based practice, vignette script development, and video production-, we developed two contrastive video cases for use in teacher education. Based on authentic teaching scenarios, each of the cases entails a best practice classroom exemplar and a related problem case. A key output of this study is a manual for the development of scripted videos that meet the requirements of both internal and external validity. Preliminary evaluative data from 81 preservice teachers support the usefulness of the final products.

616,Fostering pre-service teachers' self-regulated learning through self- and peer assessment of wiki projects,"This study investigates whether self-regulated learning of pre-service early-childhood teachers is a viable pedagogy to improve the quality of their wild-based projects. A total of 76 early-childhood pre-service teachers in their first year of study at a teacher training institute in Hong Kong participated in this study. The tasks involved were based on seven principles for supporting and developing self-regulated learning. The pre-service teachers formed groups to apply the skills and knowledge that were taught by the author by creating educational wild sites for young children to learn about a topic of their choice. This was then followed by preliminary-self-assessment, class presentations of the wild projects, peer assessment, revision of the projects and final-self-assessment. Indeed, the pre-service teachers' involvement in assessing wild projects perfectly aligns with the collaborative spirit of authoring wiki projects. Quantitative data were collected using a questionnaire and the self- and peer assessment reports, whilst qualitative data were collected from a focus group held with six of the students. It is noteworthy that the students tended to be more demanding of themselves than of their classmates, as shown by a significant difference between preliminary-self assessment and peer assessment in the scores for three out of four criteria (p value = 0.011). The mean for preliminary-self-made video was rated the lowest by preliminary-self-assessment but it was rated the highest by peers. Since the p-value is 0.024, which is less than 0.05, this difference is significant. The focus-group participants thought their peers and the teacher provided helpful feedback, but did not find the self assessment particularly useful. Although the data from the questionnaires and focus groups show that the pre-service teachers considered formative assessment approaches helpful, and all the mean final-self-assessment scores improved, the differences between preliminary-self-assessment and final-self-assessment were not significant. The research findings show that the students were active wild creators and assessors and yet they did not have enough confidence in themselves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Aims: To determine the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of self-help interventions for anxiety disorders. Method: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of self-help interventions for anxiety disorders were identified by searching nine online databases. Studies were grouped according to disorder and meta-analyses were conducted where sufficient data were available. Overall meta-analyses of self-help v. waiting list and therapist-administered treatment were also undertaken. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two researchers according to criteria set out by the Cochrane Collaboration. Results: Thirty-one RCTs met inclusion criteria for the review. Results of the overall meta-analysis comparing self-help with waiting list gave a significant effect size of 0.84 in favour of self-help. Comparison of self-help with therapist-administered treatments revealed a significant difference in favour of the latter with an effect size of 0.34. The addition of guidance and the presentation of multimedia or web-based self-help materials improved treatment outcome. Conclusions: Self-help interventions appear to be an effective way of treating individuals diagnosed with social phobia and panic disorder. Further research is required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and acceptability of these interventions.

Parents and children alike believe eduactional videos make these topics more engaging, and socio-cultural theory suggests such videos can effectively promote learning. To that end, we tested the efficacy of a series of reproductive health education videos called 'A New You, That's Who', with a sample of 80 11-year-old children in a research laboratory setting. The series was designed with socio-cultural theory learning principles in mind and consisted of three 5-min animated music videos focused on puberty, reproductive anatomy, and menstruation. Children were randomly assigned to watch the 'A New You, That's Who' videos or a control set of videos on the scientific method. Children who watched the treatment videos out-performed peers in the control group on a measure reproductive health knowledge. However, there were no differences in attitudes towards puberty between conditions. The videos provide effective ways to learn factual information about puberty and human reproduction, and may be valuable tools to supplement social-emotional lessons provided at home, at school, or in other real-world settings.","SEXUALITY EDUCATION; EARLY ADOLESCENCE; SEX-EDUCATION; YOUNG-PEOPLE; CHILDRENS; COMMUNICATION; SCHOOLS; MENSTRUATION; METAANALYSIS; TELEVISION; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw",Hurwitz LB and Lovato SB and Lauricella AR and Woodruff TK and Patrick E and Wartella E,,,0,543

Eleven studies (n = 472 participants) were identified from electronic database searches. Study quality was assessed, with studies characterised by small and underpowered samples. Effect sizes and associated confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to determine the direction and magnitude of treatment change. Short-term treatment gains were reported for internet and video-based interventions. This included significant medium to large improvements (d range = 0.66-3.22) in cognitive and behavioural symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety and posttraumatic stress. However, the equivalence of telepsychology and face-to-face psychotherapy could not be determined, with few comparative studies available. Both treatment gains and deterioration were noted 1 to 6 months following treatment cessation, although this was based on limited follow-up data. Further larger scale and longitudinal research will help to ascertain the minimum requirements for the management and treatment of PTSD in a technology-supported environment.","Telepsychiatry; Telecare; Online health; ehealth; Remote consultation; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Humans; Internet; Psychotherapy; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Telemedicine; Videoconferencing; Disease Management; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; Psychology; Telemedicine; Treatment Outcomes; Electronic Communication; Technology; Teleconferencing; Computer Mediated Communication; Telepsychology; Telepsychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw",Bolton AJ and Dorstyn DS,,,0,544
621,The dopaminergic basis of human behaviors: A review of molecular imaging studies,"This systematic review describes human molecular imaging studies which have investigated alterations in extracellular DA levels during performance of behavioral tasks. Whilst heterogeneity in experimental methods limits meta-analysis, we describe the advantages and limitations of different methodological approaches. Interpretation of experimental results may be limited by regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes, head movement and choice of control conditions. We revisit our original study of striatal DA release during video-game playing [Koepp, M.J., Gunn, R.N., Lawrence, A.D., Cunningham, V.J., Dagher, A., Jones, T., Brooks, D.J., Bench, C.J., Grasby, P.M., 1998. Evidence for striatal dopamine release during a video game. Nature 393, 266–268] to illustrate the potentially confounding influences of head movement and alterations in rCBF. Changes in [¹¹C]raclopride binding may be detected in extrastriatal as well as striatal brain regions—however we review evidence which suggests that extrastriatal changes may not be clearly interpreted in terms of DA release. Whilst several investigations have detected increases in striatal extracellular DA concentrations during task components such as motor learning and execution, reward-related processes, stress and cognitive performance, the presence of potentially biasing factors should be carefully considered (and, where possible, accounted for) when designing and interpreting future studies.

Teachers’ noticing or teachers’ professional vision, and teachers’ (situated) professional knowledge were found to be the most frequent frameworks. Designs ranged from comprehensive case studies with a variety of methods to confirmatory studies testing a large sample with standardized instruments. The main findings suggest: (1) Teachers’ expertise and experience positively influence noticing and teachers’ noticing can be successfully fostered by (video-based) professional development programs. (2) Pre-service teachers struggle with perceiving and interpreting students’ work. Thereby, their mathematical knowledge plays an important role. (3) Teachers’ in-the-moment decision-making is influenced by their knowledge, beliefs and goals. (4) Teachers’ knowledge and belief facets predict their situation specific-skills which in turn correlate with aspects close to instructional practice. (5) Teachers have difficulties interpreting tasks and identifying their educational potential. Methods and implication of this systematic review are thoroughly discussed. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Higher Education; Postsecondary Education; Decision Making; Teacher Attitudes; Correlation; Professional Development; Data Interpretation; Mathematics; Research; Mathematics Teachers; Preservice Teachers; Case Studies; Literature Reviews; Mathematics Education; Models; Teaching Methods; Mathematics Skills; Expertise; Decision-making; Interpretation; Perception; Situation-specific skills; Teacher cognition; Teacher professional knowledge; Video Meta Results Raw",Stahnke R and Schueler S and Roesken-Winter B,,,0,546
623,"Web-Based Self-Management Programs for Bipolar Disorder: Insights From the Online, Recovery-Oriented Bipolar Individualised Tool Project","Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex, relapsing mood disorder characterized by considerable morbidity and mortality. Web-based self-management interventions provide marked opportunities for several chronic mental health conditions. However, Web-based self-management programs targeting BD are underrepresented compared with programs targeting other psychiatric conditions. Objective: This paper aims at facilitating future research in the area of self-management of BD and draws insights from the development of one such intervention-the Online, Recovery-Oriented Bipolar Individualised Tool (ORBIT)-that is aimed at improving the quality of life of people with BD. Methods: We have discussed the opportunities and challenges in developing an engaging, evidence-based, safe intervention within the context of the following three nested domains: (1) intervention development; (2) scientific testing of the intervention; and (3) ethical framework including risk management. Results: We gained the following insights across the three abovementioned overlapping domains: Web-based interventions can be optimized through (1) codesign with consumers with lived experience to ensure relevance and appropriateness to the target audience; (2) novel content development processes that iteratively combine evidence-based information with lived experience perspectives, capitalizing on multimedia (eg, videos) that the digital health space provides; and (3) incorporating Web-based communities to connect end users and promote constructive engagement by access to a Web-based coach. Conclusions: Self-management is effective in BD, even for those on the more severe end of the spectrum. While there are challenges to be aware of, guided self-management programs, such as those offered by the ORBIT project, which are specifically developed for Web-based delivery provide highly accessible, engaging, and potentially provocative treatments for chronically ill populations who may otherwise have never engaged with treatment. Key questions about engagement, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness will be answered by the ORBIT project over the next 18 months.",Web-based intervention; bipolar disorder; self-management; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR THERAPY; E-MENTAL HEALTH; SOMATIC DISORDERS; SERVICE USERS; HELP PROGRAM; INTERNET; INTERVENTION; FEASIBILITY; METAANALYSIS; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Fletcher K and Foley F and Murray G,,,0,547
624,Updating the Trainability Tests Literature on Black-White Subgroup Differences and Reconsidering Criterion-Related Validity,"A number of applied psychologists have suggested that trainability test Black White ethnic group differences are low or relatively low (e.g., Siegel & Bergman, 1975), though data are scarce. Likewise, there are relatively few estimates of criterion-related validity for trainability tests predicting job performance (cf. Robertson & Downs, 1989). We review and clarify the existing (and limited) literature on Black White group differences on trainability tests, provide new trainability test data from a recent video-based trainability exam, and present archival data about how trainability test scores relate to cognitive ability, Black White differences, and job performance. Consistent with hypotheses, our results suggest large correlations of trainability tests with cognitive ability (e.g.,.80) and larger standardized ethnic group differences than previously thought (ds of 0.86, 1.10, and 1.21 for 3 samples). Results also suggest that trainability tests have higher validity than previously thought. Overall, our analysis provides a substantial amount of data to update our understanding of the use of trainability tests in personnel selection.",Video Meta Results Raw,Roth PL and Buster MA and Bobko P,,,0,548
625,Evaluation of an online training program in eating disorders for health professionals in Australia,"Background: Early detection and treatment of eating disorders is instrumental in positive health outcomes for this serious public health concern. As such, workforce development in screening, diagnosis and early treatment of eating disorders is needed. Research has demonstrated both high rates of failure to accurately diagnose and treat cases early and low levels of perceived access to training in eating disorders by health professionals-representing an urgent need for clinician training in this area. However, significant barriers to the access of evidence-based training programs exist, including availability, cost and time, particularly when large geographic distances are involved. Online learning presents a solution to workforce challenges, as it can be delivered anywhere, at a fraction of the cost of traditional training, timing is user controlled, and a growing body of research is demonstrating it as effective as face-to-face training. The Centre for Eating and Dieting Disorders in Australia has developed an Online Training Program In Eating Disorders, to educate health professionals in the nature, identification, assessment and management of eating disorders. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the ability of this online learning course to improve clinician levels of knowledge, skill and confidence to treat eating disorders. As well as its effect on stigmatised beliefs about eating disorders known to effect treatment delivery. Methods: One-hundred-eighty-seven health professionals participated in the program. A pre training questionnaire and a post training evaluation examined participants' levels of knowledge, skill and confidence to treat eating disorders, as well attitudes and beliefs about people with eating disorders. Results: Significant improvements in knowledge, skill, and confidence to treat eating disorders was found between pre and post program assessment in health professionals who completed the course, along with a significant decrease in stigmatised beliefs about eating disorders. Discussion: The results of this study demonstrated that the online training program was an effective tool in increasing health professionals' level of knowledge, skill and confidence to treat people with eating disorders. The results also demonstrated that online training reduced health professionals' personal bias towards people with eating disorders. Limitations of this study include the use of self-report measures rather than observation of the health professional in clinical practice. As a result, it is not possible to make determinations regarding the translation of these results to clinical settings. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that online training programs may present an innovative solution to the considerable workforce development challenges faced by clinicians needing training in eating disorders.",Video Meta Results Raw,Brownlow RS and Maguire S and O'Dell A and Dias-da-Costa C and Touyz S and Russell J,,,0,549
626,The influence of risk perception on safety: A laboratory study,"Although it may be expected that employee perception of risk impacts engagement in safety behavior, previous research has been equivocal. The purpose of the present study was to clarify this relationship via a more thorough measurement of risk perception. Specifically, this study investigated the value of using a risk perception measure that makes risk perception conditional on behavior, in addition to investigating cognitive and affective risk perception. Another purpose of this study was to investigate how a lack of supervisor commitment to safety affects employees' safety behaviors. Eighty individuals participated in a laboratory study in which they performed two seemingly dangerous tasks. Supervisor commitment to safety was manipulated and safety behavior was assessed using video data. Results suggest that risk perception, when framed with regard to the risk of not performing the safety procedures, is related to safety behavior, as is supervisor commitment to safety. implications for the findings are discussed, including the need for measures that make risk perception conditional on behavior.

627,Pedagogical content knowledge of experts and noviceswhat knowledge do they activate when analyzing science lessons?,"In the current debate on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), the term is used to refer to the context-specific knowledge that teachers activate when reflecting on practice. Against the background of this debate, we conducted an empirical study and sought to answer the question of which knowledge experts and novices activated in assessing a videotaped lesson in relation to its effectiveness for learning. Our assumption was that the participants activate their PCK as a blending of content knowledge (CK) and pedagogical knowledge (PK) as suggested by Shulman's amalgam thesis. The participants (9 experts and 9 novices) were shown a lesson on optics, in which the law of refraction (Snell's law) was being studied. In a subsequent interview, the participants were asked to analyze the observed lesson. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the interviews showed that experts activated both CK and PK intensively and in this respect they differed significantly from novices. Further analysis of the expert statements also proved that they do not activate their CK and PK in isolation, but instead combine both kinds of knowledge together, in line with Shulman's amalgam thesis.

628,The Role of Transfer in Designing Games and Simulations for Health: Systematic Review,"Background: The usefulness and importance of serious games and simulations in learning and behavior change for health and health-related issues are widely recognized. Studies have addressed games and simulations as interventions, mostly in comparison with their analog counterparts. Numerous complex design choices have to be made with serious games and simulations for health, including choices that directly contribute to the effects of the intervention. One of these decisions is the way an intervention is expected to lead to desirable transfer effects. Most designs adopt a first-class transfer rationale, whereas the second class of transfer types seems a rarity in serious games and simulations for health. Objective: This study sought to review the literature specifically on the second class of transfer types in the design of serious games and simulations. Focusing on game-like interventions for health and health care, this study aimed to (1) determine whether the second class of transfer is recognized as a road for transfer in game-like interventions, (2) review the application of the second class of transfer type in designing game-like interventions, and (3) assess studies that include second-class transfer types reporting transfer outcomes. Methods: A total of 6 Web-based databases were systematically searched by titles, abstracts, and keywords using the search strategy (video games OR game OR games OR gaming OR computer simulation*) AND (software design OR design) AND (fidelity OR fidelities OR transfer* OR behaviour OR behavior). The databases searched were identified as relevant to health, education, and social science. Results: A total of 15 relevant studies were included, covering a range of game-like interventions, all more or less mentioning design parameters aimed at transfer. We found 9 studies where first-class transfer was part of the design of the intervention. In total, 8 studies dealt with transfer concepts and fidelity types in game-like intervention design in general; 3 studies dealt with the concept of second-class transfer types and reported effects, and 2 of those recognized transfer as a design parameter. Conclusions: In studies on game-like interventions for health and health care, transfer is regarded as a desirable effect but not as a basic principle for design. None of the studies determined the second class of transfer or instances thereof, although in 3 cases a nonliteral transfer type was present. We also found that studies on game-like interventions for health do not elucidate design choices made and rarely provide design principles for future work. Games and simulations for health abundantly build upon the principles of first-class transfer, but the adoption of second-class transfer types proves scarce. It is likely to be worthwhile to explore the possibilities of second-class transfer types, as they may considerably influence educational objectives in terms of future serious game design for health.",transfer; computer simulation; video games; serious games; games for health; fidelity; abstract learning; immersion; metaphor; VIDEO GAME; FIDELITY; SKILLS; FRAMEWORK; OUTCOMES; Medical Informatics; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Kuipers DA and Terlouw G and Wartena BO and van 't Veer JT and Prins JT and Pierie JP,,,0,552
629,Systematic review of e-learning for surgical training,"BACKGROUND: Internet and software-based platforms (e-learning) have gained popularity as teaching tools in medical education. Despite widespread use, there is limited evidence to support their effectiveness for surgical training. This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of e-learning as a teaching tool compared with no intervention and other methods of surgical training. METHODS: A systematic literature search of bibliographical databases was performed up to August 2015. Studies were included if they were RCTs assessing the effectiveness of an e-learning platform for teaching any surgical skill, compared with no intervention or another method of training. RESULTS: From 4704 studies screened, 87 were included with 7871 participants enrolled, comprising medical students (52 studies), trainees (51 studies), qualified surgeons (2 studies) and nurses (6 studies). E-learning tools were used for teaching cognitive (71 studies), psychomotor (36 studies) and non-technical (8 studies) skills. Tool features included multimedia (84 studies), interactive learning (60 studies), feedback (27 studies), assessment (26 studies), virtual patients (22 studies), virtual reality environment (11 studies), spaced education (7 studies), community discussions (2 studies) and gaming (2 studies). Overall, e-learning showed either greater or similar effectiveness compared with both no intervention (29 and 4 studies respectively) and non-e-learning interventions (29 and 22 studies respectively). CONCLUSION: Despite significant heterogeneity amongst platforms, e-learning is at least as effective as other methods of training.",Video Meta Results Raw,Maertens H and Madani A and Landry T and Vermassen F and Van Herzeele I and Aggarwal R,,,0,553
630,YouTube as a learning tool for four shoulder tests,"AimTo analyze the use of YouTube videos as educational tools for four physical examinations of the shoulder: the Neer, Hawkins, empty can, and drop arm tests. BACKGROUND: Video-based education, which is accompanied by text-based education, can be an effective education method, especially in learning medical skills. Medical students and doctors in training often use YouTube videos to share medical education materials, and more systematic review of the reliability of these videos is required. METHODS: A search of YouTube was conducted using four keywords: 'Neer test,' 'Hawkins test,' 'empty can test,' and 'drop arm test.' Two physicians reviewed each video and recorded a variety of characteristics (date uploaded, number of views, likes and dislikes, and upload source). In addition, they scored and categorized the videos into four groups: 'very useful,' 'somewhat useful,' 'not useful,' and 'misleading.' Videos containing inappropriate content were classified as 'misleading.' Finally, the correlations of each video's usefulness with viewers' preferences and the upload source were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 400 videos were assessed and 200 videos were adopted which yield eligible criteria. Out of 200 videos, 51 videos were very useful and 32 were misleading. Significant correlations were observed between the video's usefulness and the uploaded source, as well as between the video's usefulness and viewers' preferences, such as the number of views, views per day, and number of likes. The proportion of videos classified as 'very useful' was highest (58.6%) among those uploaded by physicians and lowest (12.7%) among those uploaded by individuals. Videos uploaded by individuals had significantly lower values reflecting viewer preferences than did videos uploaded by physicians. CONCLUSION: YouTube videos could be used as learning sources for shoulder physical examinations after the application of appropriate filtering processes, such as review of the upload source and viewers' preferences.",YouTube; e-learning; shoulder; physical examination; e-health; CLINICAL EXAMINATION; PATIENT INFORMATION; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; VIDEO; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; TUBE; Primary Health Care; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw,Lee H and Choi A and Jang Y and Lee JI,,,0,554
631,Variation in Hospital Adoption Rates of Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomy for Lung Cancer and the Effect on Outcomes,"Background. This study examined the variation in the adoption of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lobectomy across United States hospitals from a population-based national database. Methods. We used the National Cancer Data Base to identify patients undergoing lobectomy between 2010 and 2012 and used hierarchical regression to estimate case-mix-adjusted VATS lobectomy rates using patient and tumor characteristics. We stratified hospitals into quintiles by adjusted VATS lobectomy rates. To account for lack of equipment to perform minimally invasive thoracoscopic operations, we also obtained data on VATS wedge resections. Results. Of 55,972 cancer lobectomies performed at 905 hospitals, 17,072 (30.5%) were VATS. Crude hospital VATS use varied widely (mean was 25.5% of all lobectomies per hospital; interquartile range, 4.4% to 42.3%). Variation persisted after case-mix adjustment. For example, VATS rates at the highest and lowest quintiles were 76% vs 0.6%, respectively. Differences in patient and tumor characteristics across quintiles were negligible, and there was no indication that those hospitals lacked VATS equipment. The risk-adjusted same-hospital readmission (6.7% vs 7%; p > 0.2), 30-day mortality (1.5% vs 1.5%; p > 0.2), and 90- day mortality (2.9% vs 2.7%; p = 0.038) rates were similar between the highest and lowest quintiles. Length of stay was shorter at hospitals in the highest VATS quintile (6.6 vs 7.4 days; p < 0.001). Conclusions. Adoption of VATS lobectomy varies widely across United States hospitals. This variation cannot be explained by patient or tumor characteristics or by a shortage of VATS equipment. Efforts to reduce this variation will require the dissemination and implementation of novel training techniques and learning opportunities for surgeons.

633,"46th ESAO Congress 3-7 September 2019 Hannover, Germany Abstracts","Objectives:ADVOS multi is a recirculating albumin-based dialysis device that supports kidney, liver and lung function by eliminating CO2, water-soluble and protein-bound substances. In the present work in vitro data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods: An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied. Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%, 62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3) dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160 ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here, albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure. Objectives:Given the extent of bypass graft failure, the motivation behind this multidisciplinary project is to improve the patency of the current bypass grafts by developing a novel and optimised blood flow augmentation technique. Methods: One of the most significant contributions to the improvement of haemodynamics in grafts was based on a research which showed that the 'spiral flow' is a natural phenomenon in the whole arterial system and is induced by the twisting of the left ventricle during contraction and then accentuated upon entering the aortic arch. The benefit of this flow pattern lies in removing unfavourable haemodynamic environment such as turbulence, stagnation and oscillatory shear stress, which are believed to be the main causes of intimal hyperplasia at anastomotic configurations. Results:This multi-disciplinary engineering venture has resulted in a unique product which makes use of both non-planar helicity and an optimised internal ridge within the graft to achieve a significantly improved haemodynamic condition within the anastomosis (an anastomosis is a surgical connection between autologous/prosthetic grafts and veins/arteries inside the human body) Discussion:This truly multidisciplinary project has integrated fluid mechanics, biomechanics and biology with cardiovascular surgery to develop a novel biomedical device, inspired by the nuclear engineering sector. The novel spiral-inducing bypass graft, nominated for this award, is the best example of how engineering techniques, tools and designs can lead to life-saving innovations that could potentially save the lives of thousands of people and save millions of pounds for the healthcare systems across the world. Such successful engineering stories are what would encourage the next generation of engineers to go beyond the traditional boundaries of engineering disciplines to make a difference. Objectives:The goal of this work was to study methods that will allow increase in spatial freedom of couplers orientation in inductive powering unit for implantable medical devices. An inductive energy transfer system is considered, therefore the freedom of relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving coils must be optimized. Methods:The design procedure of inductive powering unit (IPU) consists of two main steps: design of the power amplifier and optimization of an inductive link. To account for the patient specifics, such as tissue thickness near the implantation site, a number of different couplers were simulated using finite element modeling. Effect of coils geometrical parameters on mutual inductance and inductive link efficiency was examined. Class E power amplifier was chosen as a driver for the transmitting coil. Capacitors in the amplifier loading network were tuned to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). A patient's everyday activity, including walking and even breathing, leads to misalignment of the transmitting and receiving coils, and, as a result, detuning of the amplifier from ZVS and increased losses. Feedback schemes were studied to compensate the misalignments effect on the amplifier. Results:A self-oscillating IPU with class E amplifier was designed that provides stable output power about 0.5 W for the distance between the couplers in range 10-20 mm and the lateral distance up to 20 mm. The use of self-oscillating circuit in the transmitter increases spatial freedom of the transmitting and receiving coils corresponding to ZVS. Discussion: Inductive link geometrical parameters optimization and implementation of self-oscillating class E driver the IPU contributes to stable output power and efficiency of IPU. As a result, less intervention from the patient and physician is required, and patient quality of life is increased Precision medicine emerges from integration of a number of emerging technologies and the data they produce with modern data analytics. For precision diagnostics and for predicting drug responses new computational and in-vitro models are needed from gene regulation to cellular and organ functions. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) derived e.g., from patient blood cells provide means to produce most cell types and thus provide means to get patient specific in-vitro models. New technologies are needed to produce tissues from these cells and to assess the cell functions in-vitro. In addition, computational in-silico models can be used to augment our understanding of the diseases or drug effects. They also provide tools to translate the in-vitro findings to clinical settings and patient populations. We are in transition to turn our in-vitro cell culture models to body-on-chip platforms including environmental control and biophysical functional sensing. We have developed methods to assess the cellular functions based on electrophysiological sensing as well as 2D and 3D bioimaging. For example, we have developed imaging methods to assess functions of hIPSC cardiac cell with simultaneous assessment of electrophysiology such as Calcium and voltage transients as well as mechanobiology in vitro. Further, we have developed in-silico models of various cellular function including multi-cell-type neuronal networks and in-silico population models of the hIPSC cardiomyocytes. The later ones are providing us ionic machinery of hIPSC derived cardiomyocyte electrophysiology in various populations of patiets. We have shown that these computational models can represent pathological patient phenotype cells and populations of patients with specific mutations, e.g., long QT syndrome. We have also demonstrated the power of in-silico as possible pre-screening method for drug effects prior to in-vitro examinations. Moreover, our in-silico results highlight the need of careful consideration of use of HiPSC models before they can be turned from immature cell models to mature tissues in vitro. With integration of novel engineering expertise from multimodal sensing, imaging and computational modelling, we have shown their power on studying diseases and for pre-screening of compounds. Our results demonstrate the power of combined in-vitro and in-silco methods for future precision medicine. Objectives: We have developed in vivo tissue engineered autologous vascular grafts constructed in the subcutaneous of the recipient body. However, since the formation of the vascular grafts depends on the conditions of recipients including high risk or immature patients, immaturity in the fabricated tissues might be problematic for the severely diseased patients because of their suppressed regenerative activity. Therefore, possibility of the xenogeneic or the allogeneic implantation of the grafts should be evaluated. The objective of this study is to fabricate cardiovascular grafts using xenogeneic or allogeneic animals. Methods: Silicone rod molds were placed into subcutaneous pouches of beagle dogs, and after 4 weeks the implants with their surrounded connective tissues were harvested. Those were decellularized with detergents and stored at -20 degrees C for 1 week. Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 2 mm) were xeno-transplanted to abdominal aorta of the rats. Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 5 mm) were cut open and trimmed to elliptical sheets of 15 x 8 mm, they were allo-transplanted to carotid arteries of other beagle dogs as vascular patches. Results: Both xenogeneic vascular grafts and allogeneic patch grafts performed well after transplantation, and the luminal surfaces after resection were very smooth.

634,e-Leaming in Surgical Education: A Systematic Review,"OBJECTIVE: e-Learning involves the delivery of educational content through web-based methods. Owing to work-hour restrictions and changing practice patterns in surgery, e-learning can offer an effective alternative to traditional teaching. Our aims were to (1) identify current modalities of e-learning, (2) assess the efficacy of e-learning as an intervention in surgical education through a systematic review of the literature, and (3) discuss the relevance of e-learning as an educational tool in surgical education. This is the first such systematic review in this field. DESIGN: A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted for relevant articles published until July 2014, using a predefined search strategy. The database search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 38 articles were found which met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, e-learning was used as an intervention in 3 different ways: (1) to teach cases through virtual patients (18/38); (2) to teach theoretical knowledge through online tutorials, or other means (18/38); and (3) to teach surgical skills (2/38). Nearly all of the studies reviewed report significant knowledge gain from e-learning; however, 2 in 3 studies did not use a control group. CONCLUSIONS: e-Learning has emerged as an effective mode of teaching with particular relevance for surgical education today. Published studies have demonstrated the efficacy of this method; however, future work must involve well-designed randomized controlled trials comparing e-learning against standard teaching.

636,Developing a Theory of Gamified Learning: Linking Serious Games and Gamification of Learning,"Background and Aim. Gamification has been defined as the use of characteristics commonly associated with video games in non-game contexts. In this article, I reframe this definition in terms of the game attribute taxonomy presented by Bedwell and colleagues. This linking is done with the goal of aligning the research literatures of serious games and gamification. A psychological theory of gamified learning is developed and explored. Conclusion. In the theory of gamified learning, gamification is defined as the use of game attributes, as defined by the Bedwell taxonomy, outside the context of a game with the purpose of affecting learning-related behaviors or attitudes. These behaviors/attitudes, in turn, influence learning by one or two processes: by strengthening the relationship between instructional design quality and outcomes (a moderating process) and/or by influencing learning directly (a mediating process). This is contrasted with a serious games approach in which manipulation of game attributes is typically intended to affect learning without this type of behavioral mediator/moderator. Examples of each game attribute category as it might be applied in gamification are provided, along with specific recommendations for the rigorous, scientific study of gamification.",Video Meta Results Raw,Landers RN,,,0,558

640,The design and implementation of learning paths in a learning management system,"Learning paths have the potential to play an important role in the way educators serve their learners. Empirical research about learning paths is scarce, particularly in a secondary education setting. The present quasi-experimental study took place in the context of a biology course involving 360 secondary school students. A 2 x 2 factorial research design was adopted. Learners were engaged in learning activities in a learning path. These learning activities (1) differed in design and (2) were either undertaken individually or collaboratively. Gender was considered as a critical covariable, given the focus on science learning. All learning paths were developed on the basis of visual representations, but in the experimental design conditions, learners worked with learning paths designed according to Mayer's multimedia guidelines (2003). Multilevel analyses were applied to study the impact on learning outcomes according to the design of learning paths, the individual/ collaborative setting, and the co-variable gender. The study provides empirical evidence that both the design and the group setting (collaborative versus individual) have an impact on learning outcomes. Although there was no main effect, several significant interaction effects with gender were found. The results are helpful to direct research about the design and implementation of learning paths in a secondary school setting and underpin the relevance of representation modes in science learning.",Video Meta Results Raw,De Smet C and Schellens T and De Wever B and Brandt-Pomares P and Valcke M,,,0,560
641,Facial expression to emotional stimuli in non-psychotic disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Facial expression of emotion is crucial to social interaction and emotion regulation; therefore, altered facial expressivity can be a contributing factor in social isolation, difficulties with emotion regulation and a target for therapy. This article provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on automatic emotional facial expression in people with non-psychotic disorders compared to healthy comparison groups. Studies in the review used an emotionally salient visual induction method, and reported on automatic facial expression in response to congruent stimuli. A total of 39 studies show alterations in emotional facial expression across all included disorders, except anxiety disorders. In depression, decreases in facial expression are mainly evident for positive affect. In eating disorders, a meta-analysis showed decreased facial expressivity in response to positive and negative stimuli. Studies in autism partially support generally decreased facial expressivity in this group. The data included in this review point towards decreased facial emotional expressivity in individuals with different non-psychotic disorders.

642,Diagnosis and management of epilepsy assiciated with hypothalamic hamartoma: An evidence-based systematic review,"The main objective was to review the evidence for management of epilepsy associated with hypothalamic hamartomas. We performed a systemic review of the literature through July 2012 that studied patients with hypothalamic hamartomas and related epilepsy. Articles meeting selection criteria were rated according to the American Academy of Neurology classification of evidence scheme. Recommendations were linked to the strength of the evidence and as follows: (a) precocious puberty is associated more with the pedunculated type and epilepsy typified by gelastic seizures with the sessile form of hypothalamic hamartomas (class III); (b) significant behavioral and cognitive deficits are associated with patients with hypothalamic hamartomas (class III); (c) video electroencephalography (EEG) findings are extremely variable particularly across the different ages and do not affect surgical outcome (class III); d) various surgical techniques (transcallosal and endoscopic resection) resulted in 49% to 54% seizure freedom, 15% with a pterional approach as well as about 40% with radiosurgery (class III).

644,"The effects of risk-glorifying media exposure on risk-positive cognitions, emotions, and behaviors: A meta-analytic review","In recent years, there has been a surge in the quantity of media content that glorifies risk-taking behavior, such as risky driving, extreme sports, or binge drinking. The authors conducted a meta-analysis involving more than 80,000 participants and 105 independent effect sizes to examine whether exposure to such media depictions increased their recipients' risk-taking inclinations. A positive connection was found for overall, combined risk taking (g = .41); as well as its underlying dimensions: risk-taking behaviors (g = .41), risk-positive cognitions and attitudes (g = .35), and risk-positive emotions (g = .56). This effect was observed across varying research methods (experimental, correlational, longitudinal); types of media (video games, movies, advertising, TV, music); and differing risk-related outcome measures (e.g., smoking, drinking, risky driving, sexual behavior). Multiple moderator analyses revealed 2 theoretically new boundary conditions for sociocognitive models. First, the effect was stronger for active (i.e., video games) than for passive (e.g., film, music) exposure to risk-glorifying media content. Second, the effect was stronger when there was a high degree of contextual fit between the media content and type of risk-taking measure. The theoretical, practical, and societal implications of the present research synthesis are discussed.

645,Video game training does not enhance cognitive ability: A comprehensive meta-analytic investigation,"As a result of considerable potential scientific and societal implications, the possibility of enhancing cognitive ability by training has been one of the most influential topics of cognitive psychology in the last two decades. However, substantial research into the psychology of expertise and a recent series of meta-analytic reviews have suggested that various types of cognitive training (e.g., working memory training) benefit performance only in the trained tasks. The lack of skill generalization from one domain to different ones-that is, far transfer-has been documented in various fields of research such as working memory training, music, brain training, and chess. Video game training is another activity that has been claimed by many researchers to foster a broad range of cognitive abilities such as visual processing, attention, spatial ability, and cognitive control. We tested these claims with three random-effects meta-analytic models. The first meta-analysis (k = 310) examined the correlation between video game skill and cognitive ability. The second meta-analysis (k = 315) dealt with the differences between video game players and nonplayers in cognitive ability. The third meta-analysis (k = 359) investigated the effects of video game training on participants' cognitive ability. Small or null overall effect sizes were found in all three models. These outcomes show that overall cognitive ability and video game skill are only weakly related. Importantly, we found no evidence of a causal relationship between playing video games and enhanced cognitive ability. Video game training thus represents no exception to the general difficulty of obtaining far transfer.

646,Endoscopic breast surgery: where are we now and what might the future hold for video-assisted breast surgery?,"Endoscopic surgery has been extensively used for many surgical conditions and has gained acceptance as an alternative and less invasive approach to open surgery. However, minimal access endoscopic techniques have yet to be translated into mainstream clinical practice in breast surgery. More recently, technical innovations have made it feasible to conduct endoscopic breast cancer resection, with or without breast reconstruction, through wounds inconspicuously hidden in the axilla and periareolar region. Several clinical trials have now been conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility, assess safety and provide follow up data regarding oncological success of endoscopic breast surgery. This primary aim was to critically evaluate the literature in order to determine the oncological and cosmetic efficacy of endoscopic breast surgery. A systematic review was conducted using Medline, Ovid and Embase to identify original data from studies of endoscopic breast surgery. Initial results have demonstrated that endoscopic breast surgery is safe and technically feasible. Early data suggests that it is possible to achieve disease control with high rates of overall survival and low rates of local relapse recurrence and/or distant metastases. However, the absence of level I randomised clinical evidence currently precludes a recommendation that endoscopic breast cancer surgery is capable of achieving equivalent oncological outcomes to open surgery.",Video Meta Results Raw,Leff DR and Vashisht R and Yongue G and Keshtgar M and Yang GZ and Darzi A,,,0,565
647,Egocentric and allocentric spatial reference frames in aging: A systematic review,"Aging affects many aspects of everyday living, such as autonomy, security and quality of life. Among all, spatial memory and spatial navigation show a gradual but noticeable decline, as a result of both neurobiological changes and the general slowing down of cognitive functioning. We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to identify studies that specifically investigated the role of allocentric and egocentric frames in healthy aging. Concerning spatial navigation, our results showed a preservation of egocentric strategies, along with specific impairments in the use of allocentric and switching abilities. Regarding spatial memory, instead, outcomes were more divergent and not frame-specific. With this perspective, spatial impairments were discussed considering the cognitive profile of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).

648,Gender difference on spatial visualization by college students' major types as STEM and non-STEM: a meta-analysis,"Gender difference on spatial visualization has been considered an important factor that impacts the gender gap in academic performance in STEM-related disciplines. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the gender difference on spatial visualization between STEM and non-STEM undergraduate majors. Twenty effect sizes representing STEM majors' spatial ability and 14 effect sizes representing non-STEM majors' spatial ability were included in the present meta-analysis. Results indicated that the overall effect size equalled 0.613 (95% CI = [0.444, 0.782]) in STEM and 0.481 (95% CI = [0.359, 0.604]) in non-STEM. These findings showed that the gender differences on spatial visualization were statistically significant in both STEM and non-STEM majors. The gender difference on spatial visualization in STEM was larger than the gender difference on spatial visualization in non-STEM. In addition, male students' spatial visualization ability was higher than female students' spatial visualization in both STEM and non-STEM majors.",Meta-analysis; gender difference; spatial visualization; science; technology; engineering; and mathematics (STEM) majors; non-STEM majors; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ACHIEVEMENT; ABILITY; THINKING; IMPROVE; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Lee Y and Capraro RM and Bicer A,,,0,567
649,Measuring therapeutic alliance in children with autism during cognitive behavior therapy,"Therapeutic alliance (TA), or the collaborative relationship between a therapist and client, has been shown to be an important component of intervention success. The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Therapy Process Observational Coding System-Alliance Scale (TPOCS-A). The sample consisted of 20 children (19 males) ages 8 to 12 years with autism and their parents (15 mothers, 5 fathers), who completed a cognitive-behavioural intervention designed to improve children's emotion regulation skills. Two trained coders rated early, middle, and late parent and child alliance using the TPOCS-A after watching video recorded therapy sessions. Therapist-reported child involvement, alliance, and adherence were also assessed. Psychometric findings revealed that the TPOCS-A is a reliable and valid measure of therapeutic alliance for children with autism. The implications of examining TA in empirically supported treatments for this population are discussed.","autism; CBT; children; therapeutic alliance; OBSERVATIONAL CODING SYSTEM; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; RELATIONSHIP VARIABLES; ANXIETY DISORDERS; WORKING ALLIANCE; PSYCHOTHERAPY; METAANALYSIS; PREDICTION; INTERVENTION; PERSPECTIVES; Psychology, Clinical; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Riosa PB and Khan M and Weiss JA,,,0,568
650,Multi-domain training in healthy old age: Hotel Plastisse as an iPad-based serious game to systematically compare multi-domain and single-domain training,"Finding effective training interventions for declining cognitive abilities in healthy aging is of great relevance, especially in view of the demographic development. Since it is assumed that transfer from the trained to untrained domains is more likely to occur when training conditions and transfer measures share a common underlying process, multi-domain training of several cognitive functions should increase the likelihood of such an overlap. In the first part, we give an overview of the literature showing that cognitive training using complex tasks, such as video games, leisure activities, or practicing a series of cognitive tasks, has shown promising results regarding transfer to a number of cognitive functions. These studies, however, do not allow direct inference about the underlying functions targeted by these training regimes. Custom-designed serious games allow to design training regimes according to specific cognitive functions and a target population's need. In the second part, we introduce the serious game Hotel Plastisse as an iPad-based training tool for older adults that allows the comparison of the simultaneous training of spatial navigation, visuomotor function, and inhibition to the training of each of these functions separately. Hotel Plastisse not only defines the cognitive functions of the multi-domain training clearly, but also implements training in an interesting learning environment including adaptive difficulty and feedback. We propose this novel training tool with the goal of furthering our understanding of how training regimes should be designed in order to affect cognitive functioning of older adults most broadly.",Video Meta Results Raw,Binder JC and Zoellig J and Eschen A and Merillat S and Roecke C and Schoch SF and Jaencke L and Martin M,,,0,569
651,Evaluating the Feasibility of an Innovative Self-Confidence Webinar Intervention for Depression in the Workplace: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"Background: Depression in the workplace is a very common problem that exacerbates employees' functioning and consequently influences the productivity of organizations. Despite the commonness of the problem and the currently available interventions, a high proportion of employees do not seek help. A new intervention, a webinar (Web-based seminar), was developed, which integrated the use of technology and the traditional guided therapist support to provide accessible help for the problem of depression in the workplace. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility, preliminary outcome, and acceptability of the webinar intervention conducted in organizations. Methods: In total, 2 organizations were invited to participate, and 33 employees participated in this proof-of-concept study. The webinar intervention consisted of 6 1-hour sessions conducted via the Adobe Connect platform, developed by Adobe Inc. The intervention was developed based on a systematic review, focus group studies, and face-to-face self-confidence workshops that utilized cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The final webinar intervention used CBT and the coping flexibility approach. The structure of the intervention included PowerPoint presentations, animation videos, utilization of chat panels, and whiteboard features. The intervention was conducted live and guided by a consultant psychologist assisted by a moderator. Study outcomes were self-assessed using self-reported Web surveys. The acceptability of the intervention was assessed using self-reported user experience Web surveys and open-ended questions. Results: The findings showed: (1) evidence of feasibility of the intervention: the webinar intervention was successfully conducted in 3 groups, with 6 1-hour sessions for each group, with 82% (23/28) participants completing all 6 sessions; (2) positive improvements in depression: the linear mixed effects modeling analysis recorded a significant overall effect of time primarily for depression (F-2,( 4)8.( 813) =3 1.524; P<.001) with a Hedge g effect size of 0.522 at 1-month follow-up. Individually, 8 subjects showed significant reliable and clinically significant changes, with 3 subjects showing clinically significant change only; and (3) encouraging evidence regarding the acceptability of the webinar intervention among the employees: the user experience score was above average for 4 out of 6 domains measured (perspicuity mean 1.198 [95% CI 0.832-1.564], efficiency mean 1.000 [95% CI 0.571-1.429], dependability mean 1.208 [95% CI 0.899-1.517], and stimulation mean 1.323 [95% CI 0.987-1.659]). The open-ended questions also yielded 52% (47/91) of the responses that reported facilitators, whereas only 12% (11/91) of the responses reported barriers. Conclusions: The self-confidence webinar intervention appears to be a potentially feasible, effective, and acceptable intervention for depression in the workplace that merits further investigation.",online; videoconferencing; cognitive behavioral therapy; depression; workplace; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; COPING FLEXIBILITY; INFORMATION; WORKSHOPS; SERVICES; HEALTH; Psychiatry; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Wan Mohd Yunus WM and Musiat P and Brown JS,,,0,570
652,Comparison of virtual reality and hands on activities in science education via functional near infrared spectroscopy,"There has been an increased focus on the use of cognitive strategies in the science classroom, in part this increased focus is due to the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This focus has created the need to examine claims regarding the cognitive basis for disciplinary approaches such as video lecture, virtual reality (VR), Serious Educational Games (SEGs), and hands on activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in the level of hemodynamic response as it relates to four different approaches to teaching topics in the life sciences. The first approach used a video based lecture approach. The other approaches used an immersive Serious Educational Game and a virtual reality environment in which students were exposed to an experience involving the process of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication. The final condition was that of a hands-on activity. Researchers used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to examine hemodynamic localization and intensity as it related to each condition. In addition to examination of cognitive dynamics, content learning gains were also examined. Results provide evidence that there is parity between the hands on condition, Serious Educational Games, and the virtual reality conditions in learning outcomes and cognitive processing.","Virtual reality; fNIRS; Cognition; Serious educational games; TECHNOLOGY; COGNITION; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; FRAMEWORK; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS; NETWORK; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education & Educational Research; Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Lamb R and Antonenko P and Etopio E and Seccia A,,,0,571

654,Patient Deterioration Education: Evaluation of Face-to-Face Simulation and e-Simulation Approaches,"Background: Simulation-based education is one strategy that may be used to teach nursing students to recognize and manage patient deterioration. Method: Final-year preregistration nursing students (n = 97) completed three face-to-face laboratory-based team simulations with a simulated patient (actor) and 330 students individually completed a three-scenario Web-based simulation program: FIRST(2)ACTWeb (TM). Results: Both groups achieved moderate performance scores (means: face to face, 49%; e-simulation, 69%). Course evaluations were positive, skill gain showing a greater effect size in the face-to-face program than for e-simulation, and higher satisfaction and more positive appraisal. Conclusion: Face-to-face simulation and e-simulation are effective educational strategies with e-simulation offering greater feasibility. Either strategy is likely to add value to the learning experience. (C) 2015 International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning. Published by Elsevier Inc.

655,Non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery: where does evidence stand?,"In recent years, non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (NIVATS) strategies are gaining popularity worldwide. The main goal of this surgical practice is to achieve an overall improvement of patients' management and outcome thanks to the avoidance of side-effects related to general anesthesia (GA) and one-lung ventilation. The spectrum of expected benefits is multifaceted and includes reduced postoperative morbidity, faster discharge, decreased hospital costs and a globally reduced perturbation of patients' well-being status. We have conducted a literature search to evaluate the available evidence on this topic. Meta-analysis of collected results was also done where appropriate. Despite some fragmentation of data and potential biases, the available data suggest that NIVATS operations can reduce operative morbidity and hospital stay when compared to equipollent procedures performed under GA. Larger, well designed prospective studies are thus warranted to assess the effectiveness of NIVATS as far as to investigate comprehensively the various outcomes. Multi-institutional and multidisciplinary cooperation will be welcome to establish uniform study protocols and to help address the questions that are to be answered yet.",Video Meta Results Raw,Tacconi F and Pompeo E,,,0,574
656,Computerized cognitive training with older adults: a systematic review,"A systematic review to examine the efficacy of computer-based cognitive interventions for cognitively healthy older adults was conducted. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: average sample age of at least 55 years at time of training; participants did not have Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment; and the study measured cognitive outcomes as a result of training. Theoretical articles, review articles, and book chapters that did not include original data were excluded. We identified 151 studies published between 1984 and 2011, of which 38 met inclusion criteria and were further classified into three groups by the type of computerized program used: classic cognitive training tasks, neuropsychological software, and video games. Reported pre-post training effect sizes for intervention groups ranged from 0.06 to 6.32 for classic cognitive training interventions, 0.19 to 7.14 for neuropsychological software interventions, and 0.09 to 1.70 for video game interventions. Most studies reported older adults did not need to be technologically savvy in order to successfully complete or benefit from training. Overall, findings are comparable or better than those from reviews of more traditional, paper-and-pencil cognitive training approaches suggesting that computerized training is an effective, less labor intensive alternative.",Video Meta Results Raw,Kueider AM and Parisi JM and Gross AL and Rebok GW,,,0,575
657,"Video Self-Modeling for Individuals with Disabilities: A Best-Evidence, Single Case Meta-Analysis","Video-based modeling capitalizes on technology to increase the efficiency of modeling interventions for individuals with disabilities. Video self-modeling is a specific form of video-based modeling that utilizes the learner as the model to provide an opportunity for the learner to view him or herself as competent. This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of video-self modeling using articles that met quality criteria with a focus on potential moderators of effect including participant characteristics, targeted outcomes, and implementation components. Results indicated strong effects for preschool and elementary aged participants with autism spectrum disorders, particularly when social-communicative and behavioral outcomes were addressed. In regards to implementation variables, significantly larger effect sizes were obtained when positive self-review was implemented as compared to feed forward. Additionally, video self-modeling implemented alone yielded stronger effects than video self-modeling implemented with programmed reinforcement or as part of a package. Gaps in the evidence are identified including limited evidence for the use of video self-modeling with older participants and participants with disabilities other than autism. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

658,Combined thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy versus open esophagectomy: a meta-analysis of outcomes,"OBJECTIVES: At present there is controversy regarding the optimal surgical method for esophageal cancer. Specifically, whether combined thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy is superior to open esophagectomy with respect to the surgical wound, perioperative morbidities and mortality, and the overall survival rate is of great concern. This article aimed to compare thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy versus open esophagectomy on the perioperative morbidities and long-term survival. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant studies comparing combined thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy with open esophagectomy using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards. Odds ratios were extracted to give pooled estimates of the perioperative effect of the two surgical procedures. Hazard ratios were extracted to compare overall survival between the two surgical procedures. RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 1549 patients were included in this meta-analysis. We found that patients that underwent combined thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy had lower total complication rates (relative risk 1.20; 95 % CI 1.08-1.34; p = 0.0009), wound infection rates, pulmonary complications, and less intraoperative blood loss. Moreover, our study also showed combined thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy did not compromise the 5-year survival rate (hazard risk 0.920; 95 % CI 0.720-1.176; p = 0.505) and even improved 2-year survival rate. The 30-day mortality and other common morbidities, including anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stricture, pulmonary infection, chylothorax, arrhythmia, or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, were not significantly different between combined thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy and traditional open esophagectomy (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combined thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy is a feasible and reliable surgical procedure that can achieve uncompromising long-term survival rates and reduce perioperative complications.",Esophageal cancer; Esophagectomy; Laparoscopy; Meta-analysis; Minimally invasive surgery; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Guo W and Ma X and Yang S and Zhu X and Qin W and Xiang J and Lerut T and Li H,,,0,577
659,The effectiveness of multimedia for teaching drug mechanisms of action to undergraduate health students,"Educators are increasingly turning to multimedia presentations as a means to convey complex information. Pharmacological mechanisms of action are dynamic processes that may be effectively represented as animations. Drug mechanisms of action were described in four different presentation formats: text only; text and static images; animation and text; or animation with narration. A comparison of these presentation modes found no significant difference on performance on a best answer multiple choice quiz. In addition, there was no significant effect of individual learning style. When learning about material related to their discipline of study, students may possess the ability to construct mental models that obviate the need for multimedia. Resources currently invested in the development of multimedia materials may be better diverted elsewhere. Furthermore, the results from this study do not support the routine assessment of individual learning styles in education.","Applications in subject areas; Multimedia/hypermedia systems; Post-secondary education; Teaching/learning strategies; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; LEARNING STYLE; ANIMATION; ILLUSTRATIONS; METAANALYSIS; INSTRUCTION; INFORMATION; TEXT; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education & Educational Research; Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Hartman H and Johnson P,,,0,578

661,"Does the modality effect exist? And if so, which modality effect?","The modality effect is a central issue in multimedia learning [see Mayer (Cambridge University Press, 2005a), for a review]. Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), for example, presumes that an illustrated text is better understood when presented visually rather than orally. The predictive power of CLT lies in how it links in to Baddeley’s (1986) model of working memory and Penney’s (Mem Cognit 17:398–442, 1989) Separate-Streams Hypothesis. Ginns’s (Learn Instr 4:313–331, 2005) recent meta-analysis also supports the modality effect (d = 0.72, based on 43 independent effects). This article replicates the meta-analysis of the modality effect based on 86 independent effects (with within-study subgroups as the unit of analysis and with mean of the outcomes as the dependent measure), with results showing a reduction of the overall effect size by almost half (d = 0.38), and even more when Duval and Tweedie’s Trim and Fill method is used to correct publication bias (d = 0.20). This article also widens the scope of the analysis of moderator variables (e.g. Pace of presentation, Type of visualization, Research group) as well as their potentially confounded effects. Finally, it is argued that, for theoretical reasons, the so-called modality effect cannot be based on Penney’s or Baddeley’s theories and must be explained in a different way.

662,The effects of video modeling in teaching functional living skills to persons with ASD: A meta-analysis of single-case studies,"Background: Many individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show deficits in functional living skills, leading to low independence, limited community involvement, and poor quality of life. With development of mobile devices, utilizing video modeling has become more feasible for educators to promote functional living skills of individuals with ASD. Aims: This article aims to review the single-case experimental literature and aggregate results across studies involving the use of video modeling to improve functional living skills of individuals with ASD. Methods and procedures: The authors extracted data from single-case experimental studies and evaluated them using the Tau-U effect size measure. Effects were also differentiated by categories of potential moderators and other variables, including age of participants, concomitant diagnoses, types of video modeling, and outcome measures. Outcomes and results: Results indicate that video modeling interventions are overall moderately effective with this population and dependent measures. While significant differences were not found between categories of moderators and other variables, effects were found to be at least moderate for most of them. Conclusions and implications: It is apparent that more single-case experiments are needed in this area, particularly with preschool and secondary-school aged participants, participants with ASD-only and those with high-functioning ASD, and for video modeling interventions addressing community access skills.

The learning process of medication administration among nursing students with non-immersive desktop virtual reality simulation,"The purpose of this study was to create and explore an effective and accessible teaching method for the higher education of professionals requiring practical skills. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of our Pharmacology Inter-Leaved Learning Virtual Reality (PILL-VR) simulation when applied to nursing education, as a tool for learning medication administration procedures. A quasi-experimental pretest-intervention-posttest comparison group design was conducted based on quantitative analysis of questionnaires, video recordings and worksheets. Participants were nursing students who either learned medication administration processes with a PILL-VR simulation platform (experimental group; n = 82) or who learned with lecture-based curriculum (n = 47; comparison group). The results revealed significantly higher conceptual and procedural knowledge learning gains following activity with the PILL-VR simulation compared to studying via lecture based curriculum. PILL-VR exposed the students to their own errors, allowing procedure rehearsal followed by constant feedback which is essential to skill acquisition. Although PILL-VR is based on a desktop system, it facilitated a strong sense of presence. A small positive correlation was found on questionnaire scores between the sense of presence, particularly the sense of control, and conceptual-procedural learning of medication administration. This indicates that by improving students' sense of control in the PILL-VR, the learning process can be improved. Hence, VR simulations may provide affordable and flexible access to practice necessary practical skills in higher education, which is crucial to developing students' expertise. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A literature search and analysis was conducted to address this deficiency. First, overviews, reviews, and meta-analyses were analysed to extract an initial set of dimensions to characterise expository animations. Next, a representative set of descriptions of expository animations used in past research on learning from animation was retrieved from the research literature. The animations employed in the 44 investigations analysed covered 30 different topics in 14 different domains. The characterisation developed distinguishes attributes that are inherent characteristics of animations from attributes that are external supplements to animations. The potential advantages of the characterisation developed as a framework for future research on learning from animation are discussed.

Such platforms are being used for sexual health promotion but with varying success in reaching and engaging users. We aimed to identify Facebook and Twitter profiles that were able to engage large numbers of users, and to identify strategies used to successfully attract and engage users in sexual health promotion on these platforms. METHODS: We identified active Facebook (n = 60) and Twitter (n = 40) profiles undertaking sexual health promotion through a previous systematic review, and assessed profile activity over a one-month period. Quantitative measures of numbers of friends and followers (reach) and social media interactions were assessed, and composite scores used to give profiles an 'engagement success' ranking. Associations between host activity, reach and interaction metrics were explored. Content of the top ten ranked Facebook and Twitter profiles was analysed using a thematic framework and compared with five poorly performing profiles to identify strategies for successful user engagement. RESULTS: Profiles that were able to successfully engage large numbers of users were more active and had higher levels of interaction per user than lower-ranked profiles. Strategies used by the top ten ranked profiles included: making regular posts/tweets (median 46 posts or 124 tweets/month for top-ranked profiles versus six posts or six tweets for poorly-performing profiles); individualised interaction with users (85% of top-ranked profiles versus 0% for poorly-performing profiles); and encouraging interaction and conversation by posing questions (100% versus 40%). Uploading multimedia material (80% versus 30%) and highlighting celebrity involvement (70% versus 10%) were also key strategies. CONCLUSION: Successful online engagement on social networking platforms can be measured through quantitative (user numbers and interactions) and basic qualitative content analysis. We identified the amount and type of host activity as key strategies for success, and in particular, regular individualised interaction with users, encouraging conversation, uploading multimedia and relevant links, and highlighting celebrity involvement. These findings provide valuable insight for achieving a high level of online engagement through social networking platforms to support successful health promotion initiatives.",Video Meta Results Raw,Veale HJ and Sacks-Davis R and Weaver ER and Pedrana AE and Stoové MA and Hellard ME,,,0,584
666,The effect of Cognitive Style Analysis (CSA) test on achievement: A meta-analytic review,"Riding's (1991) Cognitive Style Analysis test has been a popular UK test of the verbal-imagery and wholistic-analytic cognitive style dimensions. Researchers have claimed numerous academic advantages for these style dimensions, but the direction of the effects is inconsistent. A meta-analysis was therefore conducted that used the CSA along with an academic outcome measure. While 25 studies met the inclusion criteria, only 15 provided sufficient information for statistical analysis. The studies included five experimental and 10 observational studies and involved participants in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions. The results show no clear academic achievement advantage for either the verbal-imagery cognitive style dimension or the wholistic-analytic cognitive style dimension, regardless of the learning task or environment. While the final sample of included studies was relatively small the results of this meta-analysis suggest that the relationship between the CSA's cognitive style dimensions and academic achievement, if any, is likely to be negligible.

667,Learning to provide children with a secure base and a safe haven: The Circle of Security-Parenting (COS-P) group intervention,"Insecure attachment is linked to a host of negative child outcomes, including internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Circle of Security-Parenting (COS-P) is a manualized, video-based, eight unit, group parenting intervention to promote children's attachment security. COS-P was designed to be easily implemented, so as to make attachment interventions more widely available to families. We present the theoretical background of COS-P, research evidence supporting the COS approach, as well as a description of the COS-P intervention protocol. The case example of Alexa, mother of three children (aged 7, 6, and 4 years), illustrates how parents can make use of the COS-P intervention to better understand children's needs, build skills in observing and interpreting children's signals, learn to recognize and regulate their own responses to their children, and learn new ways of responding to children's needs.","attachment; attachment-based intervention; group intervention; parenting; maternal depression; sensitivity; INFANT ATTACHMENT; METAANALYSIS; VALIDITY; SENSITIVITY; INVENTORY; INSECURE; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR; FORM; Psychology, Clinical; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Kim M and Woodhouse SS and Dai C,,,0,586
668,Active video games and health indicators in children and youth: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Active video games (AVGs) have gained interest as a way to increase physical activity in children and youth. The effect of AVGs on acute energy expenditure (EE) has previously been reported; however, the influence of AVGs on other health-related lifestyle indicators remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to explain the relationship between AVGs and nine health and behavioural indicators in the pediatric population (aged 0-17 years). DATA SOURCES: Online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, psycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Central Database) and personal libraries were searched and content experts were consulted for additional material. DATA SELECTION: Included articles were required to have a measure of AVG and at least one relevant health or behaviour indicator: EE (both habitual and acute), adherence and appeal (i.e., participation and enjoyment), opportunity cost (both time and financial considerations, and adverse events), adiposity, cardiometabolic health, energy intake, adaptation (effects of continued play), learning and rehabilitation, and video game evolution (i.e., sustainability of AVG technology). RESULTS: 51 unique studies, represented in 52 articles were included in the review. Data were available from 1992 participants, aged 3-17 years, from 8 countries, and published from 2006-2012. Overall, AVGs are associated with acute increases in EE, but effects on habitual physical activity are not clear. Further, AVGs show promise when used for learning and rehabilitation within special populations. Evidence related to other indicators was limited and inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Controlled studies show that AVGs acutely increase light- to moderate-intensity physical activity; however, the findings about if or how AVG lead to increases in habitual physical activity or decreases in sedentary behaviour are less clear. Although AVGs may elicit some health benefits in special populations, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend AVGs as a means of increasing daily physical activity.",Video Meta Results Raw,LeBlanc AG and Chaput JP and McFarlane A and Colley RC and Thivel D and Biddle SJ and Maddison R and Leatherdale ST and Tremblay MS,,,0,587
669,A systematic review of acute exercise as a coadjuvant treatment of ADHD in young people,"BACKGROUND: There are studies that show preliminary evidence of the benefits of physical exercise for people with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The objective of the research being reported here was to carry out a systematic review of articles relating to the effects that exercise sessions have on children and adolescents with this pathology. METHOD: The total sample of studies considered was 1,723, of which only 11 met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: The research included in this review showed that children with ADHD undertaking exercise experienced improvements in their characteristic symptoms, mainly attention deficit and hyperactivity, in comparison to other sedentary tasks such as watching a video. Five minutes of jumping or thirty minutes on a treadmill or static bicycle were enough to produce appreciable improvements in inhibitory control or in cognitive and executive functions. Benefits following exercise were also seen in other aspects such as reaction times and preparation for response, motor skills or brain activity. CONCLUSION: The findings make us optimistic that in the future physical exercise may become an alternative, or at least an effective complement, to the pharmacological treatments currently used for this pathology.","ADHD; exercise; physical activity; children; youth; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; AEROBIC EXERCISE; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MOTOR ABILITY; CHILDREN; ATTENTION; PROGRAM; PERFORMANCE; ADOLESCENTS; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Villa-González R and Villalba-Heredia L and Crespo I and Del Valle M and Olmedillas H,,,0,588
670,Impact on clinical events and healthcare costs of adding telemedicine to multidisciplinary disease management programmes for heart failure: Results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: The role of telemedicine in the management of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that multidisciplinary comprehensive HF care could achieve better results when it is delivered using telemedicine. Methods and results: In this study, 178 eligible patients with HF were randomized to either structured follow-up on the basis of face-to-face encounters (control group, 97 patients) or delivering health care using telemedicine (81 patients). Telemedicine included daily signs and symptoms based on telemonitoring and structured follow-up by means of video or audio-conference. The primary end-point was non-fatal HF events after six months of follow-up. The median age of the patients was 77 years, 41% were female, and 25% were frail patients. The hazard ratio for the primary end-point was 0.35 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.59; p-value0.05). The telemedicine group experienced a significant mean net reduction in direct hospital costs of (sic)3546 per patient per six months of follow-up. Conclusions: Among patients managed in the setting of a comprehensive HF programme, the addition of telemedicine may result in better outcomes and reduction of costs.",Video Meta Results Raw,Comin-Colet J and Enjuanes C and Verdu-Rotellar JM and Linas A and Ruiz-Rodriguez P and Gonzalez-Robledo G and Farre N and Moliner-Borja P and Ruiz-Bustillo S and Bruguera J,,,0,589

672,Dose-response relations between preschool teachers' exposure to components of professional development and increases in quality of their interactions with children,"The present study examined the pattern of associations over time between the quality of observed interactions and exposure to features of an effective coaching model for 170 preschool teachers enrolled in a study investigating professional development impacts. Using a treatment-on-the-treated approach, teachers exposed to a greater number of cycles of coaching showed more improvement in classroom interactions over the year. More specifically, of the two components of treatment examined, video exemplars and individual coaching prompts, exposure to prompts was associated with growth from baseline in instructionally supportive interactions while watching video exemplars was associated with growth in emotionally supportive behaviors in analysis of linear effects. Watching emotional support video exemplars was negatively associated with growth in classroom organization behaviors. The non-linear pattern of these associations suggested that the initial dosage of prompts created observable effects on instructional support, but after a certain point additional dosage was not effective. Conversely, initial dosage did not create observable effects on emotional support, but improvement was observed after exposure to a certain minimum dosage of time watching video exemplars. The results have implications for the design, delivery, and focus of professional development for early childhood educators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

673,A sad mood increases attention to unhealthy food images in women with food addiction,"Food addiction and emotional eating both influence eating and weight, but little is known of how negative mood affects the attentional processes that may contribute to food addiction. The purpose of this study was to compare attention to food images in adult women (N = 66) with versus without food addiction, before and after a sad mood induction (MI). Participants' eye fixations were tracked and recorded throughout 8-s presentations of displays with healthy food, unhealthy food, and non-food images. Food addiction was self-reported using the Yale Food Addiction Scale. The sad MI involved watching an 8-min video about a young child who passed away from cancer. It was predicted that: (1) participants in the food addiction group would attend to unhealthy food significantly more than participants in the control group, and (2) participants in the food addiction group would increase their attention to unhealthy food images following the sad MI, due to increased emotional reactivity and poorer emotional regulation. As predicted, the sad MI had a different effect for those with versus without food addiction: for participants with food addiction, attention to unhealthy images increased following the sad MI and attention to healthy images decreased, whereas for participants without food addiction the sad MI did not alter attention to food. These findings contribute to researchers' understanding of the cognitive factors underlying food addiction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

674,The Role of Anatomy Computer-Assisted Learning on Spatial Abilities of Medical Students,"Currently, medical education context poses different challenges to anatomy, contributing to the introduction of new pedagogical approaches, such as computer-assisted learning (CAL). This approach provides insight into students' learning profiles and skills that enhance anatomy knowledge acquisition. To understand the influence of anatomy CAL on spatial abilities, a study was conducted. A total of 671 medical students attending Musculoskeletal (MA) and Cardiovascular Anatomy (CA) courses, were allocated to one of three groups (MA Group, CA Group, MA+CA Group). Students' pre-training and post-training spatial abilities were assessed through Mental Rotations Test (MRT), with scores ranging between 0-24. After CAL training sessions, students' spatial abilities performance improved (9.72 +/- 4.79 vs. 17.05 +/- 4.57, P<0.001). Although male students in both MA Group and CA Group show better baseline spatial abilities, no sex differences were found after CAL training. The improvement in spatial abilities score between sessions (Delta MRT) was correlated with Musculoskeletal Anatomy training sessions in MA Group (r=0.333, P<0.001) and MA+CA Group (r=0.342, P<0.001), and with Cardiovascular Anatomy training sessions in CA Group (r=0.461, P=0.001) and MA+CA Group (r=0.324, P=0.001). Multiple linear regression models were used, considering the Delta MRT as dependent variable. An association of Delta MRT to the amount of CAL training and the baseline spatial abilities was observed. The results suggest that CAL training in anatomy has positive dose-dependent effect on spatial abilities.","gross anatomy education; medical education; undergraduate education; learning profiles; spatial abilities; spatial orientation; computer-assisted learning; computer-assisted training; learning analytics; MENTAL ROTATION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; VISUALIZATION ABILITY; LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; SKILL ACQUISITION; PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE; METAANALYSIS; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Guimaraes B and Firmino-Machado J and Tsisar S and Viana B and Pinto-Sousa M and Vieira-Marques P and Cruz-Correia R and Ferreira MA,,,0,593
675,Reading aids for adults with low vision,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of low-vision rehabilitation is to allow people to resume or to continue to perform daily living tasks, with reading being one of the most important. This is achieved by providing appropriate optical devices and special training in the use of residual-vision and low-vision aids, which range from simple optical magnifiers to high-magnification video magnifiers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of reading aids for adults with low vision. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, (January 1950 to January 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2013), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov/) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 31 January 2013. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and used the Science Citation Index to find articles that cited the included studies and contacted investigators and manufacturers of low-vision aids. We handsearched the British Journal of Visual Impairment from 1983 to 1999 and the Journal of Visual Impairment and Blindness from 1976 to 1991. SELECTION CRITERIA: This review includes randomised and quasi-randomised trials in which any device or aid used for reading had been compared to another device or aid in people aged 16 or over with low vision as defined by the study investigators. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine small studies with a cross-over-like design (181 people overall) and one study with three parallel arms (243 participants) in the review. All studies reported the primary outcome, results for reading speed.Two studies including 92 participants found moderate- or low-quality evidence suggesting that reading speed is higher with stand-mounted electronic devices or electronic devices with the camera mounted in a 'mouse' than with optical magnifiers, which in these trials were generally stand-mounted or, less frequently, hand-held magnifiers or microscopic lenses. In another study of 20 participants there was moderate-quality evidence that optical devices are better than head-mounted electronic devices (four types).There was low-quality evidence from three studies (93 participants) that reading using head-mounted electronic devices is slower than with stand-based electronic devices. The technology of electronic devices may have changed and improved since these studies were conducted.One study suggested no difference between a diffractive spectacle-mounted magnifier and either refractive (15 participants) or aplanatic (15 participants) magnifiers.One study of 10 people suggested that several overlay coloured filters were no better and possibly worse than a clear filter.A parallel-arm study including 243 participants with age-related macular degeneration found that custom or standard prism spectacles were no different from conventional reading spectacles, although the data did not allow precise estimates of performance to be made. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence on the effect of different types of low-vision aids on reading performance. It would be necessary to investigate which patient characteristics predict performance with different devices, including costly electronic devices. Better-quality research should also focus on assessing sustained long-term use of each device. Authors of studies testing several devices on the same person should consider design and reporting issues related to their sequential presentation and to the cross-over-like study design.",Video Meta Results Raw,Virgili G and Acosta R and Grover LL and Bentley SA and Giacomelli G,,,0,594
676,Comparison of three video laryngoscopy devices to direct laryngoscopy for intubating obese patients: a randomized controlled trial,"Study objective: To compare three different video laryngoscope devices (VL) to standard direct laryngoscopy (DL) for tracheal intubation of obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Hypothesis: VL (vs DL) would reduce the time required to achieve successful tracheal intubation and improve the glottic view. Design: Prospective, randomized and controlled. Setting: Preoperative/operating rooms and postanesthesia care unit. Patients: One hundred twenty-one obese patients (ASA physical status I-III), aged 18 to 80 years, body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m(2) undergoing elective bariatric surgery. Intervention: Patients were prospectively randomized assigned to one of 4 different airway devices for tracheal intubation: standard Macintosh (Mac) blade (DL); Video-Mac VL; Glide Scope VL; or McGrath VL. Measurements: After performing a preoperative airway evaluation, patients underwent a standardized induction sequence. The glottic view was graded using the Cormack Lehane and percentage of glottic opening (POGO) scoring systems at the time of tracheal intubation. Times from the blade entering the patient's mouth to obtaining a glottic view, placement of the tracheal tube, and confirmation of an end tidal CO2 waveform were recorded. In addition, intubation attempts, adjuvant airway devices, hemodynamic changes, adverse events, and any airway-related trauma were recorded. Main results: All three VL devices provided improved glottic views compared to standard DL (p < 0.05). Video-Mac VL and McGrath also significantly reduced the time required to obtain the glottic view. Video-Mac VL significantly reduced the time required for successful placement of the tracheal tube (vs DL and the others VL device groups). The Video-Mac and GlideScope required fewer intubation attempts (P< .05) and less frequent use of ancillary intubating devices compared to DL and the McGrath VL. Conclusion: Video-Mac and GlideScope required fewer intubation attempts than standard DL and the McGrath device. The Video-Mac also significantly reduced the time needed to secure the airway and improved the glottic view compared to standard DL. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

678,The use of humour during a collaborative inquiry,"Studies show that teachers and students use humour when communicating with each other in a science education context. This study investigates the use of humour during a collaborative inquiry laboratory task on an undergraduate chemistry course and an undergraduate physics course. Seven groups of students working on a collaborative inquiry task were recorded on video. The videos were analysed utilising an analytical framework based on conversation analysis. During the tasks, humour was used in a dynamic way and the role of humour changed as the inquiry progressed. As expected, humour was used to create a group identity and to regulate negative emotions such as anxiety, frustration, uncertainty, boredom and disappointment. Humour also had an integral role in collaborative decision-making, for example in proposing and evaluating new ideas. Awareness of how humour can contribute to the regulation of emotions and collaborative decision-making might help students and teachers to better utilise humour in inquiry and learning.",Affective learning; laboratory work; inquiry-based learning; humour; SCIENCE; STUDENTS; ANXIETY; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; TEACHER; PHYSICS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Lamminpaa J and Vesterinen VM,,,0,596
679,Incorporating Behavioral Techniques into a Serious Videogame for Children,Introduction: Little is known about how to design serious videogames for children. The purpose of this article is to describe how behavior change techniques promoting self-regulation were incorporated into a serious videogame to help children consume more fruits and vegetables (FVs) and the extent to which these techniques were used by players. A secondary goal is to contribute to the body of scientific knowledge regarding how to design effective serious videogames for children. Materials and Methods: This research examines the gameplay data from an effective 10-episode online serious videogame promoting FV consumption to preadolescent children in the United States (roughly 9-11-year olds). Results: Children participated in the self-regulation component. Modifications to reduce potential cognitive overload and inform future game design were identified. Conclusion: This research provided suggestive evidence that behavior change techniques promoting self-regulation can be successfully integrated into a serious videogame for children without detracting from game appeal. It also emphasizes the importance of formative research to the design of an appealing game where children understand and can successfully perform the behavior change procedures.,"Videos; Nutrition; Behavioral health; Self-regulation; SQUIRES-QUEST-II; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION; SELF-REGULATION; IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS; DIGITAL GAMES; DIETARY; FRUIT; INTERVENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; Health Policy & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation; Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Thompson D,,,0,597
682,Cognitive effects of weight-shifting controlled exergames in patients with chronic stroke: a pilot randomized comparison trial,"BACKGROUND: The exergaming training involves motor as well as cognitive stimulation. Although exergame studies have been reported to have benefits in motor function, the effects of exergames on improving cognitive function remain inconclusive. Moreover, no study has been reported in stroke patients. AIM: The objective of this study was to compare the cognitive effects of 2 weight-shifting controlled exergaming systems and conventional weight-shifting training in patients with chronic stroke. DESIGN: This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING: All participants were recruited from a rehabilitation department of a tertiary hospital. POPULATION : Patients (N.=37) with chronic hemiplegic stroke. METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to one of the Wii Fit, Tetrax biofeedback, or conventional weight-shifting training groups. All interventions were administered 30 minutes per session, twice a week for 12 weeks. We used total score and the 9 domain scores of Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument Chinese version (CASI C-2.0), and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) as the outcome measures. The outcome measures were assessed before and after training, and at 3 months follow-up. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the 3 groups in the percentage of change in CASI total score and BBS, either post intervention or at the 3-month follow-up. At assessing the percentage of change in each domain of CASI, we found significant differences among the 3 groups in the abstraction/judgment domain after intervention (Wii Fit 16.25 [9.77, 37.50]% vs. Tetrax 0.00 [-10.00, 0.00]% vs. weight-shift 11.00 [0.00, 14.38]%, P=0.01], and at the 3-month follow-up (Wii Fit 20.00 [10.83, 31.25]% vs. Tetrax -10.00 [-11.11, 10.00]% vs. weight-shifting 0.00 [-2.27, 11.46]%, P=0.01). The differences came from the differences between Wii Fit and Tetrax mainly. There were significant differences among the 3 groups in language domain after intervention (Wii Fit 0.00 [0.00, 5.54]% vs. Tetrax 0.00 [-3.00, 0.00]% vs. weight-shift 0.00 [0.00, 0.00]%, P=0.045), but not at the 3-month follow-up (P=0.13). There was no correlation between the percentage of change in BBS and CASI total score postintervention (r=-0.15 P=0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Wii Fit games training might be beneficial in some cognitive functions, such as abstraction/judgment, language in patients with chronic stroke. Wii Fit games, the commercial entertainment exergames, had superior effect in abstract/judgment and language domains as compared to the rehabilitation exergame (Tetrax balance system). Hence, Wii Fit games might be considered as a tool in post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation programs.",Stroke; Cognition; Postural balance; Rehabilitation; ACTION VIDEO GAMES; OLDER-ADULTS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; TAI CHI; EXERCISE; REHABILITATION; BALANCE; IMPAIRMENT; NEUROGENESIS; METAANALYSIS; Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw,Hung JW and Chou CX and Chang HF and Wu WC and Hsieh YW and Chen PC and Yu MY and Chang CC and Lin JR,,,0,598
683,Digital clinical communication for families and caregivers of children or young people with short- or long-term conditions: Rapid review,"Background: The communication relationship between parents of children or young people with health conditions and health professionals is an important part of treatment, but it is unclear how far the use of digital clinical communication tools may affect this relationship. Objective: The objective of our study was to describe, assess the feasibility of, and explore the impact of digital clinical communication between families or caregivers and health professionals. Methods: We searched the literature using 5 electronic databases. We considered all types of study design published in the English language from January 2009 to August 2015. The population of interest included families and caregivers of children and young people aged less than 26 years with any type of health condition. The intervention was any technology permitting 2-way communication. Results: We included 31 articles. The main designs were randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 10), cross-sectional studies (n = 9), pre- and post intervention uncontrolled (pre/post) studies (n = 7), and qualitative interview studies (n = 2); 6 had mixed-methods designs. In the majority of cases, we considered the quality rating to be fair. Many different types of health condition were represented. A breadth of digital communication tools were included: videoconferencing or video consultation (n = 14), and Web messaging or emails (n = 12). Health care professionals were mainly therapists or cognitive behavioral therapists (n = 10), physicians (n = 8), and nurses (n = 6). Studies were very heterogeneous in terms of outcomes. Interventions were mainly evaluated using satisfaction or acceptance, or outcomes relating to feasibility. Clinical outcomes were rarely used. The RCTs showed that digital clinical communication had no impact in comparison with standard care. Uncontrolled pre/post studies showed good rates of satisfaction or acceptance. Some economic studies suggested that digital clinical communication may save costs. Conclusions: This rapid review showed an emerging body of literature on the use of digital clinical communication to improve families’ and caregivers’ involvement in the health management of children or young people. Further research with appropriate study designs and longer-term outcome measures should be encouraged.

684,Complications of laparoscopic pyeloplasty,"OBJECTIVES: With the development of new video-endoscopic techniques like endopyelotomy, laparoscopy and retroperitoneoscopy the treatment of UPJO has become less invasive. The complications and learning curve of laparoscopic pyeloplasty are presented together with recommendations for adequate management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the personal experience with 189 cases of retroperitoneoscopic pyeloplasty, a literature review (PubMed) was performed focussing on complication and success rates of the procedure. Intraoperative incidents were analysed using the Satava-classification, postoperative complications according to the Clavien-classification. The meta-analysis focussed on the experience of the 3 largest and 2 smaller series representing a cohort of 601 patients. RESULTS: Intraoperative incidents ranged from 2.0 to 2.3% in large series, mostly without consequences for the patient including ligation of lower pole artery, loss of needle, hyperkapnia, cutting of DJ-stent, colonic injury, and port site bleeding. The conversion rate was mainly due to inability to access UPJ or to accomplish the anastomosis ranging between 0.5 and 5.5%. Postoperative complications occured between 12.9 and 15.8% in large series. A total of 5.4-10% represented Grade III-complications, such as urine leakage, haematoma, colonic lesion, and stone formation. Recurrent UPJ-stenosis requiring reintervention was seen in 3.5-4.8%. In all three large series, complications were part of the learning curve. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic pyeloplasty has been proven safe and effective with comparable results to open surgery. The experience of pioneering centres with incidence and management of complications will be used by next generations of laparoscopic urologic surgeons to shorten their learning curve.",Video Meta Results Raw,Rassweiler JJ and Teber D and Frede T,,,0,600
685,Inducing maximal versus typical learning through the provision of a pretraining goal orientation,"Goal setting has been used in a variety of contexts in an effort to induce maximal effort and to facilitate greater performance outcomes than would otherwise be achieved through an individual's more typical efforts. Do pretraining goals induce trainees to maximize learning efforts in training? Does the type of goal matter? We meta-analytically cumulated the results of 61 independent studies (N = 10,151) that examined the efficacy of pretraining goals. Results suggest pretraining goals (regardless of type) yield higher performance on posttraining cognitive, skill, and affective learning assessments than 'no-goal' conditions. Performance-oriented goals facilitated better performance on measures of declarative knowledge, whereas mastery-oriented goals yielded greater learning on higher levels of cognitive learning and for all levels of skill-based learning. Further, mastery-oriented goals fostered greater posttraining self-efficacy, more positive attitudes toward training, and better intentions to transfer training material than performance-oriented goals and no-goal conditions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

687,Time and learning efficiency in Internet-based learning: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"UNLABELLED: Authors have claimed that Internet-based instruction promotes greater learning efficiency than non-computer methods. OBJECTIVES: determine, through a systematic synthesis of evidence in health professions education, how Internet-based instruction compares with non-computer instruction in time spent learning, and what features of Internet-based instruction are associated with improved learning efficiency. DATA SOURCES: we searched databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and ERIC from 1990 through November 2008. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA ABSTRACTION we included all studies quantifying learning time for Internet-based instruction for health professionals, compared with other instruction. Reviewers worked independently, in duplicate, to abstract information on interventions, outcomes, and study design. RESULTS: we identified 20 eligible studies. Random effects meta-analysis of 8 studies comparing Internet-based with non-Internet instruction (positive numbers indicating Internet longer) revealed pooled effect size (ES) for time -0.10 (p = 0.63). Among comparisons of two Internet-based interventions, providing feedback adds time (ES 0.67, p =0.003, two studies), and greater interactivity generally takes longer (ES 0.25, p = 0.089, five studies). One study demonstrated that adapting to learner prior knowledge saves time without significantly affecting knowledge scores. Other studies revealed that audio narration, video clips, interactive models, and animations increase learning time but also facilitate higher knowledge and/or satisfaction. Across all studies, time correlated positively with knowledge outcomes (r = 0.53, p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: on average, Internet-based instruction and non-computer instruction require similar time. Instructional strategies to enhance feedback and interactivity typically prolong learning time, but in many cases also enhance learning outcomes. Isolated examples suggest potential for improving efficiency in Internet-based instruction.","time; learning efficiency; internet based learning; instruction; health professions education; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Confidence Intervals; Curriculum; Education, Distance; Educational Technology; Health Occupations; Humans; Internet; Statistics as Topic; Teaching; Time; Time Management; Computer Assisted Instruction; Internet; Medical Education; Teaching; Time; Video Meta Results Raw; Unsorted; HETTE",Cook DA and Levinson AJ and Garside S,,,0,602
688,Success factors for serious games to enhance learning: a systematic review,"There is no doubt that an abundance of factors exists that makes learning with serious games successful. Research articles reporting on these factors, however, tend to focus on select serious game elements and do not combine all salient factors for successful learning with serious games. Addressing this gap is a necessity for the success of serious games and may even alleviate long-standing debates about pedagogy over enjoyment, how much realism is enough or whether artificial intelligence is worth the cost. This article examines existing academic literature from 2000 to 2015, extracting shared serious game success factors that have had an encouraging impact on gameful learning experiences. As such, we subsequently aim to withdraw the field from a perpetual spiral of does-my-game-work research toward more worthwhile why-does-my-game-not-work research. Qualitative content analysis through the constant comparison method (CCM) analyzed a total of 63 articles from a variety of recognized electronic libraries and databases. Through this analysis, we reveal five central serious game themes: backstory and production; realism; artificial intelligence and adaptivity; interaction; and feedback and debriefing, all of which require deliberate intertwining with pedagogical content to ensure successful learning. This review unravels each of the five themes into their constituent factors and consequently presents the factors as practical guidelines that serious games producers should strive to include in their game productions. Applying these recommendations whenever serious games are considered will provide a foundation for effective gameful learning experiences.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Feedback; Interaction; Narrative; Realism; Serious games; VIDEO GAME; EDUCATIONAL GAMES; VIRTUAL-REALITY; PHYSICAL-EDUCATION; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; COMPUTER GAME; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; ENGAGEMENT; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Video Meta Results Raw",Ravyse WS and Blignaut AS and Leendertz V and Woolner A,,,0,603
689,Does playing violent video games induce aggression? Empirical evidence of a functional magnetic resonance imaging study,"This study aims to advance the media effects debate concerning violent video games. Meta-analytic reviews reveal a small but noticeable association between playing violent video games and aggressive reactions. However, evidence for causal associations is still rare. In a novel, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 13 male research participants were observed playing a latest-generation violent video game. Each participant's game play was recorded and content analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis. Onscreen activities were coded as either 'passive/dead, no interactions'; 'active/safe, no imminent danger/no violent interactions'; 'active/potential danger occurs, violent interactions expected'; 'active/under attack, some violent interactions'; and 'active/fighting and killing, many violent interactions.' Previous studies in neuroscience on aggressive thoughts and behaviors suggested that virtual violence would suppress affective areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala subsequent to activity variations at cognitive areas of the ACC. Comparison of game play activities with and without virtual violence in 11 participants confirmed the hypothesis. The rather large observed effects can be considered as caused by the virtual violence. We discuss the applicability of neuroscience methodology in media effects studies, with a special emphasis on the assumption of virtuality prevalent in video game play.

690,Are journal clubs effective in supporting evidence-based decision making? A systematic review. BEME Guide No. 16,"Background: Journal clubs (JCs) are a common form of interactive education in health care aiming to promote the uptake of research evidence into practice, but their effectiveness has not been established. Objective: This systematic review aimed to determine whether the JC is an effective intervention in supporting clinical decision making. Methods: We searched for studies which evaluated whether clubs promote changes in learner reaction, attitudes, knowledge, skills, behaviour or patient outcomes. We included undergraduate, postgraduate and practice JCs and excluded studies evaluating video/internet meetings or single meetings. Results: Eighteen studies were included. Studies reported improvements in reading behaviour (N = 5/11), confidence in critical appraisal (N = 7/7), critical appraisal test scores (N = 5/7) and ability to use findings (N = 5/7). No studies reported on patient outcomes. Sixteen studies used self-reported measures, but only four studies used validated tests. Interventions were too heterogeneous to allow pooling. Realist synthesis identified potentially 'active educational ingredients', including mentoring, brief training in clinical epidemiology, structured critical appraisal tools, adult-learning principles, multifaceted teaching approaches and integration of the JC with other clinical and academic activities. Conclusion: The effectiveness of JCs in supporting evidence-based decision making is not clear. Better reporting of the intervention and a mixed methods approach to evaluating active ingredients are needed in order to understand how JCs may support evidence-based practice.

692,Self-regulated learning in simulation-based training: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"ContextSelf-regulated learning (SRL) requires an active learner who has developed a set of processes for managing the achievement of learning goals. Simulation-based training is one context in which trainees can safely practise learning how to learn. ObjectivesThe purpose of the present study was to evaluate, in the simulation-based training context, the effectiveness of interventions designed to support trainees in SRL activities. We used the social-cognitive model of SRL to guide a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the links between instructor supervision, supports or scaffolds for SRL, and educational outcomes. MethodsWe searched databases including MEDLINE and Scopus, and previous reviews, for material published until December 2011. Studies comparing simulation-based SRL interventions with another intervention for teaching health professionals were included. Reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to extract information on learners, study quality and educational outcomes. We used random-effects meta-analysis to compare the effects of supervision (instructor present or absent) and SRL educational supports (e.g. goal-setting study guides present or absent). ResultsFrom 11064 articles, we included 32 studies enrolling 2482 trainees. Only eight of the 32 studies included educational supports for SRL. Compared with instructor-supervised interventions, unsupervised interventions were associated with poorer immediate post-test outcomes (pooled effect size: -0.34, p=0.09; n=19 studies) and negligible effects on delayed (i.e. >1week) retention tests (pooled effect size: 0.11, p=0.63; n=8 studies). Interventions including SRL supports were associated with small benefits compared with interventions without supports on both immediate post-tests (pooled effect size: 0.23, p=0.22; n=5 studies) and delayed retention tests (pooled effect size: 0.44, p=0.067; n=3 studies). ConclusionsFew studies in the simulation literature have designed SRL training to explicitly support trainees' capacity to self-regulate their learning. We recommend that educators and researchers shift from thinking about SRL as learning alone to thinking of SRL as comprising a shared responsibility between the trainee and the instructional designer (i.e. learning using designed supports that help prepare individuals for future learning).

695,Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Children and Adolescents With Dental Anxiety: Open Trial,"Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based method for treating specific phobias, but access to treatment is difficult, especially for children and adolescents with dental anxiety. Psychologist-guided Internet-based CBT (ICBT) may be an effective way of increasing accessibility while maintaining treatment effects. Objective: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that psychologist-guided ICBT improves school-aged children's and adolescents' ability to manage dental anxiety by (1) decreasing avoidance and affecting the phobia diagnosis and (2) decreasing the dental fear and increasing the target groups' self-efficacy. The study also aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of this novel treatment. Methods: This was an open, uncontrolled trial with assessments at baseline, posttreatment, and the 1-year follow-up. The study enrolled and treated 18 participants. The primary outcome was level of avoidance behaviors, as measured by the picture-guided behavioral avoidance test (PG-BAT). The secondary outcome was a diagnostic evaluation with the parents conducted by a psychologist. The specific phobia section of the structured interview Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime (K-SADS-PL) was used. Other outcome measures included level of dental anxiety and self-efficacy. The ICBT, which employed exposure therapy, comprised 12 modules of texts, animations, dentistry-related video clips, and an exercise package (including dental instruments). Participants accessed the treatment through an Internet-based treatment platform and received Web-based guidance from a psychologist. Treatment also included training at dental clinics. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed by measures of engagement, adherence, compliance, completed measures, patient and parent satisfaction scale, and staff acceptability. Results: The level of avoidance (according to the primary outcome measure PG-BAT) and dental anxiety decreased and self-efficacy increased significantly (P<.001), within-group effect sizes for both the primary outcome (Cohen d=1.5), and other outcomes were large in the range of 0.9 and 1.5. According to K-SADS-PL, 53% (8/15) of the participants were free from diagnosable dental anxiety at the 1-year follow-up. At the 1-year follow-up, improvements were maintained and clinically significant, with 60% (9/15) of participants who had been unable to manage intraoral injection of local anesthetics before ICBT reporting having accomplished this task at a dental clinic. The target group showed improvement in all the outcome measures. High levels of feasibility and acceptability were observed for the treatment. Conclusions: ICBT is a promising and feasible treatment for dental anxiety in children and adolescents. Integrating it into routine pediatric dental care would increase access to an effective psychological treatment. The results of this open trial must be replicated in controlled studies.",cognitive behavioral therapy; dental fear; dental phobia; dentistry; internet-based treatment; pediatric dentistry; psychology; self efficacy; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY; MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS; CLINICAL-TRIAL; SELF-EFFICACY; PHOBIA; FEAR; METAANALYSIS; DISORDERS; EXPOSURE; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Shahnavaz S and Hedman-Lagerlof E and Hasselblad T and Reuterskiold L and Kaldo V and Dahllof G,,,0,609
696,Technology Enhancement Learning Reflection on Improving Students' Satisfaction in Omani Universities,"The excellence of Omani Universities in technology enhancement learning (TEL) has become essential in supporting the rapid growth and sustainability of the education sector for usage and application. Technology enhancement learning is depending on use of different application tools like Microsoft office files and video blog programs to facilitate the academic performance. The real problem faced education is a need for several applications and technologies in the higher education institutions in Oman to improve their outputs and improve on teacher-student satisfaction. This paper aims to determine the common type of (TEL) of video and attached assignments and data analysis used in the Universities. In addition to facilitate (TEL) used is used in colleges and Universities in conjunction with improving lab equipment and administrative systems. In the first phase of this study, a systematic review of the existing literature was carried out to determine and define the suitable quantitative and qualitative criteria of existence applications; and then, design and exploit pair-wise comparison and online evaluation forms to get experts opinions/preference on the evaluation criteria used to measure the satisfaction of these technologies. In this study, survey questionnaires were distributed to 3 different Universities in Oman to assess their technology enhancement learning performances which served as a link between the Universities and higher education (HEI). The findings of this paper aid in establishing the need to improve teaching material by using attached assignment with material description by video programs in the Universities, higher educational institutions (HEI); and new techniques that add value in teacher assessment method for student satisfaction in higher education. Further studies could be carried out in the future with more technological developments.",Video Programs; Technology Enhancement Learning; Teacher Assessment; Academic Performance Multimedia; eLearning; STANDARDS; IMPACT; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw,Tawafak RM and Mohammed MN and Arshah RB and Shakir M and Mezhuyev V,,,0,610
698,Transinguinal laparoscopic evaluation of contralateral side during unilateral inguinal hernia repair for children,"Background Inguinal hernia repair is a common procedure in daily pediatric surgical practice. Objectives The present study was planned to find out whether transinguinal laparoscopic exploration (TILE) of the contralateral groin is effective in reducing the need of operation for contralateral metachronous inguinal hernia (CMIH) in children. Study design Charts of 1103 children who underwent inguinal hernia repair between 2006 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Eighty-eight children with bilateral hernia at the presentation were excluded, and 705 patients whose parents could be contacted by phone to get the latest information about children's condition were included in the study. Results Of the 705 children with unilateral inguinal hernia repair, 362 (51.4%) and 343 (48.6%) of them had right-sided and left-sided inguinal hernia, respectively. Transinguinal laparoscopic exploration was performed in 479 of the 705 children with unilateral hernia and a hernia or contralateral patent processus vaginalis (PPV) was found and ligated in %28.3 (n = 136) of them. Mean follow-up time was 60 +/- 36 months. Fifteen (4.3%) of 479 patients who had TILE and 31 (13.6%) of 226 the patients who did not have TILE developed CMIH. When the videos of 15 patients who developed CMIH were reviewed, overlooked PPV was found in 10 (3.3%) patients who had TILE during early phases of institutional learning curve. Discussion and conclusions TILE of the contralateral side during pediatric inguinal hernia repair is a simple and effective method to evaluate contralateral PPV. This approach clearly and significantly reduces the need of operation for a metachronous hernia at a later date.",Contralateral exploration; Inguinal hernia; Laparoscopy; Patent processus vaginalis; Transinguinal; PATENT PROCESSUS-VAGINALIS; METACHRONOUS HERNIA; RISK; METAANALYSIS; INFANTS; RING; Pediatrics; Urology & Nephrology; Pediatrics; Urology & Nephrology; Video Meta Results Raw,Gollu G and Ates U and Bahadir K and Ergun E and Yagmurlu A and Cakmak M and Aktug T and Dindar H and Bingol-Kologlu M,,,0,611

Although feedback has been demonstrated to be beneficial in traditional learning environments, we explore how feedback has been implemented in game-and simulation-based learning environments. In this review, we discuss critical characteristics that affect the efficacy of feedback, including the content of feedback messages, the modality in which feedback is presented, the timing of feedback presentation, and learner characteristics. General guidelines based on the research evidence are provided, and the theoretical implications are discussed in the context of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML; The Cambridge handbook of multimedia learning, Mayer, 2014b).",Video Meta Results Raw,Johnson CI and Bailey SK and Van Buskirk WL,,,0,612
700,Systematic review of randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of virtual reality training for laparoscopic surgery,"BACKGROUND: Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship. The aim of this review was to determine whether virtual reality (VR) training can supplement and/or replace conventional laparoscopic training in surgical trainees with limited or no laparoscopic experience. METHODS: Randomized clinical trials addressing this issue were identified from The Cochrane Library trials register, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, grey literature and reference lists. Standardized mean difference was calculated with 95 per cent confidence intervals based on available case analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-three trials (mostly with a high risk of bias) involving 622 participants were included in this review. In trainees without surgical experience, VR training decreased the time taken to complete a task, increased accuracy and decreased errors compared with no training. In the same participants, VR training was more accurate than video trainer (VT) training. In participants with limited laparoscopic experience, VR training resulted in a greater reduction in operating time, error and unnecessary movements than standard laparoscopic training. In these participants, the composite performance score was better in the VR group than the VT group. CONCLUSION: VR training can supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training. It is at least as effective as video training in supplementing standard laparoscopic training.",Video Meta Results Raw,Gurusamy K and Aggarwal R and Palanivelu L and Davidson BR,,,0,613

A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies comparing VATS and thoracotomy in LN dissection for clinical stage I lung cancer. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria and involved 2,190 patients in the VATS group and 3,000 patients in the open group. Meta-analysis showed that fewer total LNs were dissected in the VATS group, although VATS harvested more left-side LNs. The same number of total LN stations, N2 LNs, N2 LN stations, N1 LNs, and right-side LNs was harvested in both groups.

702,Telemedicine of family-based treatment for adolescent anorexia nervosa: A protocol of a treatment development study,"Background: Family-based treatment is an efficacious treatment available for adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Yet the implementation of this treatment, at least in the United States, is challenging due to a limited number of trained family-based treatment therapists and the concentration of these therapists in a limited number of urban centers. The use of telemedicine in the delivery of family-based treatment can increase access to this therapy for this patient population. Methods/Design: This two-year treatment development study (December 2013-November 2015) follows a two-wave iterative case series design. The study is ongoing and addresses the treatment needs of families in remote, rural, or underrepresented parts of the United States by delivering family-based treatment via telemedicine (video chat). The first six months of the study was dedicated to selecting a cloud-based secure telemedicine portal for use with participants. Recruitment for the first of two consecutive case series (N = 5) began during month seven. After these five patients completed treatment, a systematic review of treatment via feedback from participants and therapists related to the delivery of this model and use of technology was completed. A second wave of recruitment is underway (N = 5). At the end of both waves (N = 10), and after a second review of treatment, we should be able to establish the feasibility and acceptability of family-based treatment delivered via telemedicine for this patient population. Discussion: This study is the first attempt to deliver family-based treatment for adolescents with anorexia nervosa via telemedicine. If delivering family-based treatment in this format is feasible, it will provide access to an evidence-based treatment for families heretofore unable to participate in specialist treatment for their child's eating disorder.",Video Meta Results Raw,Anderson KE and Byrne C and Goodyear A and Reichel R and Le Grange D,,,0,615

705,"Gamifying a Simulation: Do a Game Goal, Choice, Points, and Praise Enhance Learning?","Despite the increased interest in gamification approaches, there is a lack of comparative studies that shed light on the applicability of these approaches in educational contexts. In this explorative study, with an experimental design, university learners (N = 98) studied a complex process (i.e., how to brew beer) in a 2-hour-long computerized simulation. In the experimental condition, the simulation featured the following game design elements: game goals, increased freedom of choice, points, virtual currency, and praise (i.e., a gamified simulation). These elements were absent in the simulation versions used in the two control conditions. No differences in learning outcomes and intrinsic motivation variables between the gamified simulation and its nongamified versions were observed. The gamified simulation was perceived to be significantly easier than the nongamified versions (eta p 2 = 0.10; d = 0.74, 0.42). Of the game elements used in this study, the participants perceived most positively a clear, game-like goal. The findings are consistent with self-determination theory, cognitive-affective theory of learning from media, and cognitive load theory. The findings also support the emerging notion that caution should be applied when using gamification approaches in educational contexts.",gamification; serious games; simulations; multimedia learning; motivation; learning outcomes; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; COGNITIVE LOAD; EDUCATIONAL-RESEARCH; GAMIFICATION; DESIGN; PLAY; PERSONALIZATION; SATISFACTION; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Brom C and Starkova T and Bromova E and Dechterenko F,,,0,617
706,Task-Switching Training and Transfer,"We used task-switching (TS) paradigms to study how cognitive training can compensate age-related cognitive decline. Thirty-nine young (age span: 18-25 years) and 40 older (age span: 60-75 years) women were assigned to training and control groups. The training group received 8 one-hour long cognitive training sessions in which the difficulty level of TS was individually adjusted. The other half of the sample did not receive any intervention. The reference task was an informatively cued TS paradigm with nogo stimuli. Performance was measured on reference, near-transfer, and far-transfer tasks by behavioral indicators and event-related potentials (ERPs) before training, 1 month after pretraining, and in case of older adults, 1 year later. The results showed that young adults had better pretraining performance. The reference task was too difficult for older adults to form appropriate representations as indicated by the behavioral data and the lack of P3b components. But after training older adults reached the level of performance of young participants, and accordingly, P3b emerged after both the cue and the target. Training gain was observed also in near-transfer tasks, and partly in far-transfer tasks; working memory and executive functions did not improve, but we found improvement in alerting and orienting networks, and in the execution of variants of TS paradigms. Behavioral and ERP changes remained preserved even after 1 year. These findings suggest that with an appropriate training procedure older adults can reach the level of performance seen in young adults and these changes persist for a long period. The training also affects the unpracticed tasks, but the transfer depends on the extent of task similarities.","task-switching; aging; N2; P3; cognitive training; longitudinal; transfer; HEALTHY OLDER-ADULTS; IMPROVING FLUID INTELLIGENCE; WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; AGE-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN; PARADIGM; ERP; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw",Gaal ZA and Czigler I,,,0,618
708,Pedagogical strategies for teaching literacy to ESL immigrant students: A meta‐analysis,"Background: Many countries rely on immigrants for population growth and to maintain a skilled workforce. However, many such immigrants face literacy-related barriers to success in education and in the labour force. Aims: This meta-analysis reviews experimental and quasi-experimental studies to examine strategies for teaching English literacy to immigrant students. Method: Following an exhaustive and systematic search for studies meeting pre-determined inclusion criteria, two researchers independently extracted data from 26 English as a Second Language (ESL) studies involving 3,150 participants. These participants consisted of ESL immigrant students in kindergarten through grade 6 who were exposed to English literacy instructional interventions. Measured outcomes were reading and writing. Results and Conclusions: Mean effect sizes vary from small to large, depending on instructional interventions and outcome constructs. Across several different grade levels, settings, and methodological features, pedagogical strategies used in teaching ESL to immigrant students are associated with increased competence in reading and writing. Collaborative reading interventions, in which peers engage in oral interaction and cooperatively negotiate meaning and a shared understanding of texts, produced larger effects than systematic phonics instruction and multimedia-assisted reading interventions. The results show that the pedagogical strategies examined in this meta-analysis produced statistically significant benefits for students in all grade levels. The findings also show that students from low socio-economic status (SES) background benefit from ESL literacy interventions. However, significant heterogeneity was found in each subset. Educators and policy makers are encouraged to consider specific school contexts when making decisions about optimal pedagogical strategies. It is possible that contextual factors as well as ESL learner characteristics may influence the effectiveness of these strategies. To ensure literacy acquisition for immigrant students whose primary language is not English, it is important to continue to research successful literacy practices in ways that better inform educators and policy makers.

709,Group interaction in problem-based learning tutorials: a systematic review,"INTRODUCTION: This review aimed at identifying studies on group interaction in problem-based learning (PBL) and elucidate methods used, factors affecting group interaction and the relationship between interaction and student's learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and HighWire were searched (January 1999 to June 2013) using a combination of pre-specified search terms. The search words were also used in searching nine journals in dental and medical education. Also edited research books on PBL were searched. Both qualitative and descriptive studies of group interaction were selected and critically appraised. RESULTS: Finally, 42 of 10,606 papers were included (35 journal articles and seven from research books). The materials used in assessing group interaction varied depending on the methodology design. Forty-three percent of the studies used video recording to evaluate group interaction. Other studies used indirect approaches such as focus groups, interviews and questionnaires. Factors affecting group interactions were students' and tutors' perceptions, tutor's subject-matter expertise, training students, tutor's group dynamics. There was no conclusive evidence about the impact of interaction in PBL on learning. Most studies were from medicine (64%), and 35 papers were published in the last 10 years. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe, North America and Asia. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a progressive increase in publications on PBL group interaction during the last 10 years, there are knowledge gaps and deficiencies in this area and most studies are lacking solid theoretical basis and are descriptive. There is a deficiency in the literature in this area from dentistry and other allied health disciplines.",deep learning; factors affecting group interaction; impact on learning; measurements; problem-based learning; students' interaction; tutor's roles; tutorials; Video Meta Results Raw,Azer SA and Azer D,,,0,620
711,Cognitive benefits of right-handedness: a meta-analysis,"Hand preference - which is related to cerebral dominance - is thought to be associated with cognitive skills; however, findings on this association are inconsistent and there is no consensus whether left- or right-handers have an advantage in either spatial or verbal abilities. In addition, it is not clear whether an interaction between sex and hand preference exists in relation to these cognitive abilities. As these matters are relevant from a neurodevelopmental perspective we performed a meta-analysis of the available literature. We searched PubMed and Embase, and included 14 studies (359,890 subjects) in the verbal ability meta-analysis and 16 studies (218,351 subjects) in the spatial ability meta-analysis. There was no difference between the full sample of left and right-handers for verbal ability, nor was there a hand preference-by-sex interaction. Subgroup analysis of children showed a small right-hand benefit. Our results further revealed a modest but significant effect favouring right-handedness for overall spatial ability, which was more pronounced when analysis was restricted to studies applying the mental rotation test. We could not identify a specific interaction with sex. Our results indicate that there is a small but significant cognitive advantage of right-handedness on spatial ability. In the verbal domain, this advantage is only significant in children. An interaction effect with sex is not confirmed.",Hand preference; Verbal ability; Spatial ability; Lateralization; Meta-analysis; Cognition; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Language; Male; Sex Characteristics; Space Perception; Cerebral Dominance; Cognitive Processes; Handedness; Spatial Ability; Human Sex Differences; Verbal Ability; Video Meta Results Raw,Somers M and Shields LS and Boks MP and Kahn RS and Sommer IE,,,0,621
712,Finding the middle ground in violent video game research: Lessons from Ferguson (2015),"Ferguson’s comprehensive meta-analysis provides convincing data that violent video games have almost no effect on children’s aggression. Although this finding is unlikely to bring unity to a divided field, Ferguson’s article (2015, this issue) provides important rules that should aid all researchers. First, we need to be more accepting of results that are inconsistent with our own theories. Second, extraneous variables are often responsible for the relations previous studies have found between violent media and aggression. Third, we should avoid using unstandardized assessments of important variables whenever possible. Finally, caution is warranted when generalizing laboratory research findings to severe acts of violent in the 'real world.'

713,Older Adult Video Game Preferences in Practice: Investigating the Effects of Competing or Cooperating,"Recent meta-analyses on video game interventions with the aim to improve cognition have shown promise for both younger and older adults. Most studies suggest that fast-paced action games produce the largest benefits, but previous work has shown that older adults might not necessarily adhere to interventions using action games. To increase intervention adherence, we investigated older adult video game preferences that might bolster adherence by having participants play a competitive game (Mario Kart DS) or a cooperative game (Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga) alone or with a partner. Although hypotheses regarding cooperative and multiplayer gameplay were not supported, converging evidence suggests multiplayer gameplay may lead to greater enjoyment, which has been previously shown to be related to intervention adherence. Insights for gaming intervention studies in older populations are also provided.",Video Meta Results Raw,Souders DJ and Boot WR and Charness N and Moxley JH,,,0,623
714,Facial Image Analysis for Fully Automatic Prediction of Difficult Endotracheal Intubation,"Goal: Difficult tracheal intubation is a major cause of anesthesia-related injuries with potential life threatening complications. Detection and anticipation of difficult airway in the preoperative period is, thus, crucial for the patients' safety. We propose an automatic face-analysis approach to detect morphological traits related to difficult intubation and improve its prediction. Methods: For this purpose, we have collected a database of 970 patients including photos, videos, and ground truth data. Specific statistical face models have been learned using the faces in our database providing an automated parametrization of the facial morphology. The most discriminative morphological features are selected through the importance ranking provided by the random forest algorithm. The random forest approach has also been used to train a classifier on these selected features. We compare a threshold tuning method based on class prior with two methods, which learn an optimal threshold on a training set for tackling the inherent imbalanced nature of the database. Results: Our fully automated method achieves an AUC of 81.0% in a simplified experimental setup, where only easy and difficult patients are considered. A further validation on the entire database has proven that our method is applicable for real-world difficult intubation prediction, with AUC = 77.9%. Conclusion: The system performance is in line with the state-of-the-art medical diagnosis, based on ratings provided by trained anesthesiologists, whose assessment is guided by an extensive set of criteria. Significance: We present the first completely automatic and noninvasive difficult intubation detection system that is suitable for use in clinical settings.",Video Meta Results Raw,Cuendet GL and Schoettker P and Yuece A and Sorci M and Gao H and Perruchoud C and Thiran JP,,,0,624
716,Sex differences in verbal reasoning are mediated by sex differences in spatial ability,"Several meta-analyses have shown that males outperform females in overall spatial ability, while females outperform males in some verbal ability tests, but not in others. The present article measures sex differences in two computerized tests, one thought to reflect verbal reasoning and one thought to reflect dynamic spatial performance. The sample comprised 1,593 university graduates (794 females and 799 males). Results show that males outperform females in both tests. However, sex differences in verbal reasoning turn to be nonsignificant when sex differences in dynamic spatial performance are statistically removed. The finding is interpreted from the previously demonstrated fact that the verbal reasoning test requires spatial processing. The result raises doubts about the common practice of evaluating sex differences in cognitive abilities from the tests' superficial characteristics or information content. The interpretation of the observed findings strongly requires the analysis of the tests' cognitive requirements.

717,Observation manuals as lenses to classroom teaching: Pitfalls and possibilities,"The aim of this paper is to discuss the role of coding and observation manuals in classroom studies. While observation manuals have been a part of the methodological toolkit for measuring various aspects of instruction for decades, the field has also been suffering from paradigm wars', fragmentation and local production of instruments. Common frameworks for investigating teaching are needed, including observation instruments for teaching that are both generic and subject specific. Such common tools for research developed within an integrated methodological design could help researchers make progress in aggregating knowledge about the impact of different teaching approaches across settings and subjects. This article serves as one such integrative mechanism by summarizing and reviewing existing manuals targeted towards developing knowledge for and in teaching. The analysis provides status, overview and focus of the different observation manuals; additionally, the article discusses how recent developments in instruments and coding procedures might provide increased rigour and a shared vocabulary to talk about teaching. We discuss both pitfalls and possibilities of coding manuals, and argue that if used in a reflexive manner, coding manuals can provide a common language and vocabulary when talking about - and researching - classroom teaching and learning.",Coding manuals; video studies; comparative classroom research; METAANALYSIS; EDUCATION; SCHOOL; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Klette K and Blikstad-Balas M,,,0,626
719,Gender differences in mental rotation strategy depend on degree of autistic traits,"Participants with low, medium, and high autistic traits completed a mental rotation task while their eye movements were recorded. Men were more accurate than women (F(1, 102)=4.36, P=0.04, (2)(p)=0.04), but there were no group differences in reaction time. In terms of eye movements, all participants tended to rely on top corners of cube figures for most angles of rotation, and bottom corners of cube figures for 0 and 90 degree rotations (duration: F(8, 816)=21.70, P<0.001, (2)(p)=0.18; count: F(8, 816)=24.42, P<0.001, (2)(p)=0.19) suggesting a shift in strategy with rotation angle. Eye movements to corners of cube figures also varied by autistic traits group and gender (duration: F(4, 204)=2.44, P=0.05, (2)(p)=0.05; count: F(4, 204)=2.47, P=0.05, (2)(p)=0.05). Participants with low and medium autistic traits tended to rely more often on the top corners, whereas women with high autistic traits relied on both the top and bottom corners and men with high autistic traits relied on all corners equally. These results suggest mental rotation strategies may vary by both gender and autistic traits. Autism Res2018, 11: 1024-1037. (c) 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay SummaryThe current study looked at eye movements to assess adults' strategies when mentally rotating three-dimensional cube figures.

720,"Usability of Health Information Websites Designed for Adolescents: Systematic Review, Neurodevelopmental Model, and Design Brief","BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a unique developmental period characterized by biological, social, and cognitive changes, as well as an interest in managing one's own health care. Many adolescents use the internet to seek health care information. However, young people face barriers before they can understand and apply the health information that they access on the web. It is essential that usability of adolescent health websites on the internet is improved to help adolescents overcome these barriers and allow them to engage successfully with web-based health care content. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to synthesize the usability of specific health information websites. These findings were mapped onto the adolescent neurodevelopmental profile, and a design brief based on the findings was developed to tailor future websites for specific adolescent requirements. METHODS: A systematic search conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) identified 25 studies that assessed the usability of health information websites. Adolescent feedback was collected by a mixture of surveys, focus groups, interviews, and think-aloud procedures. RESULTS: A majority of the information websites were developed for specific health issues that may be relevant to adolescents. The most preferred website features were interactive content such as games and quizzes, as well as videos, images, audio clips, and animations. Participants also preferred communicating with other adolescents with similar conditions or learning about their experience through real stories and testimonials. Adolescents found it difficult to use health information websites if they contained too much text, were too cluttered, or had features that made it difficult to access. The findings are considered in the context of adolescent social processes, low tolerance of delayed gratification, and attraction to novelty and mapped onto a neurodevelopmental model of adolescence. CONCLUSIONS: Young people's feedback can determine usability and content that make a health information website easy or informative to use. Neurodevelopmental profiles and the users' specific preferences and skills should be addressed in future development of health information websites for adolescents.",adolescents; health communication; internet; information seeking behavior; usability; systematic review; SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; ONLINE; INTERVENTION; SUPPORT; MESSAGES; BEHAVIOR; PARENTS; RISKS; TEENS; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Reen GK and Muirhead L and Langdon DW,,,1,628
721,How do visual-spatial and psychomotor abilities influence clinical performance in periodontal plastic surgery?,"Aim We want to evaluate the relationship of self-assessed experience and proficiency, manual dexterity and visual-spatial ability with surgical performance. Material and methods A total of 26 professionals were included in the study which consisted of four parts: (a) self-assessment by a questionnaire regarding proficiency and experience, (b) evaluation of visual-spatial ability, (c) testing of manual dexterity assessed by validated psychomotor tests and (d) evaluation of surgical performance by Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS). Results Self-assessed proficiency and experience levels did not correlate with objectively evaluated surgical performances (OSATS). However, low-level visual-spatial ability tests strongly correlated with OSATS while intermediate- and high-level tests did not. No correlation was found between psychomotor ability and clinical performance. Conclusions Self-assessed proficiency is not a good predictor for surgical performance as experts tend to be overconfident. To evaluate and predict surgical performance, visual-spatial ability tests seem to be more appropriate than measuring manual dexterity which failed to correlate with the surgical outcome.","clinical performance; periodontal surgery; psychomotor ability; skills evaluation; OBJECTIVE STRUCTURED ASSESSMENT; ROOT COVERAGE PROCEDURES; TECHNICAL SKILLS OSATS; COGNITIVE-ABILITIES; DIAGNOSTIC ERROR; SURGICAL SKILLS; ACQUISITION; EFFICACY; MODEL; METAANALYSIS; Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Burkhardt R and Hammerle CH and Lang NP,,,0,629
722,Classroom simulations in teacher education to support preservice teachers’ interpersonal competence: A systematic literature review,"Computer-based classroom simulations have been argued to be a promising way to practice preservice teachers' (PSTs') interpersonal competence and to ease the gap between teacher education and educational practice. The systematic literature review presented in this paper examined existing research on the links between PSTs' interpersonal competence, well-being, and simulations. Furthermore, this review mapped learning experiences, affordances, and hindrances of simulations. Fifteen studies were found eligible for inclusion. Most of these studies reported positive effects of simulations on PSTs' classroom management and teaching skills in general, rather than specifically on interpersonal competence (e.g., professional interpersonal vision, professional interpersonal knowledge, professional interpersonal repertoire). Concerning PSTs' well-being, four studies did show positive effects of simulations on PSTs' self-efficacy. However, none of the studies reported PSTs' anxiety. Reported affordances were mostly educational (e.g., receiving teacher feedback, available resources) or social (e.g., peer observation, discussions), while the reported hindrances were mainly of a technical nature (e.g., lack of a user-friendly interface, malfunctioning audio or video). Positive learning experiences depended on the degree of realism and authenticity within the simulation. The results of this study provide suggestions for future research on how computer-based simulations in teacher education could contribute to PSTs' interpersonal competence and well-being.

723,Gaming for health: a systematic review of the physical and cognitive effects of interactive computer games in older adults,"This systematic review examined the physical and cognitive effects of physically based interactive computer games (ICGs) in older adults. Literature searching was carried out from January 2000 to June 2011. Eligible studies were trials involving older adults (>65 years) describing the effects of ICGs with a physical component (aerobic, strength, balance, flexibility) on physical or cognitive outcomes. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, compliance, and enjoyment. Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria. ICG interventions varied in terms of software, game type, and nature of the computer interaction. Although there was preliminary evidence that ICG is a safe and effective exercise intervention for older adults, the dearth of high-quality evidence limits this finding. No major adverse effects were reported and two studies reported minor events. ICG could be improved further by tailoring interventions for older adults; in particular, they should aim to optimize participant safety, motivation, and enjoyment for this population.",older adults; physical activity; interactive computer gaming; Aged; Cognition; Humans; Motor Activity; Physical Fitness; Video Games; Aging; Computer Games; Physical Activity; Digital Gaming; Health; Intervention; Video Meta Results Raw,Bleakley CM and Charles D and Porter-Armstrong A and McNeill MD and McDonough SM and McCormack B,,,0,631
724,An active e-book to foster self-regulation in music education,"Purpose – The purpose of this work is to analyze the concept of self-regulated learning and applying it to a web-based interface for music teaching. Design/methodology/approach – This work starts from a systematic review about music education and self-regulation during learning processes. Then, the paper identifies those meta-cognitive strategies that music students should adopt during their instrumental practice. The goal is applying such concepts to rethink the structure of a didactic e-book for instrumental music education. Thanks to the adoption of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1599 standard, the paper outlines a model of active e-book able to improve learners’ performances through proper cognitive and multi-modal scaffolds. In the last section, the design principles for an implementation will be proposed. Findings – This work applies theoretical research on self-regulated learning to the design and implementation of a working prototype. Research limitations/implications – A limitation is the lack of experimentation data, required to test the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed e-book model and its impact on self-regulated music abilities. A validation strategy – e.g. based on scenarios – will be proposed in our future works, thanks to the support of music learning centres and focus groups composed by young Italian students. Originality/value – This work has been invited as an extension of the paper presented by the authors at EL2014 International Conference held in Lisbon. The previous work has been awarded as the best paper of the conference. In this extension, the authors provide further details about the proposed framework, highlighting in particular the implementation of scaffolds in the interface. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Active e-book; E-Learning; IEEE 1599; Multimedia; Music education; Self regulation; Video Meta Results Raw,Ludovico LA and Mangione GR,,,0,632
725,A comparison of the Truview PCD and the GlideScope Cobalt AVL video-laryngoscopes to the Miller blade for successfully intubating manikins simulating normal and difficult pediatric airways,"Background: Video-laryngoscopes provide better glottic visualization, but tracheal intubation times are longer, compared to conventional direct laryngoscopy in adult patients with normal airways. The objective of this randomized crossover study was to compare times to successful tracheal intubation with video-laryngoscope and direct laryngoscopy in manikins simulating infants with normal and abnormal airways. Methods: Thirty experienced pediatric anesthesia practitioners performed tracheal intubation in three distinct manikins simulating infants with (i) a normal airway (ii), an anterior larynx, and (iii) the Pierre Robin sequence anatomy. These were performed using a standard Miller #1 blade, the Glide-Scope Cobalt AVL, and the Truview PCD video-laryngoscope, first in a normal neck and then an unstable cervical spine scenario (18 intubations/subject). The specific assigned order of devices and manikins for each participant was based on a three by three Latin square design to minimize carryover effects between the model and the device. Predefined times to intubation were analyzed by Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results: Intubation times were shorter and success rates were higher with the Miller blade compared to either the GlideScope or the Truview videoscope in all three manikins in both scenarios, but did not differ between the GlideScope and the Truview devices. Improved intubation times and success rates in the unstable cervical spine scenario compared to the normal neck were attributed to learning effects with sequential intubation. Conclusion: Higher success rates and shorter intubation times with the Miller blade compared to either video-laryngoscope may reflect greater experience with direct laryngoscopy, need for more video-laryngoscopy training, or result from the manikin design. Individual practitioners may differ in their preference of device for intubating a child with anticipated difficult airway based on their previous experiences, self-assessment of their skills, and evaluation of the child's airway anatomy.",Video Meta Results Raw,Hippard HK and Kalyani G and Olutoye OA and Mann DG and Watcha MF,,,0,633
726,Working Inside for Smoking Elimination (Project W.I.S.E.) study design and rationale to prevent return to smoking after release from a smoke free prison,"Background: Incarcerated individuals suffer disproportionately from the health effects of tobacco smoking due to the high smoking prevalence in this population. In addition there is an over-representation of ethnic and racial minorities, impoverished individuals, and those with mental health and drug addictions in prisons. Increasingly, prisons across the U. S. are becoming smoke free. However, relapse to smoking is common upon release from prison, approaching 90% within a few weeks. No evidence based treatments currently exist to assist individuals to remain abstinent after a period of prolonged, forced abstinence. Methods/Design: This paper describes the design and rationale of a randomized clinical trial to enhance smoking abstinence rates among individuals following release from a tobacco free prison. The intervention is six weekly sessions of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy initiated approximately six weeks prior to release from prison. The control group views six time matched videos weekly starting about six weeks prior to release. Assessments take place in-person 3 weeks after release and then for non-smokers every 3 months up to 12 months. Smoking status is confirmed by urine cotinine. Discussion: Effective interventions are greatly needed to assist these individuals to remain smoke free and reduce health disparities among this socially and economically challenged group.",Video Meta Results Raw,Clarke JG and Martin RA and Stein LA and Lopes CE and Mello J and Friedmann P and Bock B,,,0,634

730,The role of multimedia in surgical skills training and assessment,"INTRODUCTION: Multimedia is an educational resource that can be used to supplement surgical skills training. The aim of this review was to determine the role of multimedia in surgical training and assessment by performing a systematic review of the literature. METHODS: A systematic review for published articles was conducted on the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE (1992 to November 2014), SCOPUS (1992 to November 2014) and EMBASE (1992 to November 2014). For each study the educational content, study design, surgical skill assessed and outcomes were recorded. A standard data extraction form was created to ensure systematic retrieval of relevant information. RESULTS: 21 studies were included; 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 non-randomized controlled trials (Non-RCTs). Technical skills were assessed in 7 RCTs and 3 non-RCTs; cognitive skills were assessed in 9 RCTs and 4 non-RCTs. In controlled studies, multimedia was associated with significant improvement in technical skills (4 studies; 4 RCTs) and cognitive skills (7 studies; 6 RCTs). In two studies multimedia was inferior in comparison to conventional teaching. Evaluation of multimedia (9 studies) demonstrated strongly favourable results. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that multimedia effectively facilitates both technical and cognitive skills acquisition and is well accepted as an educational resource.",Education; Multimedia; Surgical skills; Training and assessment; Video Meta Results Raw,Shariff U and Seretis C and Lee D and Balasubramanian SP,,,1,636
731,The Influence of Specific Supervisor Support Types on Transfer of Training: Examining the Mediating Effect of Training Retention,"The aim of this study was to examine the differential effects of specific types of supervisor support on transfer of training, taking into account established trainee characteristics, such as trainees' motivation to learn, motivation to transfer, and training self-efficacy. More specifically, nine types of supervisor support were examined (pre-training information, role modelling & facilitation, request sharing, favourable attitude, coaching & feedback, openness, involvement & accountability, work coverage, and training participation). In addition, the mediating effect of training retention is explored, as learning outcomes may present an intervening variable that connects supervisor support to transfer of training. A time-lagged design was used to investigate the relationships in the proposed model and it was evaluated using partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM). Data was gathered in Belgium through online questionnaires at three points in time from 111 participants of work-related training. Participants were employees from a retail organisation and different government agencies. Results indicate that only supervisors' accountability and involvement positively predicted employees' transfer of training three months after training. In addition, it was found that supervisors' involvement and accountability had an indirect effect on transfer of training through training retention.",Transfer of training; Supervisor support; Training retention; Quantitative study; Partial least squares path modelling; SELF-EFFICACY; ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT; PLS-SEM; MOTIVATION; ENVIRONMENT; LEARN; INSTRUMENTALITY; METAANALYSIS; ATTITUDES; FEEDBACK; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Govaerts N and Kyndt E and Dochy F,,,0,637

739,Improving communicative competence through synchronous communication in computer-supported collaborative learning environments: A systematic review,"Computer-supported collaborative learning facilitates the extension of second language acquisition into social practice. Studies on its achievement effects speak directly to the pedagogical notion of treating communicative practice in synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC): real-time communication that takes place between human beings via the instrumentality of computers in forms of text, audio and video communication, such as live chat and chatrooms as socially-oriented meaning construction. This review begins by considering the adoption of social interactionist views to identify key paradigms and supportive principles of computer-supported collaborative learning. A special focus on two components of communicative competence is then presented to explore interactional variables in synchronous computer-mediated communication along with a review of research. There follows a discussion on a synthesis of interactional variables in negotiated interaction and co-construction of knowledge from psycholinguistic and social cohesion perspectives. This review reveals both possibilities and disparities of language socialization in promoting intersubjective learning and diversifying the salient use of interactively creative language in computer-supported collaborative learning environments in service of communicative competence. © 2018 by the author.

740,Treatment of Internet gaming disorder: An international systematic review and CONSORT evaluation,"Treatment services for Internet gaming disorder are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, particularly in East Asia. This international systematic review was designed to appraise the quality standards of the gaming disorder treatment literature, a task previously undertaken by King et al. (2011) prior to the inclusion of Internet gaming disorder in Section III of the DSM-5 and 'Gaming disorder' in the draft ICD-11. The reporting quality of 30 treatment studies conducted from 2007 to 2016 was assessed. Reporting quality was defined according to the 2010 Consolidating Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. The results reaffirmed previous criticisms of these trials, namely: (a) inconsistencies in the definition, diagnosis, and measurement of disordered use; (b) lack of randomization and blinding; (c) lack of controls; and (d) insufficient information on recruitment dates, sample characteristics, and effect sizes. Although cognitive-behavioral therapy has a larger evidence base than other therapies, it remains difficult to make definitive statements on its benefits. Study design quality has not improved over the last decade, indicating a need for greater consistency and standardization in this area. Continuing international efforts to understand the core psychopathology of gaming disorder are vital to developing a model of best practice in treatment.","Internet gaming disorder; Internet addiction; Treatment; CONSORT; DSM-5; ICD-11; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; ONLINE GAME PLAY; PATHOLOGICAL INTERNET; CHINESE ADOLESCENTS; ADDICTION TREATMENT; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; TREATMENT PROGRAM; ASSESSMENT TOOLS; VIDEO GAMES; Psychology, Clinical; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",King DL and Delfabbro PH and Wu AM and Doh YY and Kuss DJ and Pallesen S and Mentzoni R and Carragher N and Sakuma H,,,0,641
741,The impact of behavioral interventions on cognitive function in healthy older adults: A systematic review,"Behavioral interventions to improve cognitive function in older adults are widespread and can vary from theater classes to cognitive training programs. However, the effectiveness in maintaining different cognitive domains varies greatly both across and within intervention types. To date, no systematic reviews have synthesized findings across more than a few types of interventions (e.g., cognitive vs. exercise). This systematic review examined 11 types of behavioral interventions and the respective transfer to 19 cognitive domains, as well as transfer to everyday function. Study inclusion criteria were: peer-reviewed articles in English, samples of healthy adults aged 65 and older, and randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions with reported cognitive outcomes. The 2017 search yielded 75 eligible articles comprising cognitive training, exercise training, combination interventions, cognitively-stimulating activities, and action video games. In general, process- (n = 26) and strategy-based (n = 16) cognitive training improved the trained domains but had weak transfer to non-trained domains. Aerobic training (n = 13) most consistently improved executive function, and strength/resistance (n = 8) and aerobic/resistance combination training (n = 6) most consistently improved cognitive inhibition and visual working memory. Combination interventions (n = 15 nonfactorial, n = 3 factorial) showed promise in improving verbal delayed recall and executive function. Few studies examined cognitively-stimulating activities or action video games, leaving inconclusive results about their effect on cognitive function. Few studies examined everyday function (n = 9), however, process- and strategy-based training demonstrated notable long-term transfer.

742,Mobile-assisted ESL/EFL vocabulary learning: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) has been a popular research area in recent years in the SLA field, as it has been considered as being able to facilitate language learning by offering an authentic, socially connective, contextually sensitive, and personalized mobile-mediated language learning environment. To investigate the benefits and possible limitations of mobile-assisted L2 vocabulary retention, many researchers continuously conducted relevant experiments worldwide. Among the current mobile-assisted L2 vocabulary learning research, short message services (SMS), multimedia message service (MMS), and mobile applications (apps) are the predominant approaches supported by the situated learning theory, cognitive mechanisms of L2 word retention, behaviorism, and social constructivism. Although language educators have been focusing on this topic, the effectiveness of mobile L2 vocaubulary learning still remained inconclusive. Besides, to date, little research synthesis has been conducted to investigate the effect of mobile-assisted L2 vocabulary learning. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to systematically synthethisize findings from (quaisi-) experimental studies carried out between 2005 and 2018 to examine whether there is a connection between the use of mobile technologies and L2 word retention. The results of 33 primary eligible studies showed a positive and large effect of mobile-assisted L2 word learning interventions. Additionally, SMS/MMS mode was found to be more beneficial for L2 word retention than mobile application mode; however, it is more prudent to interpret this finging as tentative because the number of target words and intervention time were unequal in the two modes. Moreover, the research settings, treatment durations, and task-afforded autonomy are three variables that tend to significantly moderate the effect of mobile-assisted L2 word retention. However, the above results should be viewed as suggestive rather than definitive with a view to the research flaws found in the primary studies and the small sample size of certain categories of moderators when compared.

743,"Home-Based Exergaming on Preschoolers' Energy Expenditure, Cardiovascular Fitness, Body Mass Index and Cognitive Flexibility: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Purpose: The effects of exergaming-based physical activity (PA) interventions on preschoolers' health outcomes and cognition remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to discern the effectiveness of a home-based educational exergaming intervention on preschoolers' energy expenditure, fitness, body mass index, and cognition. Methods: Participants were 32 preschoolers (16 girls; 59.4% Asian; M-age = 4.72, SD = +/- 0.73) recruited from the Twin Cities area in Minnesota. During baseline testing, we measured preschooler's daily energy expenditure (EE), cardiovascular fitness, body mass index, and cognitive flexibility using validated instruments. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) the exergaming intervention condition; or (2) control condition. The intervention program requested children participate in home-based educational exergaming using the LeapTV gaming console for at least 30 min/session 5 times/week. The control condition asked children to maintain regular PA patterns without any exergaming gameplay. Each condition lasted 12 weeks. We conducted identical outcome assessments for all children at baseline and post-intervention. Results: Analysis of covariance with repeated measures yielded significant time x group interaction effects for cognitive flexibility, Wilks' Lambda = 0.81, F(1, 29) = 6.98, p = 0.01, eta(2) = 0.19, suggesting children in the exergaming group demonstrated significantly greater increases in cognitive flexibility as compared to those in the control group over time. There were no significant differences for time x group changes between the two groups for EE, Wilks' Lambda = 0.92, F(1, 29) = 2.29, p = 0.14, eta(2) = 0.08; cardiovascular fitness, Wilks' Lambda = 0.96, F(1, 29) = 1.07, p = 0.31, eta(2) = 0.04; and BMI, Wilks' Lambda = 0.99, F(1, 29) = 0.05, p = 0.82, eta(2) = 0.01. However, our data did suggest a marginal effect of time for EE, Wilks' Lambda = 0.89, F(1, 29) = 3.26, p = 0.08, eta(2) = 0.08, indicating that children's daily EE increased from baseline to post-intervention. Conclusions: Home-based educational exergaming may positively impact cognitive flexibility in preschoolers. Studies with larger sample sizes in multiple geographic locations are needed, with our study suggesting a longer intervention period might also be warranted.","active video games; cognitive functions; early childhood; pediatric obesity; physical activity; health promotion; ACTIVE VIDEO GAMES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; INTERACTIVE DANCE; SITUATIONAL MOTIVATION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; CHILDREN; HEALTH; IMPACT; METAANALYSIS; EXERCISE; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Gao Z and Lee JE and Zeng N and Pope ZC and Zhang Y and Li X,,,0,644
744,The effect of losses disguised as wins and near misses in electronic gaming machines: A systematic review,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 33(4) of Journal of Gambling Studies (see record [rid]2017-49546-015[/rid]). The second author’s name was incorrectly published as 'Y. Yazdani' instead of 'A. Yazdani'. This has been corrected with this erratum.] Near misses and losses disguised as wins have been of interest to gambling researchers and policymakers for many years (e.g., Griffiths in J Gambl Stud 9(2):101–120, 1993). This systematic literature review describes the behavioural, psychological, and psychobiological effects of near misses and losses disguised as wins (LDWs) in an effort to evaluate their precise influence on the player and to highlight areas requiring further investigation. A systematic search for relevant studies was conducted using Scopus, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest Sociology databases, and the Gambling Research Exchange Ontario Knowledge Repository. A total of 51 (from an initial pool of 802) experimental peer-reviewed studies using human participants were found between 1991 and 2015. The systematic review revealed that near misses motivate continued play, but have varying effects on the emotional state or betting behaviour of the player. Near miss events were also shown to be associated with elevated skin conductance levels and diffuse activity across the brain, most consistently in areas processing reinforcement and reward. Re-examination of the studies of near misses events after classifying the type of game feedback suggested that the effectiveness of near misses is related to the phenomenology of a near miss itself rather than as a response to auditory or visual feedback provided by a slot machine. In contrast to near misses, the presence of LDWs was found to relate to an overestimation of how much a player is actually winning and was consistently viewed as an exciting event. The effect of LDWs appears to be driven by the presence of visuals and sounds most often associated with a true win. Practical implications and directions for future research are also discussed.

745,"The Effect of Simultaneous Exercise and Exposure to Thin-Ideal Music Videos on Women's State Self-Objectification, Mood and Body Satisfaction","The present study examined the simultaneous impact of thin-ideal music videos and exercise on state self-objectification, mood and body satisfaction, in order to assess whether exercise can ameliorate the usually found negative effects of appearance-focused media. One-hundred and eighty-four South Australian undergraduate women viewed appearance-focused or neutral music videos, with half in each condition simultaneously participating in a bout of exercise or in quiet rest. Participants completed pre- and post- state measures of mood, body satisfaction and self-objectification. As expected, exposure to appearance-focused music videos produced increased state self-objectification in comparison to neutral images. For body satisfaction, an interaction emerged for the dimension of physical attractiveness, whereby women who exercised and watched appearance-focused video clips felt more attractive than women watching the same clips who did not exercise, and felt no less attractive than women who watched neutral clips. The findings demonstrate that thin-ideal music videos serve to increase state self-objectification, but that exercise can ameliorate the negative effects of idealized media images on women's feelings of physical attractiveness.",Video Meta Results Raw,Prichard I and Tiggemann M,,,0,646
746,"Availability and performance of image-based, non-contact methods of monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation: a systematic review","OBJECTIVE: Over the last 15 years, developments in camera technology have coincided with increased availability and affordability. This has led to an increasing interest in using these technologies in healthcare settings. Image-based monitoring methods potentially allow multiple vital signs to be measured concurrently using a non-contact sensor. We have undertaken a systematic review of the current availability and performance of these monitoring methods. APPROACH: A multiple database search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, OpenGrey, IEEE Xplore Library and ACM Digital Library to July 2018. We included studies comparing image-based heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure monitoring methods against one or more validated reference device(s). Each included study was assessed using the modified GRRAS criteria for reporting bias. MAIN RESULTS: Of 30 279 identified studies, 161 were included in the final analysis. Twenty studies (20/161, 12%) were carried out on patients in clinical settings, while the remainder were conducted in academic settings using healthy volunteer populations. The 18-40 age group was best represented across the identified studies. One hundred and twenty studies (120/161, 75%) estimated heart rate, followed by 62 studies (62/161, 39%) estimating respiratory rate. Fewer studies focused on oxygen saturation (11/161, 7%) or blood pressure (6/161, 4%) estimation. Fifty-one heart rate studies (51/120, 43%) and 24 respiratory rate studies (24/62, 39%) used Bland-Altman analysis to report their results. Of the heart rate studies, 28 studies (28/51, 55%) showed agreement within industry standards of [Formula: see text]5 beats per minute. Only two studies achieved this within clinical settings. Of the respiratory rate studies, 13 studies (13/24, 54%) showed agreement within industry standards of [Formula: see text]3 breaths per minute, but only one study achieved this in a clinical setting. Statistical analysis was heterogeneous across studies with frequent inappropriate use of correlation. The majority of studies (99/161, 61%) monitored subjects for under 5 min. Three studies (3/161, 2%) monitored subjects for over 60 min, all of which were conducted in hospital settings. SIGNIFICANCE: Heart rate and respiratory rate monitoring using video images is currently possible and performs within clinically acceptable limits under experimental conditions. Camera-derived estimates were less accurate in the proportion of studies conducted in clinical settings. We would encourage thorough reporting of the population studied, details of clinically relevant aspects of methodology, and the use of appropriate statistical methods in future studies.

748,Integrating information from two pictorial animations: Complexity and cognitive prerequisites influence performance,"Dividing visual attention between spatially distinct sources of information could either be beneficial (if there is too much information for a single visualization) or detrimental (if interrelated information has to be mentally re-integrated) for learning. We present a new display technology allowing for the presentation of two distinct animations by avoiding split foci of visual attention: learners are able to switch between animations by moving their head. We examined how 84 naive learners integrated information in three presentation modes: the vexing-image mode displaying two animations, participants being able to switch between them without shifting the visual focus, a classical split-screen and an overlaid condition. Results showed that reduced complexity led to higher performance. Further, we showed that participants with high mental rotation abilities were best in the split-screen mode, whereas participants with low mental rotation abilities benefited most from the vexing-image. Theoretical and instructional consequences of these findings are discussed. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Video Meta Results Raw,Huff M and Schwan S,,,0,648
749,Reviews in instructional video,"This study investigates the effectiveness of a video tutorial for software training whose construction was based on a combination of insights from multimedia learning and Demonstration-Based Training. In the videos, a model of task performance was enhanced with instructional features that were intended to be particularly effective insofar as they addressed four key processes in observational learning (i.e., attention, retention, reproduction and motivation). An experiment with two conditions was reported. The control condition consisted of only demonstration videos. The experimental condition included a review after task demonstration to provide additional support for retention. The videos taught Word formatting tasks. The 73 participants came from elementary and secondary school. During training, video playing was followed by task practice. After training, a post-test was administered. Engagement data showed that demonstration videos were played almost completely (93%). Reviews fared worse (32%). Motivation increased significantly with training regardless of condition. Task performance also increased significantly from pre-test (29%) to training (84%) and post-test (71%). In addition, results for performance during and after training were significantly better for the experimental condition than the control condition. The discussion argues that the demonstration videos provide a viable way to support task completion. To further improve learning, better understanding of learners' retention processes is needed.

750,Developing the SRL-PV assessment scheme: Preservice teachers' professional vision for teaching self-regulated learning,"The present study aimed to: (a) develop the SRL-PV scheme for assessing preservice teachers' integration of professional vision (PV) considerations (noticing/describing/explaining/predicting) while analyzing two delivery modes for teaching of self-regulated learning (SRL): direct SRI teaching (explicit/implicit) and indirect SRI teaching (via environment) and (b) test this scheme's practical validity and reliability for measuring effects of teacher education. The scheme was used to assess 26 preservice teachers' lesson analyses, collected before and after an academic SRL Teaching and Learning Methods course. At posttest, lesson analyses revealed specific, qualitative SRL-PV descriptions that referenced SRL components and PV considerations, thus providing content validity for the scheme. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications are discussed for using the SRL-PV scheme to empower teachers' SRL professionalism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

751,NOT QUITE PLAYING THE GAME? MOBILE APPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES,This paper focuses on the use of mobile \app\'-based interventions as tools to influence health-related behaviour. Apps are software applications designed to run on smart phones and other mobile devices We review the extensive but fragmented literature relating to serious games and gamification in order to identify the key concepts and frameworks that can be used to underpin the design and evaluation of these apps. We then use these criteria to review a range of current apps developed by one public body,the UK NHS and commercial developers of health-related apps and compare these to commercial apps promoting unhealthy food items. We suggest that there are serious weaknesses evident in the apps provided by public bodies and that this sector could learn from an analysis of the development strategies used in the commercial sector.

753,I Know How You Feel: The Warm-Altruistic Personality Profile and the Empathic Brain,"The ability to empathize with other people is a critical component of human social relationships. Empathic processing varies across the human population, however it is currently unclear how personality traits are associated with empathic processing. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that specific personality traits are associated with behavioral and biological indicators of improved empathy. Extraversion and Agreeableness are personality traits designed to measure individual differences in social-cognitive functioning, however each trait-dimension includes elements that represent interpersonal social functioning and elements that do not represent interpersonal social functioning. We tested the prediction that interpersonal elements of Extraversion (Warmth) and Agreeableness (Altruism) are associated with empathy and non-interpersonal elements of Extraversion and Agreeableness are not associated with empathy. We quantified empathic processing behaviorally (empathic accuracy task using video vignettes) and within the brain (fMRI and an emotional perspective taking task) in 50 healthy subjects. Converging evidence shows that highly warm and altruistic people are well skilled in recognizing the emotional states of other people and exhibit greater activity in brain regions important for empathy (temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex) during emotional perspective taking. A mediation analysis further supported the association between warm-altruistic personality and empathic processing; indicating that one reason why highly warm-altruistic individuals may be skilled empathizers is that they engage the temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex more. Together, these findings advance the way the behavioral and neural basis of empathy is understood and demonstrates the efficacy of personality scales to measure individual differences in interpersonal social function.",Video Meta Results Raw,Haas BW and Brook M and Remillard L and Ishak A and Anderson IW and Filkowski MM,,,0,653
756,Systematic Review of Postgraduate Surgical Education in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,"Surgical care is recognized as an important component of public health, however, many low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) are faced with a shortage of trained personnel. In response to this unmet need, many countries have developed local postgraduate training programs in surgery. This study aims to characterize general surgery postgraduate education in LMICs. PubMed, EMBASE, and Global Index Medicus databases were searched for articles related to postgraduate general surgery education in LMICs. Studies in other surgical specialties and those published prior to 1990 were excluded. Data were collected on the characteristics of postgraduate training programs. Sixty-four articles discussed postgraduate surgical education in LMICs. Programs in 34 different countries and 6 different regions were represented. Nine countries were low-income, 12 were low-middle-income, and 13 were upper-middle-income countries. Sixty-four articles described aspects of the local postgraduate training program. Prior to postgraduate training, residents complete an undergraduate medical degree with 19 programs describing a pre-training experience such as internship. Surgical curricula were broad-based to prepare trainees to work in low-resource settings. At the completion of postgraduate training, examination formats varied including oral, written, and clinical exams. Postgraduate general surgery programs ranged from 2.5 to 7 years. Postgraduate surgical education is one mechanism to increase surgical capacity in LMICs. Different strategies have been employed to improve surgical education in LMICs and learning from these programs can optimize surgical education across teaching sites.",Video Meta Results Raw,Rickard J,,,0,654
758,What are we looking for in computer-based learning interventions in medical education? A systematic review,"Background: Computer-based learning (CBL) has been widely used in medical education, and reports regarding its usage and effectiveness have ranged broadly. Most work has been done on the effectiveness of CBL approaches versus traditional methods, and little has been done on the comparative effects of CBL versus CBL methodologies. These findings urged other authors to recommend such studies in hopes of improving knowledge about which CBL methods work best in which settings. Objective: In this systematic review, we aimed to characterize recent studies of the development of software platforms and interventions in medical education, search for common points among studies, and assess whether recommendations for CBL research are being taken into consideration. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published from 2003 through 2013. We included studies written in English, specifically in medical education, regarding either the development of instructional software or interventions using instructional software, during training or practice, that reported learner attitudes, satisfaction, knowledge, skills, or software usage. We conducted 2 latent class analyses to group articles according to platform features and intervention characteristics. In addition, we analyzed references and citations for abstracted articles. Results: We analyzed 251 articles. The number of publications rose over time, and they encompassed most medical disciplines, learning settings, and training levels, totaling 25 different platforms specifically for medical education. We uncovered 4 latent classes for educational software, characteristically making use of multimedia (115/251, 45.8%), text (64/251, 25.5%), Web conferencing (54/251, 21.5%), and instructional design principles (18/251, 7.2%). We found 3 classes for intervention outcomes: knowledge and attitudes (175/212, 82.6%), knowledge, attitudes, and skills (11.8%), and online activity (12/212, 5.7%). About a quarter of the articles (58/227, 25.6%) did not hold references or citations in common with other articles. The number of common references and citations increased in articles reporting instructional design principles (P = .03), articles measuring online activities (P = .01), and articles citing a review by Cook and colleagues on CBL (P = .04). There was an association between number of citations and studies comparing CBL versus CBL, independent of publication date (P = .02). Conclusions: Studies in this field vary highly, and a high number of software systems are being developed. It seems that past recommendations regarding CBL interventions are being taken into consideration. A move into a more student-centered model, a focus on implementing reusable software platforms for specific learning contexts, and the analysis of online activity to track and predict outcomes are relevant areas for future research in this field.

759,Working alliance and outcome effectiveness in videoconferencing psychotherapy: A systematic review and noninferiority meta-analysis,"Videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP)-the remote delivery of psychotherapy via secure video link-is an innovative way of delivering psychotherapy, which has the potential to overcome many of the regularly cited barriers to accessing psychological treatment. However, some debate exists as to whether an adequate working alliance can be formed between therapist and client, when therapy is delivered through such a medium. The presented article is a systematic literature review and two meta-analyses aimed at answering the questions: Is working alliance actually poorer in VCP? And is outcome equivalence possible between VCP and face-to-face delivery? Twelve studies were identified which met inclusion/exclusion criteria, all of which demonstrated good working alliance and outcome for VCP. Meta-analyses showed that working alliance in VCP was inferior to face-to-face delivery (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.67, 0.07], p = 0.11; with the lower bound of the CI extending beyond the noninferiority margin [-0.50]), but that target symptom reduction was noninferior (SMD = -0.03; 95% CI [-0.45, 0.40], p = 0.90; CI within the noninferiority margin [0.50]). These results are discussed and directions for future research recommended.","meta-analysis; systematic review; VCP; videoconferencing psychotherapy; working alliance; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; FACE-TO-FACE; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PROCESSING THERAPY; PANIC DISORDER; HEALTH; DEPRESSION; EXPOSURE; DELIVERY; Psychology, Clinical; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Norwood C and Moghaddam NG and Malins S and Sabin-Farrell R,,,0,656
761,Experimental evaluations of elementary science programs: A best‐evidence synthesis,"This article presents a systematic review of research on the achievement outcomes of all types of approaches to teaching science in elementary schools. Study inclusion criteria included use of randomized or matched control groups, a study duration of at least 4 weeks, and use of achievement measures independent of the experimental treatment. A total of 23 studies met these criteria. Among studies evaluating inquiry‐based teaching approaches, programs that used science kits did not show positive outcomes on science achievement measures (weighted ES = + 0.02 in 7 studies), but inquiry‐based programs that emphasized professional development but not kits did show positive outcomes (weighted ES = + 0.36 in 10 studies). Technological approaches integrating video and computer resources with teaching and cooperative learning showed positive outcomes in a few small, matched studies (ES = + 0.42 in 6 studies). The review concludes that science teaching methods focused on enhancing teachers' classroom instruction throughout the year, such as cooperative learning and science‐reading integration, as well as approaches that give teachers technology tools to enhance instruction, have significant potential to improve science learning.

The review involved 38 independent samples with 2988 total participants. There was a highly significant small-to-medium effect for intelligence measures to be correlated with decoding accuracy (r = .19, p < .001). Significant moderators included the type of decoding judgment (emotion vs. intended meaning judgments), decoding channel (audio-only vs. audio-plus-video channel), and target gender (both male-and-female targets vs. female-only targets). Interpersonal decoding accuracy requires some level of social sophistication and results of this meta-analysis suggest that part of that social sophistication involves the cognitive abilities comprising general intelligence.

765,Supporting learners' self-regulated learning in Massive Open Online Courses,"In MOOCs, learners are typically presented with great autonomy over their learning process. Therefore, learners should engage in self-regulated learning (SRL) in order to successfully study in a MOOC. Learners however often struggle to self-regulate their learning. We implemented an SRL intervention in three MOOCs. The intervention consisted of three short videos containing SRL instruction and study suggestions to improve learners' SRL. We tested the effects of the SRL intervention on both learners' course completion as well as on learners' SRL. Learners' SRL was measured with trace data variables indicating SRL activity. The results showed that the intervention positively affected learners' course completion. Furthermore, the learners who complied with the intervention also engaged in more SRL activities compared to the learners in the control condition: learners who complied showed more metacognitive activities before learning (planning), help seeking, and persistence. Intervention compliance was however low. Further analyses exploring potential causes of the low intervention compliance were conducted. The great majority of learners who did not comply with the intervention dropped out of the MOOC before they encountered the implemented intervention. We conclude that the SRL intervention has been successful in supporting both learners' SRL as well as their course completion. Implications include the importance of supporting learners' SRL as well as the necessity to conduct further research on how to improve intervention compliance.","Intervention; MOOC; Online learning; Self-regulated learning; Trace data In; STUDENTS; ACHIEVEMENT; STRATEGIES; METAANALYSIS; INTERVENTIONS; ENVIRONMENTS; MOTIVATIONS; ATTAINMENT; COMPONENTS; EDUCATION; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education & Educational Research; Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Jansen RS and van Leeuwen A and Janssen J and Conijn R and Kester L,,,0,659
767,Needle localization of small pulmonary nodules: Lessons learned,"Background: Lung nodules that are small and deep within lung parenchyma, and have semisolid characteristics are often challenging to localize with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). We describe our cumulative experience using needle localization of small nodules before surgical resection. We report procedural tips, operative results, and lessons learned over time. Methods: A retrospective review of all needle localization cases between July 1, 2006, and December 30, 2016, at a single institution was performed. A total of 253 patients who underwent needle localization of lung nodules ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 cm before operation were enrolled. Nodules were localized by placing two 20-gauge Hawkins III coaxial needles from different trajectories with tips adjacent to the nodule, injection of 0.3 to 0.6 mL of methylene blue, and deployment of 2 hookwires, under computed tomography guidance. Patients then underwent VATS wedge resection for diagnosis, followed by anatomic resection for lung carcinoma. Procedural and perioperative outcomes were assessed. Results: Needle localization was successful in 245 patients (96.8%). Failures included both wires falling out of lung parenchyma before operation (5 patients), wire migration (2 patients), and bleeding resulting in hematoma requiring transfusion (1 patient). The most common complication of needle localization was asymptomatic pneumothorax (11/253 total patients; 4.3%) and was higher in patients with bullous emphysema (9/35 patients; 25.7%). Of the 8 individuals who had unsuccessful needle localization, 7 had successful wedge resection in the area of methylene blue injection that included the nodule; 1 required segmentectomy for diagnosis. Completion lobectomy (154 VATS, 2 minithoracotomies) or VATS segmentectomy (18 patients) was performed in 174 individuals with a diagnosis of non-small cell carcinoma or carcinoid. The average length of hospital stay was 1.4 days for wedge resection, 1.9 days for VATS segmentectomy, 3.1 days for VATS lobectomy, and 4.9 days for minithoracotomy. Perioperative survival was 100%. Conclusions: Needle localization with hookwire deployment and methylene blue injection is a safe and feasible strategy to localize small, deep lung nodules for wedge resection and diagnosis.

768,A school educational intervention based on a serious game to promote a healthy lifestyle,"Background: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is a basic aspect of well-being. Since public health surveillance systems underlie high prevalence of obesity and diet-related ill health, efforts to provide effective intervention to prevent these conditions are of primary importance. The present study aims to test and validate a school intervention based on a serious game (SG) directed to empower a healthy lifestyle in children, actively involving their parents and teachers. Methods: A quantitative, pre/post-test study design assessed effects of a healthy lifestyle intervention on healthy food knowledge, food consumption frequency and level of interest. Participants were 79 children attending primary school and lower secondary school in the Chieti-Pescara urban and rural areas of Italy. Measures were collected during two supervised steps of assessment (T1 and T2). Results: Sixty-seven children completed the intervention. After playing the SG, participants reported higher levels of knowledge on healthy diet. Children also showed significant improvement in healthy eating habits. Moreover, high rates of endorsement about fun, playability, learning perception and goodness of characteristics emerged. Conclusion: This study, targeted children, but directly involving families, shows the effectiveness of a school educational intervention based on a SG, an innovative tool with potential benefits for preventive purposes, despite the short term of intervention. Issues related to the implementation of a method for prevention tailored for children are discussed.","Healthy behavior promotion; Obesity and diabetes prevention; Serious games; Children; parents; DIGITAL GAMES; CHILDREN; OBESITY; METAANALYSIS; PREVALENCE; OVERWEIGHT; DIETARY; MULTIMEDIA; BEHAVIORS; QUEST; Psychology, Clinical; Mathematics; Psychology; Mathematics; Video Meta Results Raw",Marchetti D and Fraticelli F and Polcini F and Fulcheri M and Mohn AA and Vitacolonna E,,,0,661

770,Brain activations associated with fearful experience show common and distinct patterns between younger and older adults in the hippocampus and the amygdala,"Revisiting threat-related scenes elicits fear and activates a brain network related to cognitive-affective processing. Prior experience may contribute to the present fearful experience. We aimed to investigate (a) patterns of brain activation associated with individual differences in past fearful experiences (pFear) and the present fear elicited by watching videos (eFear) and (b) age-related differences in the activation patterns. Forty healthy adults, including 20 younger adults (YA) and 20 older adults (OA), underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while watching videos containing high- and low-threat scenes of medical treatment. Both age subgroups showed positive correlations between pFear and bilateral hippocampal activation. Only YA showed threat-related activation in the bilateral anterior insula and activation positively correlated with pFear in the bilateral S1 and the amygdala. The evidence suggests that the hippocampus, amygdala and S1 may play key roles in bridging past fearful experiences and the present fear elicited by revisiting visual scenes and that the interaction between memory and emotional processing may be age dependent.",AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS; DENTAL TREATMENT; PAIN; CONNECTIVITY; METAANALYSIS; ANXIETY; REPRESENTATION; ANTICIPATION; ATTENTION; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw,Lin CS and Wu CY and Wu SY and Lin HH,,,0,663
771,The Benefits of Active Video Games for Educational and Physical Activity Approaches: A Systematic Review,"This article sets out to conduct a systematic review of the current literature on active video games as potential educational tools for physical education or physical activity. To begin with, research on active video games for educational and physical purposes has been examined with the purpose of verifying improvement of attitudes, intellectual skills, knowledge, motor skills and physical properties associated with physical activity and physical education. A second aim will be to determine the effectiveness of active video games compared with traditional approaches to physical activity. From this perspective, a systematic literature search from relevant international databases was conducted from January to July 2015 in order to find papers published in journals or conference proceedings from January 2010 onwards. Then, 2648 references were identified in database searches and 100 of these papers met the inclusion criteria. Two main conclusions are to be drawn from this research.

772,A web-based clinical pedagogy program to enhance registered nurse preceptors' teaching competencies - An innovative process of development and pilot program evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Registered Nurse Preceptors guide students to integrate theory into practice, assess clinical competencies, and enhance problem-solving skills. Researches have indicated that the teaching competencies of nurse preceptors can be transferred to students' clinical learning. OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study are to develop a web-based clinical pedagogy (WCP) program for Registered Nurse Preceptors and conduct pilot program evaluation. DESIGN: A three-step process was applied to integrate the theoretical framework, evidence from the systematic review, and content validity by the experts and pilot test with the Registered Nurse Preceptors in the content and technical development of the program. The WCP program has unique features including use of dashboard, interactive videos, consultation with experts, discussion forum and backend data analysis. RESULTS: A committee of six content experts evaluated the comprehensiveness, appropriateness, and relevancy of the program. The item-Content Validity Index (CVI) score ranged from 0.83 to 1.00 and the scale-CVI score was 0.87, which indicated that the WCP program had a strong content validity. Ten nurse preceptors were invited to use the WCP program. Preceptors shared that the website was easy to use and navigate. They commented that the videos in each module are beneficial for nurses to understand the real situation in the clinical setting. This feature also makes the website more interactive. Feedback from preceptors was subsequently used to further refine the program. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The WCP program is an evidence-based program that provides a comprehensive coverage on clinical teaching pedagogy and assessment strategies. The unique web-based technology and interactive features provide a platform for nurse preceptors to discuss clinical encounters with peers and consult experts. The flexible and resource-rich nature of web-based learning encourages nurses to use it for continuing education.","Clinical pedagogy; Teaching competency; Web-based program; Nurse preceptor; STUDENTS SELF-EFFICACY; CONTENT VALIDITY; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCES; PLACEMENT; ATTITUDES; EDUCATION; INTERNET; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Nursing; Education & Educational Research; Nursing; Video Meta Results Raw",Wu XV and Chi Y and Chan YS and Wang W and Ang EN and Zhao S and Sehgal V and Wee FC and Selvam UP and Devi MK,,,0,665
773,Internet and video game addictions: A cognitive behavioral approach,"Background: While several benefits are attributed to the Internet and video games, an important proportion of the population presents symptoms related to possible new technological addictions and there has been little discussion of treatment of problematic technology use. Although demand for knowledge is growing, only a small number of treatments have been described. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the literature, to establish Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as a possible strategy for treating Internet and video game addictions. Method: Te review was conducted in the following databases: Science Direct on Line, PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Clinical Trials Library, BVS and SciELO. The keywords used were: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; therapy; treatment; with association to the terms Internet addiction and video game addiction. Given the scarcity of studies in the field, no restrictions to the minimum period of publication were made, so that articles found until October 2013 were accounted. Results: Out of 72 articles found, 23 described CBT as a psychotherapy for Internet and video game addiction. Te manuscripts showed the existence of case studies and protocols with satisfactory efficacy. Discussion: Despite the novelty of technological dependencies, CBT seems to be applicable and allows an effective treatment for this population.",Cognitive behavioral therapy; Internet addiction; Internet gaming disorder; Treatment; Video game addiction; caffeine; addiction; anxiety; cognitive therapy; electroacupuncture; hostility; human; impulse control disorder; internet addiction; irritability; meta analysis; neurosis; obsessive compulsive disorder; pathological gambling; psychoeducation; psychosocial disorder; psychotherapy; relapse; review; self control; self evaluation; suicidal ideation; systematic review; time management; trichotillomania; video game addiction; Video Meta Results Raw,Lemos IL and De Abreu CN and Sougey EB,,,0,666
775,"A meta-analysis of pathological gaming prevalence and comorbidity with mental health, academic and social problems","Background: Mental health professionals, policy makers and the general public continue to debate the issue of pathological video gaming. Scholars disagree on the prevalence and diagnostic criteria for this potential new disorder. The current meta-analysis considers existing scholarship to examine how differing measurement methods influence prevalence rates and associations with other mental health problems. Method: Thirty three published studies and doctoral dissertations were analyzed in meta-analysis. Prevalence rates and comorbidity with other mental health problems were examined according to measurement method. Results: Prevalence estimates and comorbidity with other problems varied widely between studies. Measurement which attempted to replicate 'pathological gambling' approaches produced higher prevalence estimates and lower comorbidity estimates than methods which focused on the interfering nature of pathological gaming. The most precise measures produce an overall prevalence rate of 3.1%. Interpretation: Diagnostic analogies with pathological gambling may produce spuriously high prevalence estimates, potentially over identifying non-pathological players as pathological. Diagnostic approaches focused on the interfering nature on other life needs and responsibilities may have greater validity and utility.

776,Does an exercise programme integrating the Nintendo Wii-Fit Balance Board improve balance in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy?,"Background: Cerebral palsy is a common childhood movement disorder with balance impairment a common complaint. Active video games such as the Nintendo Wii-Fit have been found to be a valuable therapeutic tool, enjoyed by a variety of populations including children with CP, but a synthesis of the research investigating its specific use for balance in children with CP has yet to be conducted. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of a Nintendo Wii-Fit Balance board programme in improving balance in ambulatory children with CP. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted. A total of six studies matching inclusion and exclusion criteria were found and critically appraised by a modified version of Downs and Black's Checklist. Results: All studies used the Nintendo Wii-Fit software, with variable programme length and frequency of sessions. All but one study demonstrated a significant improvement in at least one balance outcome post-intervention, with dynamic balance appearing to be greater influenced. Discussion: The impact of age on the results was inconclusive. Children with cognitive, visual or vestibular impairments may show less of an improvement. A 6-week programme appears sufficient, provided training frequency remains high. Overall, there is moderate evidence to suggest that a Nintendo Wii-Fit Balance Board programme can improve balance in children with CP. Conclusions: Balance training with a Nintendo Wii-Fit Balance Board can enhance balance in individuals with ambulatory CP. Due to limited evidence investigating ataxic or dyskinetic CP, results from this study should be generalised with caution to these subtypes. Future research should aim to investigate the long-term effects of the intervention. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Balance; Exercise; Intervention; Outcome measures; Systematic review; Video Meta Results Raw,Cooper T and Williams JM,,,0,668
777,How effective is emotional design? A meta-analysis on facial anthropomorphisms and pleasant colors during multimedia learning,"We conducted a meta-analysis of 33 independent samples (N = 2924) to address whether adding anthropomorphic faces to multimedia graphics and/or adding pleasant colors are effective emotional design approaches. We found significant positive meta-analytic effects for retention (k = 18, d+ = 0.387), comprehension (k = 14, d+ = 0.317), and transfer (k = 27, d+ = 0.327) under a random-effects model. Effects for affective-motivational variables were mixed, with a robust effect for intrinsic motivation (k = 23, d+ = 0.255), a weaker effect for liking/enjoyment (k = 20, d+ = 0.109), and a marginal effect for positive affect (k = 15, d+ = 0.113). The manipulations did not significantly (ps >.227) influence perceptions of learning (k = 11, d+ = 0.097) or effort (k = 20, d+ = 0.051), but reduced perceptions of difficulty (k = 14, d+ = −0.208). Four of the outcome variables (retention, transfer, intrinsic motivation, and perceived effort) were sufficiently heterogeneous. There was no major issue with publication bias, influential cases, or outliers. With one exception, there was no evidence of moderation by experimental contrast, dynamicity of materials, age, language/culture, prior mood, time-on-task, and publication type after adjusting for multiple comparisons. There was provisional evidence that age moderated the effect of the manipulations on intrinsic motivation, such that larger effects were revealed for children compared to older learners. Altogether, anthropomorphisms/colors appear to be useful design principles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Multimedia learning; Emotional design; Anthropomorphisms; Pleasant color; Meta-analysis; EDUCATIONAL-RESEARCH; DECORATIVE PICTURES; COGNITIVE LOAD; GAMIFICATION; MOTIVATION; EXAMPLES; GAMES; SATISFACTION; PERFORMANCE; DISCOVERY; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Brom C and Stárková T and D'Mello SK,,,1,669
778,Benefits and Pitfalls of Multimedia and Interactive Features in Technology-Enhanced Storybooks: A Meta-Analysis,"A meta-analysis was conducted on the effects of technology-enhanced stories for young children's literacy development when compared to listening to stories in more traditional settings like storybook reading. A small but significant additional benefit of technology was found for story comprehension (g+ = 0.17) and expressive vocabulary (g+ = 0.20), based on data from 2,147 children in 43 studies. When investigating the different characteristics of technology-enhanced stories, multimedia features like animated pictures, music, and sound effects were found beneficial. In contrast, interactive elements like hotspots, games, and dictionaries were found to be distracting. Especially for children disadvantaged because of less stimulating family environments, multimedia features were helpful and interactive features were detrimental. Findings are discussed from the perspective of cognitive processing theories.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Vocabulary; Multimedia Materials; Comprehension; Literacy; Expressive Language; Search Strategies; Comparative Analysis; Story Reading; Disadvantaged Youth; Young Children; Literature Reviews; Story Telling; Technology Uses in Education; Meta Analysis; Books; at-risk students; computers and learning; instructional technologies; media; meta-analysis; Video Meta Results Raw",Takacs ZK and Swart EK and Bus AG,,,1,670

METHOD: A concealed, randomized controlled trial of computer based session versus lecture of equal duration (40 minutes) and identical content in EBM and systematic reviews. The study was based at the Medical School, University of Birmingham, UK involving one hundred and seventynine year one medical students. The main outcome measures were change from pre to post-intervention score measured using a validated questionnaire assessing knowledge (primary outcome) and attitudes (secondary outcome). RESULTS: Participants' improvement in knowledge in the computer based group was equivalent to the lecture based group (gain in score: 0.8 [S.D = 3.2] versus 1.3 [S.D = 2.4]; p = 0.24). Attitudinal gains were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Computer based teaching and typical lecture sessions have similar educational gains.","Computer Assisted Instruction; Education, Medical; Medical Practice, Evidence-Based; Teaching -- Standards; Randomized Controlled Trials; Educational Technology; Great Britain; Questionnaires; Students, Medical -- Psychosocial Factors; Human; Video Meta Results Raw; VIDEOS/LECTURERS/Excluded at Full Text; VIDEOS/LECTURERS/Included = Y; Video vs Lectures/Excluded at Full Text; Video vs Lectures/Excluded; Video vs Lectures/Included",Davis J and Crabb S and Rogers E and Zamora J and Khan K,,,0,671
782,A meta-analysis of the segmenting effect,"The segmenting effect states that people learn better when multimedia instructions are presented in (meaningful and coherent) learner-paced segments, rather than as continuous units. This meta-analysis contains 56 investigations including 88 pairwise comparisons and reveals a significant segmenting effect with small to medium effects for retention and transfer performance. Segmentation also reduces the overall cognitive load and increases learning time. These four effects are confirmed for a system-paced segmentation. The meta-analysis tests different explanations for the segmenting effect that concern facilitating chunking and structuring due to segmenting the multimedia instruction by the instructional designer, providing more time for processing the instruction and allowing the learners to adapt the presentation pace to their individual needs. Moderation analyses indicate that learners with high prior knowledge benefitted more from segmenting instructional material than learners with no or low prior knowledge in terms of retention performance.

783,Patient-mediated knowledge translation (PKT) interventions for clinical encounters: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Patient-mediated knowledge translation (PKT) interventions engage patients in their own health care. Insight on which PKT interventions are effective is lacking. We sought to describe the type and impact of PKT interventions. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of PKT interventions, defined as strategies that inform, educate and engage patients in their own health care. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from 2005 to 2014 for English language studies that evaluated PKT interventions delivered immediately before, during or upon conclusion of clinical encounters to individual patients with arthritis or cancer. Data were extracted on study characteristics, PKT intervention (theory, content, delivery, duration, personnel, timing) and outcomes. Interventions were characterized by type of patient engagement (inform, activate, collaborate). We performed content analysis and reported summary statistics. RESULTS: Of 694 retrieved studies, 16 were deemed eligible (5 arthritis, 11 cancer; 12 RCTs, 4 cohort studies; 7 low, 3 uncertain, 6 high risk of bias). PKT interventions included print material in 10 studies (brochures, booklets, variety of print material, list of websites), electronic material in 10 studies (video, computer program, website) and counselling in 2 studies. They were offered before, during and after consultation in 4, 1 and 4 studies, respectively; as single or multifaceted interventions in 10 and 6 studies, respectively; and by clinicians, health educators, researchers or volunteers in 4, 3, 5 and 1 study, respectively. Most interventions informed or activated patients. All studies achieved positive impact in one or more measures of patient knowledge, decision-making, communication and behaviour. This was true regardless of condition, PKT intervention, timing, personnel, type of engagement or delivery (single or multifaceted). No studies assessed patient harms, or interventions for providers to support PKT intervention delivery. Two studies evaluated the impact on providers of PKT interventions aimed at patients. CONCLUSIONS: Single interventions involving print material achieved beneficial outcomes as did more complex interventions. Few studies were eligible, and no studies evaluated patient harms, or provider outcomes. Further research is warranted to evaluate these PKT interventions in more patients, or patients with different conditions; different types of PKT interventions for patients and for providers; and potential harms associated with interventions.",Video Meta Results Raw,Gagliardi AR and Légaré F and Brouwers MC and Webster F and Badley E and Straus S,,,0,673
784,Propensity-matched comparison of video-assisted thoracoscopic with thoracotomy lobectomy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"Objective: We evaluated whether video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer could be performed safely and with acceptable long-term outcomes by our improved technique and compared with standard thoracotomy lobectomy in a well-balanced population. Methods: Patients with clinical stage II and III A non-small cell lung cancers who received lobectomy were reviewed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomies were all performed with Wang's technique by the surgeons who had overcome the learning curve and achieved proficiency. By using propensity-matched analysis, perioperative outcomes and long-term survival were compared. Results: Matching based on propensity scores produced 120 patients in each group. Conversion rate to thoracotomy was 11.7%. After thoracoscopic lobectomy, hospital length of stay was shorter compared with thoracotomy (9.2 vs 12 days; P =.014) despite similar rates of postoperative complications (30/ 125 [25%] vs 34/125 [28.3%]; P =.56). Disease-free survival (49.1% vs 42.2%; P =.40) and overall survival (55.0% vs 57.1%; P =.73) at 5 years were similar between groups. Although advanced pathologic stage (hazard ratio [HR], 2.018; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.330-3.062) and no postoperative chemotherapy (HR, 1.880; 95% CI, 1.236-2.858) were independently associated with increased hazard of death in multivariable Cox regression at each time point in follow-up, thoracoscopic lobectomy was not (HR, 1.075; 95% CI, 0.714-1.620; P =.73). Conclusions: With continued experience and optimized technique, video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy can be performed in the majority of cases without compromising perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy.",lung cancer; video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy; locally advanced; THORACIC-SURGERY LOBECTOMY; LONG-TERM SURVIVAL; VATS LOBECTOMY; METAANALYSIS; EXPERIENCE; OUTCOMES; Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Respiratory System; Surgery; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Chen K and Wang X and Yang F and Li J and Jiang G and Liu J and Wang J,,,0,674
785,Gender Effects in Spatial Orientation: Cognitive Profiles and Mental Strategies,"Experimental evidence and meta-analyses offer some support for gender-related differences in visuo-spatial ability. However, few studies addressed this issue in an ecological context and/or in everyday tasks implying spatial abilities, such as geographical orientation. Moreover, the relation of specific strategies and gender is still unclear. In the present investigation, we compared men and women in a newly designed battery of spatial orientation tasks in which landmark, route and survey knowledge were considered. In addition, four visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM) tasks were presented. Significant differences favouring men in VSWM tasks were reported, supporting existing evidence. However, men and women did not significantly differ in orientation tasks performance. The patterns of correlation between working memory and spatial orientation tasks indicated that men and women used somewhat different strategies in carrying out the orientation tasks. In particular, active processes seem to play a greater role in females' performance, thus confirming the importance of this variable in interpreting gender effect in VSWM tasks. Altogether, results indicate that gender effects could well result from differences in cognitive strategies and support data indicating that adequate training could reduce or eliminate them.

The role of providing explanations and listening to others,"Seventy students participated in an experiment to measure the effects of either providing explanations or listening during small group discussions on recall of related subject-matter studied after the discussion. They watched a video of a small group discussing a problem. In the first experimental condition, the video was stopped at various points in time, enabling the participants to verbally respond to the discussion. In the second condition, they listened to the same discussion, without contributing. In the control condition, they listened to a discussion that was not related to the subject-matter subsequently studied. After the discussion, all participants studied a text and answered questions that tested their recall of information from this text. No immediate differences in recall were found. One month later, participants who had actively engaged in explaining remembered more from the text. The conclusion appears justified that actively providing explanations during a discussion positively affects long-term memory.",Video Meta Results Raw,van Blankenstein FM and Dolmans DH and van der Vleuten CP and Schmidt HG,,,0,676
787,Deep learning applied to steganalysis of digital images: A systematic review,"Steganography consists of hiding messages inside some object known as a carrier in order to establish a covert communication channel so that the act of communication itself goes unnoticed by observers who have access to that channel. The steganalysis is dedicated to the detection of hidden messages using steganography; these messages can be implicit in different types of media, such as digital images, video files, audio files or plain text. Traditionally, steganalysis has been divided into two separate stages, the first stage consists of manual extraction of sophisticated features and the second stage is classification using Ensemble Classifiers or Support Vector Machines. In recent years, the development of Deep Learning has made it possible to unify and automate the two traditional stages into an end to end approach with promising results. This paper shows the evolution of steganalysis in recent years using the Deep Learning techniques. The results of these techniques have surpassed those obtained with conventional methods - Rich Models with Ensemble Classifiers - both in the spatial and frequency (JPEG) domains. Since 2014, researchers have used The Convolutional Neural Networks to solve this problem generating diverse architectures and strategies to improve the detection percentages of steganographic images on the last generation algorithms (WOW, S-UNIWARD, HUGO, J-UNIWARD, among others). The Deep Learning, being applied to steganalysis, is now in the process of construction and results so far are encouraging for researchers that are interested in the topic. © 2019 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network; deep learning; steganalysis; steganography; JPEG STEGANALYSIS; STEGANOGRAPHY; MODELS; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications; Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications; Convolution; E-learning; Image enhancement; Neural networks; Conventional methods; Ensemble classifiers; Generation algorithm; Hidden messages; Learning techniques; Systematic Review; Video Meta Results Raw",Tabares-Soto R and Raúl RP and Gustavo I,,,0,677
788,Visuospatial Ability as a Predictor of Novice Performance in Ultrasound- guided Regional Anesthesia,"Background: Visuospatial ability correlates positively with novice performance of simple laparoscopic tasks. The aims of this study were to identify whether visuospatial ability could predict technical performance of an ultrasound-guided needle task by novice operators and to describe how emotional state, intelligence, and fear of failure impact on this. Methods: Sixty medical student volunteers enrolled in this observational study. The authors used an instructional video to standardize training for ultrasound-guided needle advancement in a turkey breast model and assessed volunteers' performance independently by two assessors using composite error score (CES) and global rating scale (GRS). The authors assessed their visuospatial ability with mental rotation test (MRT), group embedded figures test, and Alice Heim group ability test. Emotional state was judged with UWIST Mood Adjective Checklist (UMACL), and fear of failure and general cognitive ability were judged with numerical reasoning test. Results: High CES scores (high error rate) were associated with low MRT scores ( = -0.54; P < 0.001). Better GRS scores were associated with better MRT scores ( = 0.47; P < 0.001). Regarding emotions, GRS scores were low when anxiety levels were high ( = -0.35; P = 0.005) and CES scores (errors) were low when individuals reported feeling vigorous and active ( = -0.30; P = 0.01). Conclusions: An MRT predicts novice performance of an ultrasound-guided needling task on a turkey model and as a trait measure could be used as a tool to focus training resources on less-able individuals. Anxiety adversely affects performance. Therefore, both may prove useful in directing targeted training in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia.",Video Meta Results Raw,Shafqat A and Ferguson E and Thanawala V and Bedforth NM and Hardman JG and McCahon RA,,,0,678
789,Students' perception of technology-assisted learning in undergraduate medical education - A survey,"The use of technology assisted learning (TAL) has widely increased over the last decade. TAL has become a significant part of many universities' curriculum delivery or at least a necessity for both teachers and learners to aid in the learning process. A learner's attitude toward, and acceptance of, training methods are important precursors to the success of any educational method, which in turn may be determined by factors such as individual learning style, type of technological tool available, learner's general perception about using technological assistance, technological complexity for use, etc. Although previous studies have focused on the influence and effectiveness of technology in aiding the teaching-learning process, it is also important to study these factors. Therefore, this study was conducted with the objectives to identify undergraduate medical and health science students' preference for use of various TAL tools, their perception about the effectiveness of technology in aiding the learning process, and to investigate the influence of learning style on students' perception of TAL. This cross-sectional study was conducted as a survey. The survey questions were directed toward identifying students' learning style, and their perception of TAL. Student volunteers were provided with two self-administered questionnaires, the index of learning style (ILS) questionnaire (test-retest correlation coefficient 0.7-0.9) and a pre-tested questionnaire to measure perception of TAL. Majority of students have a strong component of visual learning style, and therefore preferred interactive animations and videos to aid in their learning. They also demonstrated increased acceptance of TAL as measured in terms of their attitude, and perceived knowledge gain. Nevertheless, students' perception of TAL and their learning style existed independent of each other. (C) 2014 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

790,"Does Far Transfer Exist? Negative Evidence From Chess, Music, and Working Memory Training","Chess masters and expert musicians appear to be, on average, more intelligent than the general population. Some researchers have thus claimed that playing chess or learning music enhances children's cognitive abilities and academic attainment. We here present two meta-analyses assessing the effect of chess and music instruction on children's cognitive and academic skills. A third meta-analysis evaluated the effects of working memory training-a cognitive skill correlated with music and chess expertise-on the same variables. The results show small to moderate effects. However, the effect sizes are inversely related to the quality of the experimental design (e.g., presence of active control groups). This pattern of results casts serious doubts on the effectiveness of chess, music, and working memory training. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings; extend the debate to other types of training such as spatial training, brain training, and video games; and conclude that far transfer of learning rarely occurs.","chess; working memory; music; training; transfer; COGNITIVE SKILLS; METAANALYSIS; INTELLIGENCE; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; PLAYERS; ABILITY; DOMAIN; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Sala G and Gobet F,,,0,680
791,The influence of text modality on learning with static and dynamic visualizations,"In this study we investigated the influence of text modality on learning with static and dynamic visualizations in a dynamic domain, namely the physical principles underlying fish locomotion. A 2 x 2-design with type of visualization (static vs. dynamic) and text modality (spoken vs. written) as independent variables was used. Concerning learning outcomes, it was hypothesized that (1) learners presented with dynamic visualizations would outperform learners presented with static visualizations, (2) learners presented with spoken text would outperform learners presented with written text, and (3) an interaction between type of visualization and modality would occur: the superiority of dynamic over static visualizations was expected to be more pronounced for spoken compared to written text. Subjective cognitive load measures were assessed and expected to mirror the aforementioned pattern of learning outcomes in accordance with Cognitive Load Theory (i.e., higher extraneous cognitive load (ECL) related to lower learning outcomes). For transfer tasks, the first two hypotheses could be confirmed. However, there was no interaction. Moreover, ECL was rated higher by subjects when learning with static compared to dynamic visualizations, but there were no differences for ECL with respect to the text modality. The results are discussed within the framework of Cognitive Load Theory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

792,Paradigm change in aggression research: The time has come to retire the General Aggression Model,"As Kuhn (1970) has noted, most scientific fields go through processes of paradigm change, painful periods in which old theories no longer fit available data and are placed by new theories. Such periods typically create strife and debate as ideological differences emerged between proponents of old and new theoretical approaches. In the current paper, we argue that such a period has been reached within the field of aggression research. Over the past half-century, social cognitive and social learning paradigms of aggression, exemplified in the General Aggression Model (GAM) have retained dominance, particularly in areas such as media violence. We contend that data to support the GAM and social cognitive approaches to aggression have never been conclusive, and newer evidence increasingly suggests that the GAM and social cognitive theories of aggression more generally are not adequate to explain aggressive phenomena. We discuss weaknesses and problematic, sometimes hidden assumptions of the GAM and how these reduce the utility of this paradigm. Current evidence suggests that the GAM and the social cognitive paradigm of aggression should be retired, and approaches which focus on diathesis-stress hold greater promise. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

793,Sudden cardiac death in athletes: the Lausanne Recommendations,"OBJECTIVES: This study reports on sudden cardiac death (SCD) in sport in the literature and aims at achieving a generally acceptable preparticipation screening protocol (PPSP) endorsed by the consensus meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). BACKGROUND: The sudden death of athletes under 35 years engaged in competitive sports is a well-known occurrence; the incidence is higher in athletes (approximately 2/100,000 per year) than in non-athletes (2.5 : 1), and the cause is cardiovascular in over 90%. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature identified causes of SCD, sex, age, underlying cardiac disease and the type of sport and PPSP in use. Methods necessary to detect pre-existing cardiac abnormalities are discussed to formulate a PPSP for the Medical Commission of the IOC. RESULTS: SCD occurred in 1101 (1966-2004) reported cases in athletes under 35 years, 50% had congenital anatomical heart disease and cardiomyopathies and 10% had early-onset atherosclerotic heart disease. Forty percent occurred in athletes under 18 years, 33% under 16 years; the female/male ratio was 1/9. SCD was reported in almost all sports; most frequently involved were soccer (30%), basketball (25%) and running (15%). The PPSP were of varying quality and content. The IOC consensus meeting accepted the proposed Lausanne Recommendations based on this research and expert opinions (http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_886.pdf). CONCLUSION: SCD occurs more frequently in young athletes, even those under the age of 18 years, than expected and is predominantly caused by pre-existing congenital cardiac abnormalities. Premature atherosclerotic disease forms another important cause in these young adults. A generally acceptable PPSP has been achieved by the IOC's acceptance of the Lausanne Recommendations.",Video Meta Results Raw,Bille K and Figueiras D and Schamasch P and Kappenberger L and Brenner JI and Meijboom FJ and Meijboom EJ,,,0,683
794,Effects of Gestures on Older Adults' Learning from Video-based Models,"This study investigated whether the positive effects of gestures on learning by decreasing working memory load, found in children and young adults, also apply to older adults, who might especially benefit from gestures given memory deficits associated with aging. Participants learned a problem-solving skill by observing a video-based modeling example, with the human model using gesture cues, with a symbolic cue, or without cues. It was expected that gesture compared with symbolic or no cues (i) improves learning and transfer performance, (ii) more in complex than simple problems, and (iii) especially in older adults. Although older adults' learning outcomes were lower overall than that of children and young adults, the results only revealed a time-on-task advantage of gesture over no cues in the learning phase for the older adults. In conclusion, the present study did not provide strong support for the effectiveness of gestures on learning from video-based modeling example.

Group-based interventions have the potential to increase patient access to highly needed services. The aim of this study was to systematically review the available literature on group-based video teleconference services. Methods The English-language literature was searched using Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and CINAHL for terms related to telehealth, group therapy and support groups. Abstracts were reviewed for relevance based on inclusion criteria. Multiple study types were reviewed, including open-label, qualitative and randomised controlled trial study designs. Data were compiled regarding participants, study intervention and outcomes. Specific areas of interest were the feasibility of and satisfaction with telehealth technology, as well as the effect of video teleconference delivery on group dynamics, including therapeutic alliance. Results Forty published studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Six were randomised controlled trials. Among the studies, there was a broad range of study designs, participants, group interventions and outcome measures. Video teleconference groups were found to be feasible and resulted in similar treatment outcomes to in-person groups. However, few studies were designed to demonstrate noninferiority of video teleconference groups compared with in-person groups. Studies that examined group process factors showed small decreases in therapeutic alliance in the video teleconference participants. Conclusions Video teleconference groups are feasible and produce outcomes similar to in-person treatment, with high participant satisfaction despite technical challenges. Additional research is needed to identify optimal methods of video teleconference group delivery to maximise clinical benefit and treatment outcomes.",Group psychotherapy; group therapy; support groups; telehealth; telemedicine; videoconference; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; COGNITIVE PROCESSING THERAPY; CANCER SUPPORT GROUPS; TELEMENTAL HEALTH; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; GROUP INTERVENTION; FEASIBILITY; VETERANS; VIDEOCONFERENCE; TELEMEDICINE; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Gentry MT and Lapid and Maria and I and Clark MM and Rummans TA,,,0,685
797,Videos to influence: a systematic review of effectiveness of video-based education in modifying health behaviors,"This systematic review examines the effectiveness of videos in modifying health behaviors. We searched PubMed (1975-2012), PsycINFO (1975-2012), EMBASE (1975-2012), and CINAHL (1983-2012) for controlled clinical trials that examined the effectiveness of video interventions in changing health behaviors. Twenty-eight studies comprised of 12,703 subjects were included in the systematic review. Video interventions were variably effective for modifying health behaviors depending on the target behaviors to be influenced. Video interventions appear to be effective in breast self-examination, prostate cancer screening, sunscreen adherence, self-care in patients with heart failure, HIV testing, treatment adherence, and female condom use. However, videos have not shown to be effective in influencing addiction behaviors when they are not tailored. Compared to loss-framing, gain-framed messages may be more effective in promoting certain types of health behavior change. Also, video modeling may facilitate learning of new behaviors and can be an important consideration in future video interventions.",video based education; health behaviors; intervention; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Videotape Recording; Health Behavior; Intervention; Videotapes; Video-Based Interventions; Education; Video Meta Results Raw,Tuong W and Larsen ER and Armstrong AW,,,0,686
798,Mismatch Negativity is a Sensitive and Predictive Biomarker of Perceptual Learning During Auditory Cognitive Training in Schizophrenia,"Computerized cognitive training is gaining empirical support for use in the treatment of schizophrenia (SZ). Although cognitive training is efficacious for SZ at a group level when delivered in sufficiently intensive doses (eg, 30-50 h), there is variability in individual patient response. The identification of biomarkers sensitive to the neural systems engaged by cognitive training interventions early in the course of treatment could facilitate personalized assignment to treatment. This proof-of-concept study was conducted to determine whether mismatch negativity (MMN), an event-related potential index of auditory sensory discrimination associated with cognitive and psychosocial functioning, would predict gains in auditory perceptual learning and exhibit malleability after initial exposure to the early stages of auditory cognitive training in SZ. MMN was assessed in N = 28 SZ patients immediately before and after completing 1 h of a speeded time-order judgment task of two successive frequency-modulated sweeps (Posit Science 'Sound Sweeps' exercise). All SZ patients exhibited the expected improvements in auditory perceptual learning over the 1 h training period (p<0.001), consistent with previous results. Larger MMN amplitudes recorded both before and after the training exercises were associated with greater gains in auditory perceptual learning (r=-0.5 and r=-0.67, respectively, p's<0.01). Significant pretraining vs posttraining MMN amplitude reduction was also observed (p<0.02). MMN is a sensitive index of the neural systems engaged in a single session of auditory cognitive training in SZ. These findings encourage future trials of MMN as a biomarker for individual assignment, prediction, and/or monitoring of patient response to procognitive interventions, including auditory cognitive training in SZ.",ENHANCEMENT THERAPY; SYSTEM PLASTICITY; OLDER-ADULTS; PSYCHOSIS; DEFICITS; MEMORY; P3A; METAANALYSIS; METHODOLOGY; REMEDIATION; Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry; Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Perez VB and Tarasenko M and Miyakoshi M and Pianka ST and Makeig SD and Braff DL and Swerdlow NR and Light GA,,,0,687
799,Gender-Role Differences in Spatial Ability: A Meta-Analytic Review,"Although gender-related differences in highly gender typed cognitive abilities are of considerable interest to educators and cognitive researchers alike, relatively little progress has been made in understanding the psychological processes that lead to them. Nash (1979) proposed a gender-role mediation hypothesis for such differences, with particular emphasis on spatial ability. However, changes in gender equality and gender stereotypes in the decades since merit a re-examination of whether a gender-role association still holds (Feingold 1988). A meta-analysis of 12 studies that examined gender-role identity and mental rotation performance was conducted. These included studies from the United Kingdom, Canada, Poland, Croatia, and the United States of America. The mean effect size for masculinity was r = .30 for men and r = .23 for women; no association was found between femininity and mental rotation. This effect size was slightly larger than that found previously by Signorella and Jamison (1986), and exceeds many other factors known to influence spatial ability. The implications of gender-role mediation of gender differences are discussed and future research directions are identified.

801,Determining the impact of pre-lecture educational video on comprehension of a difficult gross anatomy lecture,"Objective: Students commonly perceive gross anatomy lectures as difficult because they contain complex information that requires three-dimensional visualisation in order to be understood. Without prior preparation, a gross anatomy topic expounded via lecture can be cognitively challenging. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the impact of a pre-lecture activity in the form of viewing a video on students' lecture comprehension. Method: A quasi-experimental study was conducted using 254 first-year medical students with no prior exposure to the lecture topic during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 academic sessions. The students from each batch were divided into two groups and exposed to different video material. Group A watched an action movie, while Group B watched an educational video related to the lecture topic. After 15 min, both groups attended a lecture on the gross anatomy of the heart, which was delivered by a qualified anatomist. At the end of the lecture, their understanding of the material was measured through a post-lecture test using ten vetted multiple choice true/false questions. Results: Group B's test scores were found to be significantly higher than Group A's (p > 0.001, t-stats [df] = -4.21 [252]). Conclusion: This study concluded that the pre-lecture activity had successfully provided the students with some prior knowledge of the subject before they attended the lecture sessions. This finding was aligned with cognitive load theory, which describes a reduction in learners' cognitive load when prior knowledge is stimulated.","Cognitive load; Gross anatomy lecture; Pre-lecture activity; Prior knowledge; Video-viewing activity; COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY; ONLINE; KNOWLEDGE; METAANALYSIS; STRATEGIES; LEARNER; SCIENCE; QUIZZES; YOUTUBE; DESIGN; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Hadie SN and Simok AA and Shamsuddin SA and Mohammad JA,,,0,690

Design and methods: Ninety-one dementia caregivers were given the choice of being involved in either an Internet-based chat support group or an Internet-based video conferencing support group. Pre-post outcome measures focused on distress, health status, social support, and service utilization. Results: In contrast to the Chat Group, the Video Group showed significantly greater improvement in mental health status. Also, for the Video Group, improvements in self-efficacy, neuroticism, and social support were associated with lower stress response to coping with the care recipient's cognitive impairment and decline in function. Implications: The results show that, of 2 Internet-based intervention programs for dementia caregivers, the video conferencing intervention program was more effective in improving mental health status and improvement in personal characteristics were associated with lower caregiver stress response.",Video Meta Results Raw,Marziali E and Garcia LJ,,,0,691
804,Effects of pretraining and water temperature on female rats' performance in the Morris water maze,"The water maze is a complex spatial task that requires the coordination of multiple systems to perform efficiently. Various factors have been shown to influence performance in this task, including motivational state and prior experience. Although a consistent sex difference has been observed in acquiring the water maze in rats, the contribution of the various factors in female rat performance has not been fully assessed. Therefore, the current study tested the effects of motivation as manipulated by water temperature of the maze and prior experience in the maze on the performance of female rats. It was hypothesized that females pretrained in the maze would perform better than those without exposure to the water maze, regardless of water temperature, but in naive rats, colder water would improve performance as shown previously in male rats. For pretraining, female rats were taught to find a visible platform in cold (19 degrees C, 4 trials on one day) and warm (25 degrees C, 4 trials on one day) water before acquisition trials, with the order of the water temperature randomly assigned. Control rats were not given any training and were naive to the water maze procedure. Pretrained and control rats were then tested to locate a hidden platform in either cold or warm water for 5 consecutive days. Overall, pretraining had a significant effect on distance, latency, and directness of path to the platform. Water temperature did not show a significant effect on any measure or a significant interaction with pretraining. Thus, while our hypothesis that pretraining would improve performance was supported, the results did not support the prediction that water temperature would also significantly influence performance. These results show that non-spatial pretraining can critically improve the performance of females in acquiring a place strategy for the hidden platform, irrespective of water temperature.

806,Efficacy and experiences of telephone counselling for informal carers of people with dementia,"BACKGROUND: Informal carers of people with dementia can suffer from depressive symptoms, emotional distress and other physiological, social and financial consequences. OBJECTIVES: This review focuses on three main objectives:To:1) produce a quantitative review of the efficacy of telephone counselling for informal carers of people with dementia;2) synthesize qualitative studies to explore carers' experiences of receiving telephone counselling and counsellors' experiences of conducting telephone counselling; and3) integrate 1) and 2) to identify aspects of the intervention that are valued and work well, and those interventional components that should be improved or redesigned. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, Web of Science, DIMDI databases, Springer database, Science direct and trial registers were searched on 3 May 2011 and updated on 25 February 2013. A Forward Citation search was conducted for included studies in Web of Science and Google Scholar. We used the Related Articles service of PubMed for included studies, contacted experts and hand-searched abstracts of five congresses. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cross-over trials that compared telephone counselling for informal carers of people with dementia against no treatment, usual care or friendly calls for chatting were included evaluation of efficacy. Qualitative studies with qualitative methods of data collection and analysis were also included to address experiences with telephone counselling. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened articles for inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed the quantitative trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the qualitative studies with the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool. The authors conducted meta-analyses, but reported some results in narrative form due to clinical heterogeneity. The authors synthesised the qualitative data and integrated quantitative RCT data with the qualitative data. MAIN RESULTS: Nine RCTs and two qualitative studies were included. Six studies investigated telephone counselling without additional intervention, one study combined telephone counselling with video sessions, and two studies combined it with video sessions and a workbook. All quantitative studies had a high risk of bias in terms of blinding of participants and outcome assessment. Most studies provided no information about random sequence generation and allocation concealment. The quality of the qualitative studies ('thin descriptions') was assessed as moderate. Meta-analyses indicated a reduction of depressive symptoms for telephone counselling without additional intervention (three trials, 163 participants: standardised mean different (SMD) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.63, P value 0.04; moderate quality evidence). The estimated effects on other outcomes (burden, distress, anxiety, quality of life, self-efficacy, satisfaction and social support) were uncertain and differences could not be excluded (burden: four trials, 165 participants: SMD 0.45, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.90, P value 0.05; moderate quality evidence; support: two trials, 67 participants: SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.73, P value 0.32; low quality evidence). None of the quantitative studies included reported adverse effects or harm due to telephone counselling. Three analytical themes (barriers and facilitators for successful implementation of telephone counselling, counsellor's emotional attitude and content of telephone counselling) and 16 descriptive themes that present the carers' needs for telephone counselling were identified in the thematic synthesis. Integration of quantitative and qualitative data shows potential for improvement. For example, no RCT reported that the counsellor provided 24-hour availability or that there was debriefing of the counsellor. Also, the qualitative studies covered a limited range of ways of performing telephone counselling. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that telephone counselling can reduce depressive symptoms for carers of people with dementia and that telephone counselling meets important needs of the carer. This result needs to be confirmed in future studies that evaluate efficacy through robust RCTs and the experience aspect through qualitative studies with rich data.",Video Meta Results Raw,Lins S and Hayder-Beichel D and Rücker G and Motschall E and Antes G and Meyer G and Langer G,,,0,694
807,Cognitive style and gender differences in children's mathematics achievement,"Males are often found to outperform females in tests of mathematics achievement and it has been proposed that this may in part be explained by differences in cognitive style. This study investigated the relation between Wholistic-Analytic and Verbal-Imagery cognitive style, gender and mathematics achievement in a sample of 190 Australian primary school students aged between 8-11years (M=9.77, SD=1.05). It was hypothesised that males would outperform females in mathematics achievement tests, and that gender would interact with cognitive style on mathematics performance. A significant gender/cognitive style interaction was found. Boys with an Analytic/Imagery style achieved significantly higher results than the girls with an Analytic/Imagery style, supporting the contention that certain cognitive styles affect boys and girls mathematics performance differently. Implications of results and strategies for improving mathematics achievement among girls are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Arnup JL and Murrihy C and Roodenburg J and McLean LA,,,0,695
809,Measuring In-Hospital Recovery After Colorectal Surgery Within a Well-Established Enhanced Recovery Pathway: A Comparison Between Hospital Length of Stay and Time to Readiness for Discharge,"BACKGROUND: Hospital length of stay is often used as a measure of in-hospital recovery but may be confounded by organizational factors. Time to readiness for discharge may provide a superior index of recovery. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to contribute evidence for the construct validity of time to readiness for discharge and length of stay as measures of in-hospital recovery after colorectal surgery in the context of a well-established enhanced recovery pathway. DESIGN: This was an observational validation study designed according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a university-affiliated tertiary hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 100 consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal resection (mean age = 65 y; 57% men; 81% laparoscopic) who participated in a randomized controlled trial were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We tested a priori hypotheses that length of stay and time-to-readiness for discharge are longer in patients undergoing open surgery, with lower physical status, with severe comorbidities, with postoperative complications, undergoing rectal surgery, who are older (75 y), who have a new stoma, and who have inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Median time-to-readiness for discharge and length of stay were both 3 days. For both measures, 6 of 8 construct validity hypotheses were supported (hypotheses 1 and 4-8). LIMITATIONS: The use of secondary data from a randomized controlled trial (risk of selection bias) was a limitation. Results may not be generalizable to institutions where patient care is not equally structured. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes evidence to the construct validity of time-to-readiness for discharge and length of stay as measures of in-hospital recovery within enhanced recovery pathways. Our findings suggest that length of stay can be a less resource-intensive and equally construct-valid index of in-hospital recovery compared with time-to-readiness for discharge. Enhanced recovery pathways may decrease process-of-care variances that impact length of stay, allowing more timely discharge once discharge criteria are achieved.

810,Does the Modality Principle Hold for Different Media?: A Test of the Method-Affects-Learning Hypothesis,"Does the modality of instructional messages affect learning? How does it affect different media? In this paper, I offer an answer to these questions by first proposing a theoretical framework from which effective instructional methods can be derived. Then, I report a set of studies where one method, the modality principle, was tested across different media and found to produce significant learning benefits. Based on the findings and those of a recent meta-analysis of modality effects, I suggest future research directions to examine method and media contributions to learning.

813,Prism adaptation first among equals in alleviating left neglect: A review,"Purpose: The current paper was designed to provide a critical overview on the different methods proposed for the rehabilitation of left spatial neglect. Methods: On the basis of a previous systematic review of the literature, we analyzed all articles available aiming at reducing left spatial neglect which included a long term functional assessment. Results: The aim of most early rehabilitation approaches, such as visuo-scanning training, was to re-orient visual scanning toward the neglected side. This review confirmed the utility of this method for rehabilitation purposes. More recent-theory driven-procedures, also based on a training approach, include limb activation, mental imagery training and video-feedback training. Although there is ground for optimism, the functional effectiveness of these methods still relies on few single-case studies. Newer methods have tried to stimulate automatic orientation of gaze or attention towards neglected space in a bottom-up fashion. Sensory stimulations can remove most of the classical signs of left neglect but their effects are short-lived. Such stimulations are not functionally relevant for rehabilitation except for trunk rotation or repeated neck muscle vibrations if they are associated with an extensive training program. A more promising intervention is prism adaptation given the growing evidence of relatively long-term functional gains from comparatively short term usage. Conclusion; Overall, there is now evidence for several clinically relevant long-term benefits in the case of visual scanning training, mental imagery training, video feedback training, neck muscle vibration and trunk rotation if associated with visual scanning training and prism adaptation. However, the amount of evidence is still limited to a small number of relevant published articles and it is mandatory to continue the research in this field. In this review, the possible routes for new rehabilitation procedures are discussed on the basis of the actual knowledge regarding the neuro-cognitive mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of prism adaptation.

814,Emotional Intelligence and School-Based Bullying Prevention and Intervention,"Bullying among all students continues to be a concern for students, parents, and educators, with harmful detrimental academic and psychological effects. With legislation mandating that schools address the phenomenon, school officials are faced with the decision of selecting a program that meets the unique needs for its students and teachers, while maximizing its potential to reduce bullying. School-based prevention and intervention efforts to reduce bullying are often predicated on theories that assume that bullying involvement stems from an interaction among individual characteristics of youth, parental factors, peer influences, school environment, and societal influences. In this chapter, we discuss the definition and prevalence of bullying and explore the different individual and contextual influences on bullying involvement according to the social-ecological model of bullying. Many of these influences are connected to the concepts of emotional intelligence (EI) and social-emotional learning (SEL). We review a number of school-based prevention programs that align with the constructs of EI and SEL and provide opportunities for youth to learn social-emotional skills that are associated with decreases in bullying and other forms of aggression. Successful elements of these programs include use of multimedia, classroom rules, teacher training, psycho-educational information for parents, and cooperative group work. These programs are evaluated in terms of effectiveness for bullying prevention and how they are consistent with EI and SEL approaches. Considerations for schools when selecting a program are discussed.","RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PEER VICTIMIZATION; SOCIAL COMPETENCE; YOUTH VIOLENCE; AGGRESSION; PROGRAM; ADOLESCENTS; STUDENTS; RISK; METAANALYSIS; Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Educational; Education & Educational Research; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Espelage DL and King MT and Colbert CL,,,0,699

816,Risk Factors for Cognitive Impairment after Ischemic Stroke,"A fall can be defined as 'an event that results in a person coming to rest inadvertently on the ground or floor or other lower level (Matarese & Ivziku, 2016). Falls can be caused by many factors. Millions of patient falls in hospitals are recorded (Lynn et al., 2014). Patient falls impact either the patients or the hospitals. It is a challenge for healthcare organization to reduce negative impact of patient falls. This article aims to describe tools used by hospitals to prevent patient falls, by reviewing systematically the literatures found in ProQuest and SCOPUS database. This systematic review refers to the protocol of PRISMA. Literatures were gathered from 'ProQuest' and 'SCOPUS' electronic databases. Prevention of patient falls can, generally, be divided in two main sections; while the first section is early detection, the second is interventions (Smith et al., 2016). The early detection of patient falls is further divided into two sections, fall-risk screening and fall-risk assessment (Matarese Er Ivziku, 2016). Various screening tools have been developed to identify patients at risk of falls in hospitals. The following falls risk-screening tools are frequently used: the St Thomas risk assessment tool in falling elderly inpatients (STRATIFY); the Conley scale; the Morse Fall scale; the Falls Risk Assessment Tool (FRAT); and the NPSA scale (Matarese & Ivziku, 2016). There are several paediatric screening tools, such as General Risk Assessment for Paediatric Inpatient Falls (Graf-PIF), CHAMPS, Cummings scale, Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) scale, and the Humpty Dumpty Fall Scale (Murray et al., 2016). The NICE guideline recommends including the following factors in the hospital's multifactorial falls risk-assessment tool: cognitive and visual impairment, continence problems, a history of falls, mobility problems, medications, balance and postural problems, health problems, and syncope syndrome (Matarese Er Ivziku, 2016). In addition to screening and assessment tools, there are many intervention tools used by hospitals to prevent patient falls, such as using remote video monitoring in hospitals for reducing falls (Votruba et al., 2016), using certain footwears, and using fall-reduction projects, consider measuring effect on nursing staff time, staffing ratios on budget, or changes in patient mobility as a result of the initiative (Cumbler et al., 2013). Falls are unintended accidents to the patients in hospital that happen frequently. It is a challenge for healthcare organizations to reduce negative impacts of patient falls.

817,Stereotype manipulation effects on math and spatial test performance: A meta-analysis,"A meta-analysis of 224 effect sizes (d) drawn from 86 studies examined the relationship between gender, stereotype manipulations, and math and spatial performance. Stereotype manipulations were analyzed separately as a function of gender (threat to males, threat to females, lift for males, lift for females). Only the threat to females grouping (d = 0.29) showed a mean effect size that was significantly different from zero, indicating significant deleterious effects of stereotype threat instructions. Analyses for the threat to females and lift for females categories in an attempt to account for significant variability in these groupings showed that task, sex of experimenter, and control group type accounted for significant variance in effect sizes. Essentially, the effects of stereotype threat on women can be interpreted as relatively small but significant in math performance, but non-significant in spatial performance. Implications for interpretations of gender differences in math and spatial performance are discussed.

818,TOWARDS A PEDAGOGY FOR USING DIGITAL 3-D CONTENT IN SCIENCE EDUCATION,"Spatial thinking skills are strongly correlated to success and achievement in science disciplines. Therefore it may be possible to improve learning in science by improving spatial skills. However, most interventions to improve spatial skills are discipline-general and not directly connected to domain-specific science content. This potentially limits the practical use of spatial training activities since science teachers are mainly concerned about communicating science content in the classroom. The goal of this work was to design learning activities that simultaneously teach both spatial skills and science content. The learning activities are scaffolded by the use of 3-D computer software. The pedagogical design is based on constructivist learning and assumes active engagement of a learner is necessary for the acquisition of meaningful knowledge. As a result, three learning activities involving interactive 3-D computer software (Identify, Organize, and Measure) are proposed as ways to support integrated learning of science and spatial skills. Examples in the context of a domain-specific science topic are provided to demonstrate these activities.",Video Meta Results Raw,Siiman LA and Pedaste M,,,0,703

820,Use of Learning Analytics Data in Health Care-Related Educational Disciplines: Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: While the application of learning analytics in tertiary education has received increasing attention in recent years, a much smaller number have explored its use in health care-related educational studies. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to examine the use of e-learning analytics data in health care studies with regards to how the analytics is reported and if there is a relationship between e-learning analytics and learning outcomes. METHODS: We performed comprehensive searches of papers from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and ERIC) to identify relevant papers. Qualitative studies were excluded from this review. Papers were screened by 2 independent reviewers. We selected qualified studies for further investigation. RESULTS: A total of 537 papers were screened, and 19 papers were identified. With regards to analytics undertaken, 11 studies reported the number of connections and time spent on e-learning. Learning outcome measures were defined by summative final assessment marks or grades. In addition, significant statistical results of the relationships between e-learning usage and learning outcomes were reported in 12 of the identified papers. In general, students who engaged more in e-learning resources would get better academic attainments. However, 2 papers reported otherwise with better performing students consuming less e-learning videos. A total of 14 papers utilized satisfaction questionnaires for students, and all were positive in their attitude toward e-learning. Furthermore, 6 of 19 papers reported descriptive statistics only, with no statistical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The nature of e-learning activities reported in this review was varied and not detailed well. In addition, there appeared to be inadequate reporting of learning analytics data observed in over half of the selected papers with regards to definitions and lack of detailed information of what the analytic was recording. Although learning analytics data capture is popular, a lack of detail is apparent with regards to the capturing of meaningful and comparable data. In particular, most analytics record access to a management system or particular e-learning materials, which may not necessarily detail meaningful learning time or interaction. Hence, learning analytics data should be designed to record the time spent on learning and focus on key learning activities.

823,Advanced training in laparoscopic abdominal surgery: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Simulation has spread widely this last decade, especially in laparoscopic surgery, and training out of the operating room has proven its positive impact on basic skills during real laparoscopic procedures. Few articles dealing with advanced training in laparoscopic abdominal surgery, however, have been published. Such training may decrease learning curves in the operating room for junior surgeons with limited access to complex laparoscopic procedures as a primary operator. METHODS: Two reviewers, using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library conducted a systematic research with combinations of the following keywords: (teaching OR education OR computer simulation) AND laparoscopy AND (gastric OR stomach OR colorectal OR colon OR rectum OR small bowel OR liver OR spleen OR pancreas OR advanced surgery OR advanced procedure OR complex procedure). Additional studies were searched in the reference lists of all included articles. RESULTS: Fifty-four original studies were retrieved. Their level of evidence was low: most of the studies were case series and one fifth were purely descriptive, but there were eight randomized trials. Pig models and video trainers as well as gastric and colorectal procedures were mainly assessed. The retrieved studies showed some encouraging trends in terms of trainee satisfaction with improvement after training, but the improvements were mainly on the training tool itself. Some tools have been proven to be construct-valid. CONCLUSION: Higher-quality studies are required to appraise educational value in this field.",Video Meta Results Raw,Beyer-Berjot L and Palter V and Grantcharov T and Aggarwal R,,,0,707
825,Heidelberg interaction training for language promotion in early childhood settings (HIT),"Beside parents, teachers in early childhood education and care have the greatest potential to foster language acquisition in children. This is especially important for children with language delays, language disorders or bi-/multilingual children. However, they present teachers with a particular challenge in language support. Therefore, integrated language facilitation programmes are needed to promote language acquisition in the daily routine of daycare facilities and kindergartens. In this article, the Heidelberg Interaction Training for Language Promotion in Early Childhood Settings (HIT) is presented as a systematic approach to improve daily interactions between preschool teachers and children. This group training comprises six half-day sessions over a period of six months. The objective is to expand teachers’ knowledge about language development in general and more specifically regarding children with language problems or bi-/multilingual children. Furthermore, teachers learn a responsive interaction style and various strategies of language modelling by means of video supervision and feedback. Teachers’ satisfaction with the training has been evaluated and its efficacy in terms of changes in their behaviour and children's language performance has been proven in several intervention studies and meta-analytic reviews. Lastly, implementation considerations for lasting effects following the HIT are discussed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Early Childhood Education; Intervention; Multilingualism; Teacher Behavior; Child Care Centers; Behavior Change; Kindergarten; Second Language Learning; Program Descriptions; Preschool Teachers; Faculty Development; Teacher Student Relationship; Knowledge Base for Teaching; Child Language; Language Acquisition; Video Technology; Language Impairments; Child Development; Bilingualism; Program Effectiveness; Video Meta Results Raw",Buschmann A and Sachse S,,,0,708
827,Using Insights from Video Games to Support Formal Education - A Conceptual Exploration,"This article draws upon findings from research on the effects of gaming, educational psychology, teacher professionalism as well as school improvement, to develop a framework for linking video game activities to formal education. This framework uses video game achievements - virtual trophies received for completing tasks or mastering challenges as a proxy indicator for the development of competencies relevant to formal education. We suggest that this knowledge can be harnessed to improve teaching and learning, in particular teacher perceptions, teaching skills, and, ultimately, measurable changes in students' learning. Showing teachers what students can actually do and are already doing (in video games) could help them better understand areas of strength and interest of their students.",video games; video game achievements; asset-based orientation; schools in challenging circumstances; professional development; COGNITIVE-ABILITIES; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR; SERIOUS GAMES; METAANALYSIS; VIOLENT; INTELLIGENCE; PERFORMANCE; OUTCOMES; GAMIFICATION; AGGRESSION; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Tulowitzki P and Bremm N and Brown C and Krammer G,,,0,709
828,Integration of good practices of active methodologies with the reuse of student-generated content,"In this article, we present an integrated instructive methodological approach. We begin with a set of proposals for educational innovation oriented towards active learning that have been tested separately and implemented for various subjects in courses of different levels. The approach integrates the following elements: (1) the dynamic generation of digital content by students and their integration into shared knowledge bases of the subjects involved; (2) the systematic use of quality content, mainly in video format, distributed through online platforms as support for flipped classrooms; (3) peer evaluation to support the development of reflective and self-critical capacities; and (4) systematic collaboration with students and professors from other universities to develop the enumerated activities. The methodology has been tested in a variety of subjects, thanks to its flexibility. In all experienced cases, it has been shown that it is feasible for students to generate enough valuable and reusable content. In addition, students have expressed high levels of satisfaction with the implementation of the proposal.",Learning active methodologies; Student-generated content; Student-generated video; Peer review; Peer assessment; METAANALYSIS COMPARING PEER; HIGHER-EDUCATION; FLIPPED CLASSROOM; SELF; PEDAGOGY; WIKI; CONSISTENCY; DIFFERENCE; VIDEOS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Arruabarrena R and Sanchez A and Blanco JM and Vadillo JA and Usandizaga I,,,0,710
829,"Video games do indeed influence children and adolescents’ aggression, prosocial behavior, and academic performance: A clearer reading of Ferguson (2015)","Psychological scientists have long sought to determine the relative impact of environmental influences over development and behavior in comparison with the impact of personal, dispositional, or genetic influences. This has included significant interest in the role played by media in children’s development with a good deal of emphasis on how violent media spark and shape aggressive behavior in children and adolescents. Despite a variety of methodological weaknesses in his meta-analysis, Ferguson (2015, this issue) presents evidence to support the positive association between violent media consumption and a number of poor developmental outcomes. In this Commentary we discuss this meta-analytic work and how it fits into a broader understanding of human development.

830,The GestureTek virtual reality system in rehabilitation: a scoping review,"Purpose: To identify, to map out and to appraise research examining GestureTek virtual reality (VR) use for physical and cognitive rehabilitation and to highlight areas for future research. Method: Scoping review methodology was used to systematically and comprehensively search the academic and grey literature for GestureTek-specific research. Consensus was achieved following two reviewers' independent inclusion screening, data extraction and appraisal. Results: Forty-four studies evaluated the utility and efficacy of the IREX, GX, VMall and Meal Maker software for rehabilitation across a range of populations, with few adverse events reported. Stroke and cerebral palsy research dominated, while geriatrics was largely overlooked. Efficacy research provided support for balance, mobility, upper extremity, cognitive, fitness and daily living skills outcomes for specific populations with effect sizes ranging from 0.19 to 3.34. Nevertheless, few strong quality or high-level studies are available, and no clear guidelines on optimal treatment characteristics exist. Outcomes of primary interest were at ICF body function and activity levels; evaluation of transfer of training across ICF levels is needed. Conclusions: This literature provides preliminary evidence for the technology's efficacy for rehabilitation. Identified research gaps relate to study quality and design, treatment characteristics, populations and outcomes of interest, including transfer across ICF levels.",Video Meta Results Raw,Glegg SM and Tatla SK and Holsti L,,,0,712

This beneficial effect of having a male sibling on spatial ability could be due to in-uterine transmission of testosterone from males to females (the Twin Testosterone Transfer hypothesis, fro. The present study explored sex differences and the ITT in non-verbal and verbal abilities in a large sample of twins assessed longitudinally at 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 16 years of age. Females scored significantly higher than males on both verbal and non-verbal abilities at ages 2, 3 and 4. Males scored significantly higher than females on verbal ability at ages 10 and 12. The effect sizes of all differences were very small. No sex differences in nonverbal or verbal abilities were found at 7, 9, 14 and 16 years of age. No support for the TTT was found at any age. The findings indicate that the twin testosterone transfer effect occurs only for specific cognitive abilities, such as mental rotation.","Sex differences; Twins; Testosterone transmission hypothesis; Non-verbal abilities; Verbal abilities; MENTAL ROTATION PERFORMANCE; CONGENITAL ADRENAL-HYPERPLASIA; SPATIAL ABILITY; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; COGNITIVE-ABILITIES; META-ANALYSIS; SHORT-TERM; TESTOSTERONE; METAANALYSIS; SCIENCE; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Toivainen T and Papageorgiou KA and Tosto MG and Kovas Y,,,0,713
832,Effects of telehealth by allied health professionals and nurses in rural and remote areas: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To describe telehealth interventions delivered by allied health professionals and nurses in rural and remote areas, and to compare the effects of telehealth interventions with standard face-to-face interventions. DATA SOURCES: CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO and PubMed databases were searched. The content of relevant journals and published articles were also searched. STUDY SELECTION: Studies examining the effectiveness of allied health and nursing telehealth interventions for rural and remote populations were included in descriptive analyses. Studies comparing telehealth intervention with standard face-to-face interventions grouped by type of intervention approach were used to examine between-groups effect sizes. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodological quality of studies was rated using the QualSyst critical appraisal tool and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Evidence Hierarchy levels. DATA SYNTHESIS: After quality ratings, 43 studies were included. A majority of studies had strong methodological quality. The disciplines of psychology and nursing were represented most frequently, as were studies using a cognitive intervention approach. Meta-analysis results slightly favoured telehealth interventions compared with face-to-face interventions, but did not show significant differences. Interventions using a combined physical and cognitive approach appeared to be more effective. CONCLUSION: Telehealth services may be as effective as face-to-face interventions, which is encouraging given the potential benefits of telehealth in rural and remote areas with regards to healthcare access and time and cost savings.",telemedicine; video conferencing; delivery of healthcare; treatment outcome; outcome assessment; rural population; rural health; remote consultation; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; PEDIATRIC OBESITY; DIABETES EDUCATION; COLLABORATIVE CARE; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; SERVICE DELIVERY; SEXUAL ASSAULT; CHRONIC PAIN; TELEMEDICINE; Rehabilitation; Sport Sciences; Rehabilitation; Sport Sciences; Video Meta Results Raw,Speyer R and Denman D and Wilkes-Gillan S and Chen YW and Bogaardt H and Kim JH and Heckathorn DE and Cordier R,,,0,714
833,A systematic review of serious games in medical education: quality of evidence and pedagogical strategy,"INTRODUCTION: The literature shows an optimistic landscape for the effectiveness of games in medical education. Nevertheless, games are not considered mainstream material in medical teaching. Two research questions that arise are the following: What pedagogical strategies do developers use when creating games for medical education? And what is the quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of games? METHODS: A systematic review was made by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers following the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. We included peer-reviewed journal articles which described or assessed the use of serious games or gamified apps in medical education. We used the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) to assess the quality of evidence in the use of games. We also evaluated the pedagogical perspectives of such articles. RESULTS: Even though game developers claim that games are useful pedagogical tools, the evidence on their effectiveness is moderate, as assessed by the MERSQI score. Behaviourism and cognitivism continue to be the predominant pedagogical strategies, and games are complementary devices that do not replace traditional medical teaching tools. Medical educators prefer simulations and quizzes focused on knowledge retention and skill development through repetition and do not demand the use of sophisticated games in their classrooms. Moreover, public access to medical games is limited. DISCUSSION: Our aim was to put the pedagogical strategy into dialogue with the evidence on the effectiveness of the use of medical games. This makes sense since the practical use of games depends on the quality of the evidence about their effectiveness. Moreover, recognition of said pedagogical strategy would allow game developers to design more robust games which would greatly contribute to the learning process.",Video games; medical education; evidence-based practice; comparative effectiveness research; review; SURGICAL SKILLS; GAMIFICATION; PHYSIOLOGY; SIMULATOR; TAXONOMY; PROGRAM; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Gorbanev I and Agudelo-Londoño S and González RA and Cortes A and Pomares A and Delgadillo V and Yepes FJ and Muñoz Ó,,,0,715
834,Training teamwork in medicine: An active approach using role play and feedback,"Recent reports in the field of medicine have recommended teamwork training as method of reducing human error. The current study evaluated a teamwork training protocol that used a lecture, several role plays, and guided discussion for feedback. Forty-one medical residents participated in the training on 1 of 2 days (groups) and completed evaluation measures both prior to and immediately following the training program. Means for a situational judgment test (SJT) were higher for post-training scores than pre-training scores. However, mean comparisons with teamwork attitudes and learning goal orientation did not yield significant differences. An item analysis of the SJT responses indicated significant response shifts that corresponded to teamwork behaviors.

835,Digital Learning Game Praxis,"Research into the influential effects of digital games on children's thoughts, affects, and behaviours has become a popular pursuit in academia (Anderson 2013). Initially influenced by media attention surrounding violent video games and their impact (Anderson 2004), research in this area has moved towards potential positive impact such as pro-social behaviour (Gentile 2009). Predating and now paralleling this is the ongoing commercial development of - and academic research into - digital games-based learning. The meeting of these two axis has resulted in the origin of a new focal point for academic enquiry, commercial venture, and educational practice; the development of digital games for children's social and emotional learning (SEL). This paper will provide a contextual overview of current cross-domain games-based SEL praxis. Games-based learning provides multiple, intertwined, points of praxis - development, implementation, and assessment. This cross-domain endeavour requires integration of theoretical research, commercial and education best-practice, and a contextual sensitivity. Progress is hindered by challenges in - and at the intersection of - the academic, educational and commercial domains. Academic discussion regarding the behavioural influence of digital games is increasingly polarised (Ferguson, 2013). National education systems prioritise standard curriculum subjects due to a culture of performance measurement. Subject to commercial pressures games-based learning companies often neglect formative and summative research, relying instead on unsubstantiated sales rhetoric. Intra-domain challenges to games-based SEL are exacerbated by inter-domain tensions, primarily caused by limited cross-contextual awareness. Endeavouring to inform games-based SEL praxis - drawing on the author's cross-domain experience - contextual differences and commonalities will be highlighted. This paper will culminate in a call for the fostering of deeper cross-domain endeavours through embedding researchers.",Video Meta Results Raw,Wilkinson P,,,0,717

Two studies explored theoretically relevant mediators and moderators of the effects of prosocial media on helping. Study 1 examined associations among prosocial- and violent-media use, empathy, and helping in samples from seven countries. Prosocial-media use was positively associated with helping. This effect was mediated by empathy and was similar across cultures. Study 2 explored longitudinal relations among prosocial-video-game use, violent-video-game use, empathy, and helping in a large sample of Singaporean children and adolescents measured three times across 2 years. Path analyses showed significant longitudinal effects of prosocial- and violent-video-game use on prosocial behavior through empathy. Latent-growth-curve modeling for the 2-year period revealed that change in video-game use significantly affected change in helping, and that this relationship was mediated by change in empathy.",Video Meta Results Raw,Prot S and Gentile DA and Anderson CA and Suzuki K and Swing E and Lim KM and Horiuchi Y and Jelic M and Krahe B and Wei Liuqing and Liau AK and Khoo A and Petrescu PD and Sakamoto A and Tajima S and Toma RA and Warburton W and Zhang X and Lam BC,,,0,718
839,How reliable are Functional Movement Screening scores? A systematic review of rater reliability,"BACKGROUND: Several physical assessment protocols to identify intrinsic risk factors for injury aetiology related to movement quality have been described. The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is a standardised, field-expedient test battery intended to assess movement quality and has been used clinically in preparticipation screening and in sports injury research. AIM: To critically appraise and summarise research investigating the reliability of scores obtained using the FMS battery. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. METHODS: Systematic search of Google Scholar, Scopus (including ScienceDirect and PubMed), EBSCO (including Academic Search Complete, AMED, CINAHL, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition), MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus. Studies meeting eligibility criteria were assessed by 2 reviewers for risk of bias using the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies checklist. Overall quality of evidence was determined using van Tulder's levels of evidence approach. RESULTS: 12 studies were appraised. Overall, there was a 'moderate' level of evidence in favour of 'acceptable' (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥0.6) inter-rater and intra-rater reliability for composite scores derived from live scoring. For inter-rater reliability of composite scores derived from video recordings there was 'conflicting' evidence, and 'limited' evidence for intra-rater reliability. For inter-rater reliability based on live scoring of individual subtests there was 'moderate' evidence of 'acceptable' reliability (κ≥0.4) for 4 subtests (Deep Squat, Shoulder Mobility, Active Straight-leg Raise, Trunk Stability Push-up) and 'conflicting' evidence for the remaining 3 (Hurdle Step, In-line Lunge, Rotary Stability). CONCLUSIONS: This review found 'moderate' evidence that raters can achieve acceptable levels of inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of composite FMS scores when using live ratings. Overall, there were few high-quality studies, and the quality of several studies was impacted by poor study reporting particularly in relation to rater blinding.",Injury; Physiotherapy; Prevention; Reliability; Sports medicine; Video Meta Results Raw,Moran RW and Schneiders AG and Major KM and Sullivan SJ,,,0,719
840,The effect of math SAT on women's chemistry competency beliefs,"In chemistry, lack of academic preparation and math ability have been offered as explanations as to why women seem to enroll, perform, and graduate at lower levels than men. In this paper, we explore the alternative possibility that the gender gap in chemistry instead originates from differential gender effects of academic factors on students' motivation. Using a sample of approximately 670 students enrolled in a mid-sized university in the United States we conducted: (1) t-tests to understand incoming academic differences between freshman students by gender, (2) regression analysis to determine which academic and attitudinal factors predict success in General Chemistry 1, and (3) a mediation analysis to understand the underlying mechanisms of how academic performance affects students' beliefs about their competency in chemistry, which in turn has an effect on chemistry achievement. We demonstrate the importance of math ability as a contributor to chemistry achievement, but further that ability differences in math are important because they affect students' chemistry competency beliefs. Critically, this link between ability and competency beliefs is stronger for women than men. These results suggest that interventions geared towards improving women's chemistry competency beliefs could have an important influence in improving their achievement in the classroom, and in consequence reduce the gender gap in chemistry.","SPATIAL ABILITY; STEREOTYPE THREAT; SEX-DIFFERENCES; SELF-EFFICACY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; TEST-PERFORMANCE; META-ANALYSIS; SCIENCE; MATHEMATICS; STUDENTS; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Vincent-Ruz P and Binning K and Schunn CD and Grabowski J,,,0,720
841,Capsule endoscopy in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease,"Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but frequently involves the small and large bowel. Typical presenting symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea. Patients with this disorder may also have extraintestinal manifestations, including arthritis, uveitis, and skin lesions. The PillCam™SB capsule is an ingestible disposable video camera that transmits high quality images of the small intestinal mucosa. This enables the small intestine to be readily accessible to physicians investigating for the presence of small bowel disorders, such as Crohn's disease. Four meta-analyses have demonstrated that capsule endoscopy identifies Crohn's disease when other methods are not helpful. It should be noted that it is the best noninvasive procedure for assessing mucosal status, but is not superior to ileocolonoscopy, which remains the gold standard for assessment of ileocolonic disease. Mucosal healing along the small bowel can only be demonstrated by an endoscopic procedure such as capsule endoscopy. Achievement of long-term mucosal healing has been associated with a trend towards a decreased need for hospitalization and a decreased requirement for corticosteroid treatment in patients with Crohn's disease. Recently, we have developed and validated the Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease Activity Index (also known as the Niv score) for Crohn's disease of the small bowel. The next step is to expand our score to the colon, and to determine the role and benefit of a capsule endoscopy activity score in patients suffering from Crohn's ileocolitis and/or colitis. This scoring system will also serve to improve our understanding of the impact of capsule endoscopy, and therefore treatment, on the immediate outcome of this disorder. As the best procedure available for assessing mucosal status, capsule endoscopy will provide important information about the course and outcome of Crohn's disease.",Capsule Endoscopy Crohn’s Disease Activity Index; Crohn’s disease; Niv score; capsule endoscopy; mucosal healing; Video Meta Results Raw,Niv Y,,,0,721
842,Spatial Contiguity and Spatial Split-Attention Effects in Multimedia Learning Environments: a Meta-Analysis,"Spatial split-attention effects have been noted in the research literature, where, under split-attention conditions, integrating text and diagrams has been shown to be effective. From this literature grew the spatial contiguity principle (or spatial contiguity effect), which states that people learn more when related words and pictures are displayed spatially near one another. Research has shown both effects to influence learning; however, little is known about the conditions in which integrated designs are most effective. This meta-analysis examines the influence of integrated designs across numerous moderator variables in order to improve our understanding of under which conditions integrated designs influence learning. A random effects meta-analysis of 58 independent comparisons (n = 2426) produced an overall effect size of g = 0.63 (p < 0.001). Moderator analyses indicated that integrated designs have benefited learning across many intervention-related and context-related moderator variables. Practical and theoretical implications of the findings are provided.

843,ADHD rehabilitation through video gaming: A systematic review using PRISMA guidelines of the current findings and the associated risk of bias': Corrigendum,"Reports errors in 'ADHD rehabilitation through video gaming: A systematic review using PRISMA guidelines of the current findings and the associated risk of bias' by Thiago Strahler Rivero, Lina Maria Herrera Nuñez, Emmy Uehara Pires and Orlando Francisco Amodeo Bueno (Frontiers in Psychiatry, 2015[Oct][22], Vol 6[151]). Modifications on the original paper are presented for pages 4, 10, and 11. They were made to address the requests of the researchers whose papers were evaluated in the original systematic review. Some corrections refer to mistakes made when data were transferred from tables to text (tables were correct, but some data were mistyped on the text). Other modifications can be classified as more detailed explanations, and they should clarify misunderstandings about the bias analysis or technical video game characteristics. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-19046-001[/rid]). Empirical research studies have highlighted the need to investigate whether video game can be useful as a tool within a neuropsychological rehabilitation program for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients. However, little is known about the possible gains that this kind of video game-based interventions can produce and even if these gains can be transferred to real life abilities. The present paper aims to uncover key information related to the use of video game in ADHD neuropsychological rehabilitation/intervention by focusing on its gains and its capability to transfer/generalize these gains to real life situation via a systematic review of the empirical literature. The PRISMA guidelines were adopted. Internet-based bibliographic searches were conducted via seven major electronic databases (i.e., PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Core Collection BIOSIS Citation Index, MEDLINE, SciELO Citation Index, and PubMed) to access studies examining the association between video game interventions in ADHD patients and behavioral and cognitive outcomes. A total of 14 empirical studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. The studies reported the attention, working memory, and the behavioral aspects as the main target of the intervention. Cognitive and behavioral gains were reported after the video game training (VGT). However, many bias related to the choice of outcome instruments, sampling and blindness of assessors, weaken the results power. Additional researches are important to clarify the effects and stability of the VGT programs, and an important effort should be made to construct better methods to assess improvements on everyday cognitive abilities and real world functioning.

A repeated free recall task involving overt rehearsal and three computer-based adaptive working memory tasks were administered to 54 eight-year-old children. Children without spelling impairments tended to recall more items than did those children with spelling deficits. Video analyses revealed that recall behaviour was similar in impaired and unimpaired children, indicating that both groups applied similar learning activities. Group differences in number of recalled items were attributed to differences in working memory subcapacities between children with and without spelling impairment, especially with regard to central executive and phonological loop functioning.

845,Designing multimedia learning environments using animated pedagogical agents: factors and issues: APAs and learning environments,"Abstract Animated pedagogical agents (APAs) are known to possess great potential in supporting learning because of their ability to simulate a real classroom learning environment. But research in this area has produced mixed results. The reason for this remains puzzling. This paper is written with two purposes: (1) to examine some recent research and organize the findings in terms of classroom characteristics, and (2) to discuss and reveal any uncovered issues pertaining to the findings and provide input whenever possible. A framework formed by using APA characteristics, APA presentation, and learners' characteristics is used to analyse past research findings. The findings from the analysis reveal that because APAs are regarded as social members similar to humans, they are more effective in engaging learners in environments that require social communication and interactions. They therefore produce more definitive results in terms of affective gain and group learning. But such conditions also impose greater demand on designers to create more complex learning environments that can provide interactions with several agents and yet maintain a mode of communication that is pedagogically effective. The challenges for creating such environment include using an agent's gestures to duplicate its speech in instruction, which is usually uncommon in human practice, overcoming the needs to use input?output interface for communication and taking into consideration the possible influence of the learners' characteristics such as their sensory preference. This paper suggests that APAs' application in instruction should be seen in the light of affordances and be designed within its own practical limits.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Performance Factors; Multimedia Instruction; Educational Environment; Design Requirements; Literature Reviews; Animation; Multimedia Materials; Design Preferences; Meta Analysis; Computer System Design; Video Meta Results Raw",Woo HL,,,0,725

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to provide evidence for the short-term efficacy and safety profile of non-intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery under loco-regional anaesthesia for thoracic surgery. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases and Google Scholar, as well as American Society of Clinical Oncology to identify relevant studies comparing non-intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery under loco-regional anaesthesia with conventionally intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia, dated up to 31 August 2015. Data concerning global in-operating room time, hospital stays, rate of postoperative complications and perioperative mortality were extracted and analysed. We conducted a meta-analysis of the overall results and two subgroup analyses based on study design (a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and a second meta-analysis of observational studies). RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials and six observational studies with a total of 1283 patients were included. We found that in the overall analysis, patients treated with non-intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery under loco-regional anaesthesia achieved significantly shorter global in-operating room time [weighted mean difference = -41.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) = (-57.26, -26.67); P < 0.001] and hospital stays [weighted mean difference = -1.24; 95% CI = (-1.46, -1.02); P < 0.001] as well as a lower rate of postoperative complications [relative risk = 0.55; 95% CI = (0.40, 0.74); P < 0.001] than patients treated with intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia. Subgroup meta-analyses based on study design achieved the same outcomes as overall analysis. In our meta-analysis, no perioperative mortality was observed in patients treated with non-intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery under loco-regional anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Non-intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery under loco-regional anaesthesia for thoracic surgery proved to be feasible and safe. Future multicentre and well-designed randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up are needed to confirm and update the findings of our study, as well as the long-term efficacy of non-intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery under loco-regional anaesthesia.",Anaesthesia; Meta-analysis; Non-intubated; Thoracic surgery; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Deng HY and Zhu ZJ and Wang YC and Wang WP and Ni PZ and Chen LQ,,,0,726
849,Sources of information used by patients prior to elective surgery: a scoping review,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the range and nature of available research regarding sources of information that patients access to inform their decisions about elective surgery. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed studies published until February 2019 from the six scientific literature databases were searched and included in the study: Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, EMBASE and SCOPUS. Web searches for grey literature were conducted in Google, South Australia Department of Health, Commonwealth Department of Health (Australia) and My Aged Care from the Department of Social Services (Australia). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies with a focus on elective surgery information sources oriented to patients were eligible for inclusion. Only studies written in English were sought and no publication date or study restrictions were applied. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Included literature was described by National Health and Medical Council hierarchy of evidence, and data were extracted on country and year of publication, type of literature, who provided it and any information on end users. Information sources were categorised by type and how information was presented. RESULTS: A pool of 1039 articles was reduced to 26 after screening for duplicates and non-relevant studies. Face-to-face exchanges were the most likely source of information prior to elective surgery (59.3%), printed information (55.6%) followed by e-learning (51.9%) and multimedia (14.8%). The face-to-face category included information provided by the physician/general practitioners/specialists, and family and friends. Printed information included brochures and pamphlets, e-learning consisted of internet sites or videos and the use of multimedia included different mixed media format. CONCLUSION: There is considerable variability regarding the types of information patients use in their decision to undergo elective surgery. The most common source of health information (face-to-face interaction with medical personnel) raises the question that the information provided could be incomplete and/or biased, and dependent on what their health provider knew or chose to tell them.","health literacy [MeSH]; electivesurgical procedures [MeSH]; review [MeSH]; scoping review; consumer health information [MeSH]; SURGICAL DECISION-MAKING; HEALTH INFORMATION; ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS; FAMILY INVOLVEMENT; COLORECTAL-CANCER; CONSENT PROCESS; INTERNET; EDUCATION; CARE; COMMUNICATION; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Atlas and  Alvin and Milanese S and Grimmer K and Barras S and Stephens JH,,,0,727
850,Pairing attachment theory and social learning theory in video-feedback intervention to promote positive parenting,"Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD) is a social-learning and attachment-based intervention using video feedback to support sensitive parenting and at the same time setting firm limits. Empirical studies and meta-analyses have shown that sensitive parenting is the key determinant to promote secure child-parent attachment relationships and that adequate parental discipline contributes to fewer behavior problems in children. Building on this evidence, VIPP-SD has been tested in various populations of at-risk parents and vulnerable children (in the age range of zero to six years), as well as in the context of child care. In twelve randomized controlled trials including 1116 parents and caregivers, VIPP-SD proved to be effective in promoting sensitive caregiving, while positive social-emotional child outcomes were also found.",pairing attachment theory; social learning theory; positive parenting; attachment based intervention; video-feedback intervention; Attachment Behavior; Intervention; Social Learning; Visual Feedback; Parenting; Attachment Theory; Video Meta Results Raw,Juffer F and Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ and van IJzendoorn MH,,,0,728
852,Recognition of peer emotions in children with ADHD: Evidence from an animated facial expressions task,"A growing body of literature suggests that ADHD is associated with emotion recognition impairments that may be linked to deficient interpersonal functioning. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these recognition impairments is extremely limited. Here, we used dynamic stimuli to investigate whether impaired emotion recognition in children with ADHD may be associated with impairments in perceptual sensitivity. Participants (ADHD: N = 26; Controls: N = 26) viewed video sequences of neutral faces slowly developing into one of the six basic emotional expressions (angry, happy, fearful, sad, disgusted and surprised) and were instructed to indicate via a button press the precise moment at which they were able to correctly recognize the emotional expression. The results showed that compared to controls, children with ADHD exhibited lower accuracy rates across all emotional expressions while there was no evidence for impaired perceptual sensitivity. Thus, the study provides evidence for a generalized categorization impairment across all emotional categories and is consistent with developmental delay accounts of ADHD. Future studies are needed in order to further investigate the developmental course of social cognition deficits in ADHD.",Social cognition; Emotion recognition; Children; ADHD; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; PSYCHIATRIC STATUS; VIOLENT OFFENDERS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SOCIAL COGNITION; BOYS; METAANALYSIS; HETEROGENEITY; INFORMATION; Psychiatry; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Jusyte A and Gulewitsch MD and Schoenenberg M,,,0,729
853,Magnitude of sex differences in spatial abilities: A meta-analysis and consideration of critical variables,"In recent years, the magnitude, consistency, and stability across time of cognitive sex differences have been questioned. The present study examined these issues in the context of spatial abilities. A meta-analysis of 286 effect sizes from a variety of spatial ability measures was conducted. Effect sizes were partitioned by the specific test used and by a number of variables related to the experimental procedure in order to achieve homogeneity. Results showed that sex differences are significant in several tests but that some intertest differences exist. Partial support was found for the notion that the magnitude of sex differences has decreased in recent years. Finally, it was found that the age of emergence of sex differences depends on the test used. Results are discussed with regard to their implications for the study of sex differences in spatial abilities.

854,E-Patient Counseling Trial (E-PACO): Computer Based Education versus Nurse Counseling for Patients to Prepare for Colonoscopy,"Improving patient education focusing on bowel preparation before a colonoscopy leads to cleaner colons. Endoscopy units must obtain informed consent and perform a risk assessment for sedative use prior to a colonoscopy. The current practice in the Netherlands to achieve these goals is nurse counseling in an outpatient setting. This is costly and has disadvantages in terms of uniformity and time consumption for both the patient and the hospital. The hypothesis is that computer-based education with use of video and 3D animations may replace nurse counseling in most cases, without losing quality of bowel cleanliness during colonoscopy. This multicenter, randomized, endoscopist blinded clinical trial evaluates a primary outcome measure (bowel preparation) during colonoscopy. Secondary outcome measures are sickness absence, patient anxiety after instruction and prior to colonoscopy, patient satisfaction and information re-call. The study will be performed in four endoscopy units of different levels (rural, urban, and tertiary). Inclusion criteria are adult age and referral for complete colonoscopy. Exclusion criteria are Dutch illiteracy, audiovisual handicaps or mental disabilities and no (peers with) internet access. This trial aims to establish online computer-based education as tool for patient education prior to a colonoscopy. By choosing a direct comparison with the standard of care (nurse counseling), both endoscopic quality measures and patient related outcome measures can be evaluated.",Cancer Research; Issue 150; Endoscopy; Colonoscopy; e-Health; Patient education; Bowel Preparation; Patient Related Outcome Measures; BOWEL PREPARATION; QUALITY; IMPACT; COST; METAANALYSIS; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw,Veldhuijzen G and van Esch AA and Klemt-Kropp M and Droste JS and Drenth JP,,,0,731
856,Psychoeducational interventions with pediatric cancer patients: Part I. Patient information and knowledge,"Presents a systematic review of published research on psychoeducational interventions for children with cancer. The current lack of an organizational model for this literature makes it difficult to form a coherent picture of the literature and draw nomothetic conclusions. A model is described that is based on functional concepts from the literature on learning and instructional design. It is argued that it makes sense conceptually to analyze psychoeducational interventions in terms of psychoeducational principles, especially if the purpose is to illuminate the learning processes involved. Three categories of intervention are distinguished and the first of these, informational interventions to influence patient knowledge, is considered in this paper, and the other 2 categories will be reviewed in a subsequent paper. This review is organized by categories of information needs, intervention modes, and major types of independent variables. Data supports few generalizable conclusions at this time, except that development of health-related knowledge in children is best accomplished by information transfer methods that are highly interactive and individualized. Interactive multimedia formats such as video games are seen as having the best potential, but further research is required.

858,Marte Meo and Coordination Meetings (MAC): A Systemic School-Based Video Feedback Intervention-A Randomised Controlled Trial,"Children displaying early disruptive behaviour problems (DBP) in school are at risk for severe long-term problems. This study evaluated and compared a systemic school-based intervention, Marte Meo and Coordination meetings (MAC) with service as usual (SAU) in a randomised controlled trial. The teachers' and parents' ratings were collected before and after intervention. Target group were children aged 3-12 years that displayed DBPs in school (N = 99). MAC programme was more effective than SAU in reducing DBPs among school children based on teachers' reports (d(ppc2) .30-.38), whereas the effect was equal according to parents' reports. It is possible to achieve changes in children's DBPs in a school setting. Advantages of MAC might be explained by a clear target for change enhancing children's development in school, but might also be explained by shortcomings in SAU, which seems to generate more services and personnel.",Disruptive behaviour problems; Video feedback; Marte Meo; School-based intervention; Systemic; Randomised controlled trial; MENTAL-HEALTH-SERVICES; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; CONDUCT PROBLEMS; CHILD; BEHAVIOR; PARENT; METAANALYSIS; UPDATE; YOUTH; NEED; Social Work; Social Work; Video Meta Results Raw,Balldin S and Bergstrom M and Wirtberg I and Axberg U,,,0,733
859,The effect of active video games on cognitive functioning in clinical and non-clinical populations: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Physically-active video games ('exergames') have recently gained popularity for leisure and entertainment purposes. Using exergames to combine physical activity and cognitively-demanding tasks may offer a novel strategy to improve cognitive functioning. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to establish effects of exergames on overall cognition and specific cognitive domains in clinical and non-clinical populations. We identified 17 eligible RCTs with cognitive outcome data for 926 participants. Random-effects meta-analyses found exergames significantly improved global cognition (g=0.436, 95% CI=0.18-0.69, p=0.001). Significant effects still existed when excluding waitlist-only controlled studies, and when comparing to physical activity interventions. Furthermore, benefits of exergames where observed for both healthy older adults and clinical populations with conditions associated with neurocognitive impairments (all p<0.05). Domain-specific analyses found exergames improved executive functions, attentional processing and visuospatial skills. The findings present the first meta-analytic evidence for effects of exergames on cognition. Future research must establish which patient/treatment factors influence efficacy of exergames, and explore neurobiological mechanisms of action.",Physical activity; Exercise; Cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's; Parkinson's disease; Dementia; OLDER-ADULTS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; AEROBIC EXERCISE; IMPAIRMENT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERFORMANCE; EXERGAMES; DISEASE; HEALTH; Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Alzheimer’s; Parkinson’s disease; Video Meta Results Raw,Stanmore E and Stubbs B and Vancampfort D and de Bruin ED and Firth J,,,0,734
860,Cueing effect in multimedia learning: A meta-analysis,"Cueing is an important instructional design technique to improve learning performance in multimedia learning. Recently, researchers focus on whether cueing could guide leamers' attention or facilitate learning outcomes. However, there is still no consistent conclusion about cueing effect of guiding attention, organization and integration in multimedia learning. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the effects of cueing on learning performance (e.g. retention and transfer test), attention guiding (e.g. fixation time and fixation count of cued areas), and moderating factors (e.g. physical and spatial-temporal cues, declarative and procedural knowledge, dynamic and static presentation, and subjects of learning materials). We used key words (e.g. cue, cueing, signaling, attention guidance, multimedia learning, animation, eye tracking, eye movement) to search literatures in database and got 43 related empirical studies. Forty-four independent effect sizes (3910 participants) were included in retention tests-related meta-analysis while 41 independent effect sizes (3906 participants) were included in transfer tests-related meta-analysis. Fourteen independent effect sizes (938 participants) were included in fixation-time-related meta-analysis while eleven independent effect sizes (816 participants) were included in fixation-count-related meta-analysis to test the attention-guiding effect of cueing. According to the characteristics of studies about cueing effect, we reasonably chose random-effects model as meta-analysis model. CMA2.0 was used to test the independent effect sizes. Finally, the impact of publication bias was tested to guarantee a more convincing conclusion. The results showed that cueing could significantly improve learning outcomes of retention test (g = 0.53, 95% CI = [0.36, 0.69]) as well as transfer test (g = 0.36, 95% CI = [0.23, 0.49]). At the same time, leamers' fixation time (g = 0.50, 95% CI = [0.30, 0.71]) and fixation count (g = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.43, 0.97]) of cueing areas attracted much more attention than uncued areas. This result supported the attention guiding hypothesis of cueing in multimedia learning. Moderator analyses indicated that cueing effect in learning outcomes was mainly moderated by types of cueing, dynamism of materials, subjects of materials and types of knowledge. Specifically, cueing resulted in higher retention and transfer scores in conditions of static materials and declarative knowledge rather than dynamic materials and procedural knowledge. Compared with the materials in liberal arts, cueing effect in retention test was weaker than that in science or engineering. In addition, spatial-temporal cues performed much better than physical cues in transfer test. However, in regard to attention-guiding, cueing effect was mainly moderated by cueing types itself. Fixation time was longer and fixation count was more in the condition of physical cues than spatial-temporal cues. The observed strong cueing effect suggested that presenting cues rationally can indeed improve leamers' memorization and comprehension of knowledge as well as distribution of attention. Physical and spatial-temporal cues, declarative and procedural knowledge, dynamic and static presentation, and subjects of learning materials may act as important moderate variables in cueing effect in multimedia learning. The meta-analysis of moderator factors supported the boundary hypothesis of multimedia learning principles (Mayer, 2010). Limitations and future research were also discussed in this study.

861,E-learning in orthopedic surgery training: A systematic review,"E-learning is the use of internet-based resources in education. In the field of surgical education, this definition includes the use of virtual patient cases, digital modeling, online tutorials, as well as video recordings of surgical procedures and lectures. In recent years, e-learning has increasingly been considered a viable alternative to traditional teaching within a number of surgical fields. Here we present (1) a systematic review of literature assessing the efficacy of e-learning modules for orthopedic education and (2) a discussion of their relevance. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was conducted according to the guidelines defined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). The search yielded a total of 255 non-duplicate citations that were screened using predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 9 full text articles met inclusion criteria, which included the use of an objective outcome measure to evaluate an orthopedic e-learning module. Six studies assessed knowledge using a multiple-choice test and 4 assessed skills using a clinical exam. All studies showed positive score improvement pre- to post-intervention, and a majority showed greater score improvement than standard teaching methods in both knowledge (4/6 studies) and clinical skills (3/4 studies). E-learning represents an effective supplement or even alternative to standard teaching techniques within orthopedic education for both medical students and residents. Future work should focus on validating specific e-learning programs using standardized outcome measures and assessing long-term knowledge retention using e-learning platforms.",E-learning; Education; Orthopedics; Surgery; Training; Video Meta Results Raw,Tarpada SP and Morris MT and Burton DA,,,0,736
863,Comparing and Validating Methods of Reading Instruction Using Behavioural and Neural Findings in an Artificial Orthography,"There is strong scientific consensus that emphasizing print-to-sound relationships is critical when learning to read alphabetic languages. Nevertheless, reading instruction varies across English-speaking countries, from intensive phonic training to multicuing environments that teach sound-and meaning-based strategies. We sought to understand the behavioral and neural consequences of these differences in relative emphasis. We taught 24 English-speaking adults to read 2 sets of 24 novel words (e.g., /buv/, /sig/), written in 2 different unfamiliar orthographies. Following pretraining on oral vocabulary, participants learned to read the novel words over 8 days. Training in 1 language was biased toward print-to-sound mappings while training in the other language was biased toward print-to-meaning mappings. Results showed striking benefits of print-sound training on reading aloud, generalization, and comprehension of single words. Univariate analyses of fMRI data collected at the end of training showed that print-meaning relative to print-sound relative training increased neural effort in dorsal pathway regions involved in reading aloud. Conversely, activity in ventral pathway brain regions involved in reading comprehension was no different following print-meaning versus print-sound training. Multivariate analyses validated our artificial language approach, showing high similarity between the spatial distribution of fMRI activity during artificial and English word reading. Our results suggest that early literacy education should focus on the systematicities present in print-to-sound relationships in alphabetic languages, rather than teaching meaning-based strategies, in order to enhance both reading aloud and comprehension of written words.","reading acquisition; reading comprehension; phonics; fMRI; artificial language learning; VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; LEXICAL COMPETITION; SEMANTIC DEMENTIA; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; SURFACE DYSLEXIA; RESPONSE-TIME; BRAIN; SYSTEM; ADULTS; METAANALYSIS; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Taylor JS and Davis MH and Rastle K,,,0,737
864,Exploring blended group interventions for depression: Randomised controlled feasibility study of a blended computer- and multimedia-supported psychoeducational group intervention for adults with depressive symptoms,"Background: Blended interventions aim to capitalise on the strengths of both computer-based and face-to-face therapy. Studies on this innovative treatment format remain scare. This especially accounts for the group treatment of depression. Method: The present study applied eclectic psychotherapy methods to an adult sample exhibiting a variety of depressive symptoms (N = 46). Participants were recruited by a newspaper inlet and randomised either to a treatment or a waiting list condition. Computer supported components were multimedia group sessions, e-learning, online videos and worksheets, remote therapist-patient communication and online pre-post-assessment. Results: Large between-group effect sizes on primary outcome depressiveness (CES-D) (F ((1,44)) = 4.88, p = 0.032; d = 0.87) and secondary outcome personal resources (resource scales) (F ((1,44)) = 9.04, p = 0.004; d = 0.73 to F ((1,44)) = 8.82 p = 0.005, d = 1.15) were found in the intention to treat analysis (ANOVA). Subjective evaluation of the intervention revealed high treatment adherence (91%) and high perceived relevance of supportive computer and multimedia components. Participants rated computer and multimedia components comparable to treatment elements such as group interaction or specific cognitive behavioural exercises, and 25% associated the utilisation of those components with treatment success. Depressiveness and age did not predict the utilisation and the appraisal of computer and multimedia components. Discussion: Results provide preliminary support for the acceptability and feasibility of the investigated blended treatment in a group with non-specific depressive symptoms. However, small sample size and lack of diagnostics restrict generalizability. Additional research in clinical settings is needed.","E-mental health; Online treatment; Blended therapy; Group therapy; Blended group therapy; Depression; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; INTERNET-BASED TREATMENT; RISK-FACTOR; PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS; GROUP-PSYCHOTHERAPY; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; ANXIETY DISORDERS; METAANALYSIS; EFFICACY; DISEASE; Psychology, Clinical; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Psychiatry; Psychology; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw",Schuster R and Leitner I and Carlbring P and Laireiter AR,,,0,738
865,"Xbox 360 Kinect Cognitive Games Improve Slowness, Complexity of EEG, and Cognitive Functions in Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Control Trial","Objectives: Physical activity and cognitive training are effective to enhance cognition in older patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games are a combination of physical activity and cognitive training. The objective of this study was to determine the short- and long-term effects of Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games on slowness and complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) and cognitive functions in older subjects with MCI. Materials and Methods: A clinical trial was conducted on 44 MCI subjects. Both males and females were randomized into experimental group (participated in Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games) and control group (range of motion exercises only and no Xbox 360 Kinect cognitive games). Subjects were assessed before and after one session of game intervention for short-term effects and after 6 weeks for long-term effects. The outcome measures were the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA), trail making test (TMT) A and B, and slowness and complexity of EEG. Results: After one session of game intervention, delta (0.7040.025; P=0.013), theta (0.128 +/- 0.009; P=0.00127) waves, and complexity of EEG (0.642 +/- 0.042; P=0.008) significantly improved, in eyes closed state. Whereas after 6 weeks intervention of games, delta (0.673 +/- 0.029; P=0.013), theta (0.129 +/- 0.013; P=0.002), beta2 waves (0.044 +/- 0.009; P=0.046), complexity of EEG (0.051 +/- 0.042; P=0.016), MMSE (26.25 +/- 0.347 vs. 23.722 +/- 0.731; P=0.003), MoCA (25.65 +/- 0.310 vs. 22.00 +/- 0.504; P=0.0001), TMT-A (1.429 +/- 0.234 vs. 2.225 +/- 0.259; P=0.028), and TMT-B (2.393 +/- 0.201 vs. 3.780 +/- 0.195; P=0.0001) improved significantly. These changes were not observed in the control group. Conclusion: Xbox 360 Kinect games showed beneficial effects after short- and long-term intervention on MCI subjects.

867,Relevance of the intervention module \Coping with stress and unhelpful emotions\' for parents living in multi-ethnic deprived neighborhoods',"To achieve optimal satisfaction and impact of interventions in diverse populations, it is important to be sensitive to the needs and stressors of ethnic minority and low-income groups. This study examines the relevance of the intervention module 'Coping with stress and unhelpful emotions'. The module, addressing parenting stress, was integrated in Group Triple P and delivered to parents living in multi-ethnic deprived neighborhoods in the Netherlands. To enable in-depth understanding of parents' and providers' experiences, a multi-informant qualitative methodology was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four providers and fourteen participants, observations were made during the performance of the module, and process evaluation forms were filled in by providers. A thematic analysis was conducted to interpret the results. Three overarching themes were identified: appreciation of sharing experiences, acceptability of the module's content, and the appropriateness of program materials. The module was considered relevant by both participants and providers. Feelings related to homesickness and stress were discussed in detail. Although sharing anecdotes was valued, they took up some of the limited time available for individual behavior practice. Participants were positive about the use of video fragments, whereas providers questioned the appropriateness and the ethnic/religious diversity of the material. These findings support the relevance of the intervention module on 'Coping with stress and unhelpful emotions' for parents living in multi-ethnic deprived neighborhoods. The module might be improved by allowing more time for and variety in behavior practice, including attention for positive emotions, and adjusting program materials for use among parents with, for example, limited language proficiency.",Stress; Parenting; Ethnic minority; Intervention module; Triple P; Relevance; ETHNIC-MINORITY; TRAINING INTERVENTION; ACCULTURATION STRESS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; SOCIAL COMPETENCE; PROGRAM; BEHAVIOR; SUPPORT; MOTHERS; METAANALYSIS; Family Studies; Social Work; Family Studies; Social Work; Video Meta Results Raw,van Mourik K and Crone MR and Reis R,,,0,740
868,Immediate and delayed effects of a modeling example on the application of principles of good feedback practice: a quasi-experimental study,"The learning benefits of peer assessment and providing peer feedback have been widely reported. However, it is still not understood which learning activities most facilitate the acquisition of feedback skills. This study aimed to compare the effect of a modeling example, i.e., a model that demonstrated how to give feedback, on the acquisition of feedback skills. The participants were second-year bachelor students in pedagogical sciences (N=111). They were assigned randomly to a practice condition, in which they practiced giving feedback on oral presentations, or a modeling example condition, in which a teacher demonstrated how to give feedback on a good and a bad presentation. Students then gave feedback to a presenter in a video (direct feedback measure). One week later, they gave each other peer feedback on oral presentations (delayed feedback measure). On the direct feedback measure, students in the modeling example condition used assessment criteria more often in their feedback, and produced significantly more overall feedback, and significantly more positive and negative judgments than students in the practice condition. There was no significant difference in the amount of elaboration and feed-forward between the two conditions. On the delayed feedback measure, there were no significant differences between the two experimental conditions. The results suggest that, at least in the short term, a modeling example can stimulate the use of assessment criteria and judgments in feedback. The results and implications for future research and practice are discussed.","Feedback; Formative assessment; Peer assessment; Peer feedback; Modeling examples; Observational learning; COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY; PEER ASSESSMENT; FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT; HIGHER-EDUCATION; STUDENTS; IMPACT; METAANALYSIS; INSTRUCTION; PERCEPTIONS; PERFORMANCE; Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Educational; Education & Educational Research; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",van Blankenstein FM and Trutescu GO and van der Rijst RM and Saab N,,,0,741

871,Understanding and improving low bystander CPR rates: a systematic review of the literature,"OBJECTIVES: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a crucial yet weak link in the chain of survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We sought to understand the determinants of bystander CPR and the factors associated with successful training. METHODS: For this systematic review, we searched 11 electronic databases, 1 trial registry and 9 scientific websites. We performed hand searches and contacted 6 content experts. We reviewed without restriction all communications pertaining to who should learn CPR, what should be taught, when to repeat training, where to give CPR instructions and why people lack the motivation to learn and perform CPR. We used standardized forms to review papers for inclusion, quality and data extraction. We grouped publications by category and classified recommendations using a standardized classification system that was based on level of evidence. RESULTS: We reviewed 2409 articles and selected 411 for complete evaluation. We included 252 of the 411 papers in this systematic review. Differences in their study design precluded a meta-analysis. We classified 22 recommendations; those with the highest scores were 1) 9-1-1 dispatch- assisted CPR instructions, 2) teaching CPR to family members of cardiac patients, 3) Braslow's self-training video, 4) maximizing time spent using manikins and 5) teaching the concepts of ambiguity and diffusion of responsibility. Recommendations not supported by evidence include mass training events, pulse taking prior to CPR by laymen and CPR using chest compressions alone. CONCLUSION: We evaluated and classified the potential impact of interventions that have been proposed to improve bystander CPR rates. Our results may help communities design interventions to improve their bystander CPR rates.",Video Meta Results Raw,Vaillancourt C and Stiell IG and Wells GA,,,0,744

However, for the students that have visual and auditorial learning style, it is less effective to use only face to face teaching. The purpose of this article to determine the level of eligibility of blended learning as a learning that is able to facilitate learners who have a diversity of three learning styles in learning sports education. The method of writing articles using meta analysis. The field of study is a component related to mixed learning in sports education. The result was that the students were interested in the blended learning and the effectiveness of the learning increased. Therefore, it is expected for the students to do the learning using blended learning. Besides doing face to face teaching, the teacher is also expected to be able to develop the teaching sources in form of video and audio to be the facility in online and offline learning that can be used for the students with visual and auditorial learning style.","blended learning; cognitive step; education of sport teaching; learning style; Education & Educational Research; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Education & Educational Research; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Video Meta Results Raw",Fathoni AF,,,0,746

Feared situations are endured with extreme distress or avoided entirely. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the treatment of choice for PD and PD/A. In this case study, interoceptive exposure (IE) therapy and in vivo exposure therapy were used to treat a 30-year-old housebound woman. Following in-home assessment, psychoeducation, and a limited number of exposure sessions, clinical services were transitioned from in-home to using videoconferencing until in vivo exposure sessions began outside the home. The client was able to meet all behavioral goals by the end of treatment and no longer met criteria for PD/A. This case demonstrates the treatment effectiveness in an individual.

877,McGrath videolaryngoscope versus Macintosh laryngoscope for tracheal intubation: A systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis,"Study objective: The McGrath laryngoscope is a novel self-contained videolaryngoscope with a single-use blade. There are several anecdotal reports that the McGrath is superior to the Macintosh laryngoscope for tracheal intubation. However this remains controversial. Design: Meta-analysis and systematic review. Setting: Operating room or intensive care unit. Measurements: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify clinical trials that met our inclusion criteria. To qualify, studies had to be prospective randomized trials comparing tracheal intubation between the McGrath and the Macintosh in an adult population. We extracted data on success rate, glottic visualization during intubation, and intubation time from the studies identified. In subgroup analysis, we assessed the influence on each of these parameters which included airway condition (normal or difficult) and operator (novice or experienced). We then conducted a trial sequential analysis (TSA). Main results: Fourteen articles met our inclusion criteria. The McGrath offered better glottic visualization than the Macintosh (risk ratio, 134; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-1.45). However, the McGrath required longer intubation time (mean difference, 10.1 s; CI, 2.74-17.5) and demonstrated similar success rate of tracheal intubation (risk ratio, 1.00; CI, 0.95-1.05) compared to the Macintosh. TSA showed that total sample size reached the required information size (RIS) in glottic visualization and success rate. However, only 15.1% of the RIS was achieved in intubation time. In the subgroup analysis for airway condition and operator experience level, there were no subgroup differences in both glottic visualization and intubation time. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that the McGrath is superior to the Macintosh in terms of glottic visualization (GRADE: moderate). However, it significantly extends intubation time (GRADE: very low) and its success rate (GRADE: very low) for tracheal intubation is not excellent. TSA suggests that further studies are necessary to confirm the results of intubation time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

880,Psychophysiological arousal and biased perception of bodily anxiety symptoms in socially anxious children and adolescents: a systematic review,"Cognitive models of social anxiety [Clark and Wells, Social phobia: Diagnosis, assessment, and treatment, Guilford Press, New York, 1995], diagnostic criteria and studies on adult samples suggest that both an overestimation of bodily anxiety symptoms and psychophysiological abnormalities play an important role in social anxiety. To date, less is known about such a perception bias and physiological characteristics in children and adolescents with social anxiety. We performed a systematic review of the literature in the electronic databases Medline, PsycINFO, and PSYNDEX. Additional studies were identified by hand search using the ancestry approach. We identified 1,461 studies, screened their titles and abstracts, viewed 94 papers, and included 28 of these. Study samples were heterogeneous and consisted of socially phobic, high socially anxious, shy and test anxious children and adolescents. Regarding a biased perception, most studies in the review suggest that bodily symptoms of anxiety were overestimated by children and adolescents across the social anxiety spectrum when compared with control groups. An elevated psychophysiological reactivity to social stress was present in samples of high social anxiety, shyness, and test anxiety. In clinical samples with social phobia, by contrast, no differences or an even lower physiological responding compared with healthy control groups were reported. In addition, some evidence for a chronic psychophysiological hyperarousal was found across all sample types. The results are discussed with regard to current models of social anxiety, psychophysiological theories, and treatment implications.",Video Meta Results Raw,Siess J and Blechert J and Schmitz J,,,0,750
883,Can lymph node evaluation be performed well by video-assisted thoracic surgery?,"A systemic review was performed to investigate whether video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) could achieve equivalent lymph node (LN) evaluation efficacy to thoracotomy. A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane was performed to identify studies comparing VATS and thoracotomy in LNs and node stations. Mean difference was calculated by Review Manager 5.0 software and Stata 12. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria of LN evaluation. 2,015 patients were involved in VATS group in contrast to 3,250 patients in thoracotomy group. The same number of total nodes stations (mean difference, 0.09; 95 % CI -0.25 to 0.42; P = 0.61) and mediastinal node stations (mean difference, -0.11; 95 % CI -0.24 to 0.01; P = 0.08) could be assessed by thoracotomy and VATS. The same number of N1 LNs (mean difference, -0.33; 95 % CI -0.70 to 0.05; P = 0.09) could be assessed by both groups. While more total (mean difference, -1.41; 95 % CI -1.99 to -0.83; P < 0.00001) and mediastinal LNs (mean difference, -1.03; 95 % CI -1.81 to -0.24; P = 0.01) could be harvested by thoracotomy. Outcome showed that the same number of total and mediastinal LN stations could be harvested by VATS and OT.

884,The cognitive interview: A meta-analysis,"Performed a meta-analysis on the effects of the cognitive interview on correct and incorrect recall. The database comprised 42 studies with 55 individual comparisons involving nearly 2,500 interviewees. A strong overall effect size was found for the increase of correctly recalled details with the cognitive interview compared to a control interview. The overall effect size for the increase in incorrect details, although considerably smaller, was also significant toward the cognitive interview. However, the accuracy rates (proportion of correct details relative to the total amount of details reported) were almost identical in both types of interview (85% for the cognitive interview and 82% for standard interviews, respectively). Taking methodological factors into consideration, it was found that effect sizes for correct details were larger if staged events were used as the to-be-remembered episode (as compared to video films) and if the interviewees actively participated in the event. With regard to incorrect details effect sizes were larger for adults as compared to children. Furthermore, the enhanced version of the cognitive interview produced more errors than the original version.

886,Children's Naive Concepts of OCD and How They Are Affected by Biomedical Versus Cognitive Behavioural Psychoeducation,"Background: How we conceptualize mental health conditions is important as it impacts on a wide range of mediators of treatment outcome. We do not know how children intuitively conceptualize obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), nor do we know the relative impact of biomedical or cognitive behavioural conceptual explanations, yet both are being widely used in psychoeducation for children with OCD. Aims: This study identified children's naive concepts of OCD, and the comparative impact of biomedical versus cognitive behavioural psychoeducation on perceived prognosis. Method: A within- and between-subjects experimental design was used. After watching a video of a young person describing their OCD, 202 children completed a questionnaire examining their concepts of the condition. They repeated the questionnaire following a second equivalent video, this time preceded by either biomedical or cognitive behavioural psychoeducation. Results: Participants' naive concepts of OCD reflected predominant models of OCD in healthcare. Even at the minimal dose of psychoeducation, participants' conceptualizations of OCD changed. Prior exposure to OCD resulted in a stronger alignment with the biomedical model. Exposure to biomedical psychoeducation resulted in participants predicting a slower recovery with less chance of complete remission. Conclusion: Psychoeducation for childhood OCD is impactful. Despite its wide use by clinicians and mental health services, biomedical psychoeducation appears to have deleterious effects. Children's concepts of OCD merit attention but caution should be applied in how they are targeted.","children and adolescents; obsessive-compulsive disorder; causal attributions; CBT; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; ILLNESS PERCEPTION QUESTIONNAIRE; OF-THE-LITERATURE; MENTAL-DISORDERS; METAANALYSIS; MODEL; PSYCHOTHERAPY; ADOLESCENTS; KNOWLEDGE; PEOPLE; Psychology, Clinical; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Butlin B and Wilson C,,,0,753
888,"The effectiveness of multimedia learning education programs on knowledge, anxiety and pressure garment compliance in patients undergoing burns rehabilitation in Taiwan: An experimental study","Aim: This study examined the effectiveness of multimedia learning education programmes (MLEPs) on knowledge, anxiety and pressure garment compliance behaviour of burn patients. Background: MLEPs are increasingly suggested as education methods that can be used by health professionals in daily practice. A systematic review of the effectiveness of computer-based education demonstrates its acceptability to patients. However, few studies have empirically tested this approach. Design: Experimental study. Methods: An experimental study was conducted at a burn centre of a medical centre in Taipei, Taiwan. Participants were randomly assigned to either experimental (n = 28) or control groups (n = 30). Both groups were given pre-tests and post-tests to measure their knowledge, anxiety and pressure garment compliance behaviour. Results: At two weeks, the results of this study showed that the MLEP had ‘statistically’ significantly improved patients’ burn knowledge, reduced individual anxiety and enhanced pressure garment compliance behaviour. Conclusion: This controlled study demonstrated that a two week MLEP can be a useful intervention to improve care compliance and reduce anxiety in patients undergoing burns rehabilitation period. Relevance to clinical practice: Burn injury patients undergoing rehabilitation are likely to benefit from multimedia learning education intervention programmes. More comprehensive health economic evaluation needs to be undertaken. Further studies exploring a longer term follow-up are also required.

This review evaluated efficacy of cognitive/behavioral interventions for improving children's knowledge and behaviors around dogs. Methods: Manuscripts published before January 3, 2014 evaluating cognitive/behavioral interventions for dog-bite prevention among children <18 years of age were eligible for inclusion. Among 2,270 abstracts screened, 123 full texts were retrieved. Twelve studies were included in the qualitative synthesis; nine were included in the meta-analysis. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were evaluated. Results: Cognitive/behavioral interventions had a moderate effect in improving children's knowledge and a larger effect in improving children's behavior with dogs. The most effective intervention strategies were video for knowledge and instruction with live dogs for behaviors. Quality of evidence was poor. Conclusions: Cognitive/behavioral interventions have potential to improve both children's knowledge and behaviors around dogs. Future interventions should include multiple follow-ups on dog-bite rates from an international perspective using rigorous randomized controlled trials.","children; dog-bite; injury; meta-analysis; prevention; review; PROGRAM; PROVINCE; BELIEFS; HEALTH; IMPACT; RABIES; PAIN; Psychology, Developmental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Shen J and Rouse J and Godbole M and Wells HL and Boppana S and Schwebel DC,,,0,755
890,Screen time use in children under 3 years old: A systematic review of correlates,"Background: A large percentage (68%) of children under age 3 use screen media, such as television, DVDs and video games, on a daily basis. Research suggests that increased screen time in young children is linked to negative health outcomes, including increased BMI, decreased cognitive and language development and reduced academic success. Reviews on correlates of screen time for young children have included preschool age children and children up to age 7; however, none have focused specifically on correlates among infants and toddlers. As research suggests that screen media use increases with age, examining correlates of early media exposure is essential to reducing exposure later in life. Thus, this paper systemically reviews literature published between January 1999 and January 2013 on correlates of screen time among children between 0 and 36 months of age. Methods: Two methods were used to conduct this review: (1) Computerized searches of databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, Medline); and (2) Reference sections of existing reviews and primary studies. Inclusion criteria were: (1) The article included separate data for children 36 months and younger, (2) English language, (3) peer reviewed article, (4) analysis reported for screen viewing as a dependent variable, (5) original research article and, (6) examined correlates or associations between screen time and other demographic, contextual or behavioral variables. Articles were compiled between 2011 and 2013 and evaluation occurred in 2012 and 2013. Results: The literature search identified 29 studies that met inclusion criteria. These studies investigated a total of 33 potential correlates, which were examined in this review. Findings suggest demographic variables most commonly correlated with high screen time among infants and toddlers are child’s age (older) and race/ethnicity (minority). Child BMI, maternal distress/depression, television viewing time of the mother and cognitive stimulation in the home environment were also associated with screen media use. Studies reported that child sex, first born status, paternal education, non-English speaking family, two-parent household, number of children in the home and non-parental childcare were not associated with screen time among children aged 0–36 months. Associations were unclear (fewer than 60% of studies report an association) for maternal age, maternal education and household income. The remaining correlates were investigated in fewer than three studies and thus not coded for an association. Conclusions: The correlates identified in this study point to avenues for intervention to reduce screen time use in young children. However, further research is necessary to explore a number of environmental, socio-cultural and behavioral correlates that are under-examined in this population and may further inform prevention and intervention strategies.

891,Reducing risk and improving maternal perspective-taking and empathy using virtual embodiment,"The ability to perspective-take (cognitive awareness of another's state) and empathise (emotional/affective response) are important characteristics for sensitive, co-operative and constructive parenting, which assists in developing adaptive functioning for children. For the first time, immersive virtual reality was used to place parents in the position of a child in order to assess impact on perspective-taking and empathy. This novel study was conducted with 20 non-high risk Spanish mothers (a pilot study with 12 mothers is reported in supplementary files). Mothers were virtually embodied as a 4-year-old child, experienced from the first-person perspective and with virtual and real body movements synchronised. They interacted with a 'mother avatar', which responded either in a Positive or Negative way. Participants reported a strong body ownership illusion for the child body that led to cognitive, emotional and physical reactions. Experiencing negative maternal behavior increased levels of empathy. In addition, the Negative mother led to increased feelings of fear of violence. Physiological data indicated greater stress in the Negative than Positive condition. Although further research is required to assess the effectiveness of such methods, any improvement in empathy that leads to a change in parenting behavior has the potential to impact on developmental outcomes for children.",PROSOCIAL VIDEO GAMES; CHILD MALTREATMENT; REALITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; METAANALYSIS; PSYCHOPATHY; BEHAVIORS; INCREASES; DEFICITS; HEALTH; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw,Hamilton-Giachritsis C and Banakou D and Garcia Quiroga M and Giachritsis C and Slater M,,,0,757
892,Video versus direct laryngoscopy on successful first-pass endotracheal intubation in ICU patients,"BACKGROUND: Airway management in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is challenging. The aim of this study was to compare the rate of successful first-pass intubation in the ICU by using the direct laryngoscopy (DL) and that by using the video laryngoscopy (VL). METHODS: A randomized, non-blinded trial comparing first-pass success rate of intubation between VL and DL was performed. Patients were recruited in the period from August 2014 to August 2016. All physicians working at ICU received hands-on training in the use of the video and direct laryngoscope. The primary outcome measure was the first-pass intubation success. RESULTS: A total of 163 ICU patients underwent intubation during the study period (81 patients in VL group and 82 in DL group). The rate of successful first-pass intubation was not significantly different between the VL and the DL group (67.9% vs. 69.5%, P=0.824). Moreover, the overall intubation success and total number of attempts to achieve intubation success did not differ between the two groups. In patients with successful first-pass intubation, the median duration of the intubation procedure did not differ between the two groups. The Cormack-Lehane grades and the percentage of glottic opening score were similar, and no significant differences were found between the two groups. There were no statistical differences between the VL and the DL group in intubation complications (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Among ICU patients requiring intubation, there was no significant difference in the rate of successful first-pass intubation between VL and DL.",Intubation; Video laryngoscopy; Direct laryngoscopy; Intensive care unit; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; OROTRACHEAL INTUBATION; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; CRITICALLY-ILL; TRIAL; COMPLICATIONS; METAANALYSIS; SCALE; MODEL; Emergency Medicine; Emergency Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw,Gao YX and Song YB and Gu ZJ and Zhang JS and Chen XF and Sun H and Lu Z,,,0,758

Participants viewed a video of a staged theft and, following a 1-week interval, were asked to identify the culprit and recall the event in either the same or in a different physical environment. Results suggested that CR enhanced the perceived familiarity of the lineup members, which in turn increased participants' willingness to identify someone in the lineup. Although CR significantly improved facial discrimination and identification accuracy when the target was present, it also increased confidence ratings beyond that warranted by the increase in accuracy. In terms of recall, reinstating the study context improved participants' free recall of both central and peripheral details and cued recall of peripheral details. The results were consistent with a (mis)attribution of familiarity and the outshining hypothesis. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Video Meta Results Raw,Wong CK and Read JD,,,0,760
896,Serious games for emergency preparedness: Evaluation of an interactive vs. a non-interactive simulation of a terror attack,"Emergency preparedness is a relevant emerging application of serious games. A general issue in exploiting such approach concerns the breadth of the population that can be reached by serious games. Indeed, serious games need to be actively played and this can restrict their user population, because there are people who have no experience with video games or do not like them or do not have the proper hardware to play them. Moreover, there are organizational contexts in which a non-interactive presentation is preferred because it can be given in a more convenient and less costly way with simple traditional media, i.e., printed materials, slides or videos. This paper deals with the possibility of generating and using a non-interactive version of the experience provided by serious games. First, we propose a serious game. that simulates a mass emergency caused by a terror attack in a train station. To obtain design guidance, we explore psychological models that explain how people are motivated to protect themselves from danger. Then, we generate the non-interactive version of the terror attack simulation and we contrast it with the interactive version. Results of our study show that both versions of the simulation can provide positive outcomes in learning, risk severity perception and self-efficacy, but they differ in how much they affect user's threat appraisal and emotional response.

897,"Physical activity and brain structure, brain function, and cognition in children and youth: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials","Background: Previous reviews show a favourable relationship between physical activity (PA) and brain health in children and youth. The purpose of this systematic review was to extend the generalizability of previous findings using only studies that employed randomized controlled designs in a wider age range. Methods: After registration in PROSPERO, PRISMA guidelines were followed. Studies must have used a randomized controlled design; manipulated PA once (i.e., acute) or more (i.e., chronic) in apparently healthy children (1 month-17.99 years); and examined cognitive function, brain function, or brain structure as outcomes. Articles were reviewed for inclusion and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Results: Overall, 84 studies from 83 papers with 12,600 unique participants were included (n(range) = 10-1,224, M-range = 0.77-17 years). Studies were mostly rated as low risk of bias. The majority of studies (n = 52) reported at least one favourable cognitive function outcome associated with a PA intervention. Few studies (n = 6) reported an unfavourable outcome. Examining the multiple cognitive function outcomes within each study, PA had mostly no effect (n(acute) = 29, n(chronic) = 47) or a mix of favourable and no effects (n(acute) = 20, n(chronic) = 27). For brain function, acute PA was associated with no change (n = 2) whereas chronic PA was associated with a mix of increases, decreases, or no change (n = 3). For brain structure, two overlapping studies found either favourable or no effects of chronic PA. Discussion: PA is unlikely to harm brain health in children and youth and may confer some benefits. More research is needed to examine the relationship between PA and brain structure and function.",Brain health; BDNF; Executive function; Exercise; Achievement; Physical education; MODERATE AEROBIC EXERCISE; PRIMARY-SCHOOL CHILDREN; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS; COORDINATIVE EXERCISE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; VIDEO GAMES; Psychiatry; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Gunnell KE and Poitras VJ and LeBlanc A and Schibli K and Barbeau K and Hedayati N and Ponitfex MB and Goldfield GS and Dunlap C and Lehan E and Tremblay MS,,,0,762

Eighteen recent (2000-2006) trials including a total of 511 participants were sampled. Effect sizes (Cohen's d's) were calculated for each trial while correcting for measurement error. The Q statistic was used to test (a) heterogeneity across trials and (b) potential moderators. Results indicated that use of video feedback was not a moderator of treatment efficacy and did not significantly affect effect sizes. In contrast, treatment format was a moderator of treatment efficacy such that individual treatments reported larger effect sizes and lower attrition rates compared with group treatments.

899,A systematic review of active video games on rehabilitative outcomes among older patients,"Background: Although current research supports the use of active video games (AVGs) in rehabilitation, the evidence has yet to be systematically reviewed or synthesized. The current project systematically reviewed literature, summarized findings, and evaluated the effectiveness of AVGs as a therapeutic tool in improving physical, psychological, and cognitive rehabilitative outcomes among older adults with chronic diseases. Methods: Seven databases (Academic Search Complete, Communication & Mass Media Complete, ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Medline) were searched for studies that evaluated the effectiveness of AVG-based rehabilitation among older patients. The initial search yielded 946 articles; after evaluating against inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 19 studies of AVG-based rehabilitation remained. Results: Most studies were quasi-experimental in design, with physical functioning the primary outcome investigated with regard to the use of AVGs in rehabilitation. Overall, 9 studies found significant improvements for all study outcomes, whereas 9 studies were mixed, with significant improvements on several study outcomes but no effects observed on other outcomes after AVG-based treatments. One study failed to find any benefits of AVG-based rehabilitation. Conclusion: Findings indicate AVGs have potential in rehabilitation for older patients, with several randomized clinical trials reporting positive effects on rehabilitative outcomes. However, existing evidence is insufficient to support the advantages of AVGs over standard therapy. Given the limited number of studies and concerns with study design quality, more research is warranted to make more definitive conclusions regarding the ability of AVGs to improve rehabilitative outcomes in older patients.","Balance; Depression; Enjoyment; Exergaming; Physical functioning; Quality of life; NINTENDO WII FIT; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY LEVELS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BALANCE BOARD; FALL RISK; IMPROVE; EXERGAMES; EXERCISE; MOTOR; GAIT; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism; Sport Sciences; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Sport Sciences; Video Meta Results Raw",Zeng N and Pope Z and Lee JE and Gao Z,,,0,764

Materials and Methods: The results of LCJ performed on 84 patients were analyzed. Patients were divided into eight groups, by surgical order. The plateau of the learning curve was defined as the period during which the operative time showed a dramatic decrease. The exact operative time was recorded using video analysis. Results: Compared with the first three groups, the fourth group showed a significantly shorter LCJ time. The subsequent groups showed a plateau, indicating that there were no more significant changes in the LCJ time. After the plateau of the learning curve was reached, the average LCJ time was 27.4 +/- 4.7 minutes. Six cases of postoperative bile leakage occurred, with all occurring before the plateau of the learning curve was reached. Five of the 6 cases of bile leakage had a nondilated common bile duct. Conclusions: Even for a surgeon experienced in laparoscopic surgery, there is a steep learning curve for the performance of LCJ. With careful video review, education of the surgical team, and various technical tips, the learning curve can be shortened. After the learning curve, experienced surgeons can perform LCJ with acceptable results.",Video Meta Results Raw,Lee JS and Hong TH,,,0,765
901,Using Student Video Cases to Assess Pre-service Elementary Teachers’ Engineering Teaching Responsiveness,"Our study addresses the need for new approaches to prepare novice elementary teachers to teach both science and engineering, and for new tools to measure how well those approaches are working. This in particular would inform the teacher educators of the extent to which novice teachers are developing expertise in facilitating their students’ engineering design work. One important dimension to measure is novice teachers’ abilities to notice the substance of student thinking and to respond in productive ways. This teacher noticing is particularly important in science and engineering education, where students’ initial, idiosyncratic ideas and practices influence the likelihood that particular instructional strategies will help them learn. This paper describes evidence of validity and reliability for the Video Case Diagnosis (VCD) task, a new instrument for measuring pre-service elementary teachers’ engineering teaching responsiveness. To complete the VCD, participants view a 6-min video episode of children solving an engineering design problem, describe in writing what they notice about the students’ science ideas and engineering practices, and propose how a teacher could productively respond to the students. The rubric for scoring VCD responses allowed two independent scorers to achieve inter-rater reliability. Content analysis of the video episode, systematic review of literature on science and engineering practices, and solicitation of external expert educator responses establish content validity for VCD. Field test results with three different participant groups who have different levels of engineering education experience offer evidence of construct validity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Elementary Education; Logical Thinking; Elementary School Teachers; Teacher Response; Test Reliability; Teacher Role; Teacher Competencies; Measurement Techniques; Test Validity; Science Education; Preservice Teachers; Design; Engineering Education; Beginning Teachers; Content Analysis; Content Validity; Video Technology; Elementary engineering education; Responsive teaching; Video cases; Video Meta Results Raw",Dalvi T and Wendell K,,,0,766

This review systematically evaluated whether AVGs could improve measures of physical performance in older people. Secondary measures of safety, game appeal, and usability were also considered. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials published up to April 2015. Included were trials with 2 or more arms that evaluated the effect of AVGs on outcome measures of physical performance in older people. RESULTS: Eighteen randomized controlled trials (n = 765) were included. Most trials limited inclusion to healthy community-dwelling older people. With the exception of 1 trial, all AVG programs were supervised. Using meta-analyses, AVGs were found to be more effective than conventional exercise (mean difference [MD], 4.33; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 2.93-5.73) or no intervention (MD, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.17-1.29) for improving Berg Balance scores in community-dwelling older people. Active video games were also more effective than control for improving 30-second sit-to-stand scores (MD, 3.99; 95% CI, 1.92-6.05). No significant differences in Timed Up and Go scores were found when AVGs were compared with no intervention or with conventional exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Active video games can improve measures of mobility and balance in older people when used either on their own or as part of an exercise program. It is not yet clear whether AVGs are equally suitable for older people with significant cognitive impairments or balance or mobility limitations. Given the positive findings to date, consideration could be given to further development of age-appropriate AVGs for use by older people with balance or mobility limitations.",aged; exercise; older adult; video games; BERG BALANCE SCALE; WII FIT; EXERCISE INTERVENTION; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; POSTURAL CONTROL; ADULTS; COMMUNITY; GO; BARRIERS; FEASIBILITY; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Rehabilitation; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw,Taylor LM and Kerse N and Frakking T and Maddison R,,,0,769

906,The Impact of Educational Gaming on Knowledge Acquisition in Health Sciences Students,"Objective: The objective of this study is to systematically review the effects of educational gaming on knowledge acquisition of health science students compared to that of conventional instructional approaches. Methods: MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched for relevant studies during November 2014. Also included were applicable studies from previous systematic reviews. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Study participants were students of health care professions. Interventions of interest were educational games. Outcomes of interest were students' knowledge of the subject area of instruction. Results: These search methods identified 15 RCTs of educational games used with health science students to be included in the review. Nine studies showed that for student groups where educational gaming was implemented students demonstrated significantly better cognitive knowledge acquisition as indicated by higher testing scores than those in the conventional instructional education group. However, after partialling out studies with severe methodological biases which included students in the educational gaming group spending significantly more time playing the games outside the assigned instructional time, educational games being compared to non-directed self-study, not the conventional teaching methods, similarity of content format (i.e., case scenarios or patient management simulation) in the education games to the testing questions, and feedback from the (video/digital) games or instructors, the remainder of the studies showed limited evidence of the superiority of educational games over conventional instructional method in knowledge acquisition. Conclusion: Without conducting a meta-analysis, this systematic review cannot confirm the superiority of educational games over conventional instructional method in assisting health science students to achieve a higher testing score in cognitive knowledge of academic subjects. However, this review does suggest that educational games may serve as an alternative, effective way to non-directed self-study for health sciences students. Further studies should investigate the role of motivation (i.e., time spent on playing educational games) as a moderator in knowledge acquisition.",Video Meta Results Raw,Yuen HK and Jenkins GR,,,0,771
909,The interactive Physical and Cognitive Exercise System (iPACES (TM)): effects of a 3-month in-home pilot clinical trial for mild cognitive impairment and caregivers,"Background: Alzheimer's and related dementias are on the rise, and older adults and their families are seeking accessible and effective ways to stave off or ameliorate mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Aim: This pilot clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 03069391) examined neuropsychological and neurobiological outcomes of interactive physical and mental exercise. Participants and methods: Older adults (MCI and caregivers) were enrolled in a 3-month, in-home trial of a portable neuro-exergame (the interactive Physical and Cognitive Exercise System [iPACES (TM)]), in which they pedaled and steered along a virtual bike path to complete a list of errands (Memory Lane (TM)). Neuropsychological function and salivary biomarkers were measured at pre-, mid-, and posttrial. Ten older adults complied with the recommended use of iPACES (complete dose; >= 2x/wk, 67% of the 15 who also had pre- and postevaluation data). Statistical analyses compared change over time and also change among those with a complete dose vs inadequate dose. Correlations between change in neuropsychological and biomarker measures were also examined. Results: Executive function and verbal memory increased after 3 months (p = 0.01; no significant change was found with an inadequate dose). Change in salivary biomarkers was moderately associated with increasing cognition (cortisol, r = 0.68; IGF-1, r = 0.37). Conclusion: Further research is needed, but these pilot data provide preliminary indications to suggest neuro-exergaming can impact cognitive function, perhaps via neurobiological mechanisms, and as such may provide an effective and practical way to promote healthy aging.",aging; cognition; MCI; exergame; executive function; neurogame; neuro-exergame; DWELLING OLDER-ADULTS; VIDEO GAMES; BRAIN; METAANALYSIS; NEUROGENESIS; DEMENTIA; MULTICOMPONENT; INTERVENTIONS; PREVENTION; BENEFITS; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Video Meta Results Raw,Anderson-Hanley C and Stark J and Wall KM and VanBrakle M and Michel M and Maloney M and Barcelos N and Striegnitz K and Cohen BD and Kramer AF,,,0,772
910,Empirical Evidence for the Outcomes of Therapeutic Video Games for Adolescents With Anxiety Disorders: Systematic Review,"Background: Extant evidence suggests that the proportion of adolescents suffering from anxiety disorders (ADs) has increased by up to 70% since the mid-1980s, with experience of anxiety at this stage associated with significant negative short-and long-term life outcomes. The existing therapeutic interventions (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT; attention bias modification, ABM) have proven to have clinically measurable benefits in reducing anxiety, but their efficacy is often compromised by social and practical barriers. The growing discrepancy between demand for, and access to, clinical interventions for anxiety has led to the development of a range of eHealth (health care practice supported by electronic processes and communication) and mHealth (versions of eHealth using mobile devices) interventions. One such protocol is therapeutic games, which aim to provide clinical frameworks in dynamic, adaptable, and personalized virtual environments. Although some evidence exists to suggest therapeutic games are associated with reductions in subjective anxiety and observed stress reactivity, there is currently, to our knowledge, no systematic review of the adherence to, and effectiveness of, therapeutic games for adolescent anxiety. Objective: The aim of this review was to establish the effectiveness of therapeutic games in making clinically measurable reductions in anxiety symptoms in adolescent samples. Methods: A systematic search of the existing academic literature published between 1990 and July 2017 was conducted using the databases Journal of Medical Internet Research, Journal Storage, Psychology Articles, Psychology Info, ScienceDIRECT, and Scopus. Records linked to empirical papers on therapeutic games for anxiety using adolescent samples were evaluated. Results: A total of 5 studies (N=410 participants) met the inclusion criteria, and 3 gamified anxiety interventions for adolescents were identified. The papers included a mixture of randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and usability studies comprising quantitative and qualitative measures, with varying degrees of mixed methods. Extant evidence shows potential for therapeutic games to create clinically measurable reductions in symptoms of anxiety in adolescent samples, though findings are complicated in some cases by a low sample size, and in other cases by research design and methodological complications, including anxiety reductions in control groups caused by a control-game selection. Conclusions: Although research in this field appears to be extremely limited, as demonstrated by the small number of papers meeting the inclusion criteria for this review, early findings suggest that therapeutic games have potential in helping to engage adolescents with anxiety and lead to clinically measurable reductions in symptoms.",anxiety disorder; video games; adolescent; CBT; eHealth; mental health; mobile health; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; MENTAL-DISORDERS; SELF-MANAGEMENT; CHILDREN; HEALTH; INTERVENTION; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; Medical Informatics; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Barnes S and Prescott J,,,0,773
911,Gender imbalance in instructional dynamic versus static visualizations: A meta-analysis,"Studies comparing the instructional effectiveness of dynamic versus static visualizations have produced mixed results. In this work, we investigated whether gender imbalance in the participant samples of these studies may have contributed to the mixed results. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized experiments in which groups of students learning through dynamic visualizations were compared to groups receiving static visualizations. Our sample focused on tasks that could be categorized as either biologically secondary tasks (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics: STEM) or biologically primary tasks (manipulative–procedural). The meta-analysis of 46 studies (82 effect sizes and 5474 participants) revealed an overall small-sized effect (g+ = 0.23) showing that dynamic visualizations were more effective than static visualizations. Regarding potential moderators, we observed that gender was influential: the dynamic visualizations were more effective on samples with less females and more males (g+ = 0.36). We also observed that educational level, learning domain, media compared, and reporting reliability measures moderated the results. We concluded that because many visualization studies have used samples with a gender imbalance, this may be a significant factor in explaining why instructional dynamic and static visualizations seem to vary in their effectiveness. Our findings also support considering the gender variable in research about cognitive load theory and instructional visualizations.

912,Activity in the action observation network enhances emotion regulation during observation of risk-taking: an fMRI study,"Objectives: The results of neuroimaging studies have indicated that viewing emotional stimuli can lead to activity increases in brain regions associated with processing actions. We hypothesized that observation of actions involving the potential for harm (i.e., risk-taking actions) would activate emotion- and pain-related processing. Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the changes in neural activity during the observation of safe and risk-taking actions in 34 healthy participants (14 females, 20 males; mean age: 23.4 +/- 3.7 years). Results: Observation of risk-taking actions elicited significantly stronger neural activation in the inferior frontal gyrus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus/frontal pole, inferior parietal lobule, middle temporal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, cuneus (including the calcarine sulcus), insula, and amygdala, than observation of safe actions. Interestingly, we observed significant activation of affect-related brain areas (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and insula), thought to be implicated in various aspects of emotion regulation during the observation of risk-taking actions. No brain regions exhibited greater activation during observation of safe actions than during observation of risk-taking actions associated with risk. Discussion: Our results reveal that the risk-related content of the observed actions in the video clips elicited activation of a network of visual input and processing regions, including the action observation network, that appears to encode the meanings of observed actions as well as the reflective or retrospective monitoring of their outcomes. These findings suggest that risk-taking situations may increase cognitive load on the entire action perception system, and may command more attention.",Video Meta Results Raw,Tamura M and Moriguchi Y and Higuchi S and Hida A and Enomoto M and Umezawa J and Mishima K,,,0,775
913,The relationship between system-provided learner control and maintained situational interest within e-learning courses,"Purpose - Due to the autonomous nature of e-learning, learner control options should be provided to allow students to be more selective of content based on learning needs. Maintaining students' situational interest should also be a goal in e-learning, as research shows that doing so leads to a greater chance of success. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between learner control and maintained situational interest in hopes of promoting better engagement through content selection based on learning needs. Design/methodology/approach - This study analyzed survey responses from university students (n = 2,173) participating in a variety of massive online courses in South Korea to investigate the correlation between system-provided learner control and maintained situational interest. Additionally, the correlation between learner control and maintained situational interest was examined among demographic subsets including gender, age and grade level. Findings - Results show a positive relationship between learner control and maintained situational interest, as well as a positive relationship between learner control and maintained situational interest among each demographic subset. Originality/value - These results add to the current literature by promoting a practical way of maintaining students' situational interest by providing them with the ability to control aspects of their own learning processes.",Online learning; E-learning; Interest; Learner control; Maintained situational interest; Situational interest; SATISFACTION; IMPACT; METAANALYSIS; PERSPECTIVE; MOTIVATION; CLASSROOM; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; KOREA; VIDEO; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Lange C,,,0,776
915,Cerebral Visual Impairment: Which Perceptive Visual Dysfunctions Can Be Expected in Children with Brain Damage? A Systematic Review,"The current definition of Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI) includes all visual dysfunctions caused by damage to, or malfunctioning of, the retrochiasmatic visual pathways in the absence of damage to the anterior visual pathways or any major ocular disease. CVI is diagnosed by exclusion and the existence of many different causes and symptoms make it an overall non-categorized group. To date, no discrimination is made within CVI based on types of perceptive visual dysfunctions. The aim of this review was to outline which perceptive visual dysfunctions are to be expected based on a number of etiologies of brain damage and brain development disorders with their onset in the pre-, peri- or post-natal period. For each period two etiologies were chosen as the main characteristic brain damage. For each etiology a main search was performed. The selection of the articles was based on the following criteria: age, etiology, imaging, central pathology and perceptive visual function test. The perceptive visual functions included for this review were object recognition, face recognition, visual memory, orientation, visual spatial perception, motion perception and simultaneous perception. Our search resulted in 11 key articles. A diversity of research history is performed for the selected etiologies and their relation to perceptive visual dysfunctions. Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL) was most studied, whereas the main tested perceptive visual function was visual spatial perception. As a conclusion, the present status of research in the field of CVI does not allow to correlate between etiology, location and perceptive visual dysfunctions in children with brain damage or a brain development disorder. A limiting factor could be the small number of objective tests performed in children experiencing problems in visual processing. Based on recent insights in central visual information processing, we recommend an alternative approach for the definition of CVI that is based on functional visual processing, rather than anatomical landmarks. This could be of benefit in daily practice to diagnose CVI.

916,THE VALUE OF ADDING A FLIPPED LEARNING COMPONENT TO A HUMANITIES COURSE IN HIGHER EDUCATION: STUDENT PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,"Given that most humanities courses in higher education are already interactive and constructive, it is not clear whether a flipped model of learning adds any additional value to student learning. This study assessed the impacts of flipped learning on EFL learners' performance and perceptions of a two-semester linguistics course in a Taiwan university. For the flipped units, EFL students learning linguistics in the partially flipped classroom viewed instructor-made videos prior to the scheduled class and then participated in class activities, which required analysis and evaluation of the concepts acquired from the videos to solve real-world problems. For other units, students experienced learning via live lectures. Student responses from a questionnaire indicated that the flipped model promoted higher-order thinking and made differentiated and self-paced learning possible. Video lectures were favored over textbook chapters, but not over live lectures. The results of correlational analyses between questionnaire items and exam performance indicated that success in flipped learning depends on students' appreciation of the cohesive alignment of prerecorded lectures and in-class activities to support learning and investing time in video lectures. There was no evidence that devoting 28% less class time to transmitting knowledge over the two semesters impaired exam performance in the flipped students when compared to the students taking the same course but with live lectures in the previous year. This article calls for a careful reexamination of how to balance the use of flipped learning and live lectures in humanities disciplines in higher education.",flipped learning; humanities courses; student perceptions; LANGUAGE LEARNERS; CLASSROOM; ENGLISH; METAANALYSIS; INSTRUCTION; COMMUNICATE; THINKING; DESIGN; MODEL; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Hu CF and Hsu FF,,,0,778
917,Covert Stuttering: Investigation of the Paradigm Shift From Covertly Stuttering to Overtly Stuttering,"Purpose: Covert stuttering is a type of stuttering experience that occurs when a person who stutters conceals his or her stutter from others, attempting to be perceived as a nonstuttering individual. A person who covertly stutters experiences the cognitive and emotional elements of stuttering with minimum overt behavioral symptoms. Individuals who covertly stutter are able to provide insight into their experiences in attempting to be perceived as nonstuttering individuals. Covert stuttering is a topic that continues to be in need of a formal definition. The current investigation is utilizing thematic analysis to provide a detail-rich investigation of the paradigm shift from covertly stuttering to overtly stuttering. Method: The current investigation is a qualitative analysis of individuals' transition process from covertly stuttering to overtly stuttering. Real-time video interviews were conducted with the use of open-ended phenomenological interview questions. Interviews were transcribed, and thematic analysis of interview transcripts was conducted to investigate the covertly to overtly stuttering process for participants. Results: The findings provide insight into a paradigm shift that occurs when individuals who covertly stutter begin to outwardly identify themselves and allow for overt stuttering. The primary theme was a paradigm shift in the 6 participants' mindset regarding stuttering; additional details are provided in the subthemes: attending speech therapy, meeting other people who stutter, and a psychological low point. The details of the covert-to-overt stuttering conversion are documented with the use of direct quotations. Conclusion: The evidence suggests the various intricacies of the experiences of persons who are covert. Clinical implications of these findings for assessing and treating individuals who covertly stutter are discussed.",SELF-STIGMA; PEOPLE; ADULTS; IMPACT; METAANALYSIS; ANXIETY; MODEL; Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Rehabilitation; Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw,Douglass JE and Schwab M and Alvarado J,,,0,779
919,Different aspects of theory of mind in paranoid schizophrenia: Evidence from a video-based assessment,"In schizophrenia, impairments of theory of mind (ToM) may be due to excessive ('overmentalizing') or defective ('undermentalizing') attribution of mental states. However, most TOM tests differentiate neither between 'overmentalizing' and 'undermentalizing' nor between cognitive and affective ToM in schizophrenia. This study aimed at differentiating these aspects of ToM in 80 patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and 80 matched healthy controls using the 'Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition' (MASC). Outcome parameters comprised 1) error counts representing 'undermentalizing' or 'overmentalizing', 2) decoding of cognitive or emotional mental states and 3) non-social inferencing. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) showed significantly abnormal scores for two dimensions of 'undermentalizing' as well as for cognitive and emotional ToM that were not explained by global cognitive deficits. Scores for 'overmentalizing' did not differ between groups, when age, gender, non-social reasoning and memory were controlled. In schizophrenic patients, negative symptoms were associated with a lack of a mental state concept, while positive symptoms like delusions were associated with 'overmentalizing', supporting respective etiological concepts of delusions.

920,"Pay no attention to that data behind the curtain: On angry birds, happy children, scholarly squabbles, publication bias, and why betas rule metas","This article responds to five comments on my 'Angry Birds' meta-analysis of video game influences on children (Ferguson, 2015, this issue). Given ongoing debates on video game influences, comments varied from the supportive to the self-proclaimed 'angry,' yet hopefully they and this response will contribute to constructive discussion as the field moves forward. In this reply, I address some misconceptions in the comments and present data that challenge the assumption that standardized regression coefficients are invariably unsuitable for meta-analysis or that bivariate correlations are invariably suitable for meta-analysis. The suitability of any data should be considered on a case-by-case basis, and data indicates that the coefficients included in the 'Angry Birds' meta-analysis did not distort results. Study selection, effect size extraction, and interpretation improved upon problematic issues in other recent meta-analyses. Further evidence is also provided to support the contention that publication bias remains problematic in video game literature. Sources of acrimony among scholars are explored as are areas of agreement. Ultimately, debates will only be resolved through a commitment to newer, more rigorous methods and open science.

The objective of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the perioperative characteristics, safety, and completely stable remission rate in patients with MG who received VATS or open thymectomy (OT). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and CNKI for related articles using combinations of the search terms video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy, transsternal thymectomy, and MG. The inter-study heterogeneity was assessed by χ2-based Q statistics, and the extent of inconsistency was generated by I2 statistics. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies with 1173 patients were included, and there was no difference in the operation time (p = 0.08) and ICU time (p = 0.14) between the two groups, but VATS thymectomy was associated with less intra-operation blood loss and hospital time (p < 0.00001). VATS was also associated with lower rates of total complication (OR =0.59; 95% CI, 0.37-0.94; p = 0.03) and myasthenic crisis (OR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.92; p = 0.03), but the rates of pneumonia (OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.29-1.32; p = 0.21) and complete remission rate (CSR) (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.38-1.09; p = 0.10) had no obvious differences between the VATS and OT groups. CONCLUSION: Patients with MG undergoing VATS thymectomy achieved better surgical outcomes and fewer complications than those who received OT.",Meta-analysis; myasthenia gravis; thymectomy; video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Qi K and Wang B and Wang B and Zhang LB and Chu XY,,,0,782
922,Cognitive deficits in unipolar old-age depression: a population-based study,"Background There is substantial variability in the degree of cognitive impairment among older depressed persons. Inconsistencies in previous findings may be due to differences in clinical and demographic characteristics across study samples. We assessed the influence of unipolar depression and severity of depression on cognitive performance in a population-based sample of elderly persons aged 60 years. Method Eighty-nine persons fulfilled ICD-10 criteria for unipolar depression (mild, n=48; moderate, n=38; severe, n=3) after thorough screening for dementia (DSM-IV criteria), psychiatric co-morbidities and antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Participants (n=2486) were administered an extensive cognitive test battery. Results Moderate/severe unipolar depression was associated with poorer performance on tasks assessing processing speed, attention, executive function, verbal fluency, episodic memory and vocabulary. Mild depression was associated with poorer performance in processing speed, and few differences between mild and moderate/severe depression were observed. No association between depression and short-term memory, general knowledge or spatial ability was observed. Increasing age did not exacerbate the depression-related cognitive deficits, and the deficits remained largely unchanged after excluding persons in a preclinical phase of dementia. Furthermore, depression-related cognitive deficits were not associated with other pharmacological treatments that may affect cognitive performance. Conclusions Cognitive deficits in unipolar old-age depression involve a range of domains and the cognitive deficits seem to follow the spectrum of depression severity. The finding that mild depression was also associated with poorer cognitive functioning underscores the importance of detecting mild depression in elderly persons.",Video Meta Results Raw,Pantzar A and Laukka EJ and Atti AR and Fastbom J and Fratiglioni L and Backman L,,,0,783
923,Strategies for increasing recruitment to randomised controlled trials: systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Recruitment of participants into randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is critical for successful trial conduct. Although there have been two previous systematic reviews on related topics, the results (which identified specific interventions) were inconclusive and not generalizable. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relative effectiveness of recruitment strategies for participation in RCTs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A systematic review, using the PRISMA guideline for reporting of systematic reviews, that compared methods of recruiting individual study participants into an actual or mock RCT were included. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and reference lists of relevant studies. From over 16,000 titles or abstracts reviewed, 396 papers were retrieved and 37 studies were included, in which 18,812 of at least 59,354 people approached agreed to participate in a clinical RCT. Recruitment strategies were broadly divided into four groups: novel trial designs (eight studies), recruiter differences (eight studies), incentives (two studies), and provision of trial information (19 studies). Strategies that increased people's awareness of the health problem being studied (e.g., an interactive computer program [relative risk (RR) 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-2.18], attendance at an education session [RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.28], addition of a health questionnaire [RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.14-1.66]), or a video about the health condition (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.11-2.74), and also monetary incentives (RR1.39, 95% CI 1.13-1.64 to RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.28-1.84) improved recruitment. Increasing patients' understanding of the trial process, recruiter differences, and various methods of randomisation and consent design did not show a difference in recruitment. Consent rates were also higher for nonblinded trial design, but differential loss to follow up between groups may jeopardise the study findings. The study's main limitation was the necessity of modifying the search strategy with subsequent search updates because of changes in MEDLINE definitions. The abstracts of previous versions of this systematic review were published in 2002 and 2007. CONCLUSION: Recruitment strategies that focus on increasing potential participants' awareness of the health problem being studied, its potential impact on their health, and their engagement in the learning process appeared to increase recruitment to clinical studies. Further trials of recruitment strategies that target engaging participants to increase their awareness of the health problems being studied and the potential impact on their health may confirm this hypothesis.

924,A longitudinal investigation of cognitive function in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus,"Objective: Cross-sectional studies find altered cognition in youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, few longitudinal studies have examined the trajectories of their cognitive performance over time. The aims of this study were to explore longitudinal change in cognitive function in youth with T1DM as compared with nondiabetic sibling controls, and how glycemic control and age of onset influence cognitive performance over time. Methods: We assessed crystallized intelligence, visual-spatial ability, delayed memory, and processing speed at 3 time points using the same cognitive tasks in youth with T1DM and sibling controls. Hierarchical linear modeling examined relationships between diabetes, hyperglycemia (HbA1c values), age of onset, and cognition over 5.5 y. Results: Youth with diabetes performed worse than controls on visual-spatial ability and memory tasks over time, and did not improve as much in processing speed. Greater hyperglycemia was associated with lower crystallized intelligence and slower processing speed but better memory across all time points. There was a stronger negative relationship between hyperglycemia and visual-spatial ability for youth with earlier compared with later onset diabetes. Importantly, within-person decreases in hyperglycemia between time points were associated with improved visual-spatial ability and faster processing speed. Conclusions: On average, differences in cognitive function between youth with T1DM and nondiabetic relatives are maintained or increase during childhood and adolescence. Hyperglycemia and age of onset can have negative effects on the developmental trajectories of cognitive processes in youth with T1DM. However, treatments that lower hyperglycemia may lead to improved cognitive function in youth with T1DM.",cognition; hyperglycemia; memory; pediatrics; type 1; diabetes mellitus; TERM SPATIAL MEMORY; SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA; DISEASE ONSET; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES; RISK-FACTORS; METAANALYSIS; IDDM; AGE; COMPLICATIONS; PERFORMANCE; Endocrinology & Metabolism; Pediatrics; Endocrinology & Metabolism; Pediatrics; Video Meta Results Raw,Kirchhoff BA and Jundt DK and Doty T and Hershey T,,,0,785
925,The effect of motor and physical activity intervention on motor outcomes of children with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review,"Lay abstract Up to 83% of children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty performing age-appropriate motor skills. However, the effectiveness of current interventions to improve motor skills is poorly understood. In this review, we examined 34 research studies that investigated the use of interventions to improve the motor abilities of children with autism spectrum disorder. We also examined seven research studies that investigated strategies used to teach children with autism spectrum disorder age-appropriate motor skills. In total, these studies included 1173 children with autism spectrum disorder ranging from the age of 3 to 19 years. We found that many interventions improved the motor abilities of children with autism spectrum disorder including the following: (1) motor activity interventions (e.g. gymnastics, soccer), (2) motor skill interventions (e.g. throwing, catching), (3) horse riding interventions, (4) swimming interventions, (5) video gaming interventions, and (6) physical education interventions. However, each intervention improved different types of motor abilities. We also found that as a teaching strategy, visual instruction was more effective than verbal instruction for children with autism spectrum disorder. In addition, the children with autism spectrum disorder learned equally well from many different types of instructors (adult, robot, or peer). Further high-quality research on this topic is needed to determine how to best optimize the motor abilities of children with autism spectrum disorder.","autism spectrum disorders; children; intervention; motor; quality of life; systematic review; SKILL INTERVENTION; CURRENT PERSPECTIVES; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; THROWING SKILLS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; AQUATIC SKILLS; PROGRAM; EXERCISE; ADOLESCENTS; INDIVIDUALS; Psychology, Developmental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Ruggeri A and Dancel A and Johnson R and Sargent B,,,0,786
926,What do randomized controlled trials say about virtual rehabilitation in stroke? A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of upper-limb and cognitive outcomes,"Background: Virtual-reality based rehabilitation (VR) shows potential as an engaging and effective way to improve upper-limb function and cognitive abilities following a stroke. However, an updated synthesis of the literature is needed to capture growth in recent research and address gaps in our understanding of factors that may optimize training parameters and treatment effects. Methods: Published randomized controlled trials comparing VR to conventional therapy were retrieved from seven electronic databases. Treatment effects (Hedge's g) were estimated using a random effects model, with motor and functional outcomes between different protocols compared at the Body Structure/Function, Activity, and Participation levels of the International Classification of Functioning. Results: Thirty-three studies were identified, including 971 participants (492 VR participants). VR produced small to medium overall effects (g = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.33-0.59, p < 0.01), above and beyond conventional therapies. Small to medium effects were observed on Body Structure/Function (g = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.28-0.55; p < 0.01) and Activity outcomes (g = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.34-0.60, p < 0.01), while Participation outcomes failed to reach significance (g = 0.38; 95% CI: -0.29-1.04, p = 0.27). Superior benefits for Body Structure/Function (g = 0.56) and Activity outcomes (g = 0.62) were observed when examining outcomes only from purpose-designed VR systems. Preliminary results (k = 4) suggested small to medium effects for cognitive outcomes (g = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.28-0.55; p < 0.01). Moderator analysis found no advantage for higher doses of VR, massed practice training schedules, or greater time since injury. Conclusion: VR can effect significant gains on Body Structure/Function and Activity level outcomes, including improvements in cognitive function, for individuals who have sustained a stroke. The evidence supports the use of VR as an adjunct for stroke rehabilitation, with effectiveness evident for a variety of platforms, training parameters, and stages of recovery.","Cognition; Meta-analysis; Motor performance; Rehabilitation; Stroke; Virtual reality; REALITY-BASED REHABILITATION; UPPER EXTREMITY FUNCTION; FILE-DRAWER PROBLEM; ARM MOTOR RECOVERY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; VIDEO-GAMES; INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; SUBACUTE STROKE; Engineering, Biomedical; Neurosciences; Rehabilitation; Engineering; Neurosciences & Neurology; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Aminov A and Rogers JM and Middleton S and Caeyenberghs K and Wilson PH,,,0,787
927,Teaching Games for Understanding Conference Supplement from the German Sport University,"By bringing together the national German sports game community and an international scientific community in a joint conference, the 6th International Teaching Games for Understanding Conference (TGfU) Meets the 10th German Sports Games Symposium of the German Association of Sport Science (DVS), held July 25-27, 2016, at the German Sport University in Cologne, fostered the interdisciplinary discussion of team and racket sports in the fields of sport pedagogy, sport didactics, sport psychology, computer science, human movement science, and training science.

928,Effectiveness of multimedia aids to enhance comprehension of research consent information: A systematic review,"The aim of this systematic review is to analyze the role of multimedia aids to enhance comprehension of research consent information. This concern has heightened as consent forms continue to increase in length and complexity, despite calls for shortening them and using understandable lay language. The term multimedia specifically refers to integration of two or more forms or channels of information, such as auditory, visual, and/or text. The literature search through May 8, 2012, was conducted with the PubMed and PsycINFO Cambridge Scientific Abstracts (CSA) Illumina databases. As described in article, an information processing perspective, including the concept of 'cognitive load,' offers a clear framework in which to ground this future work and make substantive progress in the design and evaluation of multimedia aids for the consent process. There also seems to be clear value in not only teaching subjects about protocol specifics, but—in at least some cases—in priming that discussion with a brief discussion about clinical research concepts.

929,The VOICE study—A before and after study of a dementia communication skills training course,"Background: A quarter of acute hospital beds are occupied by persons living with dementia, many of whom have communication problems. Healthcare professionals lack confidence in dementia communication skills, but there are no evidence-based communication skills training approaches appropriate for professionals working in this context. We aimed to develop and pilot a dementia communication skills training course that was acceptable and useful to healthcare professionals, hospital patients and their relatives. Methods: The course was developed using conversation analytic findings from video recordings of healthcare professionals talking to patients living with dementia in the acute hospital, together with systematic review evidence of dementia communication skills training and taking account of expert and service-user opinion. The two-day course was based on experiential learning theory, and included simulation and video workshops, reflective diaries and didactic teaching. Actors were trained to portray patients living with dementia for the simulation exercises. Six courses were run between January and May 2017. 44/45 healthcare professionals attended both days of the course. Evaluation entailed: questionnaires on confidence in dementia communication; a dementia communication knowledge test; and participants' satisfaction. Video-recorded, simulated assessments were used to measure changes in communication behaviour. Results: Healthcare professionals increased their knowledge of dementia communication (mean improvement 1.5/10; 95% confidence interval 1.0−2.0; p < 0.001). Confidence in dementia communication also increased (mean improvement 5.5/45; 95% confidence interval 4.1−6.9; p < 0.001) and the course was well-received. One month later participants reported using the skills learned in clinical practice. Blind-ratings of simulated patient encounters demonstrated behaviour change in taught communication behaviours to close an encounter, consistent with the training, but not in requesting behaviours. Conclusion: We have developed an innovative, evidence-based dementia communication skills training course which healthcare professionals found useful and after which they demonstrated improved dementia communication knowledge, confidence and behaviour.

931,Determining True and False Witnessed Events: Can an Eyewitness-Implicit Association Test Distinguish Between the Seen and Unseen?,"Despite the current popularity of indirect cognitive measures in psychology, there is a paucity of research using indirect measures in the psychology and law literature. We bridge this gap in two studies in which we tested whether a modified version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) could distinguish between seen and unseen events from a previously witnessed incident. College students (total N=69) viewed a short crime video and completed an eyewitness-Implicit Association Test (eIAT) and recognition task. In Study 1, the eIAT and recognition task presented true and false central and peripheral details from the video. In Study 2, we used a misinformation paradigm to test the utility of the eIAT. In both studies, the eIAT successfully distinguished between witnessed and non-witnessed details. However, in Study 2, the eIAT did not improve upon the recognition task's ability to correctly classify participants (i.e., control vs. misinformed group). Implications are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Freng S and Kehn A,,,0,792
932,Revealing the Design Process: Inventing a Meta-Analysis Method for Documenting the Fashion Design Process,"How designers think throughout the creative process is one of the major issues in the field of design. This study aims to introduce a meta-analysis method that documents and analyses the idea development processes of fashion designers. Eighteen designers created five contemporary women’s wear designs in sessions with video/audio-recorded pre- and post-design interviews. Our analysis distilled the ideation process into seven steps, and we developed a design process coding map for each designer. This coding method reveals how salient features extracted from the source of inspiration change over time and how they converge in the final design sketches. This coding method helps us map the evolution of the design process on one page, allowing for a visual summation of key points in the process. Using this method, educators can develop systematic exercises for students, while practitioners can use the method to activate a self-learning process. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",design method; design process; fashion design; meta-analysis; KNITWEAR DESIGN; INSPIRATION; LINKOGRAPHY; Art; Art; Video Meta Results Raw,Lee JS and Danko S,,,0,793
933,Student Moon Observations and Spatial-Scientific Reasoning,"Relationships between sixth grade students' moon journaling and students' spatial-scientific reasoning after implementation of an Earth/Space unit were examined. Teachers used the project-based Realistic Explorations in Astronomical Learning curriculum. We used a regression model to analyze the relationship between the students' Lunar Phases Concept Inventory (LPCI) post-test score variables and several predictors, including moon journal score, number of moon journal entries, student gender, teacher experience, and pre-test score. The model shows that students who performed better on moon journals, both in terms of overall score and number of entries, tended to score higher on the LPCI. For every 1 point increase in the overall moon journal score, participants scored 0.18 points (out of 20) or nearly 1% point higher on the LPCI post-test when holding constant the effects of the other two predictors. Similarly, students who increased their scores by 1 point in the overall moon journal score scored approximately 1% higher in the Periodic Patterns (PP) and Geometric Spatial Visualization (GSV) domains of the LPCI. Also, student gender and teacher experience were shown to be significant predictors of post-GSV scores on the LPCI in addition to the pre-test scores, overall moon journal score, and number of entries that were also significant predictors on the LPCI overall score and the PP domain. This study is unique in the purposeful link created between student moon observations and spatial skills. The use of moon journals distinguishes this study further by fostering scientific observation along with skills from across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.",Video Meta Results Raw,Cole M and Wilhelm J and Yang H,,,0,794
934,Global Determinants of Navigation Ability,"Human spatial ability is modulated by a number of factors, including age [1-3] and gender [4, 5]. Although a few studies showed that culture influences cognitive strategies [6-13], the interaction between these factors has never been globally assessed as this requires testing millions of people of all ages across many different countries in the world. Since countries vary in their geographical and cultural properties, we predicted that these variations give rise to an organized spatial distribution of cognition at a planetary-wide scale. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mobile-app-based cognitive task, measuring non-verbal spatial navigation ability in more than 2.5 million people and sampling populations in every nation state. We focused on spatial navigation due to its universal requirement across cultures. Using a clustering approach, we find that navigation ability is clustered into five distinct, yet geographically related, groups of countries. Specifically, the economic wealth of a nation was predictive of the average navigation ability of its inhabitants, and gender inequality was predictive of the size of performance difference between males and females. Thus, cognitive abilities, at least for spatial navigation, are clustered according to economic wealth and gender inequalities globally, which has significant implications for cross-cultural studies and multi-center clinical trials using cognitive testing.",PATH-INTEGRATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GENDER EQUALITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; NORTH-AMERICA; MEMORY; METAANALYSIS; MATHEMATICS; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology; Video Meta Results Raw,Coutrot A and Silva R and Manley E and de Cothi W and Sami S and Bohbot VD and Wiener JM and Holscher C and Dalton RC and Hornberger M and Spiers HJ,,,0,795

936,Mental rotation test performance in four cross-cultural samples (N = 3367): Overall sex differences and the role of academic program in performance,"Two meta-analyses (Linn and Petersen, 1985; Voyer et al., 1995) discuss variables that affect mental rotation performance but they do not mention a potentially important variable, the Academic Program in which students are enrolled. Sex differences in brain size have been related to sex differences in spatial performance (e.g., Falk et al., 1999) and thus it is important to know whether mental rotation performance shows a significant interaction between Sex and Academic Program. To put our understanding of the Academic Program effect on a firmer empirical footing, we conducted a large scale multicultural study, with samples from Canada, Germany and Japan, using identical test procedures in all studies. Significant main effects for Sex and Academic Program were found in all four studies, with large effect sizes for Sex and medium to large effect sizes for Academic Program (based on Cohen's d). No significant interactions between these variables were found in the four samples. Our demonstration of a reliable Academic Program effect has clear and important pragmatic implications for a broad range of work on spatial ability and its interpretation.

938,Videoconferencing Psychotherapy: A Systematic Review,"Individuals with mental health problems may face barriers to accessing effective psychotherapies. Videoconferencing technology, which allows audio and video information to be shared concurrently across geographical distances, offers an alternative that may improve access. We conducted a systematic literature review of the use of videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP), designed to address 10 specific questions, including therapeutic types/formats that have been implemented, the populations with which VCP is being used, the number and types of publications related to VCP, and available satisfaction, feasibility, and outcome data related to VCP. After electronic searches and reviews of reference lists, 821 potential articles were identified, and 65 were selected for inclusion. The results indicate that VCP is feasible, has been used in a variety of therapeutic formats and with diverse populations, is generally associated with good user satisfaction, and is found to have similar clinical outcomes to traditional face-to-face psychotherapy. Although the number of articles being published on VCP has increased in recent years, there remains a need for additional large-scale clinical trials to further assess the efficacy and effectiveness of VCP.",Video Meta Results Raw,Backhaus A and Agha Z and Maglione ML and Repp A and Ross B and Zuest D and Rice-Thorp NM and Lohr J and Thorp SR,,,0,799

Design and validation of the Serious Games Evaluation Scale,"Although a number of researchers consider serious games as effective teaching/learning tools, the literature is fragmented when it comes to the factors that shape the users' experience and views. We are currently lacking a comprehensive tool that simultaneously examines their effectiveness while contrasting user views. The study is an attempt to fill this gap. It reports the development and validation of a scale which initially included seventy-two items belonging to thirteen factors. A total of 542 university students played two serious games and the aforementioned questionnaire was administered to them. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed that twelve factors and fifty-three items should be retained. The final version of the Serious Games Evaluation Scale demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity.

The current study aimed to examine the lateralization of attentional components in AVGPs. Twenty-nine AVGPs and twenty-six non-AVG players (NAVGPs) were recruited based on their frequency and intensity of playing action video games in the last 6 months. A lateralized attentional network test was used to measure the lateralization of attentional components in the two groups. The results showed that AVGPs exhibited comparable performance in the left and right hemispheres for reorienting and executive components. However, NAVGPs exhibited a significant difference between the two hemispheres for the two components. The findings indicate that AVG playing is closely associated with reduced lateralization of attentional networks.","action video game playing; attention; lateralization; executive; reorienting; INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; LINE BISECTION REVEALS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; HUMAN BRAIN; EFFICIENCY; SYSTEM; INDEPENDENCE; METAANALYSIS; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Li Y and Jin X and Wang Y and Niu D,,,0,801

943,Evaluating the role of digital intervention design in treatment outcomes and adherence to eTherapy programs for eating disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective Despite the existence of reviews which document the effectiveness of online therapies, there is little consensus regarding the exact components of online treatment delivery that are most effective in maintaining user engagement and reducing eating disorder (ED) symptomology. The current review and meta-analysis aimed to determine which components of web-based, ED self-help interventions are associated with lower attrition and improved therapeutic outcome. Method A systematic search of electronic databases (PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus) was conducted for published studies of web-based interventions for EDs and a meta-analysis of the final included studies was performed. Each intervention was coded across four dimensions, including the multimedia channels employed (e.g., text, audio, videos), degree of user interactivity (e.g., online self-monitoring, skills exercises), level of automated feedback (e.g., reminders, personalized feedback), and technological device through which the program was accessed (e.g., smartphone, computer). Results A final 23 papers were included. The results of meta-regressions indicated that higher scores on the multimedia subscale were associated with greater ED symptom improvement in treatment groups. Conversely, a higher degree of feedback in the treatment group was associated with a group difference in ED psychopathology favoring the control group. Other intervention components were not associated with treatment outcome or dropout. Discussion The results are discussed in relation to limitations of the scale used to quantify digital intervention features, as well as the limited diversity and technological sophistication of available ED digital interventions. Such findings indicate the importance of understanding the digital components, which differentiate online therapeutic programs.","feeding and eating disorders; internet; multimedia; psychopathology; smartphone; tablets; treatment outcome; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; GUIDED SELF-HELP; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; BULIMIA-NERVOSA; INTERNET; FEASIBILITY; OVERWEIGHT; ALLIANCE; SYMPTOMS; POWER; Psychology, Clinical; Nutrition & Dietetics; Psychiatry; Psychology; Psychology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw",Barakat S and Maguire S and Smith KE and Mason TB and Crosby RD and Touyz S,,,1,803
944,Psychosocial aspects of genetic screening of pregnant women and newborns: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: To address five broad questions concerned with knowledge, anxiety, factors associated with participation/non-participation in screening programmes and the long-term sequelae of false-positive, true-positive in newborns and true-negative results. DATA SOURCES: Five electronic databases, two journals and attempts were made to locate unpublished work. REVIEW METHODS: This review started from a substantial literature base that provided the basis for (a) scoping the literature, (b) informing search strategy terms and (c) identifying preliminary article inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main eligibility criteria were: any screening programme aimed at pregnant women or newborn babies that included a 'genetic' target condition, this included chromosomal anomalies; any study that reported psychosocial data collected directly from parents. The data extraction form developed for this study elicited data from the selected studies. The data were entered into a database, which provided a summary of the included papers. RESULTS: A total of 288 candidate publications were identified, 106 of which were eligible: 78 were concerned with antenatal screening and 28 with newborn screening. It was found that levels of knowledge adequate for decision-making were not being achieved despite information leaflets and videos having some effect. Studies that have succeeded in increasing knowledge have not observed a corresponding increase in anxiety, although some anxiety might be an appropriate response and may aid coping and decision-making. Anxiety is clearly raised in women receiving positive screening results, especially young women. However, evidence is lacking of a beneficial (i.e. reassuring) effect of receiving a screen-negative result. Anxiety in screen-positive women falls on receipt of subsequent reassuring results, but some residual anxiety may remain. A minority (perhaps up to 30%) of women receiving a screen-positive result in pregnancy expressed regret about their screening decision. Uptake of neonatal screening has been treated as a 'given' and not as a research topic. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review have many implications for the work of the National Screening Committee. The most pressing of these, in order of priority, relate to: the inadequacy of current procedures for achieving informed consent; the cost of providing a satisfactory service; the unmet needs of 'false-positives', and the unmet needs of women's partners, particularly in carrier screening. It is suggested that research is conducted on the above four topics in order to fill gaps in the evidence base that relate to screening technologies which have been available for many years. In addition, future screening programmes will create a new list of research questions, based on the same main agenda but applied to new areas, for example, new conditions such as haemoglobinopathies and fragile X syndrome; new client groups such as young women and minority ethnic groups; and new testing modalities such as ultrasound.",Video Meta Results Raw,Green JM and Hewison J and Bekker HL and Bryant LD and Cuckle HS,,,0,804

947,Speech databases for mental disorders: A systematic review,"Background: The employment of clinical databases in the study of mental disorders is essential to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with mental illness. While text corpora obtain merely limited information of content, speech corpora capture tones, emotions, rhythms and many other signals beyond content. Hence, the design and development of speech corpora for patients with mental disorders is increasingly important. Aim: This review aims to extract the existing speech corpora for mental disorders from online databases and peer-reviewed journals in order to demonstrate both achievements and challenges in this area. Methods: The review first covers publications or resources worldwide, and then leads to the reports from China, followed by a comparison between Chinese and non-Chinese regions. Results: Most of the speech databases were recorded in Europe or the United States by audio or video. Some were even supplemented by brain images and Event-Related Potential (ERP) statistics. The corpora were mostly developed for patients with neurocognitive disorders like stutter and aphasia, and mental illness like dementia, while other types of mental illness such as bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression and autism were scarce in number in database development. Strengths and limitations: The results demonstrated that database development of neurocognitive disorders in China is much scarcer than that in some European countries, but the existing databases pave an instructive road for psychiatric problems. Also, the methods and applications of databases from the leading countries are inspiring for Chinese scholars, who are searching methods for developing a comprehensive resource for clinical studies.",speech database; mental disorder; review; systematic; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ACCURACY; LANGUAGE; DISEASE; Psychiatry; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Li Y and Lin Y and Ding H and Li C,,,0,806
948,Real-World Persuasion From Virtual-World Campaigns: How Transportation Into Virtual Worlds Moderates In-Game Influence,"With the general public spending increasing amounts of time in virtual gaming worlds, it is relevant to explore social influence dynamics that can occur in virtual reality settings. Three studies tested the hypothesis that transportation into a virtual game heightens susceptibility to influence from in-game health communications. Study 1 participants played a first-person shooter game that had either landscape paintings or graphic anti-DUI (drive under the influence of alcohol) messages embedded in the background of scenes. Results indicated that, to the extent gamers were transported into the virtual experiences in the game, willingness to DUI was reduced by the presence of anti-DUI graphic messages. Study 2 explored potential mechanisms driving this effect and revealed evidence that transportation disrupts counter-arguing among individuals who might otherwise resist real-world influence attempts. Study 3 replicated Studies 1 and 2 findings but also pointed to a potential boomerang effect that can occur when transportation is not achieved in a game. Discussion focused on the potential positive and negative consequences of embedding persuasive health communications into the background of virtual gaming worlds.",Video Meta Results Raw,Burrows CN and Blanton H,,,0,807
949,Selecting media for effective learning in online and blended courses: A review study,"As the number of online and blended learning courses offered by higher education institutions increase, a predominant issue for instructors is their design. This study focuses on the selection of appropriate media to support online and blended learning (OBL) activities. To this end, we mapped and synthesized in two consecutive systematic review studies the effectiveness of particular media formats on students’ learning outcomes. Eleven empirical studies with a quasi-experimental research design and thirteen studies with randomized allocation to treatment conditions were selected for a detailed analysis. The cumulative findings indicate that ten particular media attributes are of paramount importance for effective learning in OBL courses: interactivity, navigability, (a)synchronicity, flexibility, media richness, ease of use, individualization, mobility, proximity and responsiveness. Furthermore, while the study affirms the theoretical underpinnings regarding multimedia learning and media richness, it exposed that further scrutiny in the field of media selection for application in natural settings of OBL is necessary. Future directions for research are proposed. The outcomes may be useful to OBL instructors and instructional designers in higher education.

952,Interventions to improve decision making and reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the management of prostate cancer: A systematic review,"Objectives: Ethnic minorities are disproportionately impacted by prostate cancer (PCa) and are at risk for not receiving informed decision making (IDM). We conducted a systematic literature review on interventions to improve: (1) IDM about PCa in screening eligible minority men, and (2) quality of life (QOL) in minority PCa survivors. Data Sources: MeSH headings for PCa, ethnic minorities, and interventions were searched in MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Subject Eligibility Criteria: We identified U.S.- based, English-language articles (1985–2010) on interventions to improve PCa IDM and QOL that included 50 % or more minority patients or analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: Articles (n = 19) were evaluated and scored for quality using a Downs and Black (DB) system. Interventions were organized by those enhancing 1) IDM about PCa screening and 2) improving QOL and symptom among PCa survivors. Outcomes were reported by intervention type (educational seminar, printed material, telephone-based, video and web-based). Results: Fourteen studies evaluated interventions for enhancing IDM about PCa screening and five evaluated programs to improve outcomes for PCa survivors. Knowledge scores were statistically significantly increased in 12 of 13 screening studies that measured knowledge, with ranges of effect varying across intervention types: educational programs (13 %–48 % increase), print (11 %–18 %), videotape/DVD (16 %), and web-based (7 %–20 %). In the final screening study, an intervention to improve decision-making about screening increased decisional self-efficacy by 9 %. Five cognitive-behavioral interventions improved QOL among minority men being treated for localized PCa through enhancing problem solving and coping skills. Limitations: Weak study designs, small sample sizes, selection biases, and variation in follow-up intervals across studies. Conclusions: Educational programs were the most effective intervention for improving knowledge among screening-eligible minority men. Cognitive behavioral strategies improved QOL for minority men treated for localized PCa.

953,Video Lottery is the Most Harmful Form of Gambling in Canada,"This paper summarizes the degree to which different forms of legal gambling contribute to Problem and Pathological Gambling (PPG) in Canada. Legal gambling activities were compared using meta-analysis of publicly available data concerning Canada's legal gambling industry. The majority of revenues in the decade spanning 2002-2012 were drawn from Video Lottery Terminals and casino slot machines. Population surveys indicated that three quarters of Canadians reported some form of past-year gambling participation, but most did not play Electronic Gambling Machines. Annual revenues divided by estimated numbers of participants in various gambling activities showed that Video Lottery players spent more money on average than did participants in other forms of gambling. The relative risk of PPG was higher among Video Lottery players than it was for other common forms of gambling. Results from a community study of frequent Video Lottery players showed that the risk of frequent players reporting symptoms of PPG was elevated if they reported playing weekly, spending $50 or more per session, or playing for more than an hour per session. These studies provide converging evidence that Video Lottery is more hazardous to consumers than other forms of gambling that are commonly practised in Canada.",Video Meta Results Raw,MacLaren VV,,,0,812
954,UNDERSTANDING MEDIA VIOLENCE FROM A ROLE-PLAY PERSPECTIVE Effects of Various Types of Violent Video Games on Players' Cognitive Aggression,"In this study I investigated the effects of depicted character roles and wishful identification with the main character on aggression and game enjoyment among players in violent video games. The results (n = 36) showed that character roles (e.g., the police, gangster, and athlete) did not have any significant effect on post-game aggression. However, there was a significant association among depicted character roles, wishful identification, and game enjoyment. Implications in terms of the level of aggression, identification with the game character, and game enjoyment are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Jung Y,,,0,813
955,Use of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy techniques in sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism: systematic review,"The past two decades have seen rapidly changing attitudes towards the surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism. Advances in localisation techniques and confidence with endoscopy have led to the development of numerous minimally invasive parathyroidectomy approaches, including open minimal incision and endoscopic and video-assisted parathyroidectomy. This paper systematically reviews the evidence for these methods to determine: (1) whether these new, minimally invasive techniques are comparable to conventional bilateral neck exploration methods in terms of success and complication rate; and (2) if they are comparable, which technique is likely to be best for cosmesis, patient safety and patient satisfaction. A search of the Medline, Cochrane Reviews and Scopus databases was conducted, using a defined list of search parameters. Abstracts were compared against inclusion and exclusion criteria, before the full text was sought and analysed for data. The evidence from each study was then assessed, based on study quality, and a recommendation made based on the level of evidence available. There is level 1b evidence that minimally invasive surgery is comparable to bilateral neck exploration in terms of efficacy and complication rates. This paper recommends that the treatment of choice for solitary adenoma (in most healthcare centres) should be open minimal incision parathyroidectomy, due to advantages in operative duration, learning curve and cost-effectiveness.",Video Meta Results Raw,Gracie D and Hussain SS,,,0,814
956,Recommendations to Enhance Psychotherapy Supervision in Psychology,"Two primary goals of clinical supervision are to promote and evaluate trainees' acquisition of professional competencies and to protect and enhance client welfare. To help supervisors achieve these goals, this article reviews the current usage and benefits of 5 important supervisory practices: direct observation (live or recorded); progress monitoring; experiential learning methods (modelling, role-playing, and providing constructive feedback based on observation); less biased summative evaluation procedures; and diversity-focused supervision. The article concludes with recommendations for research, changes in supervisory practice, and changes in the regulation of supervision and supervisor training within accreditation standards and provincial requirements for licensure. Public Significance Statement Professional psychology training relies extensively on supervision to develop, maintain, and evaluate the professional competencies of psychologists-in-training and to oversee the welfare of the clients they serve. This literature review identified gaps between recommended and typical supervision of professional psychology supervisees. Recommendations to enhance the practice of supervision during the course of professional training are to incorporate direct observation, client data, experiential learning methods, unbiased evaluation methods, and a greater focus on diversity.","supervision; clinical supervision; supervisory recommendations; effective supervision; supervision competencies; CLINICAL SUPERVISION; MULTICULTURAL COMPETENCE; RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS; COMMUNICATION-SKILLS; CLIENT FEEDBACK; THERAPY; OUTCOMES; MODEL; VIDEO; METAANALYSIS; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Johnson EA,,,0,815

958,Stable Specification Search in Structural Equation Models with Latent Variables,"In our previous study, we introduced stable specification search for cross-sectional data (S3C). It is an exploratory causal method that combines the concept of stability selection and multi-objective optimization to search for stable and parsimonious causal structures across the entire range of model complexities. S3C, however, is designed to model causal relations among observed variables. In this study, we extended S3C to S3C-Latent, to model linear causal relations between latent variables that are measured through observed proxies. We evaluated S3C-Latent on simulated data and compared the results to those of PC-MIMBuild, an extension of the PC algorithm, the state-of-the-art causal discovery method. The comparison shows that S3C-Latent achieved better performance. We also applied S3C-Latent to real-world data of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and data about measuring mental abilities among pupils. The results are consistent with those of previous studies.","Causal modeling; structural equation model with latent variables; specification search; stability selection; multi-objective evolutionary algorithm; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; SPATIAL ABILITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; CAUSAL; ADHD; OPTIMIZATION; METAANALYSIS; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science; Video Meta Results Raw",Rahmadi R and Groot P and Heskes T,,,0,817
960,"Depressive Symptoms, Rumination, and Emotion Reactivity Among Youth: Moderation by Gender","The emotion context-insensitivity hypothesis (ECI; Rottenberg et al., 2005) posits that depressive symptoms are associated with blunted emotional reactivity and is supported by the results of a meta-analysis (Bylsma et al., 2008). Yet it remains unclear how strongly ECI holds across emotional response domains, whether ECI operates similarly in male and female individuals, and whether this pattern of underreactivity is observed in youth. In contrast, rumination, a cognitive style strongly associated with depressive symptoms, may be associated with heightened reactivity. We assessed the effects of youth's depressive symptoms and rumination on subjective and physiological emotion reactivity (N = 160; Mage = 12.67, SDage = 1.12; 48% female; 94% non-Hispanic). State sadness and respiratory sinus arrhythmia were assessed during a baseline activity (nature video) and a sad mood induction. As hypothesized, depressive symptoms predicted less subjective emotional reactivity, whereas rumination predicted more subjective reactivity. Exploratory analyses revealed that associations for physiological reactivity differed by child gender. ECI may be stronger in terms of subjective rather than physiological emotional reactivity.",depressive symptoms; rumination; emotion reactivity; youth; gender; sadness; respiratory sinus arrhythmia; Emotional Responses; Major Depression; Rumination (Cognitive Process); Adolescent Psychopathology; Cognitive Style; Human Sex Differences; Mental Health; Respiration; Sadness; Symptoms; Video Meta Results Raw,Somers JA and Borelli JL and Hilt LM,,,0,818

962,Training for vigilance on the move: a video game-based paradigm for sustained attention,"The capacity for superior vigilance can be trained by using knowledge of results (KR). Our present experiments demonstrate the efficacy of such training using a first-person perspective movement videogame-based platform in samples of students and Soldiers. Effectiveness was assessed by manipulating KR during a training phase and withdrawing it in a subsequent transfer phase. Relative to a no KR control condition, KR systematically improved performance for both Soldiers and students. These results build upon our previous findings that demonstrated that a video game-based platform can be used to create a movement-centred sustained attention task with important elements of traditional vigilance. The results indicate that KR effects in sustained attention extend to a first person perspective movement based paradigm, and that these effects occur in professional military as well as a more general population. Such sustained attention training can save lives and the present findings demonstrate one particular avenue to achieve this goal.Practitioner Summary: Sustained attention can be trained by means of knowledge of results using a videogame-based platform with samples of students and Soldiers. Four experiments demonstrate that a dynamic, first-person perspective video game environment can serve to support effective sustained attention training in professional military as well as a more general population.","Sustained attention; vigilance; knowledge of results; transfer of training; video game-based vigilance; IED detection; MONITORING TASK; VISUAL-SEARCH; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; STRESS; DECREMENT; WORKLOAD; FEEDBACK; NOISE; METAANALYSIS; Engineering, Industrial; Ergonomics; Psychology, Applied; Psychology; Engineering; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Szalma JL and Daly TN and Teo GW and Hancock GM and Hancock PA,,,0,820
963,Visuo-spatial neglect: A systematic review of current interventions and their effectiveness,"Left visuo-spatial neglect is a well-recognized predictor of poor functional outcome following right hemisphere stroke. Over the past 60 years, 18 different methods have been described and evaluated aimed at reducing the effects of this impairment. Although there are some grounds for optimism particularly in terms of short-term impairment-based effects, the range and degree of disability borne by many patients remain high and the clinical effectiveness of the different methods viewed in terms of long-lasting functional improvement (i.e. improvement of disabilities or handicap) is not clear. A systematic review of the available clinically relevant literature, using comparative and stringent levels of evidence, indicates that visual scanning training (VST), trunk rotation (TR) or repeated neck muscle vibrations (NMV) when associated with an extensive training program, mental imagery training, video feedback training and prism adaptation (PA) can be recommended for the rehabilitation of patients with left neglect. More studies however are needed to determine the optimal paradigm of limb activation (LA) eliciting a sustained functional improvement. Sensory stimulations alone and Fresnel prisms do not appear to be functionally relevant. For the other methods, the actual literature is not sufficient to conclude whether or not a long-term functional improvement can be achieved.

964,Meta-analysis of digital game and study characteristics eliciting physiological stress responses,"Digital games have been used as stressors in a range of disciplines for decades. Nonetheless, the underlying characteristics of these stressors and the study in which the stressor was applied are generally not recognized for their moderating effect on the measured physiological stress responses. We have therefore conducted a meta-analysis that analyzes the effects of characteristics of digital game stressors and study design on heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, in studies carried out from 1976 to 2012. In order to assess the differing quality between study designs, a new scale is developed and presented, coined reliability of effect size. The results show specific and consistent moderating functions of both game and study characteristics, on average accounting for around 43%, and in certain cases up to 57% of the variance found in physiological stress responses. Possible cognitive and physiological processes underlying these moderating functions are discussed, and a new model integrating these processes with the moderating functions is presented. These findings indicate that a digital game stressor does not act as a stressor by virtue of being a game, but rather derives its stressor function from its characteristics and the methodology in which it is used. This finding, together with the size of the associated moderations, indicates the need for a standardization of digital game stressors.",Physiological stress response; Digital game; Stressor; Meta‐analysis; Game characteristics; Study characteristics; Games; Physiological Stress; Virtue; Digital Video; Physiology; Meta-analysis; Video Meta Results Raw,van der Vijgh B and Beun RJ and Van Rood M and Werkhoven P,,,0,822

966,Sideways fall-induced impact force and its effect on hip fracture risk: a review,"Osteoporotic hip fracture, mostly induced in falls among the elderly, is a major health burden over the world. The impact force applied to the hip is an important factor in determining the risk of hip fracture. However, biomechanical researches have yielded conflicting conclusions about whether the fall-induced impact force can be accurately predicted by the available models. It also has been debated whether or not the effect of impact force has been considered appropriately in hip fracture risk assessment tools. This study aimed to provide a state-of-the-art review of the available methods for predicting the impact force, investigate their strengths/limitations, and suggest further improvements in modeling of human body falling. METHODS: We divided the effective parameters on impact force to two categories: (1) the parameters that can be determined subject-specifically and (2) the parameters that may significantly vary from fall to fall for an individual and cannot be considered subject-specifically. RESULTS: The parameters in the first category can be investigated in human body fall experiments. Video capture of real-life falls was reported as a valuable method to investigate the parameters in the second category that significantly affect the impact force and cannot be determined in human body fall experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the gathered data revealed that there is a need to develop modified biomechanical models for more accurate prediction of the impact force and appropriately adopt them in hip fracture risk assessment tools in order to achieve a better precision in identifying high-risk patients.

969,What do we mean by web-based learning? A systematic review of the variability of interventions,"Objectives: Educators often speak of web-based learning (WBL) as a single entity or a cluster of similar activities with homogeneous effects. Yet a recent systematic review demonstrated large heterogeneity among results from individual studies. Our purpose is to describe the variation in configurations, instructional methods and presentation formats in WBL. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, CINAHL and other databases (last search November 2008) for studies comparing a WBL intervention with no intervention or another educational activity. From eligible studies we abstracted information on course participants, topic, configuration and instructional methods. We summarized this information and then purposively selected and described several WBL interventions that illustrate specific technologies and design features. Results: We identified 266 eligible studies. Nearly all courses (89 ) used written text and most (55 ) used multimedia. A total of 32 used online communication via e-mail, threaded discussion, chat or videoconferencing, and 9 implemented synchronous components. Overall, 24 blended web-based and non-computer-based instruction. Most web-based courses (77 ) employed specific instructional methods, other than text alone, to enhance the learning process. The most common instructional methods (each used in nearly 50 of courses) were patient cases, self-assessment questions and feedback. We describe several studies to illustrate the range of instructional designs. Conclusions: Educators and researchers cannot treat WBL as a single entity. Many different configurations and instructional methods are available for WBL instructors. Researchers should study when to use specific WBL designs and how to use them effectively.

970,Explaining the modality effect in multimedia learning: Is it due to a lack of temporal contiguity with written text and pictures?,"The study examined whether the modality effect is caused by either high visuo-spatial load or a lack of temporal contiguity when processing written text and pictures. Students (N = 147) viewed pictures on the development of tornados, which were accompanied by either spoken or written explanations presented simultaneously with, before, or after the pictures. For verbal recall no modality effect was observed, whereas for transfer the influence of modality varied as a function of phonological working memory capacity. For pictorial recall the results showed a modality effect that was limited to simultaneous presentation, apparently in line with the temporal contiguity explanation. However, spoken simultaneous presentations were not superior to spoken sequential presentations, which contradicts the temporal contiguity explanation for the modality effect. Rather, it seems as if learners with simultaneous presentation of written text and picture concentrated more on the text and ignored the pictures, resulting in worse pictorial recall.

971,Special Considerations in the Adaptation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia With Active-Duty US Army Personnel,"Insomnia is highly prevalent among active-duty military service members. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a well established and effective treatment; however, research and treatment recommendations have primarily focused on civilian or veteran populations. A multitude of military-specific factors directly impact service members' sleep and the subsequent treatment recommendations. This article provides treatment considerations for the use of CBT-I with active-duty U.S. Army personnel. First, an overview of the theoretical model of insomnia, including military-specific predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors, is presented, followed by a review of common comorbid conditions among service members with insomnia. Finally, discussion focuses on considerations and strategies for implementing components of CBT-I with service members, managing sleep during deployments, and adjusting sleep to accommodate overnight duties. Additional training resources and supplemental video examples (with actors) are provided.","insomnia; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia; active-duty military; deployment; treatment; SLEEP RESTRICTION THERAPY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; PRIMARY-CARE; INTERVENTION; METAANALYSIS; DISTURBANCE; VETERANS; PREVALENCE; OPERATIONS; DEPLOYMENT; Psychology, Clinical; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Pruiksma KE and Fina B and Dietch JR and Dondanville KA and Williams J and Wright EC and Molino A and Hall-Clark B and Nicholson KL and Peterson AL and Taylor DJ,,,0,827
972,Meta-analysis of deep neural networks in remote sensing: A comparative study of mono-temporal classification to support vector machines,"Deep learning methods have recently found widespread adoption for remote sensing tasks, particularly in image or pixel classification. Their flexibility and versatility has enabled researchers to propose many different designs to process remote sensing data in all spectral, spatial, and temporal dimensions. In most of the reported cases they surpass their non-deep rivals in overall classification accuracy. However, there is considerable diversity in implementation details in each case and a systematic quantitative comparison to non-deep classifiers does not exist. In this paper, we look at the major research papers that have studied deep learning image classifiers in recent years and undertake a meta-analysis on their performance compared to the most used non-deep rival, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. We focus on mono-temporal classification as the time-series image classification did not offer sufficient samples. Our work covered 103 manuscripts and included 92 cases that supported direct accuracy comparisons between deep learners and SVMs. Our general findings are the following: (i) Deep networks have better performance than non-deep spectral SVM implementations, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) performing better than other deep learners. This advantage, however, diminishes when feeding SVM with richer features extracted from data (e.g. spatial filters). (ii) Transfer learning and fine-tuning on pre-trained CNNs are offering promising results over spectral or enhanced SVM, however these pre-trained networks are currently limited to RGB input data, therefore currently lack applicability in multi/hyperspectral data. (iii) There is no strong relationship between network complexity and accuracy gains over SVM; small to medium networks perform similarly to more complex networks. (iv) Contrary to the popular belief, there are numerous cases of high deep networks performance with training proportions of 10% or less. Our study also indicates that the new generation of classifiers is often overperforming existing benchmark datasets, with accuracies surpassing 99%. There is a clear need for new benchmark dataset collections with diverse spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions and coverage that will enable us to study the design generalizations, challenge these new classifiers, and further advance remote sensing science. Our community could also benefit from a coordinated effort to create a large pre-trained network specifically designed for remote sensing images that users could later fine-tune and adjust to their study specifics.","Deep learning; Classification; Convolutional neural network; Deep belief network; Stacked auto encoder; Support vector machine; SPECTRAL-SPATIAL CLASSIFICATION; LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; SCENE CLASSIFICATION; SATELLITE IMAGES; HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGES; REPRESENTATIONS; EXTRACTION; CNN; INFORMATION; MULTISCALE; Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Physical Geography; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Video Meta Results Raw",Heydari SS and Mountrakis G,,,0,828

975,Meta-analysis of sex differences in rodent models of learning and memory: A review of behavioral and biological data,"The existence of sex differences in the standard rat and mouse models of learning and memory is a controversial and contested topic in the literature. The present meta-analysis of radial maze and water maze experiments was conducted to assess the reliablility and magnitude of sex effects in the standard rodent models of learning and memory. Data were culled from published and unpublished sources. Findings indicate large reliable male advantages for rats in radial maze and water maze protocols. Significant strain differences were also identified. In each paradigm, protocol variations were associated with differential sex effects. For the water maze, smaller male advantages were associated with pretraining regimens and for the radial maze, larger significant male advantages were observed in protocols that included unbaited arms (combined reference and working memory protocols). Mouse studies exhibited a different pattern of sex effects; small female advantages were evident in the water maze, but small male advantages were evident in the radial maze. Together these findings establish the reliability of male advantages in spatial working and reference memory for rats across strains, protocols, ages and rearing environments. The findings also support an important species dichotomy between rats and mice that should be considered when transitioning from rat to mouse models. In light of these results, the biological evidence supporting theoretical explanations of sex differences is reviewed and evaluated.

976,"Research on multimorbidity in primary care. Selected abstracts from the EGPRN meeting in Tampere, Finland, 9-12 May 2019 All abstracts of the conference can be found at the EGPRN website: www.egprn.org/page/conference-abstracts","Current primary care in Finland is based on the Primary Health Care Act (1972), which addressed numerous new tasks to all municipalities. All of them had to find a new health centre organization, which provides a wide range of health services, including prevention and public health promotion. Multiple tasks require multiprofessional staff, and thus, the Finnish health centre personnel consisted not only of GPs but of public health nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, psychologists, social workers, dentists, etc. During the next decade, there have been some changes but the idea of multiprofessional structure has remained. According to the QUALICOPC study (2012) Finnish GPs are still co-located with several other healthcare professionals compared to most of the European countries; even compared to other Nordic countries which otherwise have many similarities in their primary healthcare. During the last 10 or 15 years, healthcare providers and researchers have recognized a new challenge: our current systems do not meet the needs of patients with multiple health and social problems-and the proportion of these patients is increasing all the time as the population is getting older. One could suppose that preconditions of handling multimorbidity would be excellent in multiprofessional surroundings like ours, but actually, a person with multiple problems is a challenge there, too. Multiprofessional organization in primary care does not guarantee proper care of patients with multiple diseases, if we do not acknowledge the challenge and revise our systems. We have to develop new ways of collaboration and new models of integrated care. The problematic part is secondary care, which is organized with logic of one medical speciality per visit. In Tampere University Hospital district, we have created a care pathway model, which defines the roles of primary healthcare and secondary care. Nationwide, we have recently started to prepare national guidelines for the care of patients with multimorbidity. What we need more in the future is more research on new practices and models. Background: Most patients with antihypertensive medication do not achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. Several barriers to successful hypertension treatment are well identified but we need novel ways of addressing them. Research question: Can using a checklist improve the quality of care in the initiation of new antihypertensive medication? Methods: This non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled study was conducted in eight primary care study centres in central Finland, randomized to function as either intervention (n = 4) or control sites (n = 4). We included patients aged 30-75 years who were prescribed antihypertensive medication for the first time. Initiation of medication in the intervention group was carried out with a nine-item checklist, filled in together by the treating physician and the patient. The treating physician managed hypertension treatment in the control group without a study-specific protocol. Results: In total, 119 patients were included in the study, of which 118 were included in the analysis (n = 59 in the control group, n = 59 in the intervention group). When initiating medication, an adequate BP target was set for 19% of the patients in the control group and for 68% in the intervention group. Shortly after the appointment, only 14% of the patients in the control group were able to remember the adequate BP target, compared with 32% in the intervention group. The use of the checklist was also related to more regular agreement on the next follow-up appointment (64% in the control group vs 95% in the intervention group). Conclusion: Even highly motivated new hypertensive patients in Finnish primary care have significant gaps in their treatment-related skills. The use of a checklist for initiation of antihypertensive medication was related to substantial improvement in these skills. Based on our findings, the use of a checklist might be a practical tool for clinicians initiating new antihypertensive medications. Background: Immediate feedback is underused in the French medical education curriculum, specifically with video-recorded consultation. Research question: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and the interest in this teaching method as a training and assessment tool in the learning process of general practitioner (GP) trainees. Methods: During the period November 2017 to October 2018, trainees in ambulatory training courses collected quantitative data about recording consultations with a video camera: numbers of recordings, feedback, patients' participation refusals, and information about the learning process and competencies. The trainees' level of satisfaction was measured by means of a questionnaire at the end of their traineeship. Results: Sixty-seven trainees were recruited and 44 of them 65.7% actively participated in the study; 607 video recordings and 243 feedback with trainers were performed. Few patients (18.5%) refused the video-recording. Most trainees considered video recording with immediate feedback to be a relevant learning tool. It made it possible for the participants to observe their difficulties and their achievements. 'Relation, communication, patient-centred care' was the most built competency, non-verbal communication, in particular. Time was the main limiting factor of this teaching method. Most trainees were in favour of its generalization in their university course. Conclusion: Video recording with immediate feedback in real-time consultation needs to be adapted to training areas and depends on time and logistics. This teaching method seems to be useful in the development of communication skills. It could lift the barriers of the trainer's physical presence near GP trainees during immediate feedback in real-time consultation. It could help trainees to build their competencies while enhancing the place of immediate feedback in the general practice curriculum. It could also constitute an additional tool for the certification of GP trainees. Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with psychiatric morbidity in mothers and their offspring. This study assessed the prevalence of perinatal depressive symptoms in a large population of women and investigated associations of these symptoms with demographic and clinical factors. Research question: Which factors (including sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test) are associated with perinatal depression? Methods: All members of Maccabi Health Services who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during 2015-2016 were included in the study. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for associations of sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test factors with perinatal depressive symptoms, according to a score >10 on the EPDS. Results: Of 27 912 women who filled the EPDS, 2029 (7.3%) were classified as having peripartum depression. In a logistic regression analysis, the use of antidepressant medications, particularly for a period greater than three months, Arab background, current or past smoking, a diagnosis of chronic diabetes and age under 25 years were all associated with increased ORs for perinatal depression; while Orthodox Jewish affiliation, residence in the periphery and higher haemoglobin level were associated with lower ORs. Incidences of depression were 17.4% in women with a history of antidepressant medication, 16% among women with diabetes, and 11.8% among current smokers. Conclusion: Several demographic, medical, and lifetime factors were found to be substantially more prevalent among women with symptoms of perinatal depression than those without. Encouraging women to complete the EPDS during and following pregnancy may help identify women in need of support. Background: Regulating the quality and effectiveness of the work of general practitioners is essential for a sound healthcare system. In the Republic of Macedonia this is regulated by the Health Insurance Fund through a system of penalties/sanctions. Research question: The goal of this study is to evaluate the types and effectiveness of the sanctions used on primary care practitioners. Methods: This is a quantitative research study for which we used an anonymous survey with 18 questions. This survey was distributed to 443 randomly selected general practitioners from different parts of Macedonia and 438 of them responded. For the quantitative data, we used the Pearson's chi-squared test, correlation and descriptive statistics. Part of the survey is qualitative, consisting of comments and opinions of the general practitioners. Results: From the participants, 336 were female and 102 were male. The doctors' gender was not associated with sanctioning. Most general practitioners were in the age categories of 30-39 and 40-49 years. The participants' age had a significant influence on sanctioning-older doctors were sanctioned more frequently. Out of 438 participants, 33.3% were specialists in family medicine and 66.7% general practitioners. Specialists in family medicine were sanctioned significantly more frequently than general practitioners. Doctors that worked in the hospital or 19 km from the nearest hospital were significantly more frequently sanctioned. The three most common reasons for sanctions were financial consumption of prescriptions and referrals above the agreed amount, higher rate of sick leaves and/or justification of sick leaves and unrealized preventative goals or education. 'Financial sanction by scale' was the most common type of sanction: 49.8% of participants. Doctors who followed the guidelines, but who were exposed to violence were sanctioned significantly more frequently. Conclusion: We can observe that age, speciality, the distance of the workplace from the nearest hospital and violence influence sanctioning.

977,Is computer gaming associated with cognitive abilities? A population study among German adolescents,"Playing commercial computer games supposedly trains cognitive abilities. The present study investigated linear and nonlinear associations between the time spent on computer and video games each day and cognitive abilities in a representative sample of N = 12,459 German adolescents (51% girls). Piecewise polynomial regression analyses revealed that computer garners scored higher on standardized tests of reasoning and receptive vocabulary than non-garners, but the difference was small in size. Among garners, the time spent on computer games exhibited very modest associations with the cognitive scores: Reasoning and receptive vocabulary showed a slight (non)linear increase, whereas perceptual and reading speed were largely unrelated to gaming times. Analyses that did not account for the gender of the respondents created spurious effects that might wrongly indicate associations of gaming times with cognitive abilities. This is the first large-scale assessment showing that linear as well as nonlinear associations between playing commercial computer games and different cognitive abilities are weak to nonexistent.

978,Adjusting medical school admission: assessing interpersonal skills using situational judgement tests,"Context Todays formal medical school admission systems often include only cognitively oriented tests, although most medical school curricula emphasise both cognitive and non-cognitive factors. Situational judgement tests (SJTs) may represent an innovative approach to the formal measurement of interpersonal skills in large groups of candidates in medical school admission processes. This study examined the validity of interpersonal video-based SJTs in relation to a variety of outcome measures. Methods This study used a longitudinal and multiple-cohort design to examine anonymised medical school admissions and medical education data. It focused on data for the Flemish medical school admission examination between 1999 and 2002. Participants were 5444 candidates taking the medical school admission examination. Outcome measures were first-year grade point average (GPA), GPA in interpersonal communication courses, GPA in non-interpersonal courses, Bachelors degree GPA, Masters degree GPA and final-year GPA (after 7 years). For students pursuing careers in general practice, additional outcome measures (9 years after sitting examinations) included supervisor ratings and the results of an interpersonal objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), a general practice knowledge test and a case-based interview. Results Interpersonal skills assessment carried out using SJTs had significant added value over cognitive tests for predicting interpersonal GPA throughout the curriculum, doctor performance, and performance on an OSCE and in a case-based interview. For the other outcomes, cognitive tests emerged as the better predictors. Females significantly outperformed males on the SJT (d = - 0.26). The interpersonal SJT was perceived as significantly more job-related than the cognitive tests (d = 0.55). Conclusions Video-based SJTs as measures of procedural knowledge about interpersonal behaviour show promise as complements to cognitive examination components. The interpersonal skills training received during medical education does not negate the selection of students on the basis of interpersonal skills. Future research is needed to examine the use of SJTs in other cultures and student populations.",Video Meta Results Raw,Lievens F,,,0,833
979,The effects of adolescent health-related behavior on academic performance: A systematic review of the longitudinal evidence,"Schools are increasingly involved in efforts to promote health and healthy behavior among their adolescent students, but are healthier students better learners? This synthesis of the empirical, longitudinal literature investigated the effects of the most predominant health-related behaviors—namely, alcohol and marijuana use, smoking, nutrition, physical activity, sexual intercourse, bullying, and screen time use (television, Internet, video games)—on the academic performance of adolescents. Thirty studies dating back to 1992 were retrieved from the medical, psychological, educational, and social science literature. Healthy nutrition and team sports participation were found to have a positive effect on academic performance, whereas the effects of alcohol use, smoking, early sexual intercourse, bullying, and certain screen time behaviors were overall negative. Generally, all relations of health-related behaviors and academic performance were dependent on contextual factors and were often mediated by psychosocial problems, social structures, and demographics. Findings were interpreted with use of sociological theories.

980,Cognitive Training Does Not Enhance General Cognition,"Due to potential theoretical and societal implications, cognitive training has been one of the most influential topics in psychology and neuroscience. The assumption behind cognitive training is that one's general cognitive ability can be enhanced by practicing cognitive tasks or intellectually demanding activities. The hundreds of studies published so far have provided mixed findings and systematic reviews have reached inconsistent conclusions. To resolve these discrepancies, we carried out several meta-analytic reviews. The results are highly consistent across all the reviewed domains: minimal effect on domain-general cognitive skills. Crucially, the observed between-study variability is accounted for by design quality and statistical artefacts. The cognitive-training program of research has showed no appreciable benefits, and other more plausible practices to enhance cognitive performance should be pursued.","VIDEO-GAME EXPERIENCE; IMPROVING FLUID INTELLIGENCE; NO CONVINCING EVIDENCE; WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE-ABILITY; PUBLICATION BIAS; OLDER-ADULTS; LIFE IQ; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychology, Experimental; Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology; cognitive ability; cognitive training; intelligence; meta-analysis; music; neural plasticity; video game; working memory; Video Meta Results Raw",Sala G and Gobet F,,,0,835
981,The experimental analysis of problematic video gaming and cognitive skills: A systematic review,"There is now a growing literature demonstrating the excessive gaming can have negative detrimental effects on a small minority of gamers. This has led to much debate in the psychological literature on both the positive and negative effects of gaming. One specific area that has been investigated is the effect of gaming on different types of cognitive skills. The present study carried a systematic review examining the studies that have examined the impact of problematic gaming on cognitive skills. Following a number of inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 18 studies were identified that had investigated three specific cognitive skills: (i) multi-second time perception (4 studies), inhibition (7 studies), and decision-making (7 studies). Based on the studies reviewed, the findings demonstrate that the pathological and/or excessive use of videogames leads to more negative consequences on cognitive processes.

982,Lessons Learned from Gamifying Functional Fitness Training Through Human-Centered Design Methods in Older Adults,"Background: The design of meaningful and enjoyable Exergames for fitness training in older adults possesses critical challenges in matching user's needs and motivators with game elements. These challenges are often due to the lack of knowledge of seniors' game preferences and technology literacy as well as a poor involvement of the target population in the design process. Objective: This research aims at describing a detailed and scrutinized use case of applying human-centered design methodologies in the gamification of fitness training routines and illustrates how to incorporate seniors' feedback in the game design pipeline. Materials and Methods: We focus on how to use the insights from human-centered inquiries to improve in-game elements, such as mechanics or esthetics, and how to iterate the game design process based on playtesting sessions in the field. Results: We present a set of four Exergames created to train the critical functional fitness areas of older adults. We show how through rapid prototyping methods and multidisciplinary research, Exergames can be rigorously designed and developed to match individual physical capabilities. Moreover, we propose a set of guidelines for the design of context-aware Exergames based on the lessons learned. Conclusion: We highlight the process followed; it depicts 19 weeks of various activities delivering particular and actionable items that can be used as a checklist for future games for health design projects.","User-centered design; Motion tracking; Fitness training; Exergaming; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; VIDEO GAMES; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; PLAYING EXERGAMES; EXERCISE; BARRIERS; MOBILITY; PEOPLE; HEALTH; METAANALYSIS; Health Policy & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation; Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Munoz JE and Goncalves A and Gouveia ER and Cameirao MS and Bermudez i Badia S,,,0,837
983,"The current landscape of US children's television: violent, prosocial, educational, and fantastical content","The present study examined currently popular children's television shows to determine the prevalence of violent, prosocial, educational, and fantastical content (including fantastical events and anthropomorphism). Network, style, and content ratings were collected for 88 shows using a combination of Common Sense Media and laboratory ratings applied to two randomly-selected episodes of each show. Overall, currently popular children's television shows were most often animated and contained little violent, prosocial, or educational content, but a great deal of fantastical content. Interrelations among variables were also examined. Shows with fantastical events were both more violent and more prosocial than shows without, and shows with anthropomorphism were more prosocial than shows without. The network on which a show aired predicted violent, prosocial, and educational content, but not fantastical content. Children's television today is not as violent as might be believed, but nor is it particularly prosocial or educational. It is highly fantastical. The implications of the landscape for children's behavior, learning, and cognition are discussed.","Children; television; violence; prosocial behavior; educational content; fantasy; anthropomorphism; MEDIA VIOLENCE; VIDEO GAMES; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; IMMEDIATE IMPACT; SESAME-STREET; PRETEND PLAY; EXPOSURE; METAANALYSIS; PRESCHOOL; Communication; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Communication; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw",Taggart J and Eisen S and Lillard AS,,,0,838

985,Serious Games for Children with Chronic Diseases: A Systematic Review,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature to assess if serious games impact health outcomes for children less than 18 years of age with chronic diseases. Additionally, the impact of self-efficacy, adherence, knowledge, use of theory, parent involvement, and study quality was also examined. Materials and Methods: Searches were conducted in databases EBSCO, PubMed, and Web of Science between June and August 2016. Randomized controlled trials using a serious game as an intervention, for participants under 18 years of age, to improve their chronic disease were included. Results: Data were extracted by two independent researchers, including: Title, author, and publication year; chronic disease; game description; number and age of participants; intervention duration; significant findings; parent involvement; theory; and study quality. Any disagreements were tackled and consensus was achieved. Eighteen studies were included in the review. The areas of health addressed included cerebral palsy, asthma, diabetes, developmental coordination disorders, and vision disorders. In these articles, eight health outcome variables were measured, including: lung function, glycemic control, hospital visits, motor proficiency, and visual acuity. Psychosocial variables that were assessed included self-efficacy and knowledge. Two articles included parents in the intervention, and three articles used theory. Six studies had significant health outcome finding, and four studies found a significant change in one psychosocial variable. Conclusion: This review demonstrates the potential for games to improve health outcomes of young individuals. However, the mixed results suggest that more serious game interventions need to be better designed and rigorously tested to support their impact on improving health outcomes.","Serious games; Chronic disease; Children/adolescents; Systematic review; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; VIDEO GAMES; FAMILY CONFLICT; CEREBRAL-PALSY; SELF-EFFICACY; COMPUTER; OUTCOMES; HEALTH; INTERVENTION; MANAGEMENT; Health Policy & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation; Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Holtz BE and Murray K and Park T,,,0,840
986,Entertainment-education effectively reduces prejudice,"We show that entertainment-education reduces prejudice and does so more effectively than several established prejudice reduction methods. In Experiment 1, participants exposed to an educational television sitcom with diverse, yet relatable Arab/Muslim characters had lower scores on implicit and explicit measures of prejudice than participants exposed to a control sitcom featuring an all White cast. The prejudice reduction effect persisted 4 weeks after exposure. In Experiment 2, viewing of a 4-minute music video that portrayed Arabs/Muslims as relatable and likable resulted in a larger reduction in prejudice against Arabs/Muslims than two established prejudice reduction methods (imagined contact exercise and group malleability article), which produced no improvements. In both experiments, increased identification with target group members was associated with greater prejudice reduction. Entertainment-education, in addition to being scalable, is likely to be one the most effective methods for improving intergroup relations and promoting diversity.","entertainment-education; identification; intervention; narratives; prejudice reduction; SOCIAL-COGNITIVE THEORY; PARASOCIAL CONTACT HYPOTHESIS; IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST; INTERGROUP CONTACT; GROUP MALLEABILITY; METAANALYTIC TEST; CHANGING BELIEFS; ANXIETY; MEDIA; COMMUNICATION; Psychology, Social; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Murrar S and Brauer M,,,0,841
987,Picture or Text First? Explaining Sequence Effects when Learning with Pictures and Text,"The present article reviews 42 studies investigating the role of sequencing of text and pictures for learning outcomes. Whereas several of the reviewed studies revealed better learning outcomes from presenting the picture before the text rather than after it, other studies demonstrated the opposite effect. Against the backdrop of theories on memory representations, these results are explained by a recency effect: that is, recall of information should be superior for the medium (text or picture) presented second, and thus, in closer temporal proximity to the assessment. As a consequence, the type of knowledge assessed (text-based vs. picture-based) and its congruence with the more recent medium should determine whether better learning results are found when presenting the picture or text first. Against the backdrop of theories on mental model construction, results were explained by a facilitation effect for the medium (text or picture) presented second. As a consequence, the relative complexity of information conveyed by the picture and by the text should determine which medium is better to be processed first, with less complex information being processed first leading to better comprehension. To conclude, the review suggests that it is not so much the sequence of text and pictures per se that affects learning outcomes than these boundary conditions (i.e., type of assessed knowledge, relative complexity of text, and picture). Accordingly, the present review seeks to stimulate further research along the boundary conditions to better understand the processes involved when learning with text and pictures.",Video Meta Results Raw,Eitel A and Scheiter K,,,0,842

Individuals’ 3-D mental rotation ability was measured by the Purdue Spatial Visualization Tests: Visualization of Rotations (PSVT:R). We integrated 70 effect sizes of gender differences in mental rotation ability measured by the PSVT:R which were obtained from 40 primary studies. The results indicated that male participants outperformed females on the test (Hedges’ g = 0.57). The I2 statistic indicated 41.7 % of variation in effect sizes reflects real heterogeneity. The moderator analysis indicated that male superiority on spatial ability tasks measured by the PSVT:R is related to the implementation of time limits. The gender difference became larger when stringent time limits (equal or less than 30 s per item) were implemented.,"ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Spatial Ability; Visualization; Gender Differences; Effect Size; Cognitive Ability; Visual Measures; Meta Analysis; Video Meta Results Raw",Maeda Y and Yoon SY,,,0,843
990,Behavioral and neural markers of cigarette-craving regulation in young-adult smokers during abstinence and after smoking,"Cigarette craving contributes substantially to the maintenance of tobacco use disorder. Behavioral strategies to regulate craving may facilitate smoking cessation but remain underexplored. We adapted an emotion-regulation strategy, using proximal/distal self-positioning, to the context of cigarette craving to examine craving regulation in 42, daily smokers (18-25 years old). After overnight abstinence from smoking, before and after smoking their first cigarette of the day, participants viewed videos of natural scenes presenting young adults who were either smoking cigarettes (\smoke\') or not (\'non-smoke\'). Before each video",participants were instructed to imagine themselves either immersed in the scene (\'close\') or distanced from it (\'far\'). They rated their craving after each video.

996,Spatial abilities and technical skills performance in health care: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between spatial abilities and technical skills performance in health care in beginners and to compare this relationship with those in intermediate and autonomous learners. METHODS: Search criteria included 'spatial abilities' and 'technical skills'. Keywords related to these criteria were defined. A literature search was conducted to 20 December, 2013 in Scopus (including MEDLINE) and in several databases on EBSCOhost platforms (CINAHL Plus with Full Text, ERIC, Education Source and PsycINFO). Citations were obtained and reviewed by two independent reviewers. Articles related to retained citations were reviewed and a final list of eligible articles was determined. Articles were assessed for quality using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network-50 assessment instrument. Data were extracted from articles in a systematic way. Correlations between spatial abilities test scores and technical skills performance were identified. RESULTS: A series of 8289 citations was obtained. Eighty articles were retained and fully reviewed, yielding 36 eligible articles. The systematic review found a tendency for spatial abilities to be negatively correlated with the duration of technical skills and positively correlated with the quality of technical skills performance in beginners and intermediate learners. Pooled correlations of studies were -0.46 (p = 0.03) and -0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.53 to -0.21) for duration and 0.33 (95% CI 0.20-0.44) and 0.41 (95% CI 0.26-0.54) for quality of technical skills performance in beginners and intermediate learners, respectively. However, correlations between spatial abilities test scores and technical skills performance were not statistically significant in autonomous learners. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial abilities are an important factor to consider in selecting and training individuals in technical skills in health care.","spatial ability; technical skills performance; health care sciences; medical students; medical education; Delivery of Health Care; Education, Medical; Humans; Learning; Psychomotor Performance; Spatial Processing; Ability Level; Job Experience Level; Medical Education; Medical Students; Spatial Ability; Health Care Services; Job Performance; Medical Sciences; Skill Learning; Video Meta Results Raw",Langlois J and Bellemare C and Toulouse J and Wells GA,,,0,845

However, it is not yet clar how useful this practice is. METHODS: We searched in Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others. We extracted data from the systematic reviews, reanalyzed data of primary studies, conducted a meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table using the GRADE approach. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified three systematic reviews including eight primary studies, of which four were randomized trials. We concluded video games training could help shorten the learning curve of basic laparoscopic visuospatial skills measured in a virtual platform, but the certainty of the available evidence is low.","Video games; laparoscopic skills; Epistemonikos; GRADE; SIMULATOR; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Domínguez JI and Ramos A and Achurra P,,,0,846

All children had been assessed as having difficulties in their interactions with peers. Two were above average on internalizing problems and the third was above average on externalizing problems. The study used a delayed multiple probe across participants design and was situated in a preschool setting. Videos were individualized for each participant based on age, gender, ethnicity, and individual needs. The models demonstrated appropriate play behavior with peers. Positive outcomes were achieved for 2 participants. The findings suggest that although the social interaction skills of preschool children can be enhanced in their natural environment through the use of video modeling; video modeling alone might not be sufficient for addressing the needs of children with externalizing problems.","preschool children; social skills; video modeling; internalizing; externalizing; social withdrawal; SOCIAL-SKILLS; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; COMPETENCE; ACCEPTABILITY; INTERVENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; INITIATIONS; EFFICACY; INCREASE; PLAY; Education, Special; Rehabilitation; Education & Educational Research; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Green VA and Prior T and Smart E and Boelema T and Drysdale H and Harcourt S and Roche L and Waddington H,,,0,847

1000,A rapid review of serious games: From healthcare education to dental education,"INTRODUCTION: Games involving technology have the potential to enhance hand-eye coordination and decision-making skills. As a result, game characteristics have been applied to education and training, where they are known as serious games. There is an increase in the volume of literature on serious games in healthcare education; however, evidence on their impact is still ambiguous. AIMS: The aims of this study were (i) to identify high-quality evidence (systematic reviews or meta-analyses) regarding impacts of serious games on healthcare education; and (ii) to explore evidence regarding impacts of serious games in dental education. METHODS: A rapid review of the literature was undertaken to synthesise available evidence and examine serious games in healthcare education (Stage 1) and dental education (Stage 2). RESULTS: Nine systematic reviews were included in Stage 1, four of which were of high, three of moderate and two of low quality. For Stage 2, two randomised control trials with moderate quality were included. The findings demonstrated that serious games are potentially effective learning tools in terms of knowledge and skills improvement, although outcomes of serious games over traditional learning approaches were not consistent. In addition, serious games appeared to be more engaging and satisfying for students, which could be considered as the most important positive impact. CONCLUSION: Serious games provide an option for healthcare and dental education but remain underutilised and researched. At best, they offer a similar experience to other methods in relation to educational outcome; however, they can provide a supplementary strategy to engage students and improve learner satisfaction.","dental education; educational games; health education; healthcare education; rapid review; serious games; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; VIDEO-GAME; ENGAGEMENT; QUALITY; Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Sipiyaruk K and Gallagher JE and Hatzipanagos S and Reynolds PA,,,0,849
1001,"Meta-analysis of lobectomy, segmentectomy, and wedge resection for stage I non-small cell lung cancer","BACKGROUND: Survival difference following lobectomy, segmentectomy, and wedge resection in stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its subgroups remains undetermined. METHODS: We systemically searched published articles comparing recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), or cancer-specific survival (CSS) between lobectomy and limited resection or between segmentectomy and wedge resection. RESULTS: A total of 42 studies published from 1980 to 2014 enrolling 21,926 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Survival results favored lobectomy in stage IA NSCLC ≤2 cm (combined HR: 1.530, 95% CI: 1.402-1.671, P < 0.001) or patient's ≥65 years old (combined HR: 1.227, 95% CI: 1.003-1.502, P = 0.047). Survival outcome of video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) sublobectomy was comparable to that of VATS lobectomy (pooled HR: 0.808, 95% CI: 0.556-1.174, P = 0.263). The combined HR of segmentectomy versus lobectomy was 1.231 (95% CI: 1.070-1.417, P = 0.004), while the pooled HR of wedge resection versus segmentectomy was 1.542 (95% CI: 0.856-2.780, P = 0.149). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that tumor size or age alone should not be the criteria to encourage sublobar resection. For stage I NSCLC, survival following segmentectomy was inferior to lobectomy. Patients undergoing intentional sublobectomy achieved comparable survival as those who received lobectomy.",carcinoma; lobectomy; meta-analysis; non-small-cell lung; segmentectomy; stage I; wedge resection; Video Meta Results Raw,Zhang Y and Sun Y and Wang R and Ye T and Zhang Y and Chen H,,,0,850
1002,Testing the Feasibility of DARWeb An Online Intervention for Children With Functional Abdominal Pain and Their Parents,"Objectives: To test the feasibility of an online intervention (DAR-Web) for children with functional abdominal pain and their families. Methods: An online intervention (with 7 units for children and 7 for parents) was developed from a cognitive-behavioral perspective. A total of 15 families were given access to the intervention and asked to rate their satisfaction with each unit and the overall program (using scales from 0 to 10). Moreover, they were interviewed at the end of the program to obtain more information about their impressions of the program. Results: Nine families (60%) completed the entire program. Parents rated each unit above a median of 8; children also rated all of the units except the first 2 above a median of 8. Global ratings were also very positive. Qualitative data reinforce the idea that the participants were quite satisfied with the intervention, they appreciated the fact that it was online, and they learned coping strategies (they were especially happy with relaxation) and to give less importance to pain. Although they appreciated the available resources, they would like to have more multimedia and interactive resources, and some form of professional contact. Parents also suggest that it was a burden (in terms of time) to supervise their children's progress in the program. Discussion: DARWeb has been shown to be a feasible intervention, and it seems to be well designed. However, some improvements need to be considered based on the experiences of these participating families, and further research should be conducted to test its efficacy.",Video Meta Results Raw,Nieto R and Hernandez E and Boixados M and Huguet A and Beneitez I and McGrath P,,,0,851
1003,Online Diagnostic Assessment in Support of Personalized Teaching and Learning: The eDia System,"The aims of this paper are: to provide a comprehensive introduction to eDia, an online diagnostic assessment system; to show how the use of technology can contribute to solve certain crucial problems in education by supporting the personalization of learning; and to offer a general reference for further eDia-based studies. The primary function for which the system is designed is to provide regular diagnostic feedback in three main domains of education, reading, mathematics, and science, from the beginning of schooling to the end of the 6 years of primary education. The cognitive foundations of the system, the assessment frameworks, are based on a three-dimensional approach in each domain, distinguishing the psychological (reasoning), the application, and the disciplinary (curricular content) dimensions of learning. The frameworks have been carefully mapped into item banks containing over a 1,000 innovative (multimedia-supported) items in each dimension. The online assessments were piloted, and the system has been operating in experimental mode in over 1,000 schools for several years. This paper outlines the theoretical foundations of the eDia system and summarizes how results from research on the cognitive sciences, learning and instruction, and technology-based assessment have been integrated into a working system designed to assess a large population of students. The paper describes the main functions of eDia and discusses how it supports item writing, constructing tests, online test delivery, automated scoring, data processing, scaling and the provision of feedback both for students and teachers. It shows how diagnostic assessments can be implemented in school practice to facilitate differentiated instruction through regular measurements and to provide instruments for teachers to make formative assessments. Beyond its main function (supporting development toward personalizing education), the eDia platform has been used for assessments in a number of areas from pre-school to higher education both in Hungary and in a number of other countries as well. The paper also reviews results from eDia-based studies and highlights how technology-based assessment extends the possibilities of educational research by making more constructs measurable.","technology-based assessment; online assessment; diagnostic assessment; assessment framework; item banking; DECISION-MAKING; TECHNOLOGY; METAANALYSIS; EDUCATION; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Csapo B and Molnar G,,,0,852
1004,Videogame interventions and spatial ability interactions,"Numerous research studies have been conducted on the use of videogames as tools to improve one's cognitive abilities. While meta-analyses and qualitative reviews have provided evidence that some aspects of cognition such as spatial imagery are modified after exposure to videogames, other evidence has shown that matrix reasoning measures of fluid intelligence do not show evidence of transfer from videogame training. In the current work, we investigate the available evidence for transfer specifically to nonverbal intelligence and spatial ability measures, given recent research that these abilities may be most sensitive to training on cognitive and working memory tasks. Accordingly, we highlight a few studies that on the surface provide evidence for transfer to spatial abilities, but a closer look at the pattern of data does not reveal a clean interpretation of the results. We discuss the implications of these results in relation to research design and statistical analysis practices.",cognitive interventions; intelligence; training; transfer; video games; Video Meta Results Raw,Redick TS and Webster SB,,,0,853

We conducted five independent meta-analyses by reporting 58 effect sizes generated from 36 studies. Results suggested that playing digital games is effective in improving older adults' physical balance (g = 0.67), balance confidence (g = 0.46), functional mobility (g = 0.53), executive function (g = 0.76), and processing speed (g = 0.54). Based on the results of heterogeneity analysis, we conducted moderator analyses for physical balance and processing speed. Key findings included the following: Playing digital games can not only improve the physical balance of older adults living in community but also those living in nursing homes; the relationship between age of participants or amount of time of gameplay and effect size is weak and the direction of the relationship is not definitive.",digital games; meta-analysis; older adults; physical and cognitive abilities; Video Meta Results Raw,Zhang F and Kaufman D,,,0,854
1006,Special Issue on Cognitive Load Theory: Editorial,"For over three decades, cognitive load theory (CLT) has drawn on models of cognitive architecture—including a working memory whose capacity and duration limits can be substantially reduced when domain-specific schemas are activated from long-term memory—to generate and test instructional design hypotheses. The cognitive load construct refers to the load placed on working memory by a range of cognitive processes, including comprehension, schema construction, schema automation, and problem solving. When working memory is overloaded by the competing demands of these processes, CLT argues, student learning is impaired. Using CLT, researchers have (typically) used experimental methods to test a range of instructional designs that variously target obstructions to learning (e.g., split attention) or develop strategies to circumvent these issues (e.g., worked examples; for summaries of CLT designs, see Kalyuga 2015; Sweller et al. 2011). This Special Issue presents 10 articles, including theoretical reviews, meta-analyses, and intervention studies, that all focus on a unique aspect of advancement of CLT or cognate theories such as Mayer’s cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML). Drawing in part on ongoing research presented at the 2017 and 2018 International Cognitive Load Theory Conferences, the Special Issue also reflects on the impact of a key review of CLT published in Educational Psychology Review by Sweller et al. (Educational Psychology Review, 10(3), 251-296, 1998), 'Cognitive architecture and instructional design.' The impact of this review of CLT is clearly seen in citation counts as of 8 January 2019 (1862 citations in Web of Science; 5092 citations in Google Scholar).

1008,"Comparison of continuous epidural block and continuous paravertebral block in postoperative analgaesia after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy: a randomised, non-inferiority trial","Background: Video-assisted (VATS) lung lobectomy can be associated with stronger postoperative pain than is commonly believed. It is generally accepted to introduce multimodal analgaesic strategies based on regional blockade, opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, there is still no consensus regarding the optimal regional technique. The aim of this study was to compare the analgaesic efficacy of continuous thoracic epidural block (TEA) and percutaneous continuous paravertebral block (PVB) in patients undergoing video-assisted lung lobectomy. Methods: Fifty-one patients undergoing VATS lobectomy were enrolled in the present prospective, randomised clinical trial. The same analgaesic regimen in both groups included continuous infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine, intravenous ketoprofen and paracetamol. The doses of local anaesthetics were determined to achieve the spread of at least 4 segments in both groups. Postoperative static and dynamic visual analogue pain scores, as well as patient-controlled morphine usage, were used to compare the efficacy of analgaesia. Side effects and failure rates of both blocks were analysed. Results: Static and dynamic pain scores at 24 postoperative hours were significantly lower in the paravertebral group, as were the static pain score at 36 and 48 postoperative hours (P < 0.05). No difference between the treatment groups was identified regarding postoperative morphine usage. The failure rate was higher in the epidural group than in the paravertebral group. No complications were noted in either group, but side effects (urinary retention, hypotension) were more frequent in the epidural group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Postoperative pain following VATS lung resection procedures is significant and requires the application of complex analgaesic techniques. Percutaneous paravertebral block is equally effective as thoracic epidural block in providing analgaesia in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy. Paravertebral block has a better safety profile than thoracic epidural block.",Video Meta Results Raw,Kosinski S and Fryzlewicz E and Wilkojc M and Cmiel A and Zielinski M,,,0,856
1009,Technology-based interventions for mental health support after stroke: A systematic review of their acceptability and feasibility,"Mental health disturbances are common after stroke and linked to a slower recovery. Current face-to-face treatment options are costly and often inaccessible. Technology advances have made it possible to overcome some of these barriers to deliver technology-based mental health interventions remotely, but we do not know how acceptable and feasible they are. This systematic review aims to provide an examination of the acceptability and feasibility of technology-based mental health interventions provided to stroke patients and evaluate any barriers to their adoption. A total of 13 studies were included investigating interventions targeting non-specific mental health, depression or anxiety. The delivery technologies were: video conferencing, computer programmes, telephones, DVDs, CDs, robot-assisted devices, and personal digital assistants. Rates of refusal to participate were low (7.9-25%). Where satisfaction was reported, this was generally high. Many studies achieved high levels of adherence (up to 89.6%). This was lower for some technologies (e.g., robotic assistive devices). Where dropout occurred, this was for reasons including a decline in health as well as technical difficulties. Overall, the literature displays early evidence of using technology to deliver mental health interventions to patients with stroke. This review has identified factors that the design of future studies should take into consideration.",Stroke; Mental health; Technology; Depression; Anxiety; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; TELEMENTAL HEALTH; DEPRESSION; PROGRAM; TELEREHABILITATION; EFFICACY; ANXIETY; HOME; REHABILITATION; FREQUENCY; Neurosciences; Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw,Shek AC and Biondi A and Ballard D and Wykes T and Simblett SK,,,0,857
1010,Technology and writing: Review of research,"This review examined 29 empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals from 2002 to 2017 that investigated the use of computers and information and communication technologies during writing instruction and related writing activities. Qualitative content analysis was employed to investigate how technology was used in the writing program, the impact of technology mediated instruction on students' writing skills, and the barriers teachers faced in integrating technology into the writing curriculum. Results of the review demonstrated that computers and a range of digital technologies, applications, and web-based learning environments have been used to teach writing in K-12 educational settings. Technology-mediated writing instruction yielded improvements in students' composing processes and writing skills as well as their knowledge and use of new literacies. Students designed, produced, and presented a variety of multimodal and digital texts that represented their knowledge and understandings of literary material and contemporary social justice issues. The use of technology motivated student engagement and participation in writing assignments and increased social interaction and peer collaboration. Teachers faced a number of challenges in their efforts to integrate technology into the writing curriculum. Several recommendations are offered based on the results of this review. Relevant, high-quality teacher professional development on pedagogical uses of technology are urgently needed in order to promote technology-mediated writing instruction and build students' 21st century literacy skills. Institutional support is needed to ensure the availability of computers and appropriate applications in every classroom. Future research needs to identify how teachers can use multimedia and digital tools to improve writing instruction in the digital age, meet the objectives of the writing curriculum, and engage all students in the composing process. Continued exploration of how digital writing environments and online writing communities can support students' competence as writers also is needed. Substantial investigative work is needed in the early childhood program.","Applications in writing; Pedagogical issues; Cooperative/collaborative learning; Interactive learning environments; Improving classroom teaching; LITERACY; INSTRUCTION; ENGLISH; TIME; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION; ENVIRONMENT; STRATEGIES; MOTIVATION; WORLD; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education & Educational Research; Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Williams C and Beam S,,,0,858
1011,"Review of Learning science in informal environments: People, places, and pursuits","Reviews the book, Learning science in informal environments: People, places, and pursuits edited by Philip Bell et al. (2009). The committee and editors have conducted a comprehensive systematic review of the literature and commissioned other position papers to supplement and address voids in the extant literature. The analysis and interpretation focused on six strands: Developing interest in science, understanding science knowledge, engaging in scientific reasoning, reflecting on science, engaging in scientific practices, and identifying with the scientific enterprise. These strands were used to organize the final report into four parts: chapters 1–3 set the focus, theoretical perspectives, and assessment; chapters 4–6 provide descriptions of the venues; chapters 7–8 explore the cross-cutting and emerging themes; and chapter 9 outlines the results and recommendations. We found this book to be extremely useful in accessing and organizing the existing research results and, more importantly, identifying the existence of unaddressed issues and research voids. We will try to mention some of the many strengths of this report and will outline some of the 'it would be nice' issues for further consideration by the International Journal of Environmental and Science Education readership. First, many of the results, conclusions, and recommendations reported in this book are equally applicable to environmental, science, social studies, and mathematics education within and across formal education settings. Second, the report condemns traditional 'chalk-n-talk' instruction, rote learning, and testdriven approaches, which are supported by other NRC reports and should provide guidance for reform efforts. Third, the report acknowledges the assessment problems encountered in informal environments, which also prevail in constructivist environmental and science education programs. Fourth, the report appears to vacillate on a view of the nature of science; the choice of language did not make science fundamentally linked to people's curiosity. Fifth, unfortunately, this report does not elaborate on the concerns, barriers, and promises encountered by other minorities and the ontological and epistemological differences and similarities between traditional indigenous knowledge about nature and naturally occurring events (traditional ecological knowledge and wisdom, TEKW in Canada) and Western views of science and technology, the inquiry and design enterprises, and the knowledge systems flowing from these endeavors. Sixth, this report does not fully establish the concerns with media: journalistic versions of reports, editorials, video clips and sound bites; their commercial motives, audiences, and potential bias; and how they contribute to inaccurate views of science, certainty, time between initial findings and applications or cures (science-technology spectrum), and other features of scientific inquiry and technological design.

1013,Specific Effects of Individualized Cognitive Training in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): The Role of Pre-Training Cognitive Impairment and Individual Training Performance,"Objective: We investigated the impact of the pre-training neuropsychological (NP) impairment and of the training progress on the NP and behavioural outcome after computerized cognitive training (CogT) in children with ADHD. Method: Thirty-one participants underwent individualized CogT (focussing on one or two cognitive domains: working memory, inhibition, attention) over 12weeks. NP tests and behaviour ratings served as outcome measures. Results: After CogT, significant improvements emerged according to parents' ratings, but only on very few NP test measures. Children with milder/no pre-training NP impairment showed larger improvements on behavioural ratings than more impaired children. A steeper training performance slope was related to better behavioural outcomes. Conclusion: We find partial support for specific effects of CogT, but the assumption that an individually tailored selection of training tasks would be particularly beneficial for children with ADHD with NP deficits was not confirmed.Trial registration number: NCT02358941.",ADHD; child; cognitive intervention; plasticity; executive functions; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; WORKING-MEMORY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; VALIDITY; METAANALYSIS; INHIBITION; STABILITY; HETEROGENEITY; INTELLIGENCE; Clinical Neurology; Pediatrics; Rehabilitation; Neurosciences & Neurology; Pediatrics; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw,Minder F and Zuberer A and Brandeisabc D and Drechsler R,,,0,860
1014,Effectiveness of Serious Gaming During the Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation of Patients With Complex Chronic Pain or Fatigue: Natural Quasi-Experiment,"Background: Current evidence for the effectiveness of specialist multidisciplinary programs for burdensome chronic pain and functional somatic syndromes drives the effort to improve approaches, strategies, and delivery modes. It remains unknown to what extent and in what respect serious gaming during the regular outpatient rehabilitation can contribute to health outcomes. Objective: The objectives of our study were to determine the effect of additional serious gaming on (1) physical and emotional functioning in general; (2) particular outcome domains; and (3) patient global impressions of change, general health, and functioning and to determine (4) the dependency of serious gaming effects on adherence. Methods: We conducted a naturalistic quasi-experiment using embedded qualitative methods. The intervention group patients received an additional guided (mindfulness-based) serious gaming intervention during weeks 9-12 of a 16-week rehabilitation program at 2 sites of a Dutch rehabilitation clinic. Simultaneously, 119 control group patients followed the same program without serious gaming at 2 similar sites of the same clinic. Data consisted of 10 semistructured patient interviews and routinely collected patient self-reported outcomes. First, multivariate linear mixed modeling was used to simultaneously estimate a group effect on the outcome change between weeks 8 and 16 in 4 primary outcomes: current pain intensity, fatigue, pain catastrophizing, and psychological distress. Second, similar univariate linear mixed models were used to estimate effects on particular (unstandardized) outcomes. Third, secondary outcomes (ie, global impression of change, general health, functioning, and treatment satisfaction) were compared between the groups using independent t tests. Finally, subgroups were established according to the levels of adherence using log data. Influences of observed confounding factors were considered throughout analyses. Results: Of 329 eligible patients, 156 intervention group and 119 control group patients (N= 275) with mostly chronic back pain and concomitant psychosocial problems participated in this study. Of all, 119 patients played >= 75% of the game. First, the standardized means across the 4 primary outcomes showed a significantly more favorable degree of change during the second part of the treatment for the intervention group than for the control group (beta=-0.119, SE= 0.046, P=. 009). Second, the intervention group showed a greater outcome change in depressive mood (b=-2.748, SE= 1.072, P=. 011) but not in \insufficiency\' or concentration problems. Third",no significant group effects on secondary outcomes were found. Fourth,Vugts MA and Joosen MC and Mert A and Zedlitz AM and Vrijhoef HJ,,,0,861
1016,The paradox of seduction by irrelevant details: How irrelevant information helps and hinders self-regulated learning,"Instructors often rely on seductive details, such as jokes, stories, and video clips, to keep trainees entertained. However, this extraneous information may inadvertently detract from the course content, and the between person nature of past research precludes understanding the dynamic process by which seductive details influence learning. Using a repeated measures field study, we found that seductive details indirectly improved learning performance by reducing negative affect and indirectly hindered learning performance by increasing the speed of reviewing and decreasing time on task. Seductive details also interfered with attentional focus for trainees with low pretraining knowledge but increased attentional focus for trainees with high pretraining knowledge. Finally, seductive details moderated the effect of learning performance on attrition from training. Learning performance had a less negative effect on attrition in modules with seductive details than in modules without seductive details. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

1017,Holistic Facial Composite Construction and Subsequent Lineup Identification Accuracy: Comparing Adults and Children,"When the police have no suspect, they may ask an eyewitness to construct a facial composite of that suspect from memory. Faces are primarily processed holistically, and recently developed computerized holistic facial composite systems (e.g., EFIT-V) have been designed to match these processes. The reported research compared children aged 6-11years with adults on their ability to construct a recognizable EFIT-V composite. Adult constructor's EFIT-Vs received significantly higher composite-suspect likeness ratings from assessors than children's, although there were some notable exceptions. In comparison to adults, the child constructors also overestimated the composite-suspect likeness of their own EFIT-Vs. In a second phase, there were no differences between adult controls and constructors in correct identification rates from video lineups. However, correct suspect identification rates by child constructors were lower than those of child controls, suggesting that a child's memory for the suspect can be adversely influenced by composite construction. Nevertheless, all child constructors coped with the demands of the EFIT-V system, and the implications for research, theory, and the criminal justice system practice are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Davis JP and Thorniley S and Gibson S and Solomon C,,,0,863
1018,Are two heads always better than one? Differential effects of collaboration on students' computer-supported learning in mathematics,"While some studies found positive effects of collaboration on student learning in mathematics, others found none or even negative effects. This study evaluates whether the varying impact of collaboration can be explained by differences in the type of knowledge that is promoted by the instruction. If the instructional material requires students to reason with mathematical concepts, collaboration may increase students' learning outcome as it promotes mutual elaboration. If, however, the instructional material is focused on practicing procedures, collaboration may result in task distribution and thus reduce practice opportunities necessary for procedural skill fluency. To evaluate differential influences of collaboration, we compared four conditions: individual vs. collaborative learning with conceptual instructional material, and individual vs. collaborative learning with procedural instructional material. The instruction was computer-supported and provided adaptive feedback. We analyzed the effect of the conditions on several levels: Logfiles of students' problem-solving actions and video-recordings enabled a detailed analysis of performance and learning processes during instruction. In addition, a post-test assessed individual knowledge acquisition. We found that collaboration improved performance during the learning phase in both the conceptual and the procedural condition; however, conceptual and procedural material had a differential effect on the quality of student collaboration: Conceptual material promoted mutual elaboration; procedural material promoted task distribution and ineffective learning behaviors. Consequently, collaboration positively influenced conceptual knowledge acquisition, while no positive effect on procedural knowledge acquisition was found. We discuss limitations of our study, address methodological implications, and suggest practical implications for the school context.",Video Meta Results Raw,Mullins D and Rummel N and Spada H,,,0,864
1020,Reappraisal of Interpersonal Criticism in Social Anxiety Disorder: A Brain Network Hierarchy Perspective,"Emotion regulation is thought to involve communication between and within large-scale brain networks that underlie emotion reactivity and cognitive control. Aberrant network interaction might therefore be a key neural feature of mental disorders that involve emotion dysregulation. Here we tested whether connectivity hierarchies within and between emotion reactivity and cognitive reappraisal networks distinguishes social anxiety disorder (SAD) patients (n = 70) from healthy controls (HC) (n = 25). To investigate network organization, we implemented a graph-theory method called Dependency Network Analysis. Participants underwent fMRI while watching or reappraising video clips involving interpersonal verbal criticism. During reappraisal, the reappraisal network exerted less influence on the reactivity network in SAD participants. Specifically, the influence of the right inferior frontal gyrus on both reappraisal and reactivity networks was significantly reduced in SAD compared with HC, and correlated negatively with negative emotion ratings among SAD participants. Surprisingly, the amygdala exhibited reduced influence on the reappraisal network in SAD relative to HC. Yet, during the watch condition, the left amygdala's influence on the reactivity network increased with greater social anxiety symptoms among SAD participants. These findings refine our understanding of network organization that contributes to efficient reappraisal or to disturbances in applying this strategy in SAD.",cognitive reappraisal; emotional reactivity; fMRI; graph theory network analysis; social anxiety disorder; FOCUSED EMOTION REGULATION; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE REAPPRAISAL; AMYGDALA ACTIVATION; NEURAL BASES; METAANALYSIS; CORTEX; Neurosciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw,Jacob Y and Shany O and Goldin PR and Gross JJ and Hendler T,,,0,865
1021,Comparison of video laryngoscopes with direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation: a meta-analysis of randomised trials,"BACKGROUND: Video laryngoscopes have been introduced in recent years as an alternative choice to facilitate tracheal intubation. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess their value when compared with direct laryngoscopy. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched up until 24 September 2010. Randomised trials that reported data on the comparison of video laryngoscopes with direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation were included. RESULTS: Eleven trials with a total of 1196 participants were identified. During tracheal intubation, video laryngoscopes can achieve a better view of the glottis and have a similar success rate [rate ratio 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.01]. Overall, the time to tracheal intubation was not different between the video laryngoscopes and direct laryngoscopy (standardised mean difference 0.19; 95% CI -0.37-0.75). However, in a subgroup analysis, video laryngoscopes shortened the time taken for difficult intubation (standardised mean difference, -0.75; 95% CI -1.24 to -0.25). CONCLUSION: Video laryngoscopes are a good alternative to direct laryngoscopy during tracheal intubation. The advantage seems to be more prominent when difficult intubation is encountered.",Video Meta Results Raw,Su YC and Chen CC and Lee YK and Lee JY and Lin KJ,,,0,866
1022,"Effects of Face-to-Face and Computer-Mediated Constructive Controversy on Social Interdependence, Motivation, and Achievement","Cooperative learning capitalizes on the relational processes by which peers promote learning, yet it remains unclear whether these processes operate similarly in face-to-face and online settings. This study addresses this issue by comparing face-to-face and computer-mediated versions of constructive controversy, a cooperative learning procedure designed to create intellectual conflict among students. One hundred and one undergraduates were randomly assigned to a 1 (control: face-to-face) x 3 (medium: video, audio, text) x 2 (synchronicity: synchronous, asynchronous) experimental-control design. Cooperative perceptions declined and individualistic perceptions increased under asynchronous computer-mediated conditions, resulting in predicted declines in motivation (i.e., relatedness, interest, value) and academic achievement (i. e., completion rate). For practice, findings suggest that synchronicity but not medium plays an important role in computer-mediated constructive controversy. For theory, findings also suggest that social psychological theories based on face-to-face assumptions may need to be modified to indicate that predicted outcomes depend on synchronous social interaction.",Video Meta Results Raw,Roseth CJ and Saltarelli AJ and Glass CR,,,0,867
1023,Learning Psychotherapy in the Digital Age,"There is substantial literature documenting the process factors that lead to effective psychotherapy. Similarly, there is now a wealth of data attesting to the effectiveness of several psychotherapy brands. Little is known about the elements that facilitate learning how to be an effective clinician. One important step, after reading about a treatment model and seeing techniques demonstrated, is having the chance to practice the approach and receiving feedback and coaching from an experienced, knowledgeable supervisor. To accomplish this efficiently, most programs rely not only on trainee accounts of what went on in their therapy sessions, but also on recordings and videos of therapeutic encounters. This article describes our experience over a 5-year period in developing the use of Webcams for training psychology interns and psychiatric residents in the delivery of psychotherapy services. Pragmatic and technical details are given about how we went about establishing a recording system that is easy to use and provides secure, confidential storage of information at a reasonable cost.

1025,Working memory training in healthy young adults: Support for the null from a randomized comparison to active and passive control groups,"Training of working memory as a method of increasing working memory capacity and fluid intelligence has received much attention in recent years. This burgeoning field remains highly controversial with empirically-backed disagreements at all levels of evidence, including individual studies, systematic reviews, and even meta-analyses. The current study investigated the effect of a randomized six week online working memory intervention on untrained cognitive abilities in a community-recruited sample of healthy young adults, in relation to both a processing speed training active control condition, as well as a no-contact control condition. Results of traditional null hypothesis significance testing, as well as Bayesian factor analyses, revealed support for the null hypothesis across all cognitive tests administered before and after training. Importantly, all three groups were similar at pre-training for a variety of individual variables purported to moderate transfer of training to fluid intelligence, including personality traits, motivation to train, and expectations of cognitive improvement from training. Because these results are consistent with experimental trials of equal or greater methodological rigor, we suggest that future research re-focus on: 1) other promising interventions known to increase memory performance in healthy young adults, and; 2) examining sub-populations or alternative populations in which working memory training may be efficacious.","attention; working memory; training; fluid intelligence; Adult; Cognition; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Reaction Time; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult; Attention; Intelligence; Short Term Memory; Training; Fluid Intelligence; Video Meta Results Raw",Clark CM and Lawlor-Savage L and Goghari VM,,,0,869
1026,Near and far transfer in cognitive training: A second-order meta-analysis,"Theory building in science requires replication and integration of findings regarding a particular research question. Second-order meta-analysis (i.e., a meta-analysis of meta-analyses) offers a powerful tool for achieving this aim, and we use this technique to illuminate the controversial field of cognitive training. Recent replication attempts and large meta-analytic investigations have shown that the benefits of cognitive-training programs hardly go beyond the trained task and similar tasks. However, it is yet to be established whether the effects differ across cognitive-training programs and populations (children, adults, and older adults). We addressed this issue by using second-order meta-analysis. In Models 1 (k = 99) and 2 (k = 119), we investigated the impact of working-memory training on near-transfer (i.e., memory) and far-transfer (e.g., reasoning, speed, and language) measures, respectively, and whether it is mediated by the type of population. Model 3 (k = 233) extended Model 2 by adding six meta-analyses assessing the far-transfer effects of other cognitive-training programs (video-games, music, chess, and exergames). Model 1 showed that working-memory training does induce near transfer, and that the size of this effect is moderated by the type of population. By contrast, Models 2 and 3 highlighted that far-transfer effects are small or null. Crucially, when placebo effects and publication bias were controlled for, the overall effect size and true variance equaled zero. That is, no impact on far-transfer measures was observed regardless of the type of population and cognitive-training program. The lack of generalization of skills acquired by training is thus an invariant of human cognition. © 2019 The Author(s).","cognitive intervention; cognitive training; meta-analysis; second-order meta-analysis; transfer; IMPROVING FLUID INTELLIGENCE; WORKING-MEMORY; PUBLICATION BIAS; DEPENDENT CORRELATIONS; META-REGRESSION; VIDEO GAMES; MUSIC; CHESS; ABILITY; SKILLS; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Sala G and Deniz Aksayli N and Semir Tatlidil K and Tatsumi T and Gondo Y and Gobet F,,,0,870
1028,Brief Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Acute and Chronic Pain: A Systematic Review,"Objectives: Nonpharmacologic approaches have been characterized as the preferred means to treat chronic noncancer pain by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective for pain management, yet the typical MBI may not be feasible across many clinical settings due to resource and time constraints. Brief MBIs (BMBIs) could prove to be more feasible and pragmatic for safe treatment of pain. The aim of the present article is to systematically review evidence of BMBI's effects on acute and chronic pain outcomes in humans. Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar and by examining the references of retrieved articles. Articles written in English, published up to August 16, 2017, and reporting on the effects of a BMBI (i.e., total contact time <1.5 h, with mindfulness as the primary therapeutic technique) on a pain-related outcome (i.e., pain outcome, pain affect, pain-related function/quality of life, or medication-related outcome) were eligible for inclusion. Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. Results: Twenty studies meeting eligibility criteria were identified. Studies used qualitative (n = 1), within-group (n = 3), or randomized controlled trial (n = 16) designs and were conducted with clinical (n = 6) or nonclinical (i.e., experimentally-induced pain; n = 14) samples. Of the 25 BMBIs tested across the 20 studies, 13 were delivered with audio/video recording only, and 12 were delivered by a provider (participant-provider contact ranged from 3 to 80 min). Existing evidence was limited and inconclusive overall. Nevertheless, BMBIs delivered in a particular format-by a provider and lasting more than 5 min-showed some promise in the management of acute pain. Conclusions: More rigorous large scale studies conducted with pain populations are needed before unequivocally recommending BMBI as a first-line treatment for acute or chronic pain.",mindfulness; meditation; brief; pain; systematic review; LOW-BACK-PAIN; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; STRESS REDUCTION; OPIOID THERAPY; MEDITATION; CARE; PRESCRIPTION; ACCEPTANCE; PATIENT; Integrative & Complementary Medicine; Integrative & Complementary Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw,McClintock AS and McCarrick SM and Garland EL and Zeidan F and Zgierska AE,,,0,871
1029,"Meta-analysis of action video game impact on perceptual, attentional, and cognitive skills","The ubiquity of video games in today's society has led to significant interest in their impact on the brain and behavior and in the possibility of harnessing games for good. The present meta-analyses focus on one specific game genre that has been of particular interest to the scientific community-action video games, and cover the period 2000-2015. To assess the long-lasting impact of action video game play on various domains of cognition, we first consider cross-sectional studies that inform us about the cognitive profile of habitual action video game players, and document a positive average effect of about half a standard deviation (g = 0.55). We then turn to long-term intervention studies that inform us about the possibility of causally inducing changes in cognition via playing action video games, and show a smaller average effect of a third of a standard deviation (g = 0.34). Because only intervention studies using other commercially available video game genres as controls were included, this latter result highlights the fact that not all games equally impact cognition. Moderator analyses indicated that action video game play robustly enhances the domains of top-down attention and spatial cognition, with encouraging signs for perception. Publication bias remains, however, a threat with average effects in the published literature estimated to be 30% larger than in the full literature. As a result, we encourage the field to conduct larger cohort studies and more intervention studies, especially those with more than 30 hours of training.

Fifty-five articles (17 pilots and 38 full efficacy trials) were included with the predominance of web-based interventions in the United States-based settings. Intervention modalities include web-based, short message service (SMS)/text messges/email reminder, online video-based, computer-assisted, multimedia-based, social network, live chat and chat room, virtual simulation intervention, and smartphone applications. Forty-nine eHealth interventions achieved a short-term behaviour change among participants. Four studies were conducted with 12-month follow-ups; and only one of them could maintain the behaviour change over this longer time period which could be due to the lack of booster interventions. Our study suggests that eHealth interventions can achieve short term behaviour change among MSM, however limited interventions could maintain behaviour change over 12 months. Further eHealth intervention strategies to promote HIV prevention among MSM should be conducted and rigorously evaluated.","Systematic review; MSM; eHealth; Intervention; HIV; STI; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RISK-REDUCTION INTERVENTION; C VIRUS-INFECTION; HIV-POSITIVE GAY; PRIMARY-CARE; BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION; PRELIMINARY EFFICACY; TRANSMISSION RISK; TRANSGENDER WOMEN; BISEXUAL MEN; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Social Sciences, Biomedical; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Biomedical Social Sciences; Video Meta Results Raw",Nguyen LH and Tran BX and Rocha LE and Nguyen HL and Yang C and Latkin CA and Thorson A and Strömdahl S,,,0,873
1031,Road user behaviour changes following a self-explaining roads intervention,"The self-explaining roads (SER) approach uses road designs that evoke correct expectations and driving behaviours from road users to create a safe and user-friendly road network. Following the implementation of an SER process and retrofitting of local and collector roads in a suburb within Auckland City, lower speeds on local roads and less variation in speed on both local and collector roads were achieved, along with a closer match between actual and perceived safe speeds. Preliminary analyses of crash data shows that the project has resulted in a 30% reduction crash numbers and an 86% reduction in crash costs per annum, since the road changes were completed. In order to further understand the outcomes from this project, a study was carried out to measure the effects of the SER intervention on the activity and behaviour of all road users. Video was collected over nine separate days, at nine different locations, both before and after SER construction. Road user behaviour categories were developed for all potential road users at different location types and then used to code the video data. Following SER construction, on local roads there was a relatively higher proportion of pedestrians, less uniformity in vehicle lane keeping and less indicating by motorists along with less through traffic, reflecting a more informal/low speed local road environment. Pedestrians were less constrained on local roads following SER construction, possibly reflecting a perceptually safer and more user-friendly environment. These behaviours were not generally evident on collector roads, a trend also shown by the previous study of speed changes. Given that one of the objectives of SER is to match road user behaviour with functionally different road categories, the road user behaviour differences demonstrated on different road types within the SER trial area provides further reinforcement of a successful SER trial.

1032,Teaching Generation Me,"Today's college students are significantly different from previous generations. On average, they are overconfident, have high expectations, report higher narcissism, are lower in creativity, are less interested in civic issues, and are less inclined to read long passages of text. They are highly confident of their abilities and received higher grades in high school despite doing fewer hours of homework than previous generations. They also believe in equality regardless of ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. Strategies for teaching Generation Me include: frequent and honest feedback on performance; interactive learning; explaining why the material is important; using images and video clips; eliminating makeup exams and exceptions; and shorter textbooks. Teachers can use self-esteem and success as an example of a correlation explained by reverse causation and/or confounding variables, and can cover cultural differences such as individualism and collectivism. Overall, the best practice may be solutions that preserve high standards for learning but accommodate this generation's preferences.",Video Meta Results Raw,Twenge JM,,,0,875
1035,Improving memory performance in the aged through mnemonic training: A meta-analytic study': Correction,"Reports editorial errors in the original article by P. Verhaeghen et al (Psychology and Aging, 1992[Jun], Vol 7[2], 242–251). The S groups reported in the unpublished dissertation by T. M. Flynn (1987) and in the article by Flynn and M. Storandt (see record [rid]1990-28066-001[/rid]) mentioned in the 3rd part of Table 1 on page 244 are in fact the same. The changes in the results are minimal and have no consequences whatsoever for the conclusions drawn from the meta-analysis. Correct versions of Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 can be obtained from the 1st author. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in PA, Vol 79:34705.) The effectiveness of memory training for the elderly was examined through a meta-analysis of pre- to posttest gains on episodic memory tasks in healthy Ss (aged 60+ yrs). Pre- to posttest gains were found to be significantly larger in training groups (0.73 SD, k = 49) than in both control (0.38 SD, k = 10) and placebo (0.37 SD, k = 8) groups. Treatment gains in training groups were negatively affected by age of participants and duration of training sessions and positively affected by group treatment, pretraining, and memory-related interventions. No differences in treatment gain were obtained as a function of type of mnemonic taught nor the kind of pretraining used.

1036,Education of healthcare professionals for preventing pressure ulcers,"BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores or pressure sores, are localised areas of tissue damage arising due to excess pressure and shearing forces. Education of healthcare staff has been recognised as an integral component of pressure ulcer prevention. These educational programmes are directed towards influencing behaviour change on the part of the healthcare professional, to encourage preventative practices with the aim of reducing the incidence of pressure ulcer development. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of educational interventions for healthcare professionals on pressure ulcer prevention. SEARCH METHODS: In June 2017 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs, that evaluated the effect of any educational intervention delivered to healthcare staff in any setting to prevent pressure ulceration. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts of the studies identified by the search strategy for eligibility. We obtained full versions of potentially relevant studies and two authors independently screened these against the inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We identified five studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review: four RCTs and one cluster-RCT. The study characteristics differed in terms of healthcare settings, the nature of the interventions studied and outcome measures reported. The cluster-RCT, and two of the RCTs, explored the effectiveness of education delivered to healthcare staff within residential or nursing home settings, or nursing home and hospital wards, compared to no intervention, or usual practices. Educational intervention in one of these studies was embedded within a broader, quality improvement bundle. The other two individually randomised controlled trials explored the effectiveness of educational intervention, delivered in two formats, to nursing staff cohorts.Due to the heterogeneity of the studies identified, pooling was not appropriate and we have presented a narrative overview. We explored a number of comparisons (1) education versus no education (2) components of educational intervention in a number of combinations and (3) education delivered in different formats. There were three primary outcomes: change in healthcare professionals' knowledge, change in healthcare professionals' clinical behaviour and incidence of new pressure ulcers.We are uncertain whether there is a difference in health professionals' knowledge depending on whether they receive education or no education on pressure ulcer prevention (hospital group: mean difference (MD) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.00 to 1.60; 10 participants; nursing home group: MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.77 to 1.37; 10 participants). This was based on very low-certainty evidence from one study, which we downgraded for serious study limitations, indirectness and imprecision.We are uncertain whether there is a difference in pressure ulcer incidence with the following comparisons: training, monitoring and observation, versus monitoring and observation (risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.05; 345 participants); training, monitoring and observation, versus observation alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.43; 325 participants) or, monitoring and observation versus observation alone (RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.88; 232 participants). This was based on very low-certainty evidence from one study, which we downgraded for very serious study limitations and imprecision. We are uncertain whether multilevel intervention versus attention control makes any difference to pressure ulcer incidence. The report presented insufficient data to enable further interrogation of this outcome.We are uncertain whether education delivered in different formats such as didactic education versus video-based education (MD 4.60, 95% CI 3.08 to 6.12; 102 participants) or e-learning versus classroom education (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07; 18 participants), makes any difference to health professionals' knowledge of pressure ulcer prevention. This was based on very low-certainty evidence from two studies, which we downgraded for serious study limitations and study imprecision.None of the included studies explored our other primary outcome: change in health professionals' clinical behaviour. Only one study explored the secondary outcomes of interest, namely, pressure ulcer severity and patient and carer reported outcomes (self-assessed quality of life and functional dependency level respectively). However, this study provided insufficient information to enable our independent assessment of these outcomes within the review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain whether educating healthcare professionals about pressure ulcer prevention makes any difference to pressure ulcer incidence, or to nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcer prevention. This is because the included studies provided very low-certainty evidence. Therefore, further information is required to clarify the impact of education of healthcare professionals on the prevention of pressure ulcers.","NURSING-HOMES; PROGRAM; NURSES; PREVALENCE; KNOWLEDGE; QUALITY; CLASSIFICATION; INTERVENTION; TIME; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Porter-Armstrong AP and Moore ZE and Bradbury I and McDonough S,,,0,877
1037,Accounting for the shared environment in cognitive abilities and academic achievement with measured socioecological contexts,"Behavioral and molecular genetic research has established that child cognitive ability and academic performance are substantially heritable, but genetic variation does not account for all of the stratification of cognitive and academic outcomes across families. Which specific contexts and experiences contribute to these shared environmental influences on cognitive ability and academic achievement? Using an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of N = 1728 twins ages 7-20 from the Texas Twin Project, we identified specific measured family, school, and neighborhood socioecological contexts that statistically accounted for latent shared environmental variance in cognitive abilities and academic skills. Composite measures of parent socioeconomic status (SES), school demographic composition, and neighborhood SES accounted for moderate proportions of variation in IQ and achievement. Total variance explained by the multilevel contexts ranged from 15% to 22%. The influence of family SES on IQ and achievement overlapped substantially with the influence of school and neighborhood predictors. Together with race, the measured socioecological contexts explained 100% of shared environmental influences on IQ and approximately 79% of shared environmental influences on both verbal comprehension and reading ability. In contrast, nontrivial proportions of shared environmental variation in math performance were left unexplained. We highlight the potential utility of constructing \polyenvironmental risk scores\' in an effort to better predict developmental outcomes and to quantify children's and adolescents' interrelated networks of experiences.

1039,Spatial Ability: Its Influence on Learning with Visualizations--A Meta-Analytic Review,"This meta-analytical review focuses on the role of spatial ability when learning with pictorial visualizations. By means of selective theoretical review and meta-analysis (the latter regarding 27 different experiments from 19 studies), several sub-factors of spatial ability are considered as well as dynamic and non-dynamic, interactive and non-interactive visualizations. An overall effect of r = 0.34 (95%-CI 0.28 to 0.39) demonstrating a medium advantage for high-spatial-ability learners when working with visualizations is calculated. More importantly, two moderators could be identified: Learners with low spatial ability can be significantly supported by a dynamic instead of a non-dynamic visualization as well as by 3d- instead of 2d-illustrations. Results are discussed in consideration of contemporary theories of multimedia learning.

1040,Optimal Approach to Lobectomy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy was introduced over 25 years ago. More recently, the technique has been modified from a multiport video-assisted thoracic surgery (mVATS) to uniportal (uVATS) and robotic (rVATS), with proponents for each approach. Additionally most lobectomies are still performed using an open approach. We sought to provide evidence-based recommendations to help define the optimal surgical approach to lobectomy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of articles searched without limits from January 2000 to January 2018 comparing open, mVATS, uVATS, and rVATS using sources Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were considered for inclusion. Articles were individually scrutinized by ISMICS consensus conference members, and evidence-based statements were created and consensus processes were used to determine the ensuing recommendations. The ACC/AHA Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendation Classification system was used to assess the overall quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: One hundred and forty-five studies met the predefined inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Comparisons were analyzed between VATS and open, and between different VATS approaches looking at oncological outcomes (survival, recurrence, lymph node evaluation), safety (adverse events), function (pain, quality of life, pulmonary function), and cost-effectiveness. Fifteen statements addressing these areas achieved consensus. The highest level of evidence suggested that mVATS is preferable to open lobectomy with lower adverse events (36% versus 42%; 88,460 patients) and less pain (IIa recommendation). Our meta-analysis suggested that overall survival was better (IIb) with mVATS compared with open (71.5% versus 66.7% 5-years; 16,200 patients). Different VATS approaches were similar for most outcomes, although uVATS may be associated with less pain and analgesic requirements (IIb). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports the role of VATS lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer. Apart from potentially less pain and analgesic requirement with uVATS, different minimally invasive surgical approaches appear to have similar outcomes.",ISMICS; non-small cell lung cancer; multiport video-assisted thoracic surgery; uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery; robotic video-assisted thoracic surgery; open lobectomy; consensus statement; ASSISTED THORACIC-SURGERY; CLINICAL STAGE-I; PROPENSITY-MATCHED ANALYSIS; LONG-TERM SURVIVAL; POSTOPERATIVE PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS; MUSCLE-SPARING THORACOTOMY; LYMPH-NODE EVALUATION; THORACOSCOPIC LOBECTOMY; VATS LOBECTOMY; PERIOPERATIVE OUTCOMES; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Ng CS and MacDonald JK and Gilbert S and Khan AZ and Kim YT and Louie BE and Blair Marshall M and Santos RS and Scarci M and Shargal Y and Fernando HC,,,0,880
1041,The moderating role of arousal on the seductive detail effect in a multimedia learning setting,"Arousal has been found to increase learners' attentional resources. In contrast, seductive details (interesting but learning-irrelevant information) are considered to distract attention away from relevant information and, thus, hinder learning. However, a possibly moderating role of arousal on the seductive detail effect has not been examined yet. In this study, arousal variations were induced via audio files of false heartbeats. In consequence, 100 participants were randomly assigned to a 2 (with or without seductive details) x 2 (lower vs. higher false heart rates) between-subjects design. Data on learning performance, cognitive load, motivation, heartbeat frequency, and electro-dermal activity were collected. Results show learning-inhibiting effects for seductive details and learning-enhancing effects for higher false heart rates. Cognitive processes mediate both effects. However, the detrimental effect of seductive details was not present when heart rate was higher. Results indicate that the seductive detail effect is moderated by a learner's state of arousal.","arousal; cognitive load; false heartbeats; learning with media; physiological measurement; seductive detail effect; HEART-RATE FEEDBACK; COGNITIVE-LOAD; DECORATIVE PICTURES; WORKING-MEMORY; VALENCE; PERCEPTION; MODEL; METAANALYSIS; INDUCTION; ATTENTION; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Schneider S and Wirzberger M and Rey GD,,,0,881
1042,Cognitive consequences of segmentation and modality methods in learning from instructional animations,"This study was to investigate whether a chunking of animations about the lightning system can increase learning by designing it with sensitivity to the capacity limitations of working memory. A total of 96 girl students of junior high schools, divided into four groups, participated in the study. These groups learned from texts and animations in a 2 x 2 design with the factors modality (narration vs. on-screen text) and segmentation type (system-control vs. learner-control) and saw the process of lightening formation through 16 slides. The system-controlled segments group had 3 second pause between each slide and slides showed automatically, but learner-controlled segments group had chose to see the next slide by press play button. Retention and transfer of the learning material and cognitive load were assessed. The results showed that narration group outperformed on-screen text group in retention. The learner-controlled group outperformed system-controlled group in retention and reported less cognitive load. There was no interaction between modality and segmentation type. The chunking effect in multimedia learning is higher when the learner can control the pace of presentation. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1043,A multicentre randomised controlled trial of a carer supervised Culturally adapted CBT (CaCBT) based self-help for depression in Pakistan,"Background: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) based self-help has been found to be effective for treating depression and anxiety. There is some evidence to suggest that CBT needs to be culturally adapted for it to be effective in non-Western cultures. CBT is not widely used in low and middle income countries and there is a need to test its effectiveness in different settings and formats, including self-help. Methods: We describe a RCT of a Culturally adapted CBT (CaCBT) based self-help manual in Pakistan. The trial was conducted in psychiatry departments in three cities. Assessments were carried out at baseline and at 12 weeks, using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Bradford somatic Inventory and brief disability Questionnaire. Results: AL the end of the trial CaCBT based self-help was found to be effective against care as usual in reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as somatic symptoms and disability. Limitations: This study was conducted only in secondary care and required either patient or a carer to be able to read and write. Conclusions: This is the first study outside West of a CBT based self-help intervention for depression. This study highlights the importance of using cost effective interventions in developing world in low intensity formats. Future studies should focus on trying these resources in different settings, like primary care, and with the use of audio/video or multimedia resources to improve compliance in patients with lower literacy.

1045,A Preliminary Trial of a Prototype Internet Dissonance-Based Eating Disorder Prevention Program for Young Women With Body Image Concerns,"Objective: A group dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program, in which young women critique the thin ideal, reduces eating disorder risk factors and symptoms, but it can be difficult to identify school clinicians with the time and expertise to deliver the intervention. Thus, we developed a prototype Internet version of this program and evaluated it in a preliminary trial. Method: Female college students with body dissatisfaction (N = 107; M age = 21.6 years, SD = 6.6) were randomized to the Internet intervention, group intervention, educational video condition, or educational brochure condition. Results: Internet and group participants showed greater pre-post reductions in eating disorder risk factors and symptoms than video controls (M ds = 0.47 and 0.54, respectively) and brochure controls (M ds = 0.75 and 0.72, respectively), with many effects reaching significance. Effects did not differ significantly for Internet versus group participants (M ds = -0.13) or for video versus brochure controls (M d = 0.25). Effect sizes for the Internet intervention were similar to those previously observed for group versions of this intervention. Conclusions: Results suggest that this prototype Internet intervention is as efficacious as the group intervention, implying that there would be merit in completing this intervention and evaluating it in a fully powered trial.",Video Meta Results Raw,Stice E and Rohde P and Durant S and Shaw H,,,0,884
1046,Effects of Physical Activity on Motor Skills and Cognitive Development in Early Childhood: A Systematic Review,"Objective. This study synthesized literature concerning casual evidence of effects of various physical activity programs on motor skills and cognitive development in typically developed preschool children. Methods. Electronic databases were searched through July 2017. Peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effectiveness of physical activity on motor skills and cognitive development in healthy young children (4-6 years) were screened. Results. A total of 15 RCTs were included. Of the 10 studies assessing the effects of physical activity on motor skills, eight (80%) reported significant improvements in motor performance and one observed mixed findings, but one failed to promote any beneficial outcomes. Of the five studies investigating the influence of physical activity on cognitive development, four (80%) showed significant and positive changes in language learning, academic achievement, attention, and working memory. Notably, one indicated no significant improvements were observed after the intervention. Conclusions. Findings support causal evidence of effects of physical activity on both motor skills and cognitive development in preschool children. Given the shortage of available studies, future research with large representative samples is warranted to explore the relationships between physical activity and cognitive domains as well as strengthen and confirm the dose-response evidence in early childhood.","FUNDAMENTAL MOVEMENT SKILLS; TYPICALLY DEVELOPING-CHILDREN; REHABILITATIVE OUTCOMES; VIDEO GAMES; FITNESS; YOUNG; INTERVENTION; ADOLESCENCE; ACHIEVEMENT; SETTINGS; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Zeng N and Ayyub M and Sun H and Wen X and Xiang P and Gao Z,,,0,885
1047,Video-based Assessment of Peripheral Intravenous Catheter Insertion in the Resuscitation Area of a Pediatric Emergency Department,"Objective: The objective was to describe the frequency of and factors associated with prolonged peripheral intravenous catheter (PIV) insertion in the resuscitation area of a pediatric emergency department (PED). Methods: Video-based study of a consecutive sample of nontrauma patients undergoing PIV insertion in the resuscitation area of a PED. Preexisting videos were the main data source. The primary outcome was patients with prolonged duration of PIV insertion (>90 seconds from start of first attempt to successful flush/blood draw). Logistic regression identified variables independently associated with prolonged PIV insertion. Results: A total of 151 consecutive nontrauma patients underwent PIV insertion during a 2.5-month period. Sixty-nine patients (46%) had prolonged PIV insertion, including 14 for whom PED providers failed to insert PIVs. For patients with successful PIV insertion by PED providers, median duration was 48 seconds (interquartile range [IQR] = 23 to 295 seconds). Vascular access was ultimately achieved for 13 patients (93%) with initial insertion failure by the PED team (10 non-PED personnel, three intraosseous lines), with a median duration of 26.7 minutes (IQR = 19.9 to 34.2 minutes). Age <= 2 years (ORadj = 6.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.9 to 16.1) and musculoskeletal contractures (ORadj = 5.3; 95% CI = 1.6 to 17.2) were independently associated with prolonged PIV insertion. Conclusions: Prolonged PIV insertion is common in a PED resuscitation area. When PED providers could not insert a PIV, time to insertion was very long. Young patients and those with contractures were at particular risk for prolonged and failed PIV placement. When emergent vascular access is required, alternative approaches should be considered early for these patients.

1048,The limited informativeness of meta-analyses of media effects,"In this issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Christopher Ferguson reports on a meta-analysis examining the relationship between children’s video game use and several outcome variables, including aggression and attention deficit symptoms (Ferguson, 2015, this issue). In this commentary, I compare Ferguson’s nonsignificant effects sizes with earlier meta-analyses on the same topics that yielded larger, significant effect sizes. I argue that Ferguson’s choice for partial effects sizes is unjustified on both methodological and theoretical grounds. I then plead for a more constructive debate on the effects of violent video games on children and adolescents. Until now, this debate has been dominated by two camps with diametrically opposed views on the effects of violent media on children. However, even the earliest media effects studies tell us that children can react quite differently to the same media content. Thus, if researchers truly want to understand how media affect children, rather than fight for the presence or absence of effects, they need to adopt a perspective that takes differential susceptibility to media effects more seriously.

1051,A systematic review of neurocognitive functioning in Behçet’s disease,"Behçet’s disease (BD) is a vascular, inflammatory multisystem disorder with neuro-Behçet’s (NBD) diagnosed in a subset of patients with neurological manifestations. The objective of this review was to determine whether neurocognitive dysfunction is observed in BD, in which neurocognitive domains, and whether there are differences in rates of dysfunction observed between BD and NBD groups. Studies of any methodology were included that reported results from standardized neurocognitive assessment measures in participants with BD or NBD. Twelve group comparison studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review (totalling 284 BD and 157 NBD participants), as well as 17 case study/series papers (11 BD, 35 NBD). Issues with blinding, incomplete data reporting and selective reporting bias were found across the group and case study/series papers, as well as inadequate statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons in the group studies, and the lack of the use of appropriate norms or adjustment for premorbid ability in the case series/studies papers. These quality issues impacted on the conclusions that could be drawn from the current literature. Neurocognitive dysfunction was found in NBD compared to health controls (HC) in a higher proportion of results across studies, than in comparisons between BD and HC groups. The domains in which neurocognitive attenuation was most often reported were visual spatial ability, working memory and acquired knowledge, with more than 25% of these results showing significantly lower functioning in both the BD and NBD groups compared to HC. More than 25% of the processing speed and long-term memory encoding and retrieval results were also lower for the NBD group, compared to HC. Group comparisons between NBD and multiple sclerosis participants indicated few significant differences in neurocognitive test results. The majority of case study/series participants were found to have some degree of attenuated neurocognitive functioning, as defined by case study/series authors.

1052,Learning With Animation and Illusions of Understanding,"The illusion of understanding hypothesis asserts that, when people are learning with multimedia presentations, the addition of animation can affect metacognitive monitoring such that they perceive the presentation to be easier to understand and develop more optimistic metacomprehension. As a result, learners invest less cognitive effort when learning with animation. This study tested the illusion of understanding hypothesis with a randomized, double-blind, 2 X 2 factorial design using two different types of animation-representational and directive. Representational animation had a negative effect on learning, and directive animation had a positive effect. Both representational and directive animations induced illusion of understanding. Moreover, the animations induced multiple forms of the illusion. Consistent with expertise reversal effect, the animations induced more optimistic metacomprehension in low-proficiency learners but more pessimistic metacomprehension in high-proficiency learners.",Video Meta Results Raw,Paik ES and Schraw G,,,0,891
1053,Primary Care Interventions for Early Childhood Development: A Systematic Review,"CONTEXT: The pediatric primary care setting offers a platform to promote positive parenting behaviors and the optimal development of young children. Many new interventions have been developed and tested in this setting over the past 2 decades. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the recent published evidence regarding the impact of primary care-based interventions on parenting behaviors and child development outcomes; to provide recommendations for incorporation of effective interventions into pediatric clinics. DATA SOURCES: A literature search of PubMed and PsycINFO was conducted from January 1, 1999, to February 14, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Publications in which primary care-based interventions and reported outcomes regarding the child's development or parenting behaviors associated with the promotion of optimal child development are described. DATA EXTRACTION: Forty-eight studies in which 24 interventions were described were included. Levels of evidence and specific outcome measures are reported. RESULTS: Included interventions were categorized as general developmental support, general behavioral development, or topic-specific interventions. Two interventions resulted in reductions in developmental delay, 4 improved cognitive development scores, and 6 resulted in improved behavioral intensity or reduction in behavioral problems. Interventions used a variety of theory-based behavior change strategies such as modeling, group discussion, role play, homework assignment, coaching, and video-recorded interactions. Three interventions report the cost of the intervention. LIMITATIONS: Community or home-based interventions were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Although several interventions resulted in improved child development outcomes for children aged 0 to 3 years, comparison across studies and interventions is limited by use of different outcome measures, time of evaluation, and variability of results.",RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAM; BEHAVIORAL FAMILY INTERVENTION; YOUNG-CHILDREN PROGRAM; ADULT RELATIONSHIP ENHANCEMENT; PEDIATRIC OFFICE PRACTICES; HEALTHY STEPS; MENTAL-HEALTH; ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE; VIDEOTAPED INTERACTIONS; Pediatrics; Pediatrics; Video Meta Results Raw,Peacock-Chambers E and Ivy K and Bair-Merritt M,,,0,892

The VIPP-SD program has been tested in populations of vulnerable children and parents at risk in twelve randomized controlled trials, and shows significant effects on both positive parenting and child outcomes. Here, we present a case study of an adoptive mother and her two-and-a-half-year-old adopted daughter. During the VIPP-SD program, including one introduction visit and six intervention sessions with video feedback, the mother-child interaction revealed important changes in positive parenting and child outcomes. By describing the intervention process in some detail we hope to shed light on how the VIPP-SD program can be used by clinicians and practitioners who support families in need of parenting support.","attachment theory; behavior problems; sensitive parenting; social learning theory; VIPP-SD; video-feedback intervention; METAANALYTIC EVIDENCE; BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS; ATTACHMENT; ADOPTION; CHILDREN; INFANTS; MOTHERS; TRIAL; RISK; Psychology, Clinical; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Juffer F and Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ,,,0,893

We introduce the main tenets of design thinking and explain how they can specifically address these challenges, with an entirely new toolbox of mindsets and practices. In addition, we provide examples of a new wave of digital interventions to demonstrate the applicability of design thinking to a wide range of intervention goals. In the future, it will be critical for scientists and clinicians to implement their scientific standards, methods, and review outlets to evaluate the contribution of design thinking to the next iteration of digital mental health interventions for youth.",anxiety; depression; design thinking; e-mental health; youth; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; SELF-HELP INTERVENTIONS; YOUNG-PEOPLE; PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS; SMOKING-CESSATION; SUBSTANCE USE; VIDEO GAME; DEPRESSION; INTERNET; CHILDREN; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Scholten H and Granic I,,,0,894

They were observed and video-filmed in threes, twos or individually during literacy and numeracy lessons across two terms from January to July 2010. The video-recordings were shown later the same day to the children who had been filmed, being stopped at frequent intervals to allow the participants to comment on specific feedback incidents. The children claimed that learning was frustrated by overly directive feedback and that their learning benefited when the teacher's feedback included substantial but not burdensome detail. The children felt their learning was supported by feedback reminder cues and they noticed that negative and positive feedback provoked emotions which could interfere with or support learning. The article concludes by suggesting that Assessment for Learning might be conceptualised as a classroom conversation in which children as well as teachers assess how teacher feedback relates to children's learning, which would itself constitute a major contribution to their autonomous learning.",Video Meta Results Raw,Hargreaves E,,,0,895
1059,Brief internet-based cognitive behavior therapy program with a supplement drink improved anxiety and somatic symptoms in Japanese workers,"Background: Self-help cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a useful approach for the treatment of psychological problems. Recent research on the effectiveness of self-help internet-based CBT (ICBT) indicates that the paradigm moderately improves psychological problems. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that food and drinks containing supplements improve various health conditions. We investigated the effect of a brief self-help ICBT administered with a supplement drink on psychological well-being and somatic symptoms. Methods: In total, 101 healthy workers were enrolled in the 4-week ICBT program, which consisted of psychoeducation on stress management, behavior activation, and cognitive restructuring. The supplement soft drink was taken every day during the program. The participants were instructed to watch on-demand video clips and read the self-help guidebook and supporting comic strip weekly on the Internet or smartphone. The Japanese version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) was administered before and after completion of the program. Scores on the POMS tension-anxiety (POMS-TA), depression (POMS-D), and fatigue (POMS-F) subscales were used to assess the effect of the program. Somatic symptoms were assessed using the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. Results: In total, 75 participants continued the program for 4 weeks; however, of those, 27 failed to complete all weekly tasks or meet the post-assessment deadlines. Therefore, the data of 48 participants were included in the analysis. Pre-post intervention comparisons using paired t-tests revealed significant improvement on the POMS-TA, but not the POMS-D or POMS-F subscales. Moreover, participants reported a significant reduction in the severity of low back pain. Conclusion: Our brief intervention moderately improved anxiety levels and the symptom of low back pain. These findings suggest that the brief ICBT program is effective in non-patient populations. Future directions for brief ICBT are discussed.","Cognitive behavior therapy; Internet; L-carnosine; Self-help; Workplace; SELF-HELP TREATMENT; MENTAL-HEALTH; INTERVENTION; METAANALYSIS; DEPRESSION; CARNOSINE; DISTRESS; FATIGUE; STRESS; Psychiatry; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychiatry; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Shirotsuki K and Nonaka Y and Takano J and Abe K and Adachi SI and Adachi S and Nakao M,,,0,896
1061,Effectiveness assessment of maternal and neonatal health video clips in knowledge transfer using neuromarketing tools: A randomized crossover trial,"Audiovisual educational material has been used effectively as a knowledge translation strategy in patient education. Given the need to impact maternal mortality rates, 12 video clips related to maternal and neonatal health information were designed based on the results of a previous systematic review (SR). The content was formulated based on clinical practice guideline recommendations and validated following a formal consensus methodology. This study evaluated the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from the 12 video clips in terms of attention, emotional response, and recall by using neuroscience tools. In a randomized cross-over trial, 155 subjects (pregnant women, non-pregnant women, and men) received random sequences of 13 video clips, including a control video clip. Participants' attention levels were evaluated through eye tracking, their emotional reactions were monitored by electrodermal activity and pupillary diameter, and their recall was tested via a questionnaire. An analysis was performed to evaluate differences in the groups and between the video clips and the control clip using variance analysis models that considered period, sequence, and carry-over effects. Results revealed that fixation length was greater in women than in men, while the greatest emotional effects occurred in men. All three groups had good recall results, without any significant differences between them. Although the sequencing did influence attentional processes, no carry-over effect was demonstrated. However, a differential effect was noted among video clips in all three outcomes, that is, when adjusted for group, level of education, and having had children. The control clip generated less attention, emotional reaction, and recall than the experimental video clips. The video clips about maternal and neonatal health were shown to be effective in the transference and comprehension of information. Therefore, cognitive neuroscience techniques are useful in evaluating knowledge translation strategies through audiovisual formats.",PUPIL DIAMETER; EYE-TRACKING; BOTTOM-UP; TOP-DOWN; TRANSLATION; ATTENTION; SCIENCE; TIME; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Video Meta Results Raw,Prieto-Pinto L and Lara-Díaz MF and Garzón-Orjuela N and Herrera D and Páez-Canro C and Reyes JH and González-Gordon L and Jiménez-Murcia V and Eslava-Schmalbach J,,,0,897
1062,Social information processing skills link executive functions to aggression in adolescents with mild to borderline intellectual disability,"Executive Functions (EFs) have been associated with aggression in children and adolescents. EFs as higher-order cognitive abilities are assumed to affect cognitive functions such as Social Information Processing (SIP). We explored SIP skills as a mediating mechanism linking EFs to aggression in adolescents with mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID with IQ from 50-84), a high risk group for aggressive behaviors and EF impairments. A total of 153 adolescents (M-age = 15.24, SD = 1.35; 54% male) with MBID participated. Focused attention, behavioral inhibition, and working memory were tested with multiple neurocognitive tasks to define latent EF constructs. Participants responded to a video-based SIP task. A latent construct for aggression was defined by caretaker, teacher, and adolescent self-reports of aggression (Child Behavior Check List, Teacher Report Form, and Youth Self Report). Structural equation modeling was performed to test mediation. Results were consistent with mediation of the relation between focused attention and aggression by SIP, namely via hostile interpretations and self-efficacy for aggression. Behavioral inhibition was linked to aggression, but this relation was not mediated by SIP. The relation between working memory and aggression was mediated by SIP, namely via hostile interpretations, aggressive response generation and via self-efficacy for aggressive responses. Bearing the cross-sectional design in mind, support was found for SIP skills as a mechanism linking EFs, in particular focused attention and working memory, to aggression, providing a viable explanation for the high vulnerability of adolescents with MBID for aggression.",Social information processing; executive function; aggression; intellectual disability; focused attention; working memory; inhibition; adolescent; WORKING-MEMORY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; CHILDREN; BEHAVIOR; ADHD; PATTERNS; TASKS; METAANALYSIS; COGNITION; VALIDITY; Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw,Van Rest MM and Matthys W and Van Nieuwenhuijzen M and De Moor MH and Vriens A and Schuengel C,,,0,898
1063,The use of social-networking sites in medical education,"Background: A social-network site is a dedicated website or application which enables users to communicate with each other and share information, comments, messages, videos and images. Aims: This review aimed to ascertain if 'social-networking sites have been used successfully in medical education to deliver educational material', and whether 'healthcare professionals, and students, are engaging with social-networking sites for educational purposes'. Method: A systematic-review was undertaken using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Eight databases were searched with pre-defined search terms, limits and inclusion criteria. Data was extracted into a piloted data-table prior to the narrative-synthesis of the Quality, Utility, Extent, Strength, Target and Setting of the evidence. Results: 1047 articles were identified. Nine articles were reviewed with the majority assessing learner satisfaction. Higher outcome measures were rarely investigated. Educators used Facebook, Twitter, and a custom-made website, MedicineAfrica to achieve their objectives. Conclusions: Social-networking sites have been employed without problems of professionalism, and received positive feedback from learners. However, there is no solid evidence base within the literature that social-networking is equally or more effective than other media available for educational purposes.

METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar was performed to identify studies comparing thoracoscopic lobectomy (video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) group) and thoracotomy (open group) in LN dissection. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria and involved 2763 patients in the VATS group and 3484 patients in the open group. The meta-analysis showed that fewer total LNs (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.52 to -0.73, p < 0.0001) and N2 LNs (95% CI -1.25 to -0.10, p = 0.02) were dissected in the VATS group. A similar number of total LN stations, N2 LN stations, and N1 LNs were harvested in both groups. Only one study reported that fewer N1 LN stations were dissected in the VATS group (1.4 ± 0.5 vs. 1.6 ± 0.6, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Open lobectomy could achieve better LN dissection efficacy than thoracoscopic lobectomy in the treatment of lung cancer, especially in the N2 LNs dissection. These findings require validation by high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials.",Lung cancer; Lymph node dissection; Meta-analysis; Thoracotomy; Video-assisted thoracic surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Zhang W and Wei Y and Jiang H and Xu J and Yu D,,,0,900
1068,How digital storytelling is used in mental health: A scoping review,"The creative arts can be used to support stakeholders of mental health services to communicate and share their lived experience. Digital storytelling is one method that has been used to capture people’s lived experience. In this scoping review, we were interested in mapping how digital storytelling has been used in mental health, and to identify gaps in the literature. Nine databases were searched to identify peer reviewed literature published between January 2000 and August 2015; 15 articles were included in the review. The articles were categorized across four broad areas: educational interventions, learning skills, learning about other people’s lived experience, and learning about personal lived experience. We identify that while digital storytelling has potential as a participatory process to promote mutual understanding of and empathy towards lived experiences in mental health, there is a dearth of research in this area. More research is needed on the use of digital storytelling in mental health to determine its effectiveness in progressing a recovery orientation in service provision that is built on solidarity and a social justice agenda.

1069,Neural Activation During Mental Rotation in Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome: The Influence of Sex Hormones and Sex Chromosomes,"Sex hormones, androgens in particular, are hypothesized to play a key role in the sexual differentiation of the human brain. However, possible direct effects of the sex chromosomes, that is, XX or XY, have not been well studied in humans. Individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY karyotype but a female phenotype due to a complete androgen resistance, enable us to study the separate effects of gonadal hormones versus sex chromosomes on neural sex differences. Therefore, in the present study, we compared 46,XY men (n = 30) and 46,XX women (n = 29) to 46,XY individuals with CAIS (n = 21) on a mental rotation task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Previously reported sex differences in neural activation during mental rotation were replicated in the control groups, with control men showing more activation in the inferior parietal lobe than control women. Individuals with CAIS showed a female-like neural activation pattern in the parietal lobe, indicating feminization of the brain in CAIS. Furthermore, this first neuroimaging study in individuals with CAIS provides evidence that sex differences in regional brain function during mental rotation are most likely not directly driven by genetic sex, but rather reflect gonadal hormone exposure.",Video Meta Results Raw,van Hemmen J and Veltman DJ and Hoekzema E and Cohen-Kettenis PT and Dessens AB and Bakker J,,,0,902
1070,Patient education outcomes in surgery: a systematic review from 2004 to 2010,"Rationale and objectives In 2004, Johansson and colleagues, in their systematic review covering the years 1990-2003, documented education interventions and their effectiveness in the treatment of surgical patients. While they provide a review of the state of knowledge until 2003, recent trends in preoperative education and its effects on postoperative patients' outcomes have not been documented in a systematic review. The aim of this study was to describe preoperative educational interventions (including content and delivery time) and postoperative outcomes as considered in studies evaluating the effectiveness for patients undergoing major surgery published from 2004 to 2010. Methods A systematic review of preoperative education and its effects on postoperative patient outcomes was undertaken. A search was conducted of the PubMed, CINAHL and EBMR databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Randomised controlled trials, or at least clinical trials including pre-/post-test evaluations, with educational interventions performed by nurses preoperatively and outcomes evaluated postoperatively, and written in English, were included. Results A total of 19 studies involving 3944 patients were retrieved. Of these, 12 were randomised controlled trials. Interventions were based on verbal education, on written/visual education, or both. The content of interventions varied widely. Frequent outcomes evaluated were anxiety, knowledge, pain and length of stay. Objective knowledge (what a patient retains from education) was the only positive outcome influenced by education. Conclusions Current trends in preoperative education are: scheduling education early; increased frequency of message exposure through several interventions and/or reinforcements; content frequently addressing postoperative management; the measurement of outcomes such as patients' cognitive, experiential and biophysiological aspects. Both the clinical and research implications that emerged from the findings are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Ronco M and Iona L and Fabbro C and Bulfone G and Palese A,,,0,903

Pre- to posttest gains were found to be significantly larger in training groups (0.73 SD, k = 49) than in both control (0.38 SD, k = 10) and placebo (0.37 SD, k = 8) groups. Treatment gains in training groups were negatively affected by age of participants and duration of training sessions and positively affected by group treatment, pretraining, and memory-related interventions. No differences in treatment gain were obtained as a function of type of mnemonic taught nor the kind of pretraining used.

1072,Use of head camera-cued recall and debrief to externalise expertise: A systematic review of literature from multiple fields of practice,"Background The study of decision making in complex naturalistic environments poses several challenges. In response to these, video-stimulated cued-recall-debrief was developed. It involves an individual wearing a head-mounted camera which records a task from their point of view. Afterwards, footage captured is reviewed along with a facilitated debrief to help externalise cognitive processes. In theory, motion, audio and visual cues generate a high level of experiential immersion which helps the expert to articulate previously hidden thoughts and actions. Objective To examine the current evidence for video-stimulated cued-recall-debrief as a means of explicating expert thoughts and feelings in complex tasks in a range of environments. Study selection MEDLINE, EMBASE, Education Resources Information Center, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched for articles containing the key terms 'cued-recall (debrief)', 'decision making', 'skills' and 'video recording'. Studies were included if they examined the following outcomes: (1) feasibility, (2) extent of experiential immersion, (3) ability to generate unique insight into decision-making processes and (4) current applications. 1831 articles were identified initially, and 9 studies were included in the final review. Findings Video-stimulated cued-recall-debrief is associated with a high level of experiential immersion and generates between two and four times the number of recollections compared with free recall. It can be used to build models of cognitive activity and to characterise the way in which more and less skilled individuals tend to think and feel. Conclusions The technique could be used to explicate expertise within medicine: These insights into performance could be used as a training tool for other practitioners. © 2019 Author(s).",recall debrief; decision making; expert; skills; MOUNTED VIDEO CAMERA; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Blackhall VI and Walker KG and Whiteley I and Wilson P,,,0,905
1073,Brain activation for spontaneous and explicit false belief tasks overlaps: new fMRI evidence on belief processing and violation of expectation,"There is extensive discussion on whether spontaneous and explicit forms of ToM are based on the same cognitive/neural mechanisms or rather reflect qualitatively different processes. For the first time, we analyzed the BOLD signal for false belief processing by directly comparing spontaneous and explicit ToM task versions. In both versions, participants watched videos of a scene including an agent who acquires a true or false belief about the location of an object (belief formation phase). At the end of the movies (outcome phase), participants had to react to the presence of the object. During the belief formation phase, greater activity was found for false vs true belief trials in the right posterior parietal cortex. The ROI analysis of the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), confirmed this observation. Moreover, the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) was active during the outcome phase, being sensitive to violation of both the participant's and agent's expectations about the location of the object. Activity in the TPJ and aMPFC was not modulated by the spontaneous/explicit task. Overall, these data show that neural mechanisms for spontaneous and explicit ToM overlap. Interestingly, a dissociation between TPJ and aMPFC for belief tracking and outcome evaluation, respectively, was also found.","fMRI; spontaneous theory of mind; false belief; TEMPORO-PARIETAL JUNCTION; THEORY-OF-MIND; OTHERS BELIEFS; PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; SOCIAL COGNITION; IMPLICIT THEORY; AGENCY; METAANALYSIS; INFANTS; AUTISM; Neurosciences; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Bardi L and Desmet C and Nijhof A and Wiersema JR and Brass M,,,0,906
1074,Internet-Based Exposure Treatment Versus One-Session Exposure Treatment of Snake Phobia: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"In this study, the authors compared guided Internet-delivered self-help with one-session exposure treatment (OST) in a sample of snake phobic patients. A total of 30 patients were included following a screening on the Internet and a structured clinical interview. The Internet treatment consisted of four weekly text modules which were presented on a web page, a video in which exposure was modelled, and support provided via Internet. The OST was delivered in a three-hour session following a brief orientation session. The main outcome was the behavioural approach test (BAT), and as secondary measures questionnaires measuring anxiety symptoms and depression were used. Results showed that the groups did not differ at post-treatment or follow-up, with the exception of a significant interaction for the BAT in favour of the OST. At post-treatment, 61.5% of the Internet group and 84.6% of the OST group achieved a clinically significant improvement on the BAT. At follow-up, the corresponding figures were 90% for the Internet group and 100% for the OST group (completer sample). Within-group effect sizes for the Snake Phobia Questionnaire were large (d=1.63 and d=2.31 for the Internet and OST groups, respectively, at post-treatment). It is concluded that guided Internet-delivered exposure treatment is a potential treatment option in the treatment of snake phobia, but that OST probably is better.",Video Meta Results Raw,Andersson G and Waara J and Jonsson U and Malmaeus F and Carlbring P and Ost LG,,,0,907
1075,Core Competencies in Evidence-Based Practice for Health Professionals: Consensus Statement Based on a Systematic Review and Delphi Survey,"Importance: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is necessary for improving the quality of health care as well as patient outcomes. Evidence-based practice is commonly integrated into the curricula of undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing professional development health programs. There is, however, inconsistency in the curriculum content of EBP teaching and learning programs. A standardized set of minimum core competencies in EBP that health professionals should meet has the potential to standardize and improve education in EBP. Objective: To develop a consensus set of core competencies for health professionals in EBP. Evidence Review: For this modified Delphi survey study, a set of EBP core competencies that should be covered in EBP teaching and learning programs was developed in 4 stages: (1) generation of an initial set of relevant EBP competencies derived from a systematic review of EBP education studies for health professionals; (2) a 2-round, web-based Delphi survey of health professionals, selected using purposive sampling, to prioritize and gain consensus on the most essential EBP core competencies; (3) consensus meetings, both face-to-face and via video conference, to finalize the consensus on the most essential core competencies; and (4) feedback and endorsement from EBP experts. Findings: From an earlier systematic review of 83 EBP educational intervention studies, 86 unique EBP competencies were identified. In a Delphi survey of 234 participants representing a range of health professionals (physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals) who registered interest (88 [61.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 45.2 [10.2] years), 184 (78.6%) participated in round 1 and 144 (61.5%) in round 2. Consensus was reached on 68 EBP core competencies. The final set of EBP core competencies were grouped into the main EBP domains. For each key competency, a description of the level of detail or delivery was identified. Conclusions and Relevance: A consensus-based, contemporary set of EBP core competencies has been identified that may inform curriculum development of entry-level EBP teaching and learning programs for health professionals and benchmark standards for EBP teaching.","OUTCOME-BASED EDUCATION; EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE; GUIDE NO. 14; PRACTITIONERS; STUDENTS; MASTER; MODEL; CARE; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Albarqouni L and Hoffmann T and Straus S and Olsen NR and Young T and Ilic D and Shaneyfelt T and Haynes RB and Guyatt G and Glasziou P,,,0,908
1076,Abstract Representations of Associated Emotions in the Human Brain,"Emotions can be aroused by various kinds of stimulus modalities. Recent neuroimaging studies indicate that several brain regions represent emotions at an abstract level, i.e., independently from the sensory cues from which they are perceived (e.g., face, body, or voice stimuli). If emotions are indeed represented at such an abstract level, then these abstract representations should also be activated by the memory of an emotional event. We tested this hypothesis by asking human participants to learn associations between emotional stimuli (videos of faces or bodies) and non-emotional stimuli (fractals). After successful learning, fMRI signals were recorded during the presentations of emotional stimuli and emotion-associated fractals. We tested whether emotions could be decoded from fMRI signals evoked by the fractal stimuli using a classifier trained on the responses to the emotional stimuli (and vice versa). This was implemented as a whole-brain searchlight, multivoxel activation pattern analysis, which revealed successful emotion decoding in four brain regions: posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, MPFC, and angular gyrus. The same analysis run only on responses to emotional stimuli revealed clusters in PCC, precuneus, and MPFC. Multidimensional scaling analysis of the activation patterns revealed clear clustering of responses by emotion across stimulus types. Our results suggest that PCC, precuneus, and MPFC contain representations of emotions that can be evoked by stimuli that carry emotional information themselves or by stimuli that evoke memories of emotional stimuli, while angular gyrus is more likely to take part in emotional memory retrieval.",Video Meta Results Raw,Kim J and Schultz J and Rohe T and Wallraven C and Lee SW and Buelthoff HH,,,0,909
1077,Cognitive impairment in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis,"To determine the size of the impairment across different cognitive domains in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), a meta-analysis based on 47 studies involving 9,097 controls and 1,207 preclinical AD cases was conducted. There were marked preclinical deficits in global cognitive ability, episodic memory, perceptual speed, and executive functioning; somewhat smaller deficits in verbal ability, visuospatial skill, and attention; and no preclinical impairment in primary memory. Younger age (< 75 years) and shorter follow-up intervals (< 3 years) were associated with larger effect sizes for both global cognitive ability and episodic memory. For global cognitive ability, studies that used population-based sampling yielded larger effect sizes; for episodic memory, larger differences were seen in studies that preidentified groups in terms of baseline cognitive impairment. Within episodic memory, delayed testing and recall-based assessment resulted in the largest effect sizes. The authors conclude that deficits in multiple cognitive domains are characteristic of AD several years before clinical diagnosis. The generalized nature of the deficit is consistent with recent observations that multiple brain structures and functions are affected long before the AD diagnosis.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database and performed a manual search of selected papers. All papers and abstracts written in English that studied training and education of FAST were included. Papers were critically evaluated, looking into training methods and models of FAST, their advantages and disadvantages, number and type of training hours, practice exams in the course, and number of cases advised to achieve hospital credentialing. RESULTS: A total of 52 studies were critically analyzed. The theoretical part of the courses lasted over a median (range) of 4 (1-16) h (n = 35 studies), while the practical part lasted over a median (range) of 4 (1-32) h (n = 34 studies). The participants performed a median (range) of 10 (3-20) FAST exams during the courses (n = 13 studies). The most commonly used model was the normal human model (65 %), followed by peritoneal dialysis patients (27 %). The least used models were animal (4 %) and cadaveric models (2 %). Each of these models had their advantages and disadvantages. The median number (range) of FAST exams needed for credentialing was 50 (10-200) (n = 19 studies). CONCLUSION: Standardization of FAST training is important to improving the clinical impact of FAST. Different models used in FAST training are complementary; each has its own advantages and disadvantages. It is recommended that FAST courses be at least 2 days (16 h) long. The first day should include 4 h of theory and 4 h of training on normal human models. The second day should enforce learning using animal models, case scenarios including video clips, or simulators.",Video Meta Results Raw,Mohammad A and Hefny AF and Abu-Zidan FM,,,0,911
1079,Observing Action Sequences Elicits Sequence-Specific Neural Representations in Frontoparietal Brain Regions,"Learning new skills by watching others is important for social and motor development throughout the lifespan. Prior research has suggested that observational learning shares common substrates with physical practice at both cognitive and brain levels. In addition, neuroimaging studies have used multivariate analysis techniques to understand neural representations in a variety of domains, including vision, audition, memory, and action, but few studies have investigated neural plasticity in representational space. Therefore, although movement sequences can be learned by observing other people's actions, a largely unanswered question in neuroscience is how experience shapes the representational space of neural systems. Here, across a sample of male and female participants, we combined pretraining and posttraining fMRI sessions with 6 d of observational practice to determine whether the observation of action sequences elicits sequence-specific representations in human frontoparietal brain regions and the extent to which these representations become more distinct with observational practice. Our results showed that observed action sequences are modeled by distinct patterns of activity in frontoparietal cortex and that such representations largely generalize to very similar, but untrained, sequences. These findings advance our understanding of what is modeled during observational learning (sequence-specific information), as well as how it is modeled (reorganization of frontoparietal cortex is similar to that previously shown following physical practice). Therefore, on a more fine-grained neural level than demonstrated previously, our findings reveal how the representational structure of frontoparietal cortex maps visual information onto motor circuits in order to enhance motor performance.",action observation; fMRI; MVPA; sequence learning; VOXEL PATTERN-ANALYSIS; ACTION OBSERVATION NETWORK; MOTOR; IMITATION; CORTEX; MECHANISMS; FMRI; METAANALYSIS; NEUROSCIENCE; STIMULATION; Neurosciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw,Apsvalka D and Cross ES and Ramsey R,,,0,912
1080,Assessment of Learner Acceptance and Satisfaction with Video-Based Instructional Materials for Teaching Practical Skills at a Distance,"As video-based instructional materials become available to distance learners to learn practical skills at a distance, it is important to assess the instructional effectiveness of these materials and to understand how students respond to them. This paper is the second part of a larger exploratory study that assessed the instructional effectiveness of video-based instructional materials for teaching distance learners practical skills in block-laying and concreting and how learners respond to these instructional materials. Specifically, this paper aims to assess learners' acceptance and satisfaction with the materials. It also aims to determine whether levels of learner satisfaction and acceptance differ according to study centres. Data were collected from 71 respondents at three study centres using a self-completion questionnaire comprising 17 Likert-type items. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and Scheffe's post hoc test at a 0.05 level of significance. Learners appeared positive about their learning experiences with the use of video-based instructional materials to learn practical skills at a distance as they rated highly all the items assessing their acceptance and satisfaction. Results of item-by-item ANOVA regarding learner acceptance indicated that the respondents, categorized according to study centres, exhibited similar levels of acceptance for nine of the ten items. For learner satisfaction, there were no statistically significant differences for six of the seven items. Thus, learners of different study centres exhibited about the same level of acceptance and satisfaction.",Video Meta Results Raw,Donkor F,,,0,913
1081,Defining the neural correlates of spontaneous theory of mind (ToM): An fMRI multi-study investigation,"There is a major debate in the theory of mind (ToM) field, concerning whether spontaneous and explicit ToM are based on the same or two distinct cognitive systems. While extensive research on the neural correlates of explicit ToM has demonstrated involvement of the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), few studies investigated spontaneous ToM, leaving some open questions. Here, we implemented a multi-study approach by pooling data from three fMRI studies to obtain a larger sample to increase power and sensitivity to better define the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying spontaneous ToM. Participants watched videos in which an agent acquires a true or false belief about the location of a ball. Thus, the belief of the agent and that of the participant could either match or differ. Importantly, participants were never asked to consider the belief of the agent and were only instructed to press a button when they detected the presence of the ball after an occluder fell at the end of each video. By analysing the blood-oxygen level dependent signal during the belief formation phase for false versus true beliefs, we found a cluster of activation in the right, and to a lesser extent, left posterior parietal cortex spanning the TPJ, but no mPFC activation. Region of interest (ROI) analysis on bilateral TPJ and mPFC confirmed these results and added evidence to the asymmetry in laterality of the TPJ in spontaneous ToM. Interestingly, the whole brain analysis, supported by an overlap with brain maps, revealed maximum activation in areas involved in visuospatial working memory and attention switching functions, such as the supramarginal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus, and the inferior frontal gyrus. By contrast, evidence for the presence of brain-behaviour correlations was mixed and there was no evidence for functional connectivity between the TPJ and mPFC. Taken together, these findings help clarifying the brain system supporting spontaneous ToM.","Theory of mind; fMRI; Spontaneous mentalizing; False belief; Temporo-parietal junction; TEMPORO-PARIETAL JUNCTION; RIGHT TEMPOROPARIETAL JUNCTION; FALSE-BELIEF; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN; METAANALYSIS; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; OTHERS; Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Video Meta Results Raw",Boccadoro S and Cracco E and Hudson AR and Bardi L and Nijhof AD and Wiersema JR and Brass M and Mueller SC,,,0,914

1083,"Beyond Adoption: A New Framework for Theorizing and Evaluating Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies","BACKGROUND: Many promising technological innovations in health and social care are characterized by nonadoption or abandonment by individuals or by failed attempts to scale up locally, spread distantly, or sustain the innovation long term at the organization or system level. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to produce an evidence-based, theory-informed, and pragmatic framework to help predict and evaluate the success of a technology-supported health or social care program. METHODS: The study had 2 parallel components: (1) secondary research (hermeneutic systematic review) to identify key domains, and (2) empirical case studies of technology implementation to explore, test, and refine these domains. We studied 6 technology-supported programs-video outpatient consultations, global positioning system tracking for cognitive impairment, pendant alarm services, remote biomarker monitoring for heart failure, care organizing software, and integrated case management via data sharing-using longitudinal ethnography and action research for up to 3 years across more than 20 organizations. Data were collected at micro level (individual technology users), meso level (organizational processes and systems), and macro level (national policy and wider context). Analysis and synthesis was aided by sociotechnically informed theories of individual, organizational, and system change. The draft framework was shared with colleagues who were introducing or evaluating other technology-supported health or care programs and refined in response to feedback. RESULTS: The literature review identified 28 previous technology implementation frameworks, of which 14 had taken a dynamic systems approach (including 2 integrative reviews of previous work). Our empirical dataset consisted of over 400 hours of ethnographic observation, 165 semistructured interviews, and 200 documents. The final nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework included questions in 7 domains: the condition or illness, the technology, the value proposition, the adopter system (comprising professional staff, patient, and lay caregivers), the organization(s), the wider (institutional and societal) context, and the interaction and mutual adaptation between all these domains over time. Our empirical case studies raised a variety of challenges across all 7 domains, each classified as simple (straightforward, predictable, few components), complicated (multiple interacting components or issues), or complex (dynamic, unpredictable, not easily disaggregated into constituent components). Programs characterized by complicatedness proved difficult but not impossible to implement. Those characterized by complexity in multiple NASSS domains rarely, if ever, became mainstreamed. The framework showed promise when applied (both prospectively and retrospectively) to other programs. CONCLUSIONS: Subject to further empirical testing, NASSS could be applied across a range of technological innovations in health and social care. It has several potential uses: (1) to inform the design of a new technology; (2) to identify technological solutions that (perhaps despite policy or industry enthusiasm) have a limited chance of achieving large-scale, sustained adoption; (3) to plan the implementation, scale-up, or rollout of a technology program; and (4) to explain and learn from program failures.","diffusion of innovation; scale-up; program sustainability; implementation; complexity of innovations; business planning; NASSS framework; nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, sustainability framework; innovation adoption; FRONTLINE STAFF ACCEPTANCE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; HEART-FAILURE; TELEHEALTH; IMPLEMENTATION; INNOVATION; BARRIERS; SUCCESS; DESIGN; WORK; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw",Greenhalgh T and Wherton J and Papoutsi C and Lynch J and Hughes G and A'Court C and Hinder S and Fahy N and Procter R and Shaw S,,,0,916

Technology has shown to be effective in supporting prewriting, drafting, revising, proofreading, and publishing of written products. This article explains the use of one technology-based graphic organizer with embedded self-regulated learning strategies as well as universal design for learning (UDL) features that can be used to enhance the writing process for students with LD and EBD. Such technology categories as technology-based graphic organizers, word prediction, speech recognition, talking word processors, as well as multimedia and digital storytelling programs are discussed.

1085,Game Features and Individual Differences: Interactive Effects on Motivation and Performance,"To optimize the benefits of game-based practice within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), researchers examine how game features influence students' motivation and performance. The current study examined the influence of game features and individual differences (reading ability and learning intentions) on motivation and performance. Participants (n = 58) viewed lesson videos in iSTART-2, an ITS designed to improve reading comprehension skills, and practiced with either a game-like activity or a minimally game-like activity. No main effects of game environment were observed. However, there was an interaction between game environment and pretest learning intentions in predicting students' self-reported effort. The correlation between learning intentions and self-reported effort was not significant for students who practiced with the more game-like activity, whereas it was for students who practiced in the less game-like activity. We discuss the implications for this interaction and how it might drive future research.",Video Meta Results Raw,Jacovina ME and Snow EL and Jackson GT and McNamara DS,,,0,918
1086,Enhancing the connection between the classroom and the clinical workplace: A systematic review,"INTRODUCTION: Although medical students are increasingly exposed to clinical experiences as part of their training, these often occur parallel with, rather than connected to, their classroom-based learning experiences. Additionally, students seem to struggle with spontaneously making the connection between these spheres of their training themselves. Therefore, this systematic review synthesized the existing evidence about educational interventions that aim to enhance the connection between learning in the classroom and its application in the workplace. METHODS: Electronic databases (AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, Medline, RDRB, PsycINFO and WoS) were screened for quantitative and qualitative studies investigating educational interventions that referenced a connection between the classroom and workplace-based experiences within undergraduate, graduate or postgraduate medical education. RESULTS: Three types of interventions were identified: classroom to workplace interventions, workplace to classroom interventions, and interventions involving multiple connections between the two settings. Most interventions involved a tool (e. g. video, flow chart) or a specific process (e. g. linking patient cases with classroom-based learning content, reflecting on differences between what was learned and how it works in practice) which aimed to enhance the connection between the two settings. DISCUSSION: Small-scale interventions can bring classroom learning and workplace practice into closer alignment. Such interventions appear to be the necessary accompaniments to curricular structures, helping bridge the gap between classroom learning and workplace experience. This paper documents examples that may serve to assist medical educators in connecting the classroom and the workplace.",Transfer; Systematic review; Integration; EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE; CAMBRIDGE INTEGRATED CLERKSHIP; WARD-BASED PROGRAM; LEARNING CURRICULUM; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; SCHOOL; CARE; EXPERIENCE; MODEL; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Peters S and Clarebout G and Diemers A and Delvaux N and Verburgh A and Aertgeerts B and Roex A,,,1,919

1088,Overestimation of action-game training effects: Publication bias and Salami slicing,"Does playing action video games improve performance on tests of cognitive ability? A recent meta-analysis (Bediou et al., 2018a) summarized the available evidence and concluded that it can. Their analysis, however, did not adequately correct for publication bias. We re-analyzed the same set of studies with more appropriate adjustments for publication bias and found minimal evidence for transfer of training to cognitive ability measures. Instead, it is possible that there are little or no benefits, just publication bias — the exclusion of non-significant results from the published literature. That bias may be the cause of a lab effect reported in the original meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that studies from the Bavelier lab (the senior author of the meta-analysis) reported larger effects than other labs. We show that many of these original studies distributed different outcomes from the same or highly overlapping sets of participants across publications without noting the overlap. This salami-slicing might contribute to the extent of publication bias in the literature. More compelling, independent, and transparent evidence is needed before concluding that action video game training transfers to performance on other cognitive tasks. © 2019 The Author(s).","video game training; action game training; cognitive training; meta-analysis; publication bias; salami slicing; METAANALYSIS; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Hilgard J and Sala G and Boot WR and Simons DJ,,,0,921
1089,Screen Violence and Youth Behavior,"Violence in screen entertainment media (ie, television, film, video games, and the Internet), defined as depictions of characters (or players) trying to physically harm other characters (or players), is ubiquitous. The Workgroup on Media Violence and Violent Video Games reviewed numerous meta-analyses and other relevant research from the past 60 years, with an emphasis on violent video game research. Consistent with every major science organization review, the Workgroup found compelling evidence of short-term harmful effects, as well as evidence of long-term harmful effects. The vast majority of laboratory-based experimental studies have revealed that violent media exposure causes increased aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiologic arousal, hostile appraisals, aggressive behavior, and desensitization to violence and decreases prosocial behavior (eg, helping others) and empathy. Still, to more fully understand the potential for long-term harm from media violence exposure, the field is greatly in need of additional large-sample, high-quality, longitudinal studies that include validated measures of media violence exposure and measures of other known violence risk factors. Also, although several high-quality media violence intervention studies have been conducted, larger-scale studies with more comprehensive and longer-term assessments are needed to fully understand long-term effects and to inform the development of tools that will help to reduce problems associated with aggression and violence. The evidence that violent screen media constitutes a causal risk factor for increased aggression is compelling. Modern social-cognitive theories of social behavior provide useful frameworks for understanding how and why these effects occur.",violence; adolescent development; social media; psychosocial development; Adolescent Development; Psychosocial Development; Violence; Media Exposure; Computer Games; Films; Television Viewing; Internet Usage; Social Media; Video Meta Results Raw,Anderson CA and Bushman BJ and Bartholow BD and Cantor J and Christakis D and Coyne SM and Donnerstein E and Brockmyer JF and Gentile DA and Green CS and Huesmann R and Hummer T and Krahé B and Strasburger VC and Warburton W and Wilson BJ and Ybarra M,,,0,922
1090,Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback in Adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is associated with poor self-control, underpinned by inferior fronto-striatal deficits. Real-time functional magnetic resonance neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) allows participants to gain self-control over dysregulated brain regions. Despite evidence for beneficial effects of electrophysiological-NF on ADHD symptoms, no study has applied the spatially superior rtfMRI-NF neurotherapy to ADHD. A randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of rtfMRI-NF of right inferior prefrontal cortex (rIFG), a key region that is compromised in ADHD and upregulated with psychostimulants, on improvement of ADHD symptoms, cognition, and inhibitory fMRI activation. To control for region-specificity, an active control group received rtfMRI-NF of the left parahippocampal gyrus (lPHG). Thirty-one ADHD boys were randomly allocated and had to learn to upregulate their target brain region in an average of 11 rtfMRI-NF runs over 2 weeks. Feedback was provided through a video-clip of a rocket that had to be moved up into space. A transfer session without feedback tested learning retention as a proximal measure of transfer to everyday life. Both NF groups showed significant linear activation increases with increasing number of runs in their respective target regions and significant reduction in ADHD symptoms after neurotherapy and at 11-month follow-up. Only the group targeting rIFG, however, showed a transfer effect, which correlated with ADHD symptom reductions, improved at trend level in sustained attention, and showed increased IFG activation during an inhibitory fMRI task. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates for the first time feasibility, safety, and shorter-and longer-term efficacy of rtfMRI-NF of rIFG in adolescents with ADHD.

1093,"The Impact of Aerobic Exercise on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Neurocognition in Individuals With Schizophrenia: A Single-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial","Individuals with schizophrenia display substantial neurocognitive deficits for which available treatments offer only limited benefits. Yet, findings from studies of animals, clinical and nonclinical populations have linked neurocognitive improvements to increases in aerobic fitness (AF) via aerobic exercise training (AE). Such improvements have been attributed to up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, the impact of AE on neurocognition, and the putative role of BDNF, have not been investigated in schizophrenia. Employing a proof-of-concept, single-blind, randomized clinical trial design, 33 individuals with schizophrenia were randomized to receive standard psychiatric treatment (n = 17; \treatment as usual\'; TAU) or attend a 12-week AE program (n = 16) utilizing active-play video games (Xbox 360 Kinect) and traditional AE equipment.

1094,Sex Differences in Visual Motion Processing,"The importance of sex as a biological variable has recently been emphasized by major funding organizations [1] and within the neuroscience community [2]. Critical sex-based neural differences are indicated by, for example, conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that have a strong sex bias with a higher prevalence among males [51, 3]. Motivated by this broader context, we report a marked sex difference in a visual motion perception task among neurotypical adults. Motion duration thresholds [4, 5] the minimum duration needed to accurately perceive motion direction were considerably shorter for males than females. We replicated this result across three laboratories and 263 total participants. This type of enhanced performance has previously been observed only in special populations including ASD, depression, and senescence [6-8]. The observed sex difference cannot be explained by general differences in speed of visual processing, overall visual discrimination abilities, or potential motor-related differences. We also show that while individual differences in motion duration thresholds are associated with differences in fMRI responsiveness of human MT+, surprisingly, MT+response magnitudes did not differ between males and females. Thus, we reason that sex differences in motion perception are not captured by an MT+fMRI measure that predicts within-sex individual differences in perception. Overall, these results show how sex differences can manifest unexpectedly, highlighting the importance of sex as a factor in the design and analysis of perceptual and cognitive studies.",CENTER-SURROUND ANTAGONISM; VIDEO GAME PLAY; GENDER SIMILARITIES; SPATIAL SUPPRESSION; PERCEPTION; NORMALIZATION; METAANALYSIS; MECHANISMS; NEURONS; SPEED; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology; Video Meta Results Raw,Murray SO and Schallmo MP and Kolodny T and Millin R and Kale A and Thomas P and Rammsayer TH and Troche SJ and Bernier RA and Tadin D,,,0,925
1095,Effect of telerehabilitation on mobility in people after hip surgery: a pilot feasibility study,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of telerehabilitation on mobility in people following hip surgery. This feasibility pilot randomized controlled trial included a sample of 40 participants, with 22 male and 18 female patients and mean age (SD) of 67.5 (7.8) years following a surgical intervention. Participants were equally divided and randomly assigned to a telerehabilitation or control intervention group (6 weeks, 3 sessions/week). Telerehabilitation was based on video clips of common rehabilitation exercises focusing on the lower limbs. The control group received an exercise booklet. Both groups participated in physical therapy sessions, twice a week. Outcome measures included the Timed Up and Go test, 2-min walk test, 10-m walk test, sit to stand test, walking speed, and mean step length. Measurements were completed at baseline, at termination of the intervention, and at a 4-week follow-up examination. Improvements in both groups were demonstrated in all outcome measures in the postintervention evaluation. Improvements in the telerehabilitation group were greater in five of six tests compared with those achieved by the controls. The telerehabilitation group showed greater improvements in the 2-min walking test (86.1%) and walking speed (65.6%). During follow-up, the telerehabilitation group continued to improve in all outcome measures in contrast to the control group, who showed no changes in five of the six outcome measures. Telerehabilitation, a complementary treatment to standard physical therapy, generates a positive effect on mobility in people following hip surgery.",hip surgery; mobility; orthopedic; physical therapy; telerehabilitation; walking; LOWER-LIMB AMPUTATION; REPLACEMENT SURGERY; WALK TEST; PROGRAM; REHABILITATION; METAANALYSIS; RELIABILITY; ADHERENCE; VALIDITY; HOME; Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw,Kalron A and Tawil H and Peleg-Shani S and Vatine JJ,,,0,926
1096,Potential Benefits of Exergaming for Cognition and Dual-Task Function in Older Adults: A Systematic Review,"This paper provides a systematic review of current research findings using exergaming as a treatment for improving cognition and dual-task function in older adults. A literature search was conducted to collect exergaming intervention studies that were either randomized controlled or uncontrolled studies. Of the seven identified studies (five randomized controlled studies and two uncontrolled studies), three studies focused on cognitive function alone, two studies focused on dual-task function alone, and two studies measured both cognitive function and dual-task function. Current evidence supports that exergaming improves cognitive function and dual-task function, which potentially leads to fall prevention. However, it is unclear whether exergaming, which involves both cognitive input and physical exercise, has additional benefits compared with traditional physical exercise alone. Further studies should include traditional exercise as a control group to identify these potential, additional benefits.",Video Meta Results Raw,Ogawa EF and You T and Leveille SG,,,0,927

Gait is markedly impaired and could benefit from targeted intervention to improve quality of life for patient and caregivers. OBJECTIVE: To establish the state of the art regarding gait deviations in patients with Dravet Syndrome. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, Web of Science, Science Direct and Embase. Studies that assessed gait deviations in patients diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome using clinical observation, video gait analysis or three dimensional (3D) gait analysis and reported gait characteristics, spatiotemporal or kinematic outcomes were included. Screening, quality assessment and data extraction were performed by independent reviewers. RESULTS: Out of a total of 478 citations, nine articles were included. The total study population had an age range from 2.5 to 47 years. Three studies used clinical observation, three studies video analysis and three studies 3D gait analysis. Crouch gait was observed in about half of the population next to a variety of other gait deviations such as parkinsonian and cerebellar gait. Other findings included abnormalities in spatiotemporal parameters and kinematics, passive knee extension deficits, skeletal malalignment and neurological signs. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of gait characteristics was observed with crouch gait being the most reported gait pattern. Inconsistency in methods and findings from clinical and instrumented evaluation impede thorough understanding of the causal mechanism and evolution behind these deviations.

The random-effects meta-analysis provides a quantitative measure of the overall effect of captions on listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition, as well as an investigation into the relationship between captioning effectiveness and two potential moderators: test type and proficiency level.We conducted a systematic review and calculated effect sizes for 18 retrieved studies. Separate meta-analyses were performed for listening comprehension (including data of 15 studies) and for vocabulary learning (including data from 10 studies). The findings indicate a large effect of captions on listening comprehension as well as on vocabulary acquisition. Test type was found to moderate the effect sizes of listening comprehension. Proficiency level did not moderate the effect sizes of listening comprehension and vocabulary learning.

PGC training focuses on learning-specific client-centred skills; applying practice sessions with feedback; specific skills training; and a group review of videoed performances of the trainees. Pre-training results show that trainees use self-disclosure and suggestion as their primary way of communicating with the client, focusing on explanations behind the client problems. Post-training results show a significant decrease in the use of self-disclosure, and an increase in the use of reflection; indicating improvement in the counsellor trainees' client-centredness. Overall, results indicate that PGC training can be an effective method in increasing trainees' client-centred responses and reducing counsellor-centred responses.","Counsellor responses; skilled counselling; counsellor training; counsellor trainees; THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE; SELF-AWARENESS; THERAPIST; PSYCHOTHERAPY; SKILLS; METAANALYSIS; RECALL; MODEL; Psychology, Applied; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Rantanen AP and Soini HS,,,0,930

It has become extremely detrimental as the social media and the internet have become more popular and omnipresent. People use the internet services to viciously attack others from behind a screen. The substantial growth in the dimensionality, heterogeneity, subjectivity and multimodality of social media and the pressing need to timely curtail the damage instigated through cyberbullying, has fostered the need to devise automated mechanisms which detect such unfavorable activities. The use of soft computing techniques to handle such pernicious issue has been studied invariably and widely in literature. This study is to understand the viability, scope and significance of this alliance of using soft computing techniques for cyberbullying detection on social multimedia. This work is a systematic literature review to gather, explore, comprehend and analyze the research trends, gaps and prospects of this pairing in a well-organized way. The contribution of this study is noteworthy as it focuses on the use and application of soft computing techniques for cyberbullying detection on social multimedia utilizing a meta-analytic approach in order to integrate, interpret and critically analyze the findings in the original studies for expounding novel approaches to achieve comparable and effectual results pertaining to the defined research domain.

1103,"A systematic review of methods for studying consumer health YouTube videos, with implications for systematic reviews","Background. YouTube is an increasingly important medium for consumer health information - with content provided by healthcare professionals, government and non-government organizations, industry, and consumers themselves. It is a rapidly developing area of study for healthcare researchers. We examine the methods used in reviews of YouTube consumer health videos to identify trends and best practices. Methods and Materials. Published reviews of consumer-oriented health-related YouTube videos were identified through PubMed. Data extracted from these studies included type of journal, topic, characteristics of the search, methods of review including number of reviewers and method to achieve consensus between reviewers, inclusion and exclusion criteria, characteristics of the videos reported, ethical oversight, and follow-up. Results. Thirty-three studies were identified. Most were recent and published in specialty journals. Typically, these included more than 100 videos, and were examined by multiple reviewers. Most studies described characteristics of the videos, number of views, and sometime characteristics of the viewers. Accuracy of portrayal of the health issue under consideration was a common focus. Conclusion. Optimal transparency and reproducibility of studies of YouTube health-related videos can be achieved by following guidance designed for systematic review reporting, with attention to several elements specific to the video medium. Particularly when seeking to replicate consumer viewing behavior, investigators should consider the method used to select search terms, and use a snowballing rather than a sequential screening approach.

1104,Evaluating trauma team performance in a Level i trauma center: Validation of the trauma team communication assessment (TTCA-24),"BACKGROUND: Nontechnical skills (NTS), such as team communication, are well-recognized determinants of trauma team performance and good patient care. Measuring these competencies during trauma resuscitations is essential, yet few valid and reliable tools are available. We aimed to demonstrate that the Trauma Team Communication Assessment (TTCA-24) is a valid and reliable instrument that measures communication effectiveness during activations. METHODS: Two tools with adequate psychometric strength (Trauma Nontechnical Skills Scale [T-NOTECHS], Team Emergency Assessment Measure [TEAM]) were identified during a systematic review of medical literature and compared with TTCA-24. Three coders used each tool to evaluate 35 stable and 35 unstable patient activations (defined according to Advanced Trauma Life Support criteria). Interrater reliability was calculated between coders using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to establish concurrent validity between TTCA-24 and the other two validated tools. RESULTS: Coders achieved an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87 for stable patient activations and 0.78 for unstable activations scoring excellent on the interrater agreement guidelines. The median score for each assessment showed good team communication for all 70 videos (TEAM, 39.8 of 54; T-NOTECHS, 17.4 of 25; and TTCA-24, 87.4 of 96). A significant correlation between TTTC-24 and T-NOTECHS was revealed (p = 0.029), but no significant correlation between TTCA-24 and TEAM (p = 0.77). Team communication was rated slightly better across all assessments for stable versus unstable patient activations, but not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: TTCA-24 correlated with T-NOTECHS, an instrument measuring nontechnical skills for trauma teams, but not TEAM, a tool that assesses communication in generic emergency settings. TTCA-24 is a reliable and valid assessment that can be a useful adjunct when evaluating interpersonal and team communication during trauma activations. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

1105,A Player-Centric Approach to Designing Spatial Skill Training Games,"Certain video games show promise as tools for training spatial skills, one of the strongest predictors of future success in STEM. However, little is known about the gaming preferences of those who would benefit the most from such interventions: low spatial skill students. To provide guidance on how to design training games for this population, we conducted a survey of 350 participants from three populations: online college-age, students from a low SES high school, and students from a high SES high school. Participants took a timed test of spatial skills and then answered questions about their demographics, gameplay habits, preferences, and motivations. The only predictors of spatial skill were gender and population: female participants from online and low SES high school populations had the lowest spatial skill. In light of these findings, we provide design recommendations for game-based spatial skill interventions targeting low spatial skill students.","spatial reasoning; cognitive training; gender; video games; emotions; motivation; VIDEO-GAME; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BUILDING-BLOCKS; EXPERIENCE; METAANALYSIS; ABILITY; PERFORMANCE; COMPUTER; MEMORY; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Computer Science; Video Meta Results Raw",Wauck H and Mekler ED and Fu WT,,,0,936
1106,The development of social emotional learning programs in a cross-cultural elementary classroom,"The purpose of this study was to develop an intervention to improve the SEL skills of learners in a cross-cultural school context. The study involved the development and trial of an intervention program designed to develop social emotional skills. Participants were 30 Thai learners as well as six learners from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos in a socio-economic and culturally diverse classroom. Prior to participation, the 36 students completed the SDQ. The SDQ was also completed by parents/guardians and teachers of the 36 students. The intervention lasted 15 weeks and structured learning blended with nine multimedia social stories along with various activities. The results are presented as pre-post for the whole group which was statistically significant, meaning that the intervention was effective in improving the social skills.",learning innovation; social emotional learning; SEL; development; elementary; SEL programs; active learning; social story; strengths and difficulties behaviour; strengths and difficulties questionnaire; SDQ; cross-cultural; DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; CHILDREN; STRENGTHS; SKILLS; INTERVENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; COMPETENCE; BEHAVIOR; Management; Business & Economics; Video Meta Results Raw,Pinchumphonsang S and Chanchalor S,,,0,937
1107,Lernen mit Multimedia = Learning with multimedia,"Reviews the literature on factors influencing formal and informal learning with hypermedia. Although meta-analyses and individual studies show that hypermedia systems have great potential for improving learning performances, most of the recent multimedia systems have demonstrated only small or no positive effects on learning. The effectiveness of multimedia is influenced by several internal and external factors, including prior knowledge; motivation; type, content, and combination of media; curricular context; and learning conditions. The study design also has an important influence on observed results. Thus, there are no simple criteria to guide the effective application of hypermedia.

1108,VQ applications in steganographic data hiding upon multimedia images,"Data hiding is one of the most important techniques to achieve better data and communication protection by hiding information into a media carrier. It provides a secure method to distribute data through a public and open channel. Data hiding for vector quantization (VQ)-based images focuses on the problem of embedding secret data into a cover VQ-based image to achieve secret communication and data protection. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review and comparison of the different existing data-hiding methods for VQ-based images. In this paper, we classify VQ-based data-hiding methods into four nonoverlapping groups according to their reversibility and output formats, introduce the details of the representative methods, summarize the features of the representative methods, and compare the performance of the representative methods using peak signal-to-noise ratio, capacity of secret data, and bit rate. Our paper shows that an irreversible method is very likely a VQ-based data-hiding method that produces a stego-image as its output, and it can embed more secret data than a reversible method. Nonstandard encoding methods (e.g., joint neighboring coding) are becoming popular in reversible data hiding since they can increase the capacity for embedding the secret data. Some methods with high compression rate, such as the search-order coding-based methods, may reduce the compression rate in return for the capacity for the secret data. © 2011 IEEE.",Date hiding; image processing; steganography; vector quantization (VQ); Bit rates; Compression rates; Data hiding; Data protection; Date hiding; Multimedia images; Non-standard encoding; Open channels; Peak signal-to-noise ratio; Reversible data hiding; Secret data; State-of-the-art reviews; Stego image; Codes (symbols); Communication; Image processing; Multimedia systems; Signal to noise ratio; Steganography; Vector quantization; Data communication systems; Video Meta Results Raw,Wang WJ and Huang CT and Wang SJ,,,0,939
1109,"Interviewee Selection Test and Evaluator Assessments of General Mental Ability, Emotional Intelligence and Extraversion: Relationships with Structured Behavioral and Situational Interview Performance","The purpose of the study was to examine antecedents of interview performance commonly measured via two divergent methods; selection tests and evaluator assessments. General mental ability (GMA), emotional intelligence (EI), and extraversion have been largely studied in isolation. This study evaluates the relative strength of these traits across methods and tests whether selection test and evaluator-assessed traits interact to further enhance the prediction of interview performance. 81 interviewees were asked to complete traditional selection tests of GMA, EI, extraversion, and a video-recorded structured behavioral and situational job interview. The traits, behavioral, and situational interview performance were then evaluated with three independent sets of raters. Regression analysis was used to investigate the extent that these traits predicted structured interview performance. Results indicate that each trait was a strong predictor of interview performance, but results differed based on the method of measurement and the type of structured interview assessed. Further, evaluator perceptions related to interview performance more strongly than did selection tests. Finally, evaluator assessments of each trait interacted with its respective selection test counterpart to further enhance the prediction of interview performance. This improves our understanding of how applicant traits impact hiring decisions. This is the first study to directly compare tested versus others' ratings of interviewee GMA, EI, and extraversion as predictors of interview performance.",Video Meta Results Raw,Kluemper DH and McLarty BD and Bishop TR and Sen A,,,0,940

1111,Interactive Cognitive-Motor Step Training Improves Cognitive Risk Factors of Falling in Older Adults - A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Purpose Interactive cognitive-motor training (ICMT) requires individuals to perform both gross motor movements and complex information processing. This study investigated the effectiveness of ICMT on cognitive functions associated with falls in older adults. Methods A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in community-dwelling older adults (N = 90, mean age 81.5 +/- 7) without major cognitive impairment. Participants in the intervention group (IG) played four stepping games that required them to divide attention, inhibit irrelevant stimuli, switch between tasks, rotate objects and make rapid decisions. The recommended minimum dose was three 20-minute sessions per week over a period of 16 weeks unsupervised at home. Participants in the control group (CG) received an evidence- based brochure on fall prevention. Measures of processing speed, attention/executive function (EF), visuo-spatial ability, concerns about falling and depression were assessed before and after the intervention. Results Eighty-one participants (90%) attended re-assessment. There were no improvements with respect to the Stroop Stepping Test (primary outcome) in the intervention group. Compared to the CG, the IG improved significantly in measures of processing speed, visuo-spatial ability and concern about falling. Significant interactions were observed for measures of EF and divided attention, indicating group differences varied for different levels of the covariate with larger improvements in IG participants with poorer baseline performance. The interaction for depression showed no change for the IG but an increase in the CG for those with low depressive symptoms at baseline. Additionally, low and high-adherer groups differed in their baseline performance and responded differently to the intervention. Compared to high adherers, low adherers improved more in processing speed and visual scanning while high-adherers improved more in tasks related to EF. Conclusions This study shows that unsupervised stepping ICMT led to improvements in specific cognitive functions associated with falls in older people. Low adherers improved in less complex functions while high-adherers improved in EF.",Video Meta Results Raw,Schoene D and Valenzuela T and Toson B and Delbaere K and Severino C and Garcia J and Davies TA and Russell F and Smith ST and Lord SR,,,0,942
1112,Applying adult learning practices in medical education,"The application of the best practices of teaching adults to the education of adults in medical education settings is important in the process of transforming learners to become and remain effective physicians. Medical education at all levels should be designed to equip physicians with the knowledge, clinical skills, and professionalism that are required to deliver quality patient care. The ultimate outcome is the health of the patient and the health status of the society. In the translational science of medical education, improved patient outcomes linked directly to educational events are the ultimate goal and are best defined by rigorous medical education research efforts. To best develop faculty, the same principles of adult education and teaching adults apply. In a systematic review of faculty development initiatives designed to improve teaching effectiveness in medical education, the use of experiential learning, feedback, effective relationships with peers, and diverse educational methods were found to be most important in the success of these programs. In this article, we present 5 examples of applying the best practices in teaching adults and utilizing the emerging understanding of the neurobiology of learning in teaching students, trainees, and practitioners. These include (1) use of standardized patients to develop communication skills, (2) use of online quizzes to assess knowledge and aid self-directed learning, (3) use of practice sessions and video clips to enhance significant learning of teaching skills, (4) use of case-based discussions to develop professionalism concepts and skills, and (5) use of the American Academy of Pediatrics PediaLink as a model for individualized learner-directed online learning. These examples highlight how experiential leaning, providing valuable feedback, opportunities for practice, and stimulation of self-directed learning can be utilized as medical education continues its dynamic transformation in the years ahead.",Video Meta Results Raw,Reed S and Shell R and Kassis K and Tartaglia K and Wallihan R and Smith K and Hurtubise L and Martin B and Ledford C and Bradbury S and Bernstein HH and Mahan JD,,,0,943
1113,A preoperative predictive scoring system to predict the ability to achieve the critical view of safety during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a preoperative scoring system to predict the ability to achieve the critical view of safety (CVS) in patients undergoing emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for acute cholecystitis (AC). Methods: A retrospective review of patients who underwent LC for AC between 2012 and 2015 was performed. The achievement or failure of creating the CVS was judged by operative records, video recordings, and interviews of the surgeons. Independent preoperative variables associated with failure were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis and a prediction scoring system created. Results: A C-reactive protein (CRP) >5.5 mg/dl, gallstone impaction, and symptom onset to operation > 72 h were identified as independently correlated risk factors for the failure to achieve the CVS. A preoperative risk scoring system for the failure to create the CVS (0-5 points) was constructed using these 3 factors: CRP >5.5 mg/dl (2 points), gallstone impaction (1 points), and time from symptom onset to operation >72 h (2 points). When monitoring the frequency of patients who had a failure to create the CVS at each score, the incidence of failure increased as the score increased (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Using only three preoperative factors, the proposed scoring system provides an objective evaluation of the likelihood that CVS can be achieved in patients undergoing emergency LC for AC.",OPEN SURGERY; RISK-FACTORS; CONVERSION; METAANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery; Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Onoe S and Maeda A and Takayama Y and Fukami Y and Kaneoka Y,,,0,944
1115,A step towards stepped care: Delivery of CBT-I with reduced clinician time,"Editors present their views on delivery of (CBTI) cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia with reduced clinician time. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia has been established as an effective treatment for insomnia and is considered a first line standard treatment. However, a number of factors limit access to this effective treatment, including availability of qualified providers, geographic distance to providers, and personal limitations on travel and costs. Efforts to increase patient access to CBTI include training additional providers to competency and developing modes of delivery that increase access. These include interventions with no therapist involvement, such as books, booklets, videos, non-interactive websites; interventions that include low level of therapist involvement; and remote access to treatment to reach individuals who have limited access to in person treatment. The current issue of Sleep Medicine Reviews includes two meta analyses that summarize the extant literature on the efficacy of CBT-I when delivered in two formats designed to increase access to care: group (distributed therapist involvement) and self-help format, with no or low clinician involvement.

1116,Leaders or led? A qualitative analysis of how young people explore express and experiment via new media in an Irish higher education context,"This paper provides a systematic review of students' multimedia projects and reveals how a complex web of institutional, local, global and gender issues influence the process of digital media creation by young adults. The significance of this research for this Special Issue lies in the study's longitudinal nature, which examined students' final-year multimedia productions over a 12-year period (2003–2014) in a university setting. The analysis provides a unique insight into how sociocultural norms, access to technology and institutional forces such as the curriculum and lecturers' subject area of expertise, as well as politics and Ireland's economic recession, have influenced and shaped student voices. It also provides the opportunity to track how the student voice changed and adapted in response to events both inside and outside the university and to identify areas of silence and question what they might mean. The potential for student-produced multimedia to carry gendered qualities, especially regarding audience orientation and media type, is highlighted. Student-produced multimedia artefacts and accompanying written documentation are analysed in terms of genre, media type, audience and purpose, with gender providing a useful overarching framework to further refine the analysis.

1117,A systematic review on critical thinking in medical education,"Background: Critical thinking is the ability to raise discriminating questions in an attempt to search for better ideas, a deeper understanding and better solutions relating to a given issue. Objective: This systematic review provides a summary of efforts that have been made to enhance and assess critical thinking in medical education. Design: Nine databases [Ovid MEDLINE(R), AMED, Academic Search Premier, ERIC, CINAHL, Web of Science, JSTOR, SCOPUS and PsycINFO] were searched to identify journal articles published from the start of each database to October 2012. Results: A total of 41 articles published from 1981 to 2012 were categorised into two main themes: (i) evaluation of current education on critical thinking and (ii) development of new strategies about critical thinking. Under each theme, the teaching strategies, assessment tools, uses of multimedia and stakeholders were analysed. Discussion: While a majority of studies developed teaching strategies and multimedia tools, a further examination of their quality and variety could yield some insights. The articles on assessment placed a greater focus on learning outcomes than on learning processes. It is expected that more research will be conducted on teacher development and students’ voices.

1118,Can the Learning Curve of Laparoscopic Sacrocolpopexy Be Reduced by a Structured Training Program?,"Objective: The aim of this study was to establish whether the learning curve for laparoscopic sacral colpopexy (LSC) could be significantly reduced in a structured learning program. Methods: We conducted a prospective study aimed at mapping the learning curve of LSC in the setting of a structured learning program for a urogynecology fellow at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital. The fellow was laparoscopic suturing and dissection naive at the commencement of her fellow position and was required to assist in 20 LSCs, video-edit 2 procedures, and undertake laparoscopic suturing and knot tying training on a laparoscopic trainer for 2 h/wk during the trial period. After the completion of this structured learning program, the fellow began performing LSC as the primary surgeon. Symptomatic assessment of pelvic organ prolapse and pelvic floor dysfunction was undertaken preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively using the Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire. Objective success at 12 months was defined as less than stage 2 prolapse in any compartment. Subjective success was defined as no prolapse on Q 28 to 31 on the Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire, and patient-determined success was defined as much or very much better on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement at 12 months. Results: Five consecutive LSC in 90 minutes or less without intraoperative or postoperative complications was achieved by case 18. Overall objective success at 12 months was 91%, and subjective and patient-determined success was 95%. Conclusion: Previous studies on LSC that report a similar learning curve have recorded much longer operating times. We believe that the shorter operating time, without compromise to outcomes and complication rates, is a result of the structured learning program.",laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy; learning curve; RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; ORGAN PROLAPSE; METAANALYSIS; SURGERY; ESTABLISHMENT; PERFORMANCE; OUTCOMES; VOLUME; SKILLS; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Video Meta Results Raw,Mowat A and Maher C and Pelecanos A,,,0,948
1119,The Empirical Analysis of Non-problematic Video Gaming and Cognitive Skills: A Systematic Review,"Videogames have become one of the most popular leisure activities worldwide, including multiple game genres with different characteristics and levels of involvement required. Although a small minority of excessive players suffer detrimental consequences including impairment of several cognitive skills (e.g., inhibition, decision-making), it has also been demonstrated that playing videogames can improve different cognitive skills. Therefore, the current paper systematically reviewed the empirical studies experimentally investigating the positive impact of videogames on cognitive skills. Following a number of inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 32 papers were identified as empirically investigating three specific skills: taskswitching (eight studies), attentional control (22 studies), and sub-second time perception (two studies). Results demonstrated that compared to control groups, non-problematic use of videogames can lead to improved task-switching, more effective top-down attentional control and processing speed and increased sub-second time perception. Two studies highlighted the impact of gaming on cognitive skills differs depends upon game genre. The studies reviewed suggest that videogame play can have a positive impact on cognitive processes for players. © 2018, The Author(s).","Video games; Cognitive skills; Attention; Time perception; Task-switching; GAME PLAYERS SHOW; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; VISUAL-ATTENTION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; WORKING-MEMORY; EXPERIENCE; TASK; INTERNET; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; Psychology, Clinical; Substance Abuse; Psychiatry; Psychology; Substance Abuse; Psychiatry; controlled study; empiricism; human; human experiment; processing speed; review; skill; systematic review; video game; Video Meta Results Raw",Nuyens FM and Kuss DJ and Lopez-Fernandez O and Griffiths,,,0,949

1122,What are the critical elements of sideline screening that can be used to establish the diagnosis of concussion? A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Sideline detection is the first and most significant step in recognising a potential concussion and removing an athlete from harm. This systematic review aims to evaluate the critical elements aiding sideline recognition of potential concussions including screening tools, technologies and integrated assessment protocols. DATA SOURCES: Bibliographic databases, grey literature repositories and relevant websites were searched from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2016. A total of 3562 articles were identified. STUDY SELECTION: Original research studies evaluating a sideline tool, technology or protocol for sports-related concussion were eligible, of which 27 studies were included. DATA EXTRACTION: A standardised form was used to record information. The QUADAS-2 and Newcastle-Ottawa tools were used to rate risk of bias. Strength of evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group system. DATA SYNTHESIS: Studies assessing symptoms, the King-Devick test and multimodal assessments reported high sensitivity and specificity. Evaluations of balance and cognitive tests described lower sensitivity but higher specificity. However, these studies were at high risk of bias and the overall strength of evidence examining sideline screening tools was very low. A strong body of evidence demonstrated that head impact sensors did not provide useful sideline concussion information. Low-strength evidence suggested a multimodal, multitime-based concussion evaluation process incorporating video review was important in the recognition of significant head impact events and delayed onset concussion. CONCLUSION: In the absence of definitive evidence confirming the diagnostic accuracy of sideline screening tests, consensus-derived multimodal assessment tools, such as the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool, are recommended. Sideline video review may improve recognition and removal from play of athletes who have sustained significant head impact events. Current evidence does not support the use of impact sensor systems for real-time concussion identification.",KING-DEVICK TEST; COLLEGIATE FOOTBALL PLAYERS; SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; RECURRENT CONCUSSION; HEAD IMPACTS; TOOL; TESTS; SPECIFICITY; SENSITIVITY; MANAGEMENT; Sport Sciences; Sport Sciences; diagnostic accuracy; screening; sideline; sports related concussion; Video Meta Results Raw,Patricios J and Fuller GW and Ellenbogen R and Herring S and Kutcher JS and Loosemore M and Makdissi M and McCrea M and Putukian M and Schneider KJ,,,0,951
1124,Methodological and reporting errors in meta-analytic reviews make other meta-analysts angry: A commentary on Ferguson (2015),"Although Ferguson’s (2015, this issue) meta-analysis addresses an important topic, we have serious concerns about how it was conducted. Because there was only one coder, we have no confidence in the reliability or validity of the coded variables. Two independent raters should have coded the studies. Ferguson synthesized partial correlations as if they were zero-order correlations, which can increase or decrease (sometimes substantially) the variance of the partial correlation. Moreover, he partialled different numbers of variables from different effects, partialled different variables from different studies, and did not report what was partialled from each study. Ferguson used an idiosyncratic 'tandem procedure' for detecting publication bias. He also 'corrected' his results for publication bias, even though there is no such thing as a 'correction' for publication bias. Thus, we believe that Ferguson’s meta-analysis is fatally flawed and should not have been accepted for publication in Perspective on Psychological Science (or any other journal).

1125,Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery node dissection for lung cancer treatment,"PURPOSE: Mediastinal node dissection (MND) is an integral component of the surgical treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been used increasingly for lung cancer treatment, the accuracy of by VATS MND still remains controversial. We reviewed the surgical results of VATS MND for NSCLC. METHODS: A systematic review of literature was performed, and articles that fully described the surgical procedure, devices, and results of VATS MND were selected to compare the efficacy of MND by VATS and thoracotomy. RESULTS: Various techniques and equipments have been shown to perform adequate MND, but there is an argument as to the method of estimation of the accuracy of MND. Most of the recent studies showed that the nodal upstaging and number of dissected nodes are significantly lower by VATS than after thoracotomy. Oppositely, some studies showed VATS noninferiority in these issues. Complications such as chylothorax, pleural effusion, bleeding, and nerve damage were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although ND by VATS remains controversial, VATS MND is becoming easier and more feasible owing to the development of more advanced endoscopic cameras and equipments. We should learn further to become more adept at performing adequate ND by VATS.",Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Lung cancer; Node dissection; THORACIC-SURGERY; STAGE-I; MEDIASTINAL LYMPHADENECTOMY; SEMIPRONE POSITION; ESTS GUIDELINES; CLINICAL N0; LOBECTOMY; THORACOTOMY; EXPERIENCE; RESECTION; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Watanabe A and Miyajima M and Mishina T and Tsuruta K and Takahashi Y and Maki R and Tada M,,,0,953
1126,The Neural Correlates of Memory for a Life-Threatening Event: An fMRI Study of Passengers From Flight AT236,"We investigated the neural correlates of remote traumatic reexperiencing in survivors of a life-threatening incident: the near crash of Air Transat (AT) Flight 236. Survivors' brain activity was monitored during video-cued recollection of the AT disaster, September 11, 2001 (9/11), and a comparatively nonemotional (neutral) event. Passengers showed a robust memory enhancement effect for the AT incident relative to the 9/11 and neutral events. This traumatic memory enhancement was associated with activation in the amygdala, medial temporal lobe, anterior and posterior midline, and visual cortex in passengers. This brain-behavior relationship also held in relation to 9/11, which had elevated significance for passengers given its temporal proximity to the AT disaster. This pattern was not observed in a comparison group of nontraumatized individuals who were also scanned. These findings suggest that remote traumatic memory is mediated by amygdalar activity, which likely enhances vividness via influences on hippocampal and ventral visual systems.",Video Meta Results Raw,Palombo DJ and McKinnon MC and McIntosh AR and Anderson AK and Todd RM and Levine B,,,0,954
1127,A systematic review of the literature on parenting of young children with visual impairments and the adaptions for Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting (VIPP),"Secure parent-child attachment may help children to overcome the challenges of growing up with a visual or visual-and-intellectual impairment. A large literature exists that provides a blueprint for interventions that promote parental sensitivity and secure attachment. The Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting (VIPP) is based on that blueprint. While it has been adapted to several specific at risk populations, children with visual impairment may require additional adjustments. This study aimed to identify the themes that should be addressed in adapting VIPP and similar interventions. A Delphi-consultation was conducted with 13 professionals in the field of visual impairment to select the themes for relationship-focused intervention. These themes informed a systematic literature search. Interaction, intersubjectivity, joint attention, exploration, play and specific behavior were the themes mentioned in the Delphi-group. Paired with visual impairment or vision disorders, infants or young children (and their parents) the search yielded 74 articles, making the six themes for intervention adaptation more specific and concrete. The rich literature on six visual impairment specific themes was dominated by the themes interaction, intersubjectivity, and joint attention. These themes need to be addressed in adapting intervention programs developed for other populations, such as VIPP which currently focuses on higher order constructs of sensitivity and attachment.

1128,Generational changes and their impact in the classroom: Teaching Generation Me,"Context: Many faculty members believe that students today differ from those in the past. This paper reviews the empirical evidence for generational changes among students and makes recommendations for classroom teaching based on these changes. Generational changes are rooted in shifts in culture and should be viewed as reflections of changes in society. Methods: This paper reviews findings from a number of studies, most of which rely on overtime meta-analyses of students’ (primarily undergraduates’) responses to psychological questionnaires measuring IQ, personality traits, attitudes, reading preferences and expectations. Others are time-lag studies of nationally representative samples of high school students. Results: Today’s students (Generation Me) score higher on assertiveness, self-liking, narcissistic traits, high expectations, and some measures of stress, anxiety and poor mental health, and lower on self-reliance. Most of these changes are linear; thus the year in which someone was born is more relevant than a broad generational label. Moreover, these findings represent average changes and exceptions certainly occur. Discussion: These characteristics suggest that Generation Me would benefit from a more structured but also more interactive learning experience, and that the overconfidence of this group may need to be tempered. Faculty and staff should give very specific instructions and frequent feedback, and should explain the relevance of the material. Rules should be strictly followed to prevent entitled students from unfairly working the system. Generation Me students have high IQs, but little desire to read long texts. Instruction may need to be delivered in shorter segments and perhaps incorporate more material delivered in media such as videos and an interactive format. Given their heightened desire for leisure, today’s students may grow into professionals who demand lighter work schedules, thereby creating conflict within the profession.

1129,Geriatric Telepsychiatry: Systematic Review and Policy Considerations,"Telemental health (TMH) for older patients has the potential to increase access to geriatric specialists, reduce travel times for patients and providers, and reduce ever growing healthcare costs. This systematic review article examines the literature regarding psychiatric assessment and treatment via telemedicine for geriatric patients. English language literature was searched using Ovid Medline, PubMed, and PsycINFO with search terms including telemedicine, telemental health, aging, and dementia. Abstracts were reviewed for relevance based on inclusion criteria. Multiple study types were reviewed, including open label, qualitative and randomized controlled trial study designs. Data was compiled regarding participants, study intervention, and outcomes. 76 articles were included. TMH was shown to be feasible and well accepted in the areas of inpatient and nursing home consultation, cognitive testing, dementia diagnosis and treatment, depression in integrated and collaborative care models, and psychotherapy. There is limited data on cost-effectiveness of TMH in the elderly. This article will discuss the current barriers to broader implementation of telemedicine for geriatric patients including reimbursement from the Medicare program. Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine is limited to rural areas, which does not allow for the widespread development of telemedicine programs. All Medicare beneficiaries would benefit from increased access to telemedicine services, not only those living in rural areas. As many elderly and disabled individuals have mobility problems, home-based telemedicine services should also be made available. There are efforts in Congress to expand the coverage of these services under Medicare, but strong advocacy will be needed to ensure these efforts are successful.",Telemedicine; mental health; geriatrics; Medicare; reimbursement; PROBLEM-SOLVING THERAPY; MENTAL-STATE-EXAMINATION; FACE-TO-FACE; MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; ASSESSMENT SCALE RUDAS; OLDER-ADULTS; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; IN-PERSON; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; VIDEO-TELEMEDICINE; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Gerontology; Psychiatry; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Gentry MT and Lapid MI and Rummans TA,,,0,957
1130,Préconisations pour la prise en charge de la dépression dans le cadre des soins primaires : analyse systématique de la littérature,"Currently, depression is a real public health problem associated with very high healthcare costs and a significant impact on the patient's daily life and their entourage. One of the challenges is to identify psychological support devices according to the stage of the disorder and to also specify the role of different actors. This systematic literature review aims to establish an overview of the effective methods of intervention in primary care in cases of depressive symptoms (subsyndromal and syndromal depression). PubMed, Cochrane, PsycINFO/PsycARTICLES and Cairn were searched for articles published between 2006 and 2016 containing the following words in the title according to the algorithm: [Health promotion (title)] OR [prevention (title)] OR [primary care (title)] AND [depression (title)]. Based on 591 items matching the search algorithm, 27 items including 23 clinical trials and 4 literature reviews were included in this analysis. The results suggest that there are three types of effective prevention devices: guided therapies, self-help therapies, and monitoring by telephone interview. The majority of them are based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. Guided therapies take place in direct interaction with a therapist who is physically present by videoconference or phone. Effective guided therapies are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), problem-solving therapy (PST), and psychoeducation. Self-help therapies are standardized psychological interventions based on the total or partial autonomy of the patient. These mechanisms include: (1) bibliotherapy (book or manual); (2) DVDs or audio CDs; (3) websites; (4) computer software (CD-ROM). In addition, a follow-up by phone can be recommended. During structured and regular (monthly) telephone calls, a professional monitors the development of symptoms and supports adherence to treatment, as necessary. Four literature reviews were also considered (Bortolotti et al., 2008; Cape et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2009; McNaughton, 2009). The results of the analysis corroborate the elements presented above. Indeed, bibliotherapy, websites and computer programs are included in the effective unguided therapies. Software is the most recommended media for people with marked symptoms requiring longer-term care. Intensive guided therapies, lasting a maximum of 3 months, provide the best level of support for patients, with greater effectiveness for CBT and PST approaches. Among all the devices, it seems that the 'Website' has the most relevant efficiency – acceptability – cost ratio in the context of the prevention of depression in the general population. It constitutes an interactive and multimodal format combining different media, from video to quizzes via discussion forums. Compared to other devices, it improves accessibility to information with regular updates. The diversification of connected devices (Smartphone, Tablet, Smart Watch) leads to the development of applications. This 'online' format seems well accepted by users although it is preferable to associate this type of therapy with follow-up by a professional. This type of device has different aims: self-observation and assessment of symptoms: what are they? What is their frequency, intensity?; knowledge of strategies to deal with stress in different contexts: work, social relationships, couple relationships, etc.; identification of resource professionals and different kinds of possible support; break down of isolation through a virtual community. Given the clinical and economic issues of depression, this article provides recommendations for the treatment of adult depression in primary care.

1131,Optimizing educational video through comparative trials in clinical environments,"Although video is increasingly used in public health education, studies generally do not implement randomized trials of multiple video segments in clinical environments. Therefore, the specific configurations of educational videos that will have the greatest impact on outcome measures ranging from increased knowledge of important public health issues, to acceptance of a voluntary HIV test, remain largely unknown. Interventions can be developed to run on affordable handheld computers, including inexpensive tablets or netbooks that each patient can use individually, and to integrate video delivery with automated data collection. These video interventions can then be used not only to educate patients who otherwise might not be reached, but to examine how content can be optimized for greater effectiveness as measured by cognitive and behavioral outcomes. This approach may prove especially valuable in high volume urban facilities, such as hospital emergency departments, that provide points of contact for lower income, lower literacy, and high-risk populations who may not otherwise interact with healthcare providers or researchers. This article describes the development and evaluation of an intervention that educates emergency department patients about HIV prevention and testing while comparatively examining a set of videos, each based upon competing educational theories. The computer-based video intervention and methodology are both highly replicable and can be applied to subject areas and settings far beyond HIV or the emergency department.",Video Meta Results Raw,Aronson ID and Plass JL and Bania TC,,,0,959
1132,Attention bias modification via single-session dot-probe training: Failures to replicate,"Background and objectives: Across three experiments we investigated transfer effects of single-session attention bias modification via dot-probe training. Methods: In experiment 1, participants received training either toward or away from negative images or no-training, and transfer to an affective task-switching task was examined. In two other experiments, participants were trained to orient attention toward either positive or negative words (experiment 2a) or facial expressions (experiment 2b), and transfer to an interpretation bias task was examined. Results: In all experiments, the dot-probe training procedure did not effectively modify biases in attention allocation at the training condition level, but produced a large variability in individual attention bias acquisition within and across conditions. Individual differences in pre-training attention bias and attention bias acquisition were not related to performance on the affective task-switching task or the interpretation tasks. Limitations: The present investigations are limited by the lack of effectiveness of ABM at the condition level, the order in which transfer tasks were administered, and the restricted range of affective symptoms that could moderate training and transfer effects. Conclusions: The findings from three experiments provided no evidence for single-session dot-probe ABM procedures to effectively manipulate attention bias toward negative, away from negative, or toward positive stimuli at a training condition level. At the individual differences level of analysis, again no evidence was found for transfer of attention training. The observations invite further empirical scrutiny into factors that moderate attentional plasticity in response to dot-probe ABM procedures to optimize the conditions for effective implementation and transfer of training.

1133,Theory of Mind and Executive Functions are Dissociated in Multiple Sclerosis,"Objectives: To investigate the relationship of executive functions (EF) and theory of mind (ToM) in multiple sclerosis (MS), clarifing whether ToM impairment in MS is related to EF dysfunction or whether they represent dissociable processes which can be independently impaired in MS. Methods: We enrolled 60 consecutive MS patients and 60 healthy controls (HC) matched on age, gender, and education level. All participants underwent ToM testing using the Eyes Test and the Videos Test and neuropsychological testing tapping different EF subdomains. A correlation analysis and a hierarchical cluster analysis were used to determine the similarity between explained variance between EF measures and ToM tests. Results: MS patients had lower scores on both tasks of ToM compared to HC, i.e., Eyes Test (21.1 +/- 5.0 vs. 29.5 +/- 3.8, p < .001; Cohen's d: 1.9) and Videos Test (19.6 +/- 2.4 vs. 22.9 +/- 1.8, p < .001; Cohen's d: 1.6). They also performed significantly worse on different measures of EF. ToM performance was not significantly correlated with EF tests. The hierarchical cluster analysis showed that ToM measures in MS were clustered separately from the EF measures, revealing three executive clusters (Attention/working memory cluster; Inhibitory control/shifting ability cluster; Verbal Initiative/Abstract reasoning cluster) and one ToM cluster. Conclusion: This study suggests a dissociation of EF and ToM in MS, meaning that the MS-related neurobehavioral symptoms may be associated with a significant impairment in ToM independent of the level of EF performance. Ultimately, this discrimination of ToM deficits in MS may help to identify the appropriate cognitive and behavioral interventions.","Multiple sclerosis; Social cognition; Theory of mind; Executive functions; Cognitive impairment; Neurobehavioral symptoms; VARIANT FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; SOCIAL COGNITION; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEFICITS; AUTISM; METAANALYSIS; IMPAIRMENT; DISABILITY; DISORDERS; Psychology, Clinical; Psychology; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Batista S and Freitas S and Afonso A and Macario C and Sousa L and Cunha L and Santana I,,,0,961
1134,Connecting problem-solving and knowledge-construction processes in a visualization-based learning environment,"Learning through problem solving has been widely adopted as an effective learning paradigm in challenging domains such as medical education. For effective learning through practical experience, problem solving and knowledge construction should be highly integrated and reciprocally reinforcing. However, both knowledge construction and problem solving are complex cognitive processes, which cannot be easily captured and mastered. Temporal problem-soltfing experience can be forgotten, and knowledge embedded in problem-solving experience may not be transferable to new problems. This study aimed to address the challenge via proposing a computer-based learning environment, where a visualization-based cognitive tool was designed to make thinking and learning in a problem context visible and to connect problem-solving and knowledge-construction activities throughout the learning process. An online learning program using the proposed learning environment was delivered to thirty-five students from two medical schools. The design of the proposed learning environment and its effects on problem-based learning are examined with implications for further studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

1135,Is a Video-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia as Efficacious as a Professionally Administered Treatment in Breast Cancer? Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Study Objective: To assess the short-term efficacy of a video-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as compared to a professionally administered CBT-I and to a no-treatment group. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Radio-oncology department of a public hospital affiliated with Universite Laval (CHU de Quebec). Participants: Two hundred forty-two women with breast cancer who had received radiation therapy in the past 18 mo and who had insomnia symptoms or were using hypnotic medications were randomized to: (1) professionally administered CBT-I (PCBT-I; n = 81); (2) video-based CBT-I (VCBT-I; n = 80); and (3) no treatment (CTL; n = 81). Interventions: PCBT-I composed of six weekly, individual sessions of approximately 50 min; VCBT-I composed of a 60-min animated video + six booklets. Measurement and Results: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) total score and sleep parameters derived from a daily sleep diary and actigraphy, collected at pretreatment and posttreatment. PCBT-I and VCBT-I were associated with significantly greater sleep improvements, assessed subjectively, as compared to CTL. However, relative to VCBT-I, PCBT-I was associated with significantly greater improvements of insomnia severity, early morning awakenings, depression, fatigue, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep. The remission rates of insomnia (ISI < 8) were significantly greater in PCBT-I as compared to VCBT-I (71.3% versus 44.3%, P < 0.005). Conclusions: A self-administered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) using a video format appears to be a valuable treatment option, but face-to-face sessions remain the optimal format for administering CBT-I efficaciously in patients with breast cancer. Self-help interventions for insomnia may constitute an appropriate entry level as part of a stepped care model.",Video Meta Results Raw,Savard J and Ivers H and Savard MH and Morin CM,,,0,963

1139,A Meta-analysis on Students' Social Collaborative Knowledge Construction using Flipped Classroom Model,"The purpose of this paper is to identify the major ICT skills and learning strategies involved Social Collaborative Knowledge Construction using Flipped Classroom Model. The approach adopted in this article is a Meta-analysis on Students' Social Collaborative Knowledge Construction using Flipped Classroom Model. Social Collaborative Knowledge Construction (SCKC) process involves peer to peer communication which help students to understand, investigate, and determine how the implicit cultural assumptions, frames of references, perspectives, and biases within a discipline influence the ways in which knowledge is constructed within it. Flipped Classroom Model (FCM) turns learning by replacing traditional classroom lectures with video tutorials that students need to watch before lesson time. Students do their homework or assignments with the help of instructor during class time. FCM can be a solution to contribute to the SCKC process. The paper presents the major ICT skills (creativity skill, problem solving skill and critical thinking skill) and explores the trend of learning strategies used in FCM that could be used for future research.

1141,"Asynchronous Web-Based Learning, a Practical Method to Enhance Teaching in Emergency Medicine","Objective: To compare medical knowledge acquisition among emergency medicine (EM) residents who attend weekly core content lectures with those absent but asynchronously viewing the same lectures in a Web-based electronic platform. Subjects and Methods: During the study period all EM residents attending or absent from weekly educational conferences were given a quiz on the covered material. During Phase 1, absentees were not given supplemental educational content for missed lectures. During Phase 2, absentees were sent a link to an online multimedia module containing an audiovisual recording of the actual missed lecture with presentation slides. Scores between attendees and absentees during both phases were compared using a repeated-measures analysis to evaluate the effect of the supplemental online module on knowledge acquisition. Results: Thirty-nine EM residents (equally distributed in postgraduate years 1-4) were studied during a 15-week period. Overall and after adjusting for sex and postgraduate year level, both lecture attendance (b = 27; 95% confidence interval, 22-32; p < 0.0001) and Web-based learning (b = 32; 95% confidence interval, 26-37; p < 0.0001) were associated with significant increases in test scores compared with residents who were absent and not receiving supplemental Web-based learning. Neither the self-perceived level of mastery with the lecture topic nor the amount of reported reading was found to be a predictor of test scores. Conclusions: In an EM residency program, asynchronous Web-based learning may result in medical knowledge acquisition similar to or better than attending traditional core content lectures. The percentage of curriculum delivery by asynchronous learning that may be used to achieve overall terminal learning objectives in medical knowledge acquisition requires further study.",Video Meta Results Raw,Pourmand A and Lucas R and Nouraie M,,,0,969

Design/methodology/approach The course is designed on the basis of the experiential learning model. It is intended that the students reflect and conceptualize their own learning experience and prior knowledge by combining them with SRL theory. The course design exploits TV documentaries describing junior high school students struggling to achieve good results, as well as online essay submissions with which university students are expected to interpret the documentaries from the viewpoint of SRL theory. All the submitted essays are distributed to students to give them a chance to compare their own ideas with those in the essays written by other students to deepen their thoughts. Findings The course was taken by first-year university students. The results of a questionnaire administered to 112 students indicate that the students could associate their own experience with SRL theory and deepen their understanding on SRL. Originality/value Compared with previous intervention procedures, the course design activating student's own leaning experience through TV documentary viewing and essay submission would be an effective, efficient and practical way especially for university and adult students to make them aware of and able to use SRL theory.",Experiential learning; Prior knowledge; Instructional design; Self-regulated learning; Learn how to learn; TV documentary; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; STRATEGIES; INTERVENTION; METAANALYSIS; INSTRUCTION; ACHIEVEMENT; MOTIVATION; COMPONENTS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Nakabayashi K,,,0,970
1143,Deep learning for pixel-level image fusion: Recent advances and future prospects,"By integrating the information contained in multiple images of the same scene into one composite image, pixel-level image fusion is recognized as having high significance in a variety of fields including medical imaging, digital photography, remote sensing, video surveillance, etc. In recent years, deep learning (DL) has achieved great success in a number of computer vision and image processing problems. The application of DL techniques in the field of pixel-level image fusion has also emerged as an active topic in the last three years. This survey paper presents a systematic review of the DL-based pixel-level image fusion literature. Specifically, we first summarize the main difficulties that exist in conventional image fusion research and discuss the advantages that DL can offer to address each of these problems. Then, the recent achievements in DL-based image fusion are reviewed in detail. More than a dozen recently proposed image fusion methods based on DL techniques including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), convolutional sparse representation (CSR) and stacked autoencoders (SAEs) are introduced. At last, by summarizing the existing DL-based image fusion methods into several generic frameworks and presenting a potential DL-based framework for developing objective evaluation metrics, we put forward some prospects for the future study on this topic. The key issues and challenges that exist in each framework are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Image fusion; Deep learning; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional sparse representation; Stacked autoencoder; PAN-SHARPENING METHOD; MULTI-FOCUS IMAGES; SPARSE REPRESENTATION; INFORMATION MEASURE; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; SUPERRESOLUTION; DECOMPOSITION; SEGMENTATION; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Computer Science; Convolution; Image processing; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Medical problems; Neural networks; Pixels; Remote sensing; Security systems; Auto encoders; Digital photography; Image fusion methods; Image processing problems; Objective evaluation; Pixel-level image fusion; Video Meta Results Raw",Liu Y and Chen X and Wang Z and Wang ZJ and Ward RK and Wang X,,,0,971
1144,Behavioral Training as New Treatment for Adult Amblyopia: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review,"PURPOSE: New behavioral treatment methods, including dichoptic training, perceptual learning, and video gaming, have been proposed to improve visual function in adult amblyopia. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these methods to investigate the factors involved in amblyopia recovery and their clinical significance. METHODS: Mean and individual participant data meta-analyses were performed on 24 studies using the new behavioral methods in adults. Studies were identified using PubMed, Google Scholar, and published reviews. RESULTS: The new methods yielded a mean improvement in visual acuity of 0.17 logMAR with 32% participants achieving gains ≥ 0.2 logMAR, and a mean improvement in stereo sensitivity of 0.01 arcsec-1 with 42% of participants improving ≥2 octaves. The most significant predictor of treatment outcome was visual acuity at the onset of treatment. Participants with more severe amblyopia improved more on visual acuity and less on stereo sensitivity than those with milder amblyopia. Better initial stereo sensitivity was a predictor of greater gains in stereo sensitivity following treatment. Treatment type, amblyopia type, age, and training duration did not have any significant influence on visual and stereo acuity outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses showed that some participants may benefit from the new treatments; however, clinical trials are required to confirm these findings. Despite the diverse nature of the new behavioral methods, the lack of significant differences in visual and stereo sensitivity outcomes among them suggests that visual attention-a common element among the varied treatment methods-may play an important role in amblyopia recovery.",Video Meta Results Raw,Tsirlin I and Colpa L and Goltz HC and Wong AM,,,0,972
1145,Simple Interactions: Piloting a Strengths-Based and Interaction-Based Professional Development Intervention for Out-of-School Time Programs,"Adult-child relational interactions constitute an essential component of out-of-school-time programs, and training staff to effectively interact with children is key to improving program quality. Efficient staff training, that meets the limited time availability of out-of-school time staff, is particularly needed. This pilot study introduces Simple Interactions (SI), an innovative, strengths-based, and interaction-based professional development approach. Rather than attempting to teach generic competencies or targeting weakness areas for improvement, SI is designed to help program staff build from their strengths. In two cohorts over the course of 10 months, ten afterschool programs (N = 70 staff) participated in a pilot of SI. Program staff watched short video clips of themselves working with children and used the intuitive, 1-page SI Tool to guide discussion of adult-child interactions; specifically, connection (affective intune-ness), reciprocity (balanced roles of engagement), participation (involving all children), and progression (incremental challenge). Results suggest that participants valued the professional development process, the strengths-based approach, and the use of self-video despite initial apprehension, and reported perceived improvements in their professional learning communities. Pre-post videos of Cohort 2 staff (n = 20), coded blind to time point (pre or post), indicate significant and substantive improvements in staff-child connection, reciprocity, and participation. These results support the use of this simple, practical, and potentially effective model of supporting quality improvement for and by local staff.","Out-of-school time programs; Afterschool; Professional development; Intervention; Mixed-methods; METAANALYSIS; AGREEMENT; QUALITY; Psychology, Developmental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Akiva T and Li J and Martin KM and Horner CG and McNamara AR,,,0,973
1146,"A meta-analysis with examination of moderators of student cognition, affect, and learning outcomes while using serious educational games, serious games, and simulations","Educational games and simulations provide teachers with powerful tools for teaching students in the sciences. Within the broad category of educational gaming, there are several types of games to include Serious Educational Games (SEG), Educational Simulations (ES), and Serious Games (SG). The purpose of this meta-analysis is to characterize and compare outcomes related to serious educational games, serious games, and educational simulations as they are presented in the educational literature. Specifically the authors intend to fill gaps left by previous studies, include major finding, and assess the current state of the field related to the use of these innovative technologies. The results of this study are in line with previous studies suggesting higher cognitive gains and increases in positive affective toward learning from subjects using SEGs, SGs, and ES. Effects were calculated from 46 empirical experimental studies. The examined studies suggest that ES, SGs, and SEGs do not differ in a statistically significant way when compared to traditional instruction but do differ from each other. More to this point, effect size outcomes are suggestive of a cumulative medium effect for cognition (d = .67) and affect (d = .51) with a small effect for behavior (d = .04).

The present study capitalizes on the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method of meta‐analysis to identify: (a) the shared neural activations among spatial functions to reveal the 'core' network of spatial processing; (b) the specific neural activations associated with each of these functions. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 133 fMRI and PET studies were included in the meta‐analysis. The overall analysis showed that the core network of spatial processing comprises regions that are symmetrically distributed on both hemispheres and that include dorsal frontoparietal regions, presupplementary motor area, anterior insula, and frontal operculum. The specific analyses revealed the brain regions that are selectively recruited for each spatial function, such as the right temporoparietal junction for shift of spatial attention, the right parahippocampal gyrus, and the retrosplenial cortex for navigation and spatial long‐term memory. The findings are integrated within a systematic review of the neuroimaging literature and a new neurocognitive model of spatial cognition is proposed.

There has been growing interest in studying electronic gaming with the aim of trying to work out how learning principles that are evident in games can be harnessed to make everyday academic learning more engaging and productive. Many studies of students' learning while gaming have yielded recommendations for teaching and learning in regular classrooms. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus: The intent of this work is to describe various ways in which students' ready engagement in, and quick learning when playing, electronic games have been assumed to provide useful guidance to educators. This goal is pursued by means of analysis of the relevant research and the prescriptions for classroom teaching and learning that have emerged it.

For decades, experts have commented on the power of media. Media depictions can lead to negative attitudes and behavior in some young viewers. This article discusses whether prosocial, tolerant, and cooperative attitudes and behavior can be learned and imitated by children and adolescents and whether media can nurture or stimulate creativity or actively promote health and well-being in young consumers.",Video Meta Results Raw,Hogan MJ,,,0,979

1155,Systematic review of lessons learned from delivering tele-therapy to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder,"Introduction Despite increases in the number of ex-service personnel seeking treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there remain a number of barriers to help-seeking which prevents many veterans from accessing psychological therapies. Tele-therapy provides one potential method of increasing the number of veterans accessing support. This review aimed to systematically review the literature in order to summarise what lessons have been learned so far from providing trauma-focused tele-therapies to veterans with PTSD. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted from which 41 papers were reviewed. Studies were included if they involved the use of trauma-focused therapies carried out using tele-therapy technologies. Only studies using tele-therapy interventions via video or telephone with populations of ex-military personnel with PTSD were included. Results In the majority of cases tele-therapy was found to be as effective in reducing PTSD symptoms as in-person interventions. Similarly, there were few differences in most process outcomes such as dropout rates, with tele-therapy helping to increase uptake in some cases. Veterans using tele-therapy reported high levels of acceptability and satisfaction. Some challenges were reported in terms of therapeutic alliance, with some studies suggesting that veterans felt less comfortable in using tele-therapy. Several studies suggested it was harder for clinicians to read non-verbal communication in tele-therapy, but this did not affect their ability to build rapport. Technological issues were encountered, but these were not found to impede therapy processes or outcomes. Discussion Tele-therapy provides a viable alternative to in-person therapies and has the potential to increase access to therapy for veterans. Tele-therapy should continue to be evaluated and scrutinised in order to establish the most effective methods of delivery.",Tele-therapy; telemedicine; veterans; PTSD; COGNITIVE PROCESSING THERAPY; HOME-BASED TELEHEALTH; EVIDENCE-BASED PSYCHOTHERAPY; RANDOMIZED NONINFERIORITY TRIAL; PROLONGED EXPOSURE THERAPY; AMERICAN-INDIAN VETERANS; MENTAL-HEALTH; COLLABORATIVE CARE; PERSON DELIVERY; COMBAT VETERANS; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Turgoose D and Ashwick R and Murphy D,,,0,981
1157,Is working memory training effective? A meta-analytic review,"It has been suggested that working memory training programs are effective both as treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other cognitive disorders in children and as a tool to improve cognitive ability and scholastic attainment in typically developing children and adults. However, effects across studies appear to be variable, and a systematic meta-analytic review was undertaken. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomized controlled trials or quasi-experiments without randomization, have a treatment, and have either a treated group or an untreated control group. Twenty-three studies with 30 group comparisons met the criteria for inclusion. The studies included involved clinical samples and samples of typically developing children and adults. Meta-analyses indicated that the programs produced reliable short-term improvements in working memory skills. For verbal working memory, these near-transfer effects were not sustained at follow-up, whereas for visuospatial working memory, limited evidence suggested that such effects might be maintained. More importantly, there was no convincing evidence of the generalization of working memory training to other skills (nonverbal and verbal ability, inhibitory processes in attention, word decoding, and arithmetic). The authors conclude that memory training programs appear to produce short-term, specific training effects that do not generalize. Possible limitations of the review (including age differences in the samples and the variety of different clinical conditions included) are noted. However, current findings cast doubt on both the clinical relevance of working memory training programs and their utility as methods of enhancing cognitive functioning in typically developing children and healthy adults.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Age Differences; Verbal Ability; Control Groups; Generalization; Short Term Memory; Transfer of Training; Spatial Ability; Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; Cognitive Ability; Visual Perception; Adults; Meta Analysis; Children; Program Effectiveness; Arithmetic; Video Meta Results Raw",Melby-Lervåg M and Hulme C,,,0,982
1158,Game-Based Digital Interventions for Depression Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The aim of this study was to review the existing literature on game-based digital interventions for depression systematically and examine their effectiveness through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Database searching was conducted using specific search terms and inclusion criteria. A standard meta-analysis was also conducted of available RCT studies with a random effects model. The standard mean difference (Cohen's d) was used to calculate the effect size of each study. Nineteen studies were included in the review, and 10 RCTs (eight studies) were included in the meta-analysis. Four types of game interventions-psycho-education and training, virtual reality exposure therapy, exercising, and entertainment-were identified, with various types of support delivered and populations targeted. The meta-analysis revealed a moderate effect size of the game interventions for depression therapy at posttreatment (d = -0.47 [95% CI -0.69 to -0.24]). A subgroup analysis showed that interventions based on psycho-education and training had a smaller effect than those based on the other forms, and that self-help interventions yielded better outcomes than supported interventions. A higher effect was achieved when a waiting list was used as the control. The review and meta-analysis support the effectiveness of game-based digital interventions for depression. More large-scale, high-quality RCT studies with sufficient long-term data for treatment evaluation are needed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Li J and Theng YL and Foo S,,,0,983
1159,Functional and Structural Brain Plasticity Enhanced by Motor and Cognitive Rehabilitation in Multiple Sclerosis,"Rehabilitation is recognized to be important in ameliorating motor and cognitive functions, reducing disease burden, and improving quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In this systematic review, we summarize the existing evidences that motor and cognitive rehabilitation may enhance functional and structural brain plasticity in patients with MS, as assessed by means of the most advanced neuroimaging techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging and task-related and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In most cases, the rehabilitation program was based on computer-assisted/video game exercises performed in either an outpatient or home setting. Despite their heterogeneity, all the included studies describe changes in white matter microarchitecture, in task-related activation, and/or in functional connectivity following both task-oriented and selective training. When explored, relevant correlation between improved function and MRI-detected brain changes was often found, supporting the hypothesis that training-induced brain plasticity is specifically linked to the trained domain. Small sample sizes, lack of randomization and/or an active control group, as well as missed relationship between MRI-detected changes and clinical performance, are the major drawbacks of the selected studies. Knowledge gaps in this field of research are also discussed to provide a framework for future investigations.",functional brain plasticity; structural brain plasticity; motor rehabilitation; cognitive rehabilitation; multiple sclerosis; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognition; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multiple Sclerosis; Neuronal Plasticity; Psychomotor Performance; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recovery of Function; Video Games; White Matter; Cognitive Rehabilitation; Multiple Sclerosis; Neural Plasticity; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw,Prosperini L and Piattella MC and Giannì C and Pantano P,,,0,984
1160,I See Your Effort: Force-Related BOLD Effects in an Extended Action Execution-Observation Network Involving the Cerebellum,"Action observation (AO) is crucial for motor planning, imitation learning, and social interaction, but it is not clear whether and how an action execution-observation network (AEON) processes the effort of others engaged in performing actions. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we used a squeeze ball task involving different grip forces to investigate whether AEON activation showed similar patterns when executing the task or observing others performing it. Both in action execution, AE (subjects performed the visuomotor task) and action observation, AO (subjects watched a video of the task being performed by someone else), the fMRI signal was detected in cerebral and cerebellar regions. These responses showed various relationships with force mapping onto specific areas of the sensorimotor and cognitive systems. Conjunction analysis of AE and AO was repeated for the 0th order and linear and nonlinear responses, and revealed multiple AEON nodes remapping the detection of actions, and also effort, of another person onto the observer's own cerebrocerebellar system. This result implies that the AEON exploits the cerebellum, which is known to process sensorimotor predictions and simulations, performing an internal assessment of forces and integrating information into high-level schemes, providing a crucial substrate for action imitation.",action execution; action observation; cerebellum; functional magnetic resonance imaging; grip force; SOCIAL COGNITION; MIRROR NEURONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; MOTOR CORTEX; GRIP FORCE; METAANALYTIC CONNECTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL-MOTION; Neurosciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw,Casiraghi L and Alahmadi AA and Monteverdi A and Palesi F and Castellazzi G and Savini G and Friston K and Wheeler-Kingshott CA and D'Angelo E,,,0,985

These effects were investigated from the results of previous studies. This study used meta-analysis, which is a study of some research results focusing on similar problems. The unit of analysis in this study was written documents about research on the use of videos in mathematics learning, such as journal articles and research reports. These scientific documents were selected purposively in agreement with research themes. Quantitative analysis of the data was used, with percentage and qualitative analysis for data as a result of narrative studies of the encountered research. The results showed that the use of videos as a learning media in mathematics plays a role in improving students' motivation in learning, enhancing students' knowledge and understanding of the lesson and improving the students' achievements.","affective; cognitive; teaching; video; Physics, Applied; Physics; Video Meta Results Raw",Lalian ON,,,1,986
1163,Coupled cognitive changes in adulthood: A meta-analysis,"With advancing age, healthy adults typically exhibit decreases in performance across many different cognitive abilities such as memory, processing speed, spatial ability, and abstract reasoning. However, there are marked individual differences in rates of cognitive decline, with some adults declining steeply and others maintaining high levels of functioning. To move toward a comprehensive understanding of cognitive aging, it is critical to know whether individual differences in longitudinal changes interrelate across different cognitive abilities. We identified 89 effect sizes representing shared variance in longitudinal cognitive change from 22 unique datasets composed of more than 30,000 unique individuals, which we meta-analyzed using a series of multilevel metaregression models. An average of 60% of the variation in cognitive changes was shared across cognitive abilities. Shared variation in changes increased with age, from approximately 45% at age 35 years to approximately 70% at age 85 years. There was a moderate-to-strong correspondence (r = .49, congruence coefficient = .98) between the extent to which a variable indicated general intelligence and the extent to which change in that variable indicated a general factor of aging-related change. Shared variation in changes did not differ substantially across cognitive ability domain classifications. In a sensitivity analysis based on studies that carefully controlled for dementia, shared variation in longitudinal cognitive changes remained at upward of 60%, and age-related increases in shared variation in cognitive changes continued to be evident. These results together provide strong evidence for a general factor of cognitive aging that strengthens with advancing adult age.

1165,Individual differences in young children's visual-spatial abilities,"An enduring challenge in visual-spatial research has been to identify the factors contributing to individual differences in ability. This research investigated the overall, verbal, and nonverbal visual-spatial ability of 61 (34 boys) three- to five-year-olds (M-age = 57.3 months; SD = 7.9) and the following factors known to be related to visual-spatial ability: grade, sex, socio-economic status, math and spatial activity engagement at home, parental mental rotation, quantitative reasoning, intelligence, and working memory. Results revealed quantitative reasoning and general intelligence were an important predictor of overall and nonverbal visual-spatial ability. Mathematics activities in the home predicted children's verbal visual-spatial ability but not after accounting for various cognitive factors. Given the highly malleable nature of visual-spatial ability, we anticipated a grade effect; however, this was not found. Older children did not outperform the younger children suggesting a possible 'kindergarten in-effect' whereby schooling did not result in visual-spatial learning over time.","Visual-spatial ability; kindergarten; IQ; quantitative reasoning; home experiences; SEX-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; KINDERGARTEN-CHILDREN; SCHOOL READINESS; MENTAL ROTATION; BUILDING-BLOCKS; SKILLS; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; METAANALYSIS; Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Developmental; Education & Educational Research; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Kotsopoulos D and Makosz S and Zambrzycka J and Dickson BA,,,0,989
1166,Boundary Conditions and Constraints of the Modality Effect,"The modality effect in multimedia learning suggests that pictures presented together with spoken text lead to better learning outcomes than pictures presented together with written text. Although the modality effect has been demonstrated in a number of empirical studies, there is an emerging body of evidence that speaks against its universal validity. Rather, it might occur only when specific boundary conditions are given. Therefore, the aim of the current special issue is to offer a platform to publish studies that contribute to identifying these possible boundary conditions. In the introduction to this special issue, firstly a context for the articles of the special issue is provided by describing in more detail the theoretical framework for the modality effect that can be used to derive different explanations for its occurrence. Secondly, because the studies reported in this special issue failed to observe the modality effect when according to the theoretical framework and the pre-existing empirical evidence a modality effect had to be expected, problems associated with interpreting null effects are discussed. Thirdly, the main findings of each of the contributing articles are discussed. Overall, the studies presented in this special issue indicate that the modality effect is not as ubiquitous as one might assume. Hence, the modality principle, that is the recommendation to use narrated rather than written multimedia presentations, should be considered with care.",Video Meta Results Raw,Schueler A and Scheiter K and Schmidt-Weigand F,,,0,990
1168,Expertise in Swiss Mathematics Instruction,"This chapter draws on data and findings from several video studies to describe the quality of mathematics teaching in Switzerland. The focus is on features of instructional practice and quality as core components of classroom behavior that reflect the teacher's expertise in creating optimal learning opportunities. The didactic triangle is used as the basis for describing the profile of expertise in Swiss mathematics instruction in terms of three interdependent dimensions of instructional quality. A core element of this profile can be identified in Swiss mathematics teachers' particular strengths in the culture of communication, support and relationships. Findings also paint a generally positive picture of the culture of teaching, learning and understanding (e.g., methods and choreography of teaching) in Swiss mathematics classrooms. However, the culture of objectives, materials and tasks proves to be rather average in international comparison in several respects (level of mathematical content, characteristics of the problems set and the way they are worked on in lessons). In particular, there seems to be room for improvement in the specific context of the didactics of mathematics (e.g., the level of cognitive and mathematical challenge).",Video Meta Results Raw,Pauli C and Reusser K,,,0,991
1169,"The Meta-Analysis of Neuro-Marketing Studies: Past, Present and Future","One of the new topics that has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years is neuro-marketing. The purpose of the present study is to achieve an insight into the progress of studies on neuro-marketing through review of scientific articles in this field with methodology text-mining. A total of 394 articles were selected between 2005 and 2017 using the search for 'neuro-marketing' in valid databases. By reviewing the title, abstract, and keywords at various stages of screening, the researchers selected 311 articles related to the neuro-marketing topic in order to carry out the text mining process. Then, pre-processing of data was performed and using cluster analysis, 6 optimal clusters were obtained according to Davis Bouldin index. Using the multi-attribute decision-making technique (SAW), the most important roots were ranked in each cluster. The results showed that interest in research on neuro-marketing has increased in recent years and clusters created around topics such as marketing strategies, advertising and video ads, ethical issues, advertising message components, neuroscience in marketing, economics and consumer behavior, and decision making and brand selection. The study shows that the researchers’ attention is moving from the concepts and principles of the use of neuroscience in marketing, economics and consumer behavior to design and develop marketing strategies using neuroscience.

1170,Impact of Game-Based Health Promotion Programs on Body Mass Index in Overweight/Obese Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Background: Sedentary lifestyle is growing among children and adolescents that may contribute to problems such as overweight and obesity. Consequently, interventions to improve weight loss in this population are necessary. The aim of this current review was to evaluate the effectiveness of game-based interventions to reduce body mass index (BMI) among children who were overweight or obese. Methods: All randomized controlled trials with a game-based approach for lowering weight in obese/overweight youths aged 5-18 years old were identified from January 2005 to June 2017 across PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Two independent reviewers completed data extraction sheets on information such as sample size, country of origin, age of participants, type of interventions, and BMI change from pre- to posttest. A consensus on collected data was obtained, and a final list of studies meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria was arrived at. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software, and effect size was measured by standardized mean difference (SMD) and Hedges' g measure. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also examined using I-2 index and funnel plot. Results: A total of 388 articles were identified from electronic and manuals' searches. After deletion of duplicated articles, 138 articles remained that were then screened in terms of relevance. Of those, 41 articles were examined to determine eligibility. Finally, 10 articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were entered into the quantitative meta-analysis. Results indicated a small but significant effect size in terms of BMI reduction [SMD, -0.234; standard error (SE), 0.069] among included studies. The average BMI z-score reduction was -0.181 (SE, 0.071). Trials which used other types of interventions along with active game-based approaches achieved greater effect sizes than single game-based interventions. There was a significant difference between studies based on their country of origin, BMI value, and intervention type. Those conducted in United States, those including participants with BMI >= 30, and studies with multicomponent intervention reported a higher reduction of BMI than others. However, no significant difference in BMI was found in terms of variables such as age, sample size, type of participant (overweight/obese), intervention duration, or participant gender. No publication bias was identified, and studies were homogenous (I-2=22.5%). Conclusions: Interventions that involve active gaming may produce small effects in terms of improving BMI among children who are overweight/obese. Therefore, we recommend that supplemental interventions be used to enhance the effectiveness of game-based interventions.",body mass index (BMI); game-based interventions; obesity; weight-loss management; ACTIVE VIDEO GAMES; WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR; CHILDHOOD OBESITY; PREVENT OBESITY; STATE; DIET; Pediatrics; Pediatrics; Video Meta Results Raw,Ameryoun A and Sanaeinasab H and Saffari M and Koenig HG,,,0,993
1171,Signaling text–picture relations in multimedia learning: The influence of prior knowledge,"Multimedia integration signals highlight correspondences between text and pictures with the aim of supporting learning from multimedia. A recent meta-analysis revealed that only learners with low domain-specific prior knowledge benefit from multimedia integration signals. To more thoroughly investigate the influence of prior knowledge on the multimedia signaling effect in a more ecologically valid context, we conducted a quasi-experimental field study with 8th graders. They learned with a digital multimedia textbook in 1 of the 2 versions: (a) a basic version with signals that supported only the selection and organization of information from either text or pictures or (b) an extended version with additional multimedia integration signals to support the integration of information from text and pictures (e.g., color coding, deictic references). Results of a contrast analysis revealed that low-prior-knowledge learners learned better with the extended version compared with the basic version, whereas adding multimedia integration signals was detrimental for learning outcomes of high-prior-knowledge learners. This expertise reversal effect could only partially be explained by cognitive load measures, in that high-prior-knowledge learners had higher extraneous cognitive load in the condition with multimedia integration signals. The results suggest a need for a more individualized multimedia design that considers students’ prior knowledge.

1172,The extent to which tobacco marketing and tobacco use in films contribute to children's use of tobacco: a meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effect of exposure on initiation of tobacco use among adolescents. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, PsychINFO, ABI/INFORM, and Business Source Premier through October/November 2005 was conducted. Unpublished studies were solicited from researchers. STUDY SELECTION: Of 401 citations initially identified, 51 (n = 141 949 participants) met the inclusion criteria: reporting on exposure and tobacco use outcomes and participants younger than 18 years. Included studies reported 146 effects; 89 were conceptually independent effects. Data were extracted independently by 3 of us using a standardized tool. Weighted averages were calculated using a linear mixed-effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. Main Exposures Exposures (tobacco advertising, promotions, and samples and pro-tobacco depictions in films, television, and videos) were categorized as low or high engagement based on the degree of psychological involvement required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were categorized as cognitive (attitudes or intentions) or behavioral (initiation, tobacco use status, or progression of use). RESULTS: Exposure to pro-tobacco marketing and media increases the odds of youth holding positive attitudes toward tobacco use (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.13) and more than doubles the odds of initiating tobacco use (odds ratio, 2.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.79-2.77). Highly engaging marketing and media are more effective at promoting use (odds ratio, 2.67; 95% confidence interval, 2.19-3.25). These effects are observed across time, in different countries, with different study designs and measures of exposure and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-tobacco marketing and media stimulate tobacco use among youth. A ban on all tobacco promotions is warranted to protect children.",Video Meta Results Raw,Wellman RJ and Sugarman DB and DiFranza JR and Winickoff JP,,,0,995
1173,Defining the learning curve of robotic thoracic surgery: what does it take?,"BACKGROUND: Controversy exists as to what constitutes a learning curve to achieve competency, and how the initial learning period of robotic thoracic surgery should be approached. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published prior to December 2018 using PubMed/MEDLINE for studies of surgeons adopting the robotic approach for anatomic lung resection or thymectomy. Changes in operating room time and outcomes based on number of cases performed, type of procedure, and existing proficiency with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) were examined. RESULTS: Twelve observational studies were analyzed, including nine studies on robotic lung resection and three studies on thymectomy. All studies showed a reduction in operative time with an increasing number of cases performed. A steep learning curve was described for thymectomy, with a decrease in operating room time in the first 15 cases and a plateau after 15-20 cases. For anatomic lung resection, the number of cases to achieve a plateau in operative time ranged between 15-20 cases and 40-60 cases. All but two studies had at least some VATS experience. Six studies reported on experience of over one hundred cases and showed continued gradual improvements in operating room time. CONCLUSION: The learning curve for robotic thoracic surgery appears to be rapid with most studies indicating the steepest improvement in operating time occurring in the initial 15-20 cases for thymectomy and 20-40 cases for anatomic lung resection. Existing data can guide a standardized robotic curriculum for rapid adaptation, and aid credentialing and quality monitoring for robotic thoracic surgery programs.",Robotic surgery; Learning curve; Lobectomy; Segmentectomy; Thymectomy; ASSISTED THORACOSCOPIC SURGERY; LUNG-CANCER; LOBECTOMY; EXPERIENCE; RESECTION; QUALITY; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Power AD and D'Souza DM and Moffatt-Bruce SD and Merritt RE and Kneuertz PJ,,,0,996

The literature on the use of written selection tests was reviewed and summarized for 13,418 individuals drawn from 101 samples conducted over the past 2 decades. Validity with respect to job performance and training performance was examined. For the prediction of job performance, cognitive tests showed substantial validity (.42), although mechanical comprehension tests showed even higher validity (.54). However, the best prediction was obtained by tests that were composites of cognitive and mechanical predictors (.56). Training criteria was best predicted by cognitive measures (.77), although mechanical comprehension predictors also showed substantial prediction value (.62). Tests that were composites of cognitive and mechanical measures showed validities equal to that of cognitive measures (.77).

Although several naturalistic studies have been conducted showing the usefulness of serious video games in the treatment of some abnormal behaviours, there is a lack of serious games specially designed for treating mental disorders. Aim: The purpose of our project was to develop and evaluate a serious video game designed to remedi-ate attitudinal, behavioural and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders. Method and results: The video game was created and developed within the European research project PlayMancer. It aims to prove potential capacity to change underlying attitudinal, behavioural and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders. New interaction modes were provided by newly developed components, such as emotion recognition from speech, face and physiological reactions, while specific impulsive reactions were elicited.

However, little is known about interventions to improve developmental outcomes in this population. This study systematically reviews the literature on interventions to improve development in children born to HIV-infected mothers. We systematically searched the following electronic bibliographic databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Studies were selected on the basis of defined inclusion criteria and excluded if antiretroviral medication was the only intervention. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Data were collected on characteristics of the study design, intervention, and developmental outcomes measured. Risk of bias and strength of evidence were assessed on all included articles. Our search resulted in 11,218 records. After our initial review, 43 records were appraised in their entirety and 9 studies met all inclusion criteria. Six were performed in sub-Saharan Africa, while the remaining 3 were performed in the United States. Eight were randomized-controlled trials and one was a retrospective chart review. Four studies focused on caregiver-training, 2 studied massage therapy, and the remaining studies focused on maternal vitamin supplementation, video-based cognitive therapy, or center-based interventions. Massage therapy had the most consistent improvements in the domains measured, while caregiver training and cognitive therapy interventions had limited benefits. The center-based intervention showed no benefit. Only 3 studies had a low risk of bias, and 4 studies had good strength of evidence. Most studies found some benefit. However, these findings are limited by the quality of the study designs, small sample size, and heterogeneity of the interventions and assessments used to measure outcomes. There is a critical need for the creation of evidence-based interventions to promote development in this vulnerable population.","HIV; pediatrics; intervention; child development; developmental delays; CAREGIVER TRAINING-PROGRAM; MASSAGE THERAPY IMPROVES; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; UGANDAN CHILDREN; OUTCOMES; STIMULATION; Health Policy & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Respiratory System; Social Sciences, Biomedical; Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Psychology; Respiratory System; Biomedical Social Sciences; Video Meta Results Raw",McHenry MS and McAteer CI and Oyungu E and Deathe AR and Vreeman RC,,,0,999
1177,Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus open thoracotomy for pulmonary metastasectomy: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary metastasectomy has become a popular procedure for patients with pulmonary metastases. It can be achieved via the traditional open thoracotomy or the more recently developed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). However, there has been much debate as to which approach is better in terms of detection of pulmonary metastases and, in turn, survival and recurrence outcomes. We aim to compare the two different approaches in terms of survival and recurrence outcomes. METHODS: Medline and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant publications dated prior to May 2013. The bibliographies of the included articles were examined for additional relevant articles that were not included in the search. All publications reporting on overall survival and recurrence-free survival were included. The articles were carefully examined and data were extracted. STATA 12L and RevMan5.2 software were used to combine the data using the random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 1960 studies were identified through the search. Thirty-two articles had extractable data regarding overall survival and recurrence-free survival. However, only eight articles were included in the end as the other 24 articles had incomplete data. From the included articles, we found that the VATS group had slightly higher odds of 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival with odds ratios of 1.53, 1.69 and 1.41, respectively, and also higher odds of 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival with odds ratios of 1.29, 1.54 and 1.54, respectively.

1178,Real-time strategy game training: emergence of a cognitive flexibility trait,"Training in action video games can increase the speed of perceptual processing. However, it is unknown whether video-game training can lead to broad-based changes in higher-level competencies such as cognitive flexibility, a core and neurally distributed component of cognition. To determine whether video gaming can enhance cognitive flexibility and, if so, why these changes occur, the current study compares two versions of a real-time strategy (RTS) game. Using a meta-analytic Bayes factor approach, we found that the gaming condition that emphasized maintenance and rapid switching between multiple information and action sources led to a large increase in cognitive flexibility as measured by a wide array of non-video gaming tasks. Theoretically, the results suggest that the distributed brain networks supporting cognitive flexibility can be tuned by engrossing video game experience that stresses maintenance and rapid manipulation of multiple information sources. Practically, these results suggest avenues for increasing cognitive function.",Video Meta Results Raw,Glass BD and Maddox WT and Love BC,,,0,1001
1179,The Great and the Green: Sustainable Development in Serious Games,"Sustainable development education remains a hugely relevant and urgent pursuit across all sectors of society. In 2002, the United Nations General Assembly declared 2005-2014 the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development. Within the European Union, there has been a focus on establishing regulations with regard to environmental awareness and prevention solutions in European countries over the past 30 years. The U. S. Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development (USPESD) was conceived in 2003 and is dedicated to education for sustainable development in the United States. This paper puts forth the case for the use of serious games to help support this noble cause through the use of games for conventional skills and knowledge development related to sustainable development, in addition to the use of games to help promote a shift in fundamental attitudinal dimensions by constituting a form of procedural rhetoric (Bogost, 2007) based around the learner experiences of rule-governed variables related to sustainability education. This paper offers a qualitative meta-analysis of the learning computer and video games have been shown to support and goes on to focus in on the specific area of games which are aimed at fostering knowledge and skills related to sustainable development, in addition to cultivating a range of important generic metacognitive and 21st century skills. The authors map a range of such skills and learning to a spectrum of existing commercial and serious video game titles, across a wide range of game genres, including strategy games, simulation games, action games, amongst others.",Video Meta Results Raw,Coakley D and Garvey R,,,0,1002
1180,Motivational interviewing education: Creation and assessment of a learning module implemented among advanced pharmacy practice students,"Background and purpose: The purpose of this prospective nonrandomized study (quasi-experimental), pre-/post-intervention design was to implement and assess a formal orientation training program for Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) students focusing on skills related to motivational interviewing (MI). Educational activity and setting: Students were assessed on their knowledge, perceived ability, and perceived need to incorporate MI in practice using a pre-/posttest. Ability was assessed via student-conducted patient interviews, and performance was compared to published standards. Satisfaction with the training program was reviewed using a Likert scale questionnaire. Fourteen APPE students from three colleges of pharmacy were enrolled based on pre-assigned community experience placement. Students participated in a didactic training phase consisting of on-line knowledge acquisition and assessments. A modeling phase was implemented with role-play experiences and simulated video assessments. A shadowing phase was incorporated consisting of students observing a preceptor prior to independently conducting patient interviews. Interactions were audio recorded and reviewed by a preceptor with verbal and written feedback provided twice monthly using a standardized rubric. Findings: Data revealed statistically significant improvements in all categories of the pre-/posttest. MI ability results showed statistically significant improvements as well. Performance scores were higher than goal values in video simulated assessments. Overall student satisfaction with the training program was 4.3 out of 5. Discussion and conclusions: Data suggests the training program increased students understanding and ability to perform MI in patient interviews. High quality of student performance is also suggested due to trained students' post scores being higher than goal values published by scoring manual.","Motivational interviewing; Motivational interviewing education; APPE training; METAANALYSIS; EFFICACY; SKILLS; CARE; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Bailey L and Curington R and Brown B and Hegener M and Espel M,,,0,1003
1181,Optimising treatment resources for OCD: a review of the evidence base for technology-enhanced delivery,"BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling mental health problem. Only a minority of people receive evidence-based psychological treatments, and this deficit has prompted an increasing focus on delivering cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in new and innovative ways. AIMS: To conduct a scoping review of the published evidence base for CBT-based interventions incorporating a health technology in the treatment of OCD. The questions posed by the review were (a) are technology-assisted treatments clinically effective, (b) are patient outcomes durable and (c) are more innovative services deemed acceptable by those individuals who engage in them? METHOD: Scoping review of published studies using any study design examining CBT interventions incorporating a health technology for OCD. Electronic databases searched included MEDLINE (1966-2010), PsycInfo (1967-2010), EMBASE (1980-2010) and CINAHL databases (1982-2010). RESULTS: Thirteen studies were identified, of these, five used bibliotherapy, five examined computerised CBT (cCBT), two investigated telephone delivered CBT and one evaluated video conferencing. Overall studies were small and methodologically flawed, which precludes definitive conclusions of clinical effectiveness, durability or stakeholder satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: To date the evidence base for technology-enhanced OCD treatments has undergone limited development. Future research should seek to overcome the methodological shortcomings of published work by conducting large-scale trials that incorporate clinical, cost and acceptability outcomes.",Video Meta Results Raw,Lovell K and Bee P,,,0,1004
1184,"A Multicenter, Rater-Blinded, Randomized Controlled Study of Auditory Processing-Focused Cognitive Remediation Combined With Open-Label Lurasidone in Patients With Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder","Objective: Small-scale studies of auditory processing cognitive remediation programs have demonstrated efficacy in schizophrenia. We describe a multicenter, rater-blinded, randomized, controlled study of auditory-focused cognitive remediation, conducted from June 24, 2010, to June 14, 2013, and approved by the local institutional review board at all sites. Method: Prior to randomization, participants with schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR) were stabilized on a standardized antipsychotic regimen (lurasidone [40-160 mg/d]), followed by randomization to adjunctive cognitive remediation: auditory focused (Brain Fitness) versus control (nonspecific video games), administered 1-2 times weekly for 30 sessions. Coprimary outcome measures included MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and the University of California, San Diego, Performance-Based Skills Assessment-Brief scale. Results: 120 participants were randomized and completed at least 1 auditory-focused cognitive remediation (n = 56) or video game control session (n = 64). 74 participants completed = 25 sessions and postrandomization assessments. At study completion, the change from prestabilization was statistically significant for MCCB composite score (d = 0.42, P < .0001) across groups. Participants randomized to auditory-focused cognitive remediation had a trend-level higher mean MCCB composite score compared to participants randomized to control cognitive remediation (P = .08). After controlling for scores at the time of randomization, there were no significant between-treatment group differences at study completion. Conclusions: Auditory processing cognitive remediation combined with lurasidone did not lead to differential improvement over nonspecific video games. Across-group improvement from prestabilization baseline to study completion was observed, but since all participants were receiving lurasidone open label, it is difficult to interpret the source of these effects. Future studies comparing both pharmacologic and behavioral cognitive enhancers should consider a 2 x 2 design, using a control for both the medication and the cognitive remediation.

1185,Cesarean Scar Ectopic Pregnancy: Laparoscopic Resection and Total Scar Dehiscence Repair,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To illustrate a laparoscopic technique for the resection of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy, associated with isthmocele repair. DESIGN: Case report (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING: A tertiary referral center in Strasbourg, France. BACKGROUND: Cesarean scar pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy. The major risk of this type of pregnancy is the early uterine rupture with massive, sometimes life-threatening, bleeding. Thus, active management of these pregnancies starting immediately after diagnosis is crucial. Therapeutic options can be medical, surgical, or a combination. Numerous case reports or case series can be found in the literature, but there are few clinical studies, which are difficult to conduct because of case rarity and inconclusiveness. A 2016 meta-analysis that included 194 articles published between 1978 and 2014 (126 case reports, 45 cases series, and 23 clinical studies) concluded that hysteroscopy or laparoscopic hysterotomy seems to be the best first-line approach to treating cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy, with uterine artery embolization reserved for significant bleeding and/or a high suspicion index for arteriovenous malformation [1]. There is no consensus on the treatment of reference, however. PATIENT: The case involves a 38-year-old primiparous women who underwent a cesarean section delivery in 2010 and who was diagnosed by ultrasound scan at 7 weeks gestation with cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy, which was confirmed by pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. The patient initially received medical treatment with 2 intramuscular injections of methotrexate and one local intragestational injection of KCl. Her initial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was 82 000 IU/L. Rigorous weekly biological and ultrasound monitoring revealed an involution of the ectopic pregnancy associated with decreasing hCG. No bleeding or infectious complications occurred during this period. After 10 weeks of monitoring, her hCG had stabilized at 300 IU/L, and a residual image persisted next to the cesarean scar, and thus surgical treatment was considered. INTERVENTION: This video illustrates the laparoscopic resection of a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy associated with isthmocele repair. The originality of this video lies in the fact that it is the first demonstration of the laparoscopic treatment of total caesarean scar dehiscence. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The total operative time was 180 minutes. First, hysteroscopic evaluation revealed the cesarean scar dehiscence and the posterior pole of the ectopic pregnancy. Then the diagnosis of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy was confirmed laparoscopically. The utero-ombilical truncs were clamped bilaterally. Complete enucleation of pregnancy was achieved after dissection of the vesicouterine peritoneum. Isthmocele repair was performed with closure in 2 planes. A blue dye test confirmed the tightness of the stitches. The utero-ombilical truncs were unclamped, and antiadhesion gel was applied to the new uterine scar [1]. The operation was performed successfully without complications. Intraoperative blood loss was <100 mL. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3. No immediate complications were noticed. At 1 month after the intervention, ultrasound was normal. CONCLUSION: Surgical management of caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy with total dehiscence of hysterotomy can be performed safely and efficiently under laparoscopy.",Cesarean scar; Dehiscence; Ectopic pregnancy; Isthmocele repair; Laparoscopy; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Video Meta Results Raw,Mahgoub S and Gabriele V and Faller E and Langer B and Wattiez A and Lecointre L and Akladios C,,,0,1006
1186,Retrieval From and Understanding of Large-Scale Multi-modal Medical Datasets: A Review,"Content-based multimedia retrieval (CBMR) has been an active research domain since the mid 1990s. In medicine visual retrieval started later and has mostly remained a research instrument and less a clinical tool. The limited size of data sets due to privacy constraints is often mentioned as reason for these limitations. Nevertheless, much work has been done in CBMR, including the availability of increasingly large data sets and scientific challenges. Annotated data sets and clinical data for images have now become available and can be combined for multimodal retrieval. Much has been learned on user behavior and application scenarios. This text is motivated by the advances in medical image analysis and the availability of public large data sets that often include clinical data. It is a systematic review of recent work (concentrating on the period 2011-2017) on multimodal CBMR and image understanding in the medical domain, where image understanding includes techniques such as detection, localization, and classification for leveraging visual content. With the objective of summarizing the current state of research for multimedia researchers outside the medical field, the text provides ways to get data sets and identifies current limitations and promising research directions. The text highlights advances in the past six years and a trend to use larger scale training data and deep learning approaches that can replace/complement handcrafted features. Using images alone will likely only work in limited domains but combining multiple sources of data for multi-modal retrieval has the biggest chances of success, particularly for clinical impact.","Big data; content-based image retrieval; deep learning; large scale datasets; medical images; multi-modality; COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS; HISTOPATHOLOGICAL IMAGE-ANALYSIS; SYSTEM; SEGMENTATION; FRAMEWORK; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Telecommunications; Computer Science; Telecommunications; Video Meta Results Raw",Muller H and Unay D,,,1,1007
1187,What do we mean by web-based learning? A systematic review of the variability of interventions,"OBJECTIVES Educators often speak of web-based learning (WBL) as a single entity or a cluster of similar activities with homogeneous effects. Yet a recent systematic review demonstrated large heterogeneity among results from individual studies. Our purpose is to describe the variation in configurations, instructional methods and presentation formats in WBL. METHODS We systematically searched MEDLINE, EM BASE, ERIC, CINAHL and other databases (last search November 2008) for studies comparing a WBL intervention with no intervention or another educational activity. From eligible studies we abstracted information on course participants, topic, configuration and instructional methods. We summarised this information and then purposively selected and described several WBL interventions that illustrate specific technologies and design features. RESULTS We identified 266 eligible studies. Nearly all courses (89%) used written text and most (55%) used multimedia. A total of 32% used online communication via e-mail, threaded discussion, chat or videoconferencing, and 9% implemented synchronous components. Overall, 24% blended web-based and non-computer-based instruction. Most web-based courses (77%) employed specific instructional methods, other than text alone, to enhance the learning process. The most common instructional methods (each used in nearly 50% of courses) were patient cases, self-assessment questions and feedback. We describe several studies to illustrate the range of instructional designs. CONCLUSIONS Educators and researchers cannot treat WBL as a single entity. Many different configurations and instructional methods are available for WBL instructors. Researchers should study when to use specific WBL designs and how to use them effectively.",Video Meta Results Raw,Cook DA and Garside S and Levinson AJ and Dupras DM and Montori VM,,,1,1008
1188,Diagnostic and therapeutic single-operator cholangiopancreatoscopy with SpyGlassDS (TM): results of a multicenter retrospective cohort study,"Background and aims The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness and diagnostic and therapeutic outcome of the single-operator cholangiopancreatoscopy (SOC) with SpyGlassDS (TM). Methods In a retrospective multicenter study between November 2015 and January 2017, SpyGlassDS (TM) procedures were analyzed in participating centers. Indications, accuracy of SOC-guided biopsies, management of large bile duct stones, and complications were analyzed. Follow-up was 4 months. Results Two hundred and six patients out of 250 examinations were evaluated. Indications were biliary stones (n = 132), bile duct stenosis (n = 93), stones and stenosis combined (n = 24), and bile duct leakage (n = 1). Of the 117 cases which were suspicious of malignancy, in 99 cases the lesion could be stratified into benign (n = 55) or malignant (n = 44) indicating a sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 94.5% for the indication tumor. SOC-guided biopsies revealed a sensitivity of 57.7% with a specificity of 100%. In 107 examinations, biliary stones were visualized and could be completely removed in 91.1% with a need of three procedures (range 1-6) to achieve final stone clearance. In 75 cases, lithotripsy was performed and was successful in 71 cases (95%). Four out of 45 patients (8.9%) underwent cholecystectomy with surgical bile duct revision as a final therapy. Adverse Event (AE) occurred in 33/250 patients (13.2%) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) occurred in 1/250 patients (0.4%). Cholangitis was 1% (n = 102) after peri-interventional administration of antibiotics and 12.8% (n = 148) without antibiotic prophylaxis (p < 0.001). Conclusions SOC with SpyGlassDS (TM) became a new standard for the diagnosis of indefinite biliary lesions and therapy of large bile duct stones. The diagnostic yield of SOC-guided biopsies facilitated a definite diagnosis in most cases and should be improved by standardized biopsy protocols. SOC-guided interventions allowed removal of large biliary stones by SOC-guided lithotripsy. The complication rate of 13.2% can be considerably reduced by use of a single-shot antibiotic treatment.",Single-operator cholangiopancreatoscopy; SpyGlassDS (TM); Cholangioscopy; INDETERMINATE BILIARY STRICTURES; BILE-DUCT STONES; PERORAL CHOLANGIOSCOPY; EFFICACY; LESIONS; VIDEO; METAANALYSIS; FEASIBILITY; DISORDERS; DISEASE; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Turowski F and Huegle U and Dormann A and Bechtler M and Jakobs R and Gottschalk U and Noetzel E and Hartmann D and Lorenz A and Kolligs F and Veltzke-Schlieker W and Adler A and Becker O and Wiedenmann B and Buergel N and Troeger H and Schumann M and Daum S and Siegmund B and Bojarski C,,,0,1009
1189,A Systematic Review on the Cognitive Benefits and Neurophysiological Correlates of Exergaming in Healthy Older Adults,"Human aging is associated with structural and functional brain deteriorations and a corresponding cognitive decline. Exergaming (i.e., physically active video-gaming) has been supposed to attenuate age-related brain deteriorations and may even improve cognitive functions in healthy older adults. Effects of exergaming, however, vary largely across studies. Moreover, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms by which exergaming may affect cognitive and brain function are still poorly understood. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the effects of exergame interventions on cognitive outcomes and neurophysiological correlates in healthy older adults (>60 years). After screening 2709 studies (Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Pubmed, Scopus), we found 15 eligible studies, four of which comprised neurophysiological measures. Most studies reported within group improvements in exergamers and favorable interaction effects compared to passive controls. Fewer studies found superior effects of exergaming over physically active control groups and, if so, solely for executive functions. Regarding individual cognitive domains, results showed no consistence. Positive effects on neurophysiological outcomes were present in all respective studies. In summary, exergaming seems to be equally or slightly more effective than other physical interventions on cognitive functions in healthy older adults. Tailored interventions using well-considered exergames and intervention designs, however, may result in more distinct effects on cognitive functions.","exergaming; exercise; aging; healthy older adults; cognitive functions; neurophysiological correlates; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY REDUCTION; ACTIVE VIDEO GAMES; PROCESSING-SPEED; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; PHYSICAL-EXERCISE; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN HEALTH; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Stojan R and Voelcker-Rehage C,,,0,1010
1191,Overcoming barriers to disseminating exposure therapies for anxiety disorders: A pilot randomized controlled trial of training methods,"The present study evaluated methods for training mental health providers (N = 46) in exposure therapies (ETs) for anxiety disorders. A pilot randomized controlled trial compared: (1) an interactive, multimedia online training (ET OLT), (2) the ET OLT plus a brief Motivational Interviewing-based intervention (ET OLT + MI), and (3) a placebo control OLT. Assessments were completed at baseline, post-training, and one-week following training. Both ET OLT and ET OLT + MI received high satisfaction ratings and were comparably effective at increasing knowledge of ETs as well as clinicians' overt efforts to learn and use the treatment. ET OLT + MI was the most effective method for improving clinicians' attitudes toward ETs. Results indicate that OLT is effective for disseminating knowledge about ETs to clinicians, and suggest that supplementing OLT with a brief MI-based intervention may be a promising direction to address potential attitudinal barriers to adopting these highly efficacious treatments.

This review was registered in the PROSPERO database (registration number: 139317). The QUADAS-2 tool was used to systematically evaluate the quality of the diagnostic tests used in the evaluated studies and to confirm whether the oculomotor alterations observed in the different groups of children with various learning disorders had a consistent diagnostic basis. Using this tool, the design of the articles was well elaborated, although concerns exist regarding the selection of patients and the diagnostic criteria for the binocular conditions. All the studies reviewed conclude that a pattern of oculomotor anomalies exist in the groups of children with these three types of learning disorders compared to healthy children. However, there is a concern regarding the diagnostic methodology, as no clear range of normality for the parameters used to characterise ocular motility was identified and no gold standard or reference test has been defined. In future studies, this range of normality must be developed for different oculomotor skills, and a reference test (possibly video-oculography) for the measurement of these skills must be established.",attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder; dyslexia; dyspraxia; eye-tracking; learning disorder; oculomotor anomalies; saccades; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EYE-MOVEMENTS; DYSLEXIC-CHILDREN; CONVERGENCE; SACCADES; FIXATION; DEFICIT; Ophthalmology; Ophthalmology; Video Meta Results Raw,Bilbao C and Piñero DP,,,0,1012

In response, this paper reviews an exhaustive body of research conducted since that time, involving 40 studies, published in peer-review journals with a lens of analysis of new findings and insights on transformative learning theory. The review finds less research less about identifying transformative experiences in different setting, and more about fostering transformative learning and the complex nature of critical reflection, relationships, the nature of a perspective transformation and the role of context. Furthermore, even though qualitative designs still dominate, they have become more sophisticated and creative, including longitudinal and mixed-method designs and the use of video and photography.","ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE); Doctoral Dissertations; Learning Theories; Bibliometrics; Data Interpretation; Literature Reviews; Meta Analysis; Inferences; Evaluation Research; Research Methodology; Transformative Learning; Video Meta Results Raw",Taylor EW,,,0,1013
1194,Training Models in Laparoscopy : a Systematic Review Comparing their Effectiveness in Learning Surgical Skills,"Background : Surgery has traditionally been learned on patients in the operating room, which is time-consuming, can have an impact on the patient outcomes, and is of variable effectiveness. As a result, surgical training models have been developed, which are compared in this systematic review. Methods : We searched Pubmed, CENTRAL, and Science Citation index expanded for randomised clinical trials and randomised cross-over studies comparing laparoscopic training models. Studies comparing one model with no training were also included. The reference list of identified trials was searched for further relevant studies. Results : Fifty-eight trials evaluating several training forms and involving 1591 participants were included (four studies with a low risk of bias). Training (virtual reality (VR) or video trainer (VT)) versus no training improves surgical skills in the majority of trials. Both VR and VT are as effective in most studies. VR training is superior to traditional laparoscopic training in the operating room. Outcome results for VR robotic simulations versus robot training show no clear difference in effectiveness for either model. Only one trial included human cadavers and observed better results versus VR for one out of four scores. Contrasting results are observed when robotic technology is compared with manual laparoscopy. Conclusion : VR training and VT training are valid teaching models. Practicing on these models similarly improves surgical skills. A combination of both methods is recommended in a surgical curriculum. VR training is superior to unstructured traditional training in the operating room. The reciprocal effectiveness of the other models to learn surgical skills has not yet been established.",Video Meta Results Raw,Willaert W and Van de Putte D and Van Renterghem K and Van Nieuwenhove Y and Ceelen W and Pattyn P,,,0,1014
1195,Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice in Medical Education - a Systematic Review,"Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice (RCDP) is a novel simulation-based education model that is currently attracting interest, implementation, exploration and research in medical education. In RCDP, learners rapidly cycle between deliberate practice and directed feedback within the simulation scenario until mastery is achieved. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the literature and summarize the existing knowledge on RCDP in simulation-based medical education. Fifteen resources met inclusion criteria; they were diverse and heterogeneous, such that we did not perform a quantitative synthesis or meta-analysis but rather a narrative review on RCDP. All resources described RCDP in a similar manner. Common RCDP implementation strategies included: splitting simulation cases into segments, micro debriefing in the form of 'pause, debrief, rewind and try again' and providing progressively more challenging scenarios. Variable outcome measures were used by the studies including qualitative assessments, scoring tools, procedural assessment using checklists or video review, time to active skills and clinical reports. Results were limited and inconsistent. There is an absence of data on retention after RCDP teaching, on RCDP, with learners from specialties other than pediatrics, on RCDP for adult resuscitation scenarios and if RCDP teaching translates into practice change in the clinical realm. We have identified important avenues for future research on RCDP.","rapid cycle deliberate; systematic review; simulation; medical education; TECHNOLOGY-ENHANCED SIMULATION; EXPERT PERFORMANCE; SKILLS; FEEDBACK; METAANALYSIS; ACQUISITION; CONCURRENT; IMPROVE; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Taras J and Everett T,,,0,1015

Methods: Design: Prospective study, single cohort design. Setting: Phase 1: inpatient rehabilitation hospital; phase 2: outpatient setting. Patients: Patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors. Twenty qualified participants enrolled, 16 participants (9 men, 7 women; mean age = 56.6 years) completed phase 1. One participant completed phase 2. Intervention: Individualized aerobic training on a recumbent cycle ergometer. Phase 1: 5 days per week; phase 2: 3 days per week. Training goal was 20 minutes of continuous cycling at moderate intensity for a duration of 6 weeks including phase 1 and phase 2. Measurements: Aerobic capacity (graded submaximal cycling test), Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Functional Independence Measure, lower-extremity composite strength, and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue; measures were assessed pretraining, at inpatient discharge, and posttraining. Feasibility determined by (1) adherence to training program, (2) training responsiveness, and (3) ability to achieve training goals. Results: Statistically significant changes in all outcome measures found during phase 1, with moderate gains in aerobic capacity and the 6MWT. All participants reached the training goal of 20 minutes of continuous cycling at moderate intensity and adherence to 5 training sessions per week in phase 1. No adverse events reported. Limitations: Lack of a control group and limited participation in phase 2; therefore, training responsiveness assessed only during inpatient phase.

1200,Sexual orientation and neurocognitive ability: A meta-analysis in men and women,"The cross-sex-shift hypothesis predicts that homosexual men and women will be similar in certain neurobehavioral traits to their opposite-sex counterparts. Accordingly, it predicts that homosexual men should perform in the direction of heterosexual women, and homosexual women in the direction of heterosexual men, on neurocognitive tests that show normative sex differences. We conducted a meta-analysis on the relationship between sexual orientation and cognitive performance, and tested the effects of potential moderating variables separately by sex. A total of 106 samples and 254,231 participants were included. The meta-analysis revealed that homosexual men performed like heterosexual women in both male-favouring (e.g., spatial cognition) and female-favouring (e.g., verbal fluency) cognitive tests, while homosexual women performed like heterosexual men only in male-favouring tests. The magnitude of the sexual orientation difference varied across cognitive domains (larger for spatial abilities). It was also larger in studies comparing exclusive heterosexuals with exclusive homosexuals compared to studies comparing exclusive heterosexuals with non-exclusive homosexuals for both sexes. The results may narrow down potential sites for sexual orientation-related neural differences.",Sexual orientation; Cognition; Meta-analysis; Sex differences; Gender homosexuality; Spatial; Verbal; Brain asymmetry; Prenatal androgens; CONGENITAL ADRENAL-HYPERPLASIA; DIGIT RATIO 2D-4D; HETEROSEXUAL MEN; HOMOSEXUAL-MEN; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SPATIAL ABILITY; PUTATIVE PHEROMONES; CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY; BRAIN RESPONSE; MOTOR-TASKS; Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw,Xu Y and Norton S and Rahman Q,,,0,1018

Visual dynamics are suspected to increase split attention affordances due to a higher salience and transience compared to static visuals. In two experiments students watched an instruction on the formation of lightning while their eye movements were recorded. Both experiments varied text presentation (spoken, written) and visualization format (dynamic, static) in a 2x2 design. Learning outcomes were measured with verbal retention, visual retention, and transfer tests. Experiment 1 (N = 50) revealed a modality effect (i.e. better performance in spoken text groups) for visual retention but not for verbal retention and transfer. Experiment 2 (N = 60) replicated Experiment 1 with a faster presentation pace, expecting faster presentation to enlarge modality effects. In contrast, Experiment 2 revealed no modality effects in learning outcomes. In both experiments participants spent less time viewing visualizations when text was written. Within written text conditions text was read first and gained more visual attention than visualizations. Viewing time did not significantly vary between dynamic and static visualizations. Thus, animation did neither affect viewing behavior nor learning outcome. Moreover, the lack of effects in a standard manipulation of text modality cast doubts on the reliability of modality effects and, hence, on the validity of a general modality principle.",Video Meta Results Raw,Schmidt-Weigand F,,,0,1019

Results indicate that gender differences in all of these abilities were small: For verbal ability, the median ω–2 was .01 and the median d was .24; for quantitative ability, the median values of ω–2 and d were .01 and .43; for visual–spatial ability, they were .043 and .45; and for field articulation, ω–2 was .025 and d was .51. Discussion focuses on the practical implications of the finding that these 'well-established' differences were in fact very small. Concerns about sampling are raised. The problem is also discussed in the context of a larger issue in psychological research: the limitations of the hypothesis-testing approach and the need to estimate the magnitude of effects.

1203,Computer-assisted second language vocabulary instruction: A meta-analysis,"There is growing attention to incorporating computer-mediated instruction for language learning and teaching. Specifically, vocabulary is arguably the foundation of mastering a language, as the mastery of vocabulary is the fundamental step of learning a language. Second language (L2) vocabulary is important in the development of cognitive systems of knowledge (Coady & Huckin, 1997). Previous studies on L2 vocabulary acquisition have focused on a wide range of methods to facilitate the acquisition of L2 vocabulary ranging from traditional instruction, such as dictionary use, to games and multimedia learning. Because it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from studies on different language skills, a systematic synthesis of research findings related to one particular language skill may provide more insight on the impacts of technology use (Felix, 2005). The study presented in this paper investigates the general effectiveness of L2 computer-assisted vocabulary instruction, with analysis of the features of treatment duration, educational level, the use of games and the role of teachers in the CALL studies.

1204,Design and construction of a long-term continuous video-EEG monitoring unit for simultaneous recording of multiple small animals,"In recent years several new rat models of human limbic/mesial temporal lobe epilepsy have been described [1,2,4-7,11,15-17]. Unlike earlier models such as kindling in which the seizures are induced by an exogenous stimulus, these new models are characterized by seizures that occur spontaneously at random intervals. Although the spontaneity of the seizures makes these models more like human epilepsy, documentation of these seizures by direct observation is highly inefficient, and sub-behavioral electrographic seizures could be missed. Continuous paper EEG and video recording have been used [5-7,15], but these techniques are resource intensive. The slow paper speed required by long-term paper recordings limits the ability to differentiate between true seizure activity and electrical artifact. Subtle behavioral seizures are likely to be missed during rapid review of video recordings alone [16]. Ambulatory cassette EEG recordings have been used [3], but the systems require expensive proprietary hardware, and the systems have limited channels for recording (8-16). To improve the utility of the models, we developed a long-term EEG/video monitoring system to detect the electrographic seizures and document their behavioral accompaniment. The system is based on commercially available components, including a computerized EEG seizure detection system that was initially developed for human seizure monitoring [8,9,13]. Seizures are reliably detected and the data are reduced so that 24 h of recording can be reviewed in 30-90 min. Although the computer program is accurate, special care must be taken in system design and construction to reduce sources of electrical artifact that can cause false detections when multiple animals are recorded simultaneously on a single EEG machine. During data review it is necessary to differentiate between electrical artifact induced by animal activity from true seizure activity by key EEG patterns. Certain seizure patterns (less than 3 hz. low amplitude) will not be detected by the seizure detection program, but the system is highly effective for typical limbic seizures and may be useful for the animal models of absence epilepsy [12,14]. It can also be used as a continuous or intermittent EEG/physiological recording device for experiments that examine animals' spontaneous behavior and the EEG correlate (e.g. sleep/wake cycles, learning and memory tasks).",Video Meta Results Raw,Bertram EH and Williamson JM and Cornett JF and Spradlin S and Chen ZF,,,0,1022
1206,Longitudinal Analysis of Associations between 3-D Mental Rotation and Mathematics Reasoning Skills during Middle School: Across and within Genders,"The development of math reasoning and 3-d mental rotation skills are intertwined. However, it is currently not understood how these cognitive processes develop and interact longitudinally at the within-person level - either within or across genders. In this study, 553 students (52% girls) were assessed from fifth to seventh grades on 3-d mental rotation spatial skills (assessed each fall) and numerical and algebraic math reasoning skills (assessed each spring). Boys outperformed girls on mental rotation tests across all three grades, and on fifth and seventh grade math reasoning tests. Consistent with the literature on between-person comparisons, there was a positive correlation between mental rotation and math reasoning skills in the full sample and for both genders. A random intercept cross-lagged panel model was used to control for these confounding group-level differences in order to isolate within-person associations between earlier and later performance. Initially in fifth grade, math reasoning predicted subsequent sixth grade mental rotation skills. By seventh grade, more advanced mental rotation skills were associated with subsequent math reasoning skills while math reasoning skills were no longer predictive of mental rotation skills. An examination of gender differences revealed that this pattern was driven by boys while girls experienced less within-person change. These findings suggest that boys may initially rely in part on their math reasoning skills to solve 3-d mental rotation tasks. However, as their 3-d mental rotation skills mature, they begin to primarily depend upon these developing spatial skills to solve math reasoning problems rather than the reverse.","ENTRANCE TEST-SCORES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; SPATIAL ABILITY; PERFORMANCE; COGNITION; METAANALYSIS; STRATEGIES; MEDIATORS; NUMBER; MEMORY; Psychology, Developmental; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Lombardi CM and Casey BM and Pezaris E and Shadmehr M and Jong M,,,0,1023
1207,Validation of a novel attentional bias modification task: The future may be in the cards,"Attentional bias modification (ABM) is a promising therapeutic tool aimed at changing patterns of attentional selectivity associated with heightened anxiety. A number of studies have successfully implemented ABM using the modified dot-probe task. However others have not achieved the attentional change required to achieve emotional benefits, highlighting the need for new ABM methods. The current study compared the effectiveness of a newly developed ABM task against the traditional dot-probe ABM task. The new person-identity-matching (PIM) task presented participants with virtual cards, each depicting a happy and angry person. The task encourages selective attention toward or away from threat by requiring participants to make matching judgements between two cards, based either on the identities of the happy faces, or of the angry faces. Change in attentional bias achieved by both ABM tasks was measured by a dot-probe assessment task. Their impact on emotional vulnerability was assessed by measuring negative emotional reactions to a video stressor. The PIM task succeeded in modifying attentional bias, and exerting an impact on emotional reactivity, whereas this was not the case for the dot-probe task. These results are considered in relation to the potential clinical utility of the current task in comparison to traditional ABM methodologies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study sought to conduct a systematic review of articles published in scientific journals between the years 2003 and 2008 on the neuropsychological consequences associated with alcoholism in adults, especially executive function, evaluated with Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The results suggest that alcoholics have lower performance compared to control subjects not dependents on cognitive functions like reasoning, visual perception ability, early learning, attention, concentration and memory. In addition, the WCST was sensitive, confirming the findings in neuroimaging studies, which detect changes in the frontal lobe of alcoholics. The importance of neuropsychological assessment of alcoholics, should be noted, since the various damage caused by alcohol use, especially in executive functions, which implies the ability to solve problems and make decisions.

All were carried out in nursing or care homes, and several different approaches were represented. The studies reported some immediate and longer-term psychosocial benefits to people with dementia of individual reminiscence work, where this involved a life review process or personalized, specific reminiscence work. These benefits included mood, well-being and aspects of cognitive function. There was no evidence that the use of general reminiscence materials was associated with psychosocial benefits. The use of life story books and multimedia alternatives, with or without an associated life review process, does appear to be worth pursuing from both clinical and research perspectives.

The particular aim of the review is to explore how cognitive processes in multimedia learning are studied with relevant variables through eye tracking technology. To this end, 52 articles, including 58 studies, were analyzed. Remarkable results are that (1) there is a burgeoning interest in the use of eye tracking technology in multimedia learning research; (2) studies were mostly conducted with college students, science materials, and the temporal and count scales of eye tracking measurements; (3) eye movement measurements provided inferences about the cognitive processes of selecting, organizing, and integrating; (4) multimedia learning principles, multimedia content, individual differences, metacognition, and emotions were the potential factors that can affect eye movement measurements; and (5) findings were available for supporting the association between cognitive processes inferred by eye tracking measurements and learning performance. Specific gaps in the literature and implications of existing findings on multimedia learning design were also determined to offer suggestions for future research and practices.

1212,Microaggressions in the learning environment: A systematic review,"Microaggressions entail everyday brief, low-intensity events that convey negative messages toward marginalized groups. A systematic review of the literature on microaggressions in the learning environment of higher education was performed from 1998 to 2018 using a modified PRISMA outline. Forty articles on racial microaggressions were categorized as microaggression experiences of all races/ethnicity (27.5%), microaggression experiences of minorities (22.5%), difficult racial dialogues (10%), coping strategies for microaggressions (17.5%), and system interventions strategies (22.5%). Microinsults were reported in 82.5%, microinvalidations in 4.5%, microassaults in 20%, and institutional microaggressions in 27.5%. Microaggressions were prevalent and 'invisible' in colleges with minority students seemingly worn down by ongoing strategies used to confront the inherent associated stresses. Difficult racial dialogues were characterized by intense emotions in both professors and students that interfered with successful learning experiences. Coping strategies that correlated positively with microaggression and psychological stress included disengagement, cultural mistrust, stigma for seeking psychological help, alcohol use, and intolerance of uncertainty. Factors tending to ameliorate microaggression and psychological stress included engagement, dispositional forgiveness, help-seeking attitudes, self-efficacy in coping with daily hassles, and social connectedness. Political activism was helpful in Latinx, but exacerbated microaggression related stress in African American students. Multicultural curricula were associated with increased racial awareness. Innovative intervention strategies included brief video interventions and utility of mobile apps. Microaggressions are associated with ongoing major negative impact on the learning environment. By ameliorative coping mechanisms and institution intervention strategies, the associated toll and stresses from microaggressions may be reduced.

1214,Audio-visual presentation of information for informed consent for participation in clinical trials,"Background Informed consent is a critical component of clinical research. Different methods of presenting information to potential participants of clinical trials may improve the informed consent process. Audio-visual interventions (presented, for example, on the Internet or on DVD) are one such method. We updated a 2008 review of the effects of these interventions for informed consent for trial participation. Objectives To assess the effects of audio-visual information interventions regarding informed consent compared with standard information or placebo audio-visual interventions regarding informed consent for potential clinical trial participants, in terms of their understanding, satisfaction, willingness to participate, and anxiety or other psychological distress. Search methods We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library, issue 6, 2012; MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 13 June 2012); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1947 to 12 June 2012); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to June week 1 2012); CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1981 to 27 June 2012); Current Contents (OvidSP) (1993 Week 27 to 2012 Week 26); and ERIC (Proquest) (searched 27 June 2012). We also searched reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles, and contacted study authors and experts. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing audio-visual information alone, or in conjunction with standard forms of information provision (such as written or verbal information), with standard forms of information provision or placebo audio-visual information, in the informed consent process for clinical trials. Trials involved individuals or their guardians asked to consider participating in a real or hypothetical clinical study. (In the earlier version of this review we only included studies evaluating informed consent interventions for real studies). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We synthesised the findings using meta-analysis, where possible, and narrative synthesis of results. We assessed the risk of bias of individual studies and considered the impact of the quality of the overall evidence on the strength of the results. Main results We included 16 studies involving data from 1884 participants. Nine studies included participants considering real clinical trials, and eight included participants considering hypothetical clinical trials, with one including both. All studies were conducted in high-income countries. There is still much uncertainty about the effect of audio-visual informed consent interventions on a range of patient outcomes. However, when considered across comparisons, we found low to very low quality evidence that such interventions may slightly improve knowledge or understanding of the parent trial, but may make little or no difference to rate of participation or willingness to participate. Audiovisual presentation of informed consent may improve participant satisfaction with the consent information provided. However its effect on satisfaction with other aspects of the process is not clear. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about anxiety arising from audio-visual informed consent. We found conflicting, very low quality evidence about whether audio-visual interventions took more or less time to administer. No study measured researcher satisfaction with the informed consent process, nor ease of use. The evidence from real clinical trials was rated as low quality for most outcomes, and for hypothetical studies, very low. We note, however, that this was in large part due to poor study reporting, the hypothetical nature of some studies and low participant numbers, rather than inconsistent results between studies or confirmed poor trial quality. We do not believe that any studies were funded by organisations with a vested interest in the results. Authors' conclusions The value of audio-visual interventions as a tool for helping to enhance the informed consent process for people considering participating in clinical trials remains largely unclear, although trends are emerging with regard to improvements in knowledge and satisfaction. Many relevant outcomes have not been evaluated in randomised trials. Triallists should continue to explore innovative methods of providing information to potential trial participants during the informed consent process, mindful of the range of outcomes that the intervention should be designed to achieve, and balancing the resource implications of intervention development and delivery against the purported benefits of any intervention. More trials, adhering to CONSORT standards, and conducted in settings and populations underserved in this review, i.e. low-and middle-income countries and people with low literacy, would strengthen the results of this review and broaden its applicability. Assessing process measures, such as time taken to administer the intervention and researcher satisfaction, would inform the implementation of audio-visual consent materials.",Video Meta Results Raw,Synnot A and Ryan R and Prictor M and Fetherstonhaugh D and Parker B,,,0,1030
1215,"Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in Eastern and Western countries: A meta-analytic review","Meta-analytic procedures were used to test the effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, empathy/desensitization, and prosocial behavior. Unique features of this meta-analytic review include (a) more restrictive methodological quality inclusion criteria than in past meta-analyses; (b) cross-cultural comparisons; (c) longitudinal studies for all outcomes except physiological arousal; (d) conservative statistical controls; (e) multiple moderator analyses; and (f) sensitivity analyses. Social–cognitive models and cultural differences between Japan and Western countries were used to generate theory-based predictions. Meta-analyses yielded significant effects for all 6 outcome variables. The pattern of results for different outcomes and research designs (experimental, cross-sectional, longitudinal) fit theoretical predictions well. The evidence strongly suggests that exposure to violent video games is a causal risk factor for increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect and for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. Moderator analyses revealed significant research design effects, weak evidence of cultural differences in susceptibility and type of measurement effects, and no evidence of sex differences in susceptibility. Results of various sensitivity analyses revealed these effects to be robust, with little evidence of selection (publication) bias.

1216,Effects of video-game play on information processing: a meta-analytic investigation,"Do video games enhance cognitive functioning? We conducted two meta-analyses based on different research designs to investigate how video games impact information-processing skills (auditory processing, executive functions, motor skills, spatial imagery, and visual processing). Quasi-experimental studies (72 studies, 318 comparisons) compare habitual gamers with controls; true experiments (46 studies, 251 comparisons) use commercial video games in training. Using random-effects models, video games led to improved information processing in both the quasi-experimental studies, d = 0.61, 95% CI [0.50, 0.73], and the true experiments, d = 0.48, 95% CI [0.35, 0.60]. Whereas the quasi-experimental studies yielded small to large effect sizes across domains, the true experiments yielded negligible effects for executive functions, which contrasted with the small to medium effect sizes in other domains. The quasi-experimental studies appeared more susceptible to bias than were the true experiments, with larger effects being reported in higher-tier than in lower-tier journals, and larger effects reported by the most active research groups in comparison with other labs. The results are further discussed with respect to other moderators and limitations in the extant literature.",video games; information processing; cognitive functioning; executive function; Auditory Perception; Cognition; Executive Function; Humans; Motor Skills; Space Perception; Video Games; Visual Perception; Cognitive Ability; Cognitive Processes; Computer Games; Executive Function; Video Meta Results Raw,Powers KL and Brooks PJ and Aldrich NJ and Palladino MA and Alfieri L,,,0,1032

We searched 40 databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of computer-based interventions, defining 'interactive' as programmes that require contributions from users to produce personally relevant material. We conducted searches and analysed data using Cochrane Collaboration methods. Results of RCTs were pooled using a random-effects model with standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for binary outcomes, with heterogeneity assessed using the I-2 statistic. We identified 15 RCTs of ICBIs (3917 participants). Comparing ICBIs to minimal interventions, there were significant effects on sexual health knowledge (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27-1.18); safer sex self-efficacy (SMD 0.17, 95% Cl 0.05-0.29); safer-sex intentions (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.02-0.30); and sexual behaviour (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.18-2.59). ICBIs had a greater impact on sexual health knowledge than face-to-face interventions did (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.58). ICBIs are effective tools for learning about sexual health, and show promising effects on self-efficacy, intention and sexual behaviour.

1218,Description and Demonstration of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Enhance Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence and Treat Depression in HIV-Infected Adults,"There are an estimated 1.1 million individuals living with HIV/AIDS in the United States. In addition to the various medical comorbidities of HIV infection, depression is one of the most frequently co-occurring psychiatric conditions among HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, depression has been found to be associated with nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), as well as HIV disease progression. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has repeatedly been found to effectively treat depression in adult populations, and CBT for adherence and depression (CBT-AD) is an effective treatment for improving depressive symptoms and medication adherence in the context of various chronic health conditions, including diabetes and HIV-infection. This paper provides a description of the CBT-AD approach to treat depression and ART adherence in HIV-infected adults, which we have developed and tested in our clinic, and for which detailed therapist and client guides exist. To augment the description of treatment, the present article provides video component demonstrations of several core modules that highlight important aspects of this treatment, including Life-Steps for medication adherence, orientation to CBT-AD and psychoeducation, and suggestions for adaptation of core CBT modules for HIV-infected adults. Discussion of video demonstrations highlights differences in patient presentations and course of treatment between HIV-infected adults receiving CBT-AD and HIV-uninfected adults receiving traditional CBT for depression. This description and the accompanying demonstrations are intended as a practical guide to assist therapists wishing to conduct such a treatment in the outpatient setting.",Video Meta Results Raw,Newcomb ME and Bedoya CA and Blashill AJ and Lerner JA and O'Cleirigh C and Pinkston MM and Safren SA,,,0,1034
1219,Consequences of play: A systematic review of the effects of online gaming,"Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) have received considerable attention in news headlines describing gamers who have died while engaging in excessive play. However, more common physical and psychosocial effects attributed to online video gaming are social isolation, increased aggression, and negative academic and occupational consequences. In consideration of the bias in reporting negative consequences of video gaming, a systematic review was conducted to evaluate the evidence of the effects of MMOGs on those who play them. In the sixteen studies that met the inclusion criteria, analysis revealed that only those players who were classified as 'addicted' or engaged in 'problematic game play' experienced significant negative consequences, with many gamers finding positive aspects to video gaming such as enjoyment, feelings of achievement, friendship, and a sense of community. However, significant limitations in the studies point to the need for further research so that appropriate treatments and interventions can be developed for problematic game play.

1220,To What Extent Can We Shorten HRV Analysis in Wearable Sensing? A Case Study on Mental Stress Detection,"Mental stress is one of the first causes of cognitive dysfunctions, cardiovascular disorders and depression. In addition, it reduces performances, on the work place and in daily life. The diffusion of wearablesensors (embedded in smart-watches, phones, etc.) has opened up the potential to assess mental stress detection through ultra-shortterm Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis (i.e., less than 5 min).Although informative analyses of features coming from short HRV (i.e., 5 min) have already been performed, the reliability of ultra-short HRVremains unclear. This study aims to tackle this gap by departing from a systematic review of the existing literature and investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short/ultra-short term HRV features in time, frequency, and non-linear domains. Building on these findings, three experiments were carried outto empirically assess the usefulness of HRV for mental stress detection using ultra-short term analysis and wearable devices. Experiment 1 detected mental stress in a real life situation by exploring to which extent HRV excerpts can be shortened without losing their ability to detect mental stress. This allowed us to advance a method to explore to what extentultra-short HRV features can be consideredas good surrogates of 5 min HRV features. Experiment 2 and 3 sought todevelop automatic classifiers to detect mental stress through 2 min HRV excerpts, by usinga Stroop Color Word Test(CWT) and a highly pacedvideo game, which are two common laboratory-based stressors.","Mental stress; HRV; real-life stressor; CWT; video game; Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering; Video Meta Results Raw",Castaldo R and Montesinos L and Melillo P and Massaro S and Pecchia L,,,0,1036
1221,Predictors for Improvement of Problem-Solving during Cognitive Remediation for Patients with Schizophrenia,"Cognitive remediation is a promising pathway for ameliorating cognitive impairment of patients with schizophrenia. Here, we investigate predictors of improvement in problem-solving ability for two different types of cognitive remediation - specific problem-solving training and training of basic cognition. For this purpose we conducted a re-analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing these two training approaches. The main outcome measure was improvement in problem-solving performance. Correlational analyses were used to assess the contribution of clinical, cognitive and training-related predictors. In the problem-solving training group, impaired pre-training planning ability was associated with stronger improvement. In contrast, in the basic cognition training group antipsychotic medication dose emerged as a negative predictor. These results demonstrate that predictors for successful cognitive remediation depend on the specific intervention. Furthermore, our results suggest that at least in the planning domain patients with impaired performance benefit particularly from a specific intervention.

To assess the moderating role of demographic and clinical variables on the efficacy of a video-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (VCBT-I) among breast cancer patients. Patients and methods. As part of a randomized controlled trial, 80 women received VCBT-I. Results. Patients with a more advanced breast cancer were less likely to show reductions on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and increased sleep efficiency at posttreatment. Patients using an antidepressant medication showed a larger reduction of ISI scores and a higher rate of insomnia remission. Remission of insomnia was also significantly more likely in individuals with a higher annual income. When using a multivariate binary classification tree analysis, the best and unique predictor of insomnia remission was having a less severe baseline ISI score. Conclusion.

1228,Video-Based Interventions for Cancer Control: A Systematic Review,"Background. The use of videos for patient and public health education has been widely adopted and well documented in the literature. Aims. To conduct a systematic review of empirical studies that used video-based interventions for cancer prevention and control to document study designs, settings, approaches, targeted cancer sites and behaviors, and outcomes and to identify gaps in research and practice. Method. PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in the 30-year period from 1984 to 2014. Of 1,521 articles identified, duplicates were removed, and titles and abstracts of 779 were examined for eligibility. In all, 315 articles met the inclusion criteria and were coded by three independent coders. Interrater reliability was assessed. Descriptive frequencies and proportions were calculated. Results. Studies evaluating video interventions for cancer prevention and control have increased over time. The majority used randomized controlled trial designs (54%), followed by single-group pre-posttest designs (18%). Most were delivered in health care settings (39%). Detection (30%) and treatment (16%) were the cancer control continuum stages most frequently addressed, with breast cancer (29%) being the most frequently targeted cancer site. The behavior most commonly targeted was screening/early detection (39%). Topics such as caregiving, coping, palliative care, and end of life were rarely addressed. The majority (69%) reported being successful at achieving their stated objectives, though outcomes varied across studies. Conclusions.

1229,Video-based testing in sporting officials: A systematic review,"Objectives: Decision-making is the most important skill for sporting officials, consequently, assessment of this skill is becoming increasingly popular in the literature. There is considerable interest in the use of video-based methods to assess decision-making of officials in controlled, off-field environments. Design: Systematic review of the literature examining video-based testing in sporting officials. Methods: Using the keywords 'umpire', 'referee', 'sport officials', 'decision making' and 'judgement', a comprehensive search was conducted in February 2018 on electronic databases (SPORTDiscus, Medline, PsycInfo, Google Scholar). Inclusion criteria included full text articles from January 2000 to January 2018 published in peer-reviewed journals. Only ‘central’ or ‘field’ officials were included in this review (i.e., assistant referees, touch judges were excluded). Results: The search yielded 27 studies. The majority of articles were specific to soccer officials. Overall, video-based testing appears to be a valid measure of decision-making differentiating between performance levels. This review highlighted a high degree of variability among the methods applied, with varied participation groups, clip type used, and influences on decision-making. The reporting of reliability and implementation of transfer tests was rarely incorporated in the research. Conclusions: Video-based testing appears to be a valid measure of decision-making of officials in an off-field, controlled environment. This research area would be advanced through further investigation into sports other than soccer, examination of transfer to match performance testing, reporting the reliability of the test, reporting decisional accuracy rather than solely number of decisions, and investigation of additional video modes.

1230,Simulated learning environment (SLE) in audiology education: A systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the relevant peer-review literature investigating the outcome of simulated learning environment (SLE) training in audiology education. DESIGN: A systematic review research design. STUDY SAMPLE: Fifteen databases were searched with four studies meeting the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Three of the four studies revealed positive findings for the use of an SLE (that is, the SLE group showed a higher post-training score compared to the traditional training group or a significantly higher post-training score than the non-training groups). One study revealed negative findings where the traditional training group showed a significantly higher post-training score than the SLE group. In addition, both the studies comparing post- and pre-training scores reported significantly higher post-training scores than the pre-training scores of the participants that underwent SLE training. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review supports the notions that SLE training is an effective learning tool and can be used for basic clinical training. This conclusion should be treated with caution, considering the limited numbers of studies published in this area and future research should be conducted to cope with the gaps highlighted in this review.","Simulated learning environment; simulator training; computer-based simulation; audiology simulator training; Audiology; Clinical Competence; Databases, Factual; Humans; Program Evaluation; Simulation Training; Audiology; Clinical Methods Training; Learning Environment; Medical Education; Simulation; Video Meta Results Raw",Dzulkarnain AA and Wan Mhd Pandi WM and Rahmat S and Zakaria Nazzah,,,0,1042

There are many games specifically designed as educational games, as well as a number of entertainment games that have been successfully used for educational purposes. The EduGameLab project aims to stimulate the use of games in the classroom. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of game-based learning and focuses specifically on empirical evidence on the effectiveness of using games in education in the last decade. Moreover, the study focuses on usage in formalized school contexts, i.e. pre-school, elementary school, secondary school, high school and higher education. As secondary aims we also assess whether there are any clear methodological trends and whether a link could be found between the outcome of empirical studies and the evaluator being a stakeholder in the game development.",Video Meta Results Raw,Backlund P and Hendrix M,,,0,1044
1233,"A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia Disorder Delivered via an Automated Media-Rich Web Application","Study Objectives: The internet provides a pervasive milieu for healthcare delivery. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) course delivered by an automated virtual therapist, when compared with a credible placebo; an approach required because web products may be intrinsically engaging, and vulnerable to placebo response. Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled trial comprising 3 arms: CBT, imagery relief therapy (IRT: placebo), treatment as usual (TAU). Setting: Online community of participants in the UK. Participants: One hundred sixty-four adults (120 F: [mean age 49y (18-78y)] meeting proposed DSM-5 criteria for Insomnia Disorder, randomly assigned to CBT (n = 55; 40 F), IRT placebo (n = 55; 42 F) or TAU (n = 54; 38 F). Interventions: CBT and IRT each comprised 6 online sessions delivered by an animated personal therapist, with automated web and email support. Participants also had access to a video library/back catalogue of session content and Wikipedia style articles. Online CBT users had access to a moderated social network/community of users. TAU comprised no restrictions on usual care and access to an online sleep diary. Measurements and Results: Major assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and at follow-up 8-weeks post-treatment; outcomes appraised by online sleep diaries and clinical status. On the primary endpoint of sleep efficiency (SE; total time asleep expressed as a percentage of the total time spent in bed), online CBT was associated with sustained improvement at post-treatment (+20%) relative to both TAU (+6%; d = 0.95) and IRT (+6%: d = 1.06), and at 8 weeks (+20%) relative to IRT (+7%: d = 1.00) and TAU (+9%: d = 0.69) These findings were mirrored across a range of sleep diary measures. Clinical benefits of CBT were evidenced by modest superiority over placebo on daytime outcomes (d = 0.23-0.37) and by substantial improved sleep-wake functioning on the Sleep Condition Indicator (range of d = 0.77-1.20). Three-quarters of CBT participants (76% [CBT] vs. 29% [IRT] and 18% [TAU]) completed treatment with SE > 80%, more than half (55% [CBT] vs. 17% [IRT] and 8% [TAU]) with SE > 85%, and over one-third (38% [CBT] vs. 6% [IRT] and 0% [TAU]) with SE > 90%; these improvements were largely maintained during follow-up. Conclusion: CBT delivered using a media-rich web application with automated support and a community forum is effective in improving the sleep and associated daytime functioning of adults with insomnia disorder.",Video Meta Results Raw,Espie CA and Kyle SD and Williams C and Ong JC and Douglas NJ and Hames P and Brown JS,,,0,1045
1234,The Application of Observational Practice and Educational Networking in Simulation-Based and Distributed Medical Education Contexts,"Introduction Research has revealed that individuals can improve technical skill performance by viewing demonstrations modeled by either expert or novice performers. These findings support the development of video-based observational practice communities that augment simulation-based skill education and connect geographically distributed learners. This study explores the experimental replicability of the observational learning effect when demonstrations are sampled from a community of distributed learners and serves as a context for understanding learner experiences within this type of training protocol. Methods Participants from 3 distributed medical campuses engaged in a simulation-based learning study of the elliptical excision in which they completed a video-recorded performance before being assigned to 1 of 3 groups for a 2-week observational practice intervention. One group observed expert demonstrations, another observed novice demonstrations, and the third observed a combination of both. Participants returned for posttesting immediately and 1 month after the intervention. Participants also engaged in interviews regarding their perceptions of the usability and relevance of video-based observational practice to clinical education. Results Checklist (P < 0.0001) and global rating (P < 0.0001) measures indicate that participants, regardless of group assignment, improved after the intervention and after a 1-month retention period. Analyses revealed no significant differences between groups. Qualitative analyses indicate that participants perceived the observational practice platform to be usable, relevant, and potentially improved with enhanced feedback delivery. Conclusions Video-based observational practice involving expert and/or novice demonstrations enhances simulation-based skill learning in a group of geographically distributed trainees. These findings support the use of Internet-mediated observational learning communities in distributed and simulation-based medical education contexts.",Observational practice; Technology-enhanced learning; Simulation-based learning; Distributed medical education; Skills; TECHNOLOGY-ENHANCED SIMULATION; HEALTH-PROFESSIONS EDUCATION; DELIBERATE PRACTICE; SKILLS; MOVEMENT; VIDEO; TASK; DEMONSTRATIONS; METAANALYSIS; ACQUISITION; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Care Sciences & Services; Video Meta Results Raw,Welsher A and Rojas D and Khan Z and VanderBeek L and Kapralos B and Grierson LE,,,0,1046
1236,Sutureless thyroidectomy,"Objective: The ultrasonic scalpel is a surgical shear that uses high-frequency mechanical energy to enable simultaneous vessel sealing and tissue coagulation at the same time. We conducted a prospective study to compare the outcome of total thyroidectomy using the ultrasonic scalpel versus the device Ligasure in terms of safety, operative time, overall drainage volume, complications, hospital stay. Methods: Between January 2008 and December 2013,400 patients (260 women, 140 men; mean age 46 years) undergoing thyroidectomy were randomized into two groups: group A, where Ultracision were used, and group B, where the Ligasure device was used. Results: There was no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, gender, indication for thyroidectomy, thyroid gland weight and diameter, histopathologic diagnosis, preoperative and postoperative serum calcium levels, postoperative complications and reoperative thyroid surgery, time of operation and amount of drainage. Conclusions: The ultrasonic scalpel and the Ligasure ares safe, effective, useful, and time-saving alternative to the traditional suture ligation technique for thyroid surgery. They simplified total thyroidectomy, eliminating the need for clamp-and-tie maneuvers while achieving efficient hemostasis.

1237,Enhancing Cognitive Functioning in Healthly Older Adults: a Systematic Review of the Clinical Significance of Commercially Available Computerized Cognitive Training in Preventing Cognitive Decline,"Successfully assisting older adults to maintain or improve cognitive function, particularlywhen they are dealing with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains a major challenge. Cognitive training may stimulate neuroplasticity thereby increasing cognitive and brain reserve. Commercial brain training programs are computerized, readily-available, easy-to-administer and adaptive but often lack supportive data and their clinical validation literature has not been previously reviewed. Therefore, in this review, we report the characteristics of commercially available brain training programs, critically assess the number and quality of studies evaluating the empirical evidence of these programs for promoting brain health in healthy older adults, and discuss underlying causal mechanisms. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and each program's website for relevant studies reporting the effects of computerized cognitive training on cognitively healthy older adults. The evidence for each program was assessed via the number and quality (PEDro score) of studies, including Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Programs with clinical studies were subsequently classified as possessing Level I, II or III evidence. Out of 18 identified programs, 7 programs were investigated in 26 studies including follow-ups. Two programs were identified as possessing Level I evidence, three programs demonstrated Level II evidence and an additional two programs demonstrated Level III evidence. Overall, studies showed generally high methodological quality (average PEDro score = 7.05). Although caution must be taken regarding any potential bias due to selective reporting, current evidence supports that at least some commercially available computerized brain training products can assist in promoting healthy brain aging.","Computerized cognitive training; Brain training; Cognition; Dementia; Alzheimer's disease; RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; ACTION VIDEO GAMES; CORTICAL AREA 3B; OF-VIEW TEST; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; LIFE-STYLE; BRAIN; MEMORY; PLASTICITY; INTERVENTION; Psychology, Clinical; Neurosciences; Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw",Shah TM and Weinborn M and Verdile G and Sohrabi HR and Martins RN,,,0,1048
1238,Learning flight procedures by enacting and receiving feedback,"Learning flight procedures is part of any pilot training. The conventional learning method consists in learning and practicing the procedure written on a sheet of paper along with printed images of the cockpit. The purpose of the present paper was to test the efficiency of a tactile interactive multimedia training tool designed to foster the self-regulated learning of flight procedures, especially through enacting relevant gestures and providing feedback. Results showed that learning with this tool did not lead to significant shorter learning times than with the conventional learning. However, on a delayed retention test in a real A320 cockpit simulator, learners of the experimental group performed the procedure more rapidly than those of the control group. Results suggested that a training tool that incites learners to perform similar gestures than those in the real environment and that provides feedback, helped learners to transform declarative into procedural knowledge.","Procedural learning; Multimedia learning; Embodied cognition; METAANALYSIS; DIRECTIONS; COGNITION; DESIGN; Engineering, Industrial; Ergonomics; Psychology, Applied; Engineering; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Matton N and Vrignaud C and Rouillard Y and Lemarie J,,,0,1049
1241,Genetic and environmental influences on spatial reasoning: A meta-analysis of twin studies,"Behavioral genetic approaches, such as comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins, are often used to evaluate the extent to which variations in human abilities are the result of genetic (heritable), shared environmental, and non-shared environmental factors. We conducted a meta-analysis on the twin study literature—comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins—to provide clarity and a general consensus regarding the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to variation in spatial ability. Consistent with previous work, we found that spatial ability is largely heritable (meta-analytic a = .61; 95% CI [.55, .66]), with non-shared environmental factors having a substantial impact (meta-analytic e. = .43; 95% CI [.38, .49]), and shared environmental factors having very little impact (meta-analytic c. = .07; 95% CI [.05, .10]). Moderator analyses were performed to establish if spatial ability type, sex, or age impacted the explanatory power of genetics or environmental factors. These effects did not differ significantly by sex or spatial ability type. However, the influence of shared environments did significantly differ depending on age. This result was driven by the youngest age group (ages 4–15) demonstrating relatively high amounts of shared environmental influence (c = .15, 95% CI [.10, .20]) compared with the other age groups (cs = .00–.07).

1242,Maladaptive player-game relationships in problematic gaming and gaming disorder: A systematic review,"While certain player vulnerabilities are known to increase risk of gaming disorder (GD), the topic of maladaptive player × game relationships in GD has received limited attention. This review aimed to: (1) identify game types associated with GD symptomatology; and (2) evaluate individual differences (e.g., age, personality, depression) in the relationship between gaming and GD symptomatology. A systematic review of six databases identified 23 studies of the relations between game types and GD, including 13 studies employing multivariate analyses. Player vulnerabilities implicated in GD included impulsivity, risk-taking, psychopathological symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), and stronger gaming motivations (e.g., escapism, achievement). MMORPG involvement had the strongest positive association with GD. Problematic MMORPG players tend to have a socially anxious profile and may be attracted to the work-like roles and conventions of this genre. Problematic players of shooters tend to score higher on measures of sensation-seeking and impulsivity than other players. These findings suggest that GD may develop more readily and at more severe levels in complex, endless, socially driven games, irrespective of person-level characteristics. Some player vulnerabilities may selectively increase risk of GD for certain game types. Further research should investigate different player-game interactions to refine current models and interventions for GD.",Video game; gaming disorder; Problematic gaming; Structural characteristics; Addiction; Maladaptive player-game relationships; individual differences; Computer Games; Individual Differences; Susceptibility (Disorders); Nonsubstance Related Addictions; Gambling Disorder; Impulsiveness; Personality; Risk Factors; Symptoms; Video Meta Results Raw,King DL and Delfabbro PH and Perales JC and Deleuze J and Király O and Krossbakken E and Billieux J,,,0,1051
1243,Debriefing for technology-enhanced simulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Debriefing is a common feature of technology-enhanced simulation (TES) education. However, evidence for its effectiveness remains unclear. We sought to characterise how debriefing is reported in the TES literature, identify debriefing features that are associated with improved outcomes, and evaluate the effectiveness of debriefing when combined with TES. METHODS: We systematically searched databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus, and reviewed previous bibliographies for original comparative studies investigating the use of TES with debriefing in training health care providers. Reviewers, in duplicate, evaluated study quality and abstracted information on instructional design, debriefing and outcomes. Effect sizes (ES) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: From 10 903 potentially eligible studies, we identified 177 studies (11 511 learners) that employed debriefing as part of TES. Key characteristics of debriefing (e.g. duration, educator presence and characteristics, content, structure/method, timing, use of video) were usually incompletely reported. A meta-analysis of four studies demonstrated that video-assisted debriefing has negligible and non-significant effects for time skills (ES = 0.10) compared with non-video-assisted debriefing. Meta-analysis demonstrated non-significant effects in favour of expert modelling with short debriefing in comparison with long debriefing (ES range = 0.21-0.74). Among studies comparing terminal with concurrent debriefing, results were variable depending on outcome measures and the context of training (e.g. medical resuscitation versus technical skills). Eight additional studies revealed insight into the roles of other debriefing-related factors (e.g. multimedia debriefing, learner-led debriefing, debriefing duration, content of debriefing). Among studies that compared simulation plus debriefing with no intervention, pooled ESs were favourable for all outcomes (ES range = 0.28-2.16). CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence suggests that video-assisted debriefing yields outcomes similar to those of non-video-assisted debriefing. Other debriefing design features show mixed or non-significant results. As debriefing characteristics are usually incompletely reported, future debriefing research should describe all the key debriefing characteristics along with their associated descriptors.","technology enhanced simulation education; multimedia; video‐assisted debriefing; Computer Simulation; Databases, Bibliographic; Education, Medical; Education, Professional; Health Personnel; Humans; Problem-Based Learning; Teaching; Time Factors; Video Recording; Computer Assisted Instruction; Simulation; Video Display Units; Multimedia; Video Meta Results Raw",Cheng A and Eppich W and Grant V and Sherbino J and Zendejas B and Cook DA,,,0,1052

1245,Treatments for Internet gaming disorder and Internet addiction: A systematic review,"Problems related to excessive use of the Internet and video games have recently captured the interests of both researchers and clinicians. The goals of this review are to summarize the literature on treatment effectiveness for these problems and to determine whether any treatments meet the minimum requirement of an evidence-based treatment as defined by Chambless et al. (1998). Studies of treatments for Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and Internet addiction were examined separately, as past studies have linked IGD to more severe outcomes. The systematic review identified 26 studies meeting predefined criteria; 13 focused on treatments for IGD and 13 on Internet addiction. The results highlighted a paucity of well-designed treatment outcome studies and limited evidence for the effectiveness of any treatment modality. Studies were limited by methodological flaws, including small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and little information on treatment adherence, among other problems. In addition, the field is beset by a lack of consistent definitions of and established instruments to measure IGD and Internet addiction. The results of this review highlight the need for additional work in the area of treatment development and evaluation for IGD and Internet addiction. Attention to methodological concerns identified within this review should improve subsequent research related to treating these conditions, and ultimately outcomes of patients suffering from them.

1246,Verbal redundancy in multimedia learning environments: A meta-analysis,"Verbal redundancy arises from the concurrent presentation of text and verbatim speech. To inform theories of multimedia learning that guide the design of educational materials, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of spoken-only, written-only, and spoken–written presentations on learning retention and transfer. After an extensive search for experimental studies meeting specified inclusion criteria, data from 57 independent studies were extracted. Most of the research participants were postsecondary students. Overall, this meta-analysis revealed that outcomes comparing spoken–written and written-only presentations did not differ, but students who learned from spoken–written presentations outperformed those who learned from spoken-only presentations. This effect was dependent on learners' prior knowledge, pacing of presentation, and inclusion of animation or diagrams. Specifically, the advantages of spoken–written presentations over spoken-only presentations were found for low prior knowledge learners, system-paced learning materials, and picture-free materials. In comparison with verbatim, spoken–written presentations, presentations displaying key terms extracted from spoken narrations were associated with better learning outcomes and accounted for much of the advantage of spoken–written over spoken-only presentations. These findings have significant implications for the design of multimedia materials.

Six students enrolled in a woodwind methods course and participated in PBL activities-including video assessment, written scenarios, emergent performance scenarios in the classroom, group activities, and structured peer teaching-aimed at improving their ability to diagnose and solve instrument-specific performance problems. We examined students' perceptions of PBL, including their teaching confidence, retention of course materials, and overall course engagement. The data collected suggest that students perceived themselves to be learning effectively in this PBL environment, and they felt generally confident in their ability to teach woodwinds. In addition, students appreciated opportunities for real-life teaching scenarios and expressed high levels of motivation, though they found this approach somewhat haphazard and unstructured. We suggest that PBL may be a viable method for educating preservice music teachers.",action research; music teacher preparation; preservice teachers; problem-based learning; self-efficacy; teaching techniques; woodwind methods; TEACHER PREPARATION; BEGINNING TEACHERS; PERCEPTIONS; METAANALYSIS; STUDENTS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Blackwell JA and Roseth NE,,,0,1056
1248,How to build better memory training games,"Can we create engaging training programs that improve working memory (WM) skills? While there are numerous procedures that attempt to do so, there is a great deal of controversy regarding their efficacy. Nonetheless, recent meta-analytic evidence shows consistent improvements across studies on lab-based tasks generalizing beyond the specific training effects (Au et al., 2014; Karbach and Verhaeghen, 2014), however, there is little research into how WM training aids participants in their daily life. Here we propose that incorporating design principles from the fields of Perceptual Learning (PL) and Computer Science might augment the efficacy of WM training, and ultimately lead to greater learning and transfer. In particular, the field of PL has identified numerous mechanisms (including attention, reinforcement, multisensory facilitation and multi-stimulus training) that promote brain plasticity. Also, computer science has made great progress in the scientific approach to game design that can be used to create engaging environments for learning. We suggest that approaches integrating knowledge across these fields may lead to a more effective WM interventions and better reflect real world conditions.

In this study, a sample of 118 participants was used to test whether a lesson presented in either immersive VR or as a video could benefit from the pre-training principle, as a means of reducing cognitive load. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two method conditions (with/without pre-training), and one of two media conditions (immersive VR/video). The results showed an interaction between media and method, indicating that pretraining had a positive effect on knowledge (d = 0.81), transfer (d = 0.62), and self-efficacy (d = 0.64) directly following the intervention; and on self-efficacy (d = 0.84) in a one-week delayed post-test in the immersive VR condition.

1251,Neural correlates of impaired emotion processing in manifest Huntington's disease,"The complex phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD) encompasses motor, psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions, including early impairments in emotion recognition. In this first functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated emotion-processing deficits in 14 manifest HD patients and matched controls. An emotion recognition task comprised short video clips displaying one of six basic facial expressions (sadness, happiness, disgust, fear, anger and neutral). Structural changes between patients and controls were assessed by means of voxel-based morphometry. Along with deficient recognition of negative emotions, patients exhibited predominantly lower neural response to stimuli of negative valences in the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, insula, cingulate and prefrontal cortices, as well as in sensorimotor, temporal and visual areas. Most of the observed reduced activity patterns could not be explained merely by regional volume loss. Reduced activity in the thalamus during fear correlated with lower thalamic volumes. During the processing of sadness, patients exhibited enhanced amygdala and hippocampal activity along with reduced recruitment of the medial prefrontal cortex. Higher amygdala activity was related to more pronounced amygdala atrophy and disease burden. Overall, the observed emotion-related dysfunctions in the context of structural neurodegeneration suggest both disruptions of striatal-thalamo-cortical loops and potential compensation mechanism with greater disease severity in manifest HD.",Video Meta Results Raw,Dogan I and Sass C and Mirzazade S and Kleiman A and Werner CJ and Pohl A and Schiefer J and Binkofski F and Schulz JB and Shah NJ and Reetz K,,,0,1059

This research explores personality traits, learning style, satisfaction and their correlation to educational outcomes in a blended learning scenario that involved game-based learning strategies, flip teaching techniques and video conferencing sessions. At the end of the semester teachers evaluated the grades and skills of 142 K12 students that participated in the study in order to construct a prediction model and analyze the impact of the personality, learning style and satisfaction on educational outcomes. We constructed two ANFIS models to predict the grades and skills in the given learning setup, and two linear regression models to compare the results with ANFIS models. The ANFIS models explaining about 94% and 92% of variances in grades and skills outperformed the linear regression models explaining 81% and 69% of variances. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

1256,Effects of a low-intensity Early Start Denver Model-based intervention delivered in an inclusive preschool setting,"The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) is a promising early intervention for promoting improved social, cognitive, and communication outcomes for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, most studies evaluating group-based delivery of this program have used 15-25 h per week of intervention in specialized ESDM preschools with low child-teacher ratios. Thus, the positive results from such studies might not be obtained when this intervention model is evaluated in more typical inclusive preschool settings. In this study, a low-intensity version of the ESDM was delivered to three young children with ASD in their regular inclusive preschool by a certified therapist who did not typically work at any of the preschools. The intervention procedures were implemented for 3 h per week over an 8- to 10-week period. Data were gathered on children's levels of participation, imitation, and communication from weekly 10-min video recordings. The effects of the intervention were evaluated using a multiple probe across participants design with 3 weekly follow-up probes, 3 weeks after the intervention ended. All participants showed improvement in active participation, imitation and either intentional vocalizations or spontaneous functional utterances. These results were generally maintained at follow-up. This low-intensity version of the ESDM would seem effective for use in real-world preschool environments.","autism spectrum disorder; early intervention; preschools; Early Start Denver Model; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; YOUNG-CHILDREN; METAANALYSIS; Education, Special; Rehabilitation; Education & Educational Research; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Tupou J and Waddington H and van der Meer L and Sigafoos J,,,0,1063
1257,Can the computer replace the adult for storybook reading? A meta-analysis on the effects of multimedia stories as compared to sharing print stories with an adult,"The present meta-analysis challenges the notion that young children necessarily need adult scaffolding in order to understand a narrative story and learn words as long as they encounter optimally designed multimedia stories. Including 29 studies and 1272 children, multimedia stories were found more beneficial than encounters with traditional story materials that did not include the help of an adult for story comprehension (g+ = 0.40, k = 18) as well as vocabulary (g+ = 0.30, k = 11). However, no significant differences were found between the learning outcomes of multimedia stories and sharing traditional print-like stories with an adult. It is concluded that multimedia features like animated illustrations, background music and sound effects provide similar scaffolding of story comprehension and word learning as an adult.",electronic books; multimedia storybooks; adult-child book sharing; story comprehension; vocabulary; meta-analysis; Computers; Reading Materials; Multimedia; Electronic Books; Comprehension; Storytelling; Video Meta Results Raw,Takacs ZK and Swart EK and Bus AG,,,0,1064
1259,The Rhythm Method: A New Method for Measuring Cognitive Load-An Experimental Dual-Task Study,"The present study joins a series of studies that used the dual-task paradigm to measure cognitive load while learning with multimedia instruction. The goal of the current work was to develop a secondary task, to measure cognitive load in a direct and continuous way using intra-individual, behavioral measures. The new task is achieved by utilizing internalized cues. More specifically, a previously practiced rhythm is executed continuously by foot tapping (secondary task) while learning (primary task). Precision of the executed rhythm was used as indicator for cognitive loadthe higher the precision, the lower cognitive load. The suitability of this method was examined by two multimedia experiments (n(1)=30; n(2)=50). Cognitive load was manipulated by seductive details (Experiment 1: with vs. without) and modality (Experiment 2: on-screen text vs. narration). Learners who learned under low cognitive load conditions (Experiment 1: without seductive details; Experiment 2: narration) showed significantly higher rhythm precision. These results provide evidence that rhythm precision allows for a precise and continuous measurement of cognitive load during learning.

1261,The Advantages and Disadvantages of Online and Blended Therapy: Survey Study Amongst Licensed Psychotherapists in Austria,"Background: Web-based and blended (face-to-face plus Web-based) interventions for mental health disorders are gaining significance. However, many licensed psychotherapists still have guarded attitudes toward computer-assisted therapy, hindering dissemination efforts. Objective: The objective of this study was to provide a therapist-oriented evaluation of Web-based and blended therapies and identify commonalities and differences in attitudes toward both formats. Furthermore, it aimed to test the impact of an information clip on expressed attitudes. Methods: In total, 95 Austrian psychotherapists were contacted and surveyed via their listed occupational email address. An 8-minute information video was shown to half of the therapists before 19 advantages and 13 disadvantages had to be rated on a 6-point Likert scale. Results: The sample resembled all assessed properties of Austrian psychotherapists (age, theoretical orientation, and region). Therapists did not hold a uniform overall preference. Instead, perceived advantages of both interventions were rated as neutral (t(94)=1.89, P=. 06; d=0.11), whereas Web-based interventions were associated with more disadvantages and risks (t(94)=9.86, P<. 001; d=0.81). The information clip did not excerpt any detectable effect on therapists' attitudes (r(95)=-. 109, P=. 30). The application of modern technologies in the own therapeutic practice and cognitive behavioral orientation were positively related to the given ratings. Conclusions: This study is the first to directly compare therapists' attitudes toward Web-based and blended therapies. Positive attitudes play a pivotal role in the dissemination of new technologies, but unexperienced therapists seem to lack knowledge on how to benefit from technology-aided treatments. To speed up implementation, these aspects need to be addressed in the development of new interventions. Furthermore, the preference of blended treatments over Web-based interventions seems to relate to avoidance of risks. Although this study is likely to represent therapists' attitudes in countries with less advanced electronic health services, therapists' attitudes in more advanced countries might present differently.",computer-assisted therapy; eHealth; psychotherapy; attitude of health personnel; attitude to health; mobile phone; ACCEPTANCE FACILITATING INTERVENTION; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; INTERNET-BASED INTERVENTIONS; SELF-HELP; DEPRESSION; ATTITUDES; BARRIERS; IMPACT; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Video Meta Results Raw,Schuster R and Pokorny R and Berger T and Topooco N and Laireiter AR,,,0,1066

Based on Slater's theory of virtual reality, two dimensions of fear elements in the VR game-the fear of place illusion (PI) and the plausibility illusion (PSI) -were identified by playing a virtual reality survival horror game with a sample of 145 students. Participants reported greater fear toward PSI elements than toward PI elements. Fear of PSI elements positively and strongly predicted disengagement coping strategies and overall fear. Among coping strategies, players mainly adopted approach strategies, followed by avoidance (disengagement and denial), and self-help strategies.

1263,Individualized alignment in total knee arthroplasty using image-based robotic assistance,"Over the past decades many innovations were introduced in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) focusing on implant longevity and higher procedural precision; however, there are still a high number of dissatisfied patients. It was reported that better anatomical alignment may result in improved patient outcome; however, current technologies have limitations to achieve this. The aim of this video article is to describe the technique of individualized alignment in TKA with the use of image-based robotic assistance. The technology is based on an individual patient knee model computed from segmented computed tomography (CT) scans. A preoperative planning of prosthesis position is conducted following the principle of kinematic alignment. Intraoperatively the soft tissue envelope is recorded and the computer predicts the gap balance based on the virtual planning. The prosthesis position is then adapted to achieve balanced gaps and to avoid soft tissue release. This technique is shown in a cadaver operation and clinical examples of two patients are described. With the combination of anatomically oriented prosthesis positioning and minor adaptations with respect to the soft tissue, an individualized alignment is achieved with reduced need of soft tissue release. The robotic-assisted surgery guarantees a precise implementation of the planning. The initial experience showed a promising outcome in short-term follow-up.",KINEMATIC ALIGNMENT; METAANALYSIS; NAVIGATION; SERIES; TKA; Orthopedics; Orthopedics; Video Meta Results Raw,Calliess T and Ettinger M and Savov P and Karkosch R and Windhagen H,,,0,1068
1264,Efficacy of technology-based interventions for obesity prevention in adolescents: a systematic review,"About one third of adolescents in the USA are overweight and/or obese. Obesity during the adolescent years is associated with many adverse health consequences, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and psychosocial problems. Because of substantial advances in technologies and wide acceptance by adolescents, it is now possible to use technology for healthy weight management and prevention of obesity. This systematic review used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and aimed to evaluate the existing literature reported on the effectiveness of technology-based intervention - (web-based, e-learning, and active video games) in preventing obesity in adolescents. The primary aim of this review was to explore if components of specific interventions were associated with a reduction in body mass index. Research articles obtained from CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane database from1990 to 2014 were reviewed. A total of 131 published articles were identified, and 14 met the inclusion criteria of a randomized or nonrandomized clinical study with body mass index as primary outcome and/or secondary outcomes of diet/physical activity and/or psychosocial function, tested lifestyle interventions to prevent obesity, used technology, and studied adolescents (aged 12-18 years). The results indicated that six of 14 studies found body mass index and/or body fat decreased at short-term (less than 12 months) follow-up. Six of eleven studies that examined physical activity or physical activity-related outcomes found an improved physical activity outcome (time playing active video games and increase in physical activity time), while five of seven studies which assessed dietary outcomes indicated improvement in dietary behaviors. Five of seven studies suggested an improvement in psychosocial function (reduced depression, improved self-esteem and efficacy, improvement on Behavior Assessment Scale) in adolescents involved in the technology-based intervention. All effective interventions utilized dietary and physical activity strategies as part of intervention components. Because of the variation in duration of intervention (range 10 weeks to 2 years), it is not clear what length of intervention is most effective. Future research should assess the long-term impact of technology-based interventions and evaluate mediators and moderators for weight change in adolescents.",Video Meta Results Raw,Chen JL and Wilkosz ME,,,0,1069
1265,Mastery learning for health professionals using technology-enhanced simulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"PURPOSE: Competency-based education requires individualization of instruction. Mastery learning, an instructional approach requiring learners to achieve a defined proficiency before proceeding to the next instructional objective, offers one approach to individualization. The authors sought to summarize the quantitative outcomes of mastery learning simulation-based medical education (SBME) in comparison with no intervention and nonmastery instruction, and to determine what features of mastery SBME make it effective. METHOD: The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus, key journals, and previous review bibliographies through May 2011. They included original research in any language evaluating mastery SBME, in comparison with any intervention or no intervention, for practicing and student physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. Working in duplicate, they abstracted information on trainees, instructional design (interactivity, feedback, repetitions, and learning time), study design, and outcomes. RESULTS: They identified 82 studies evaluating mastery SBME. In comparison with no intervention, mastery SBME was associated with large effects on skills (41 studies; effect size [ES] 1.29 [95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.50]) and moderate effects on patient outcomes (11 studies; ES 0.73 [95% CI, 0.36-1.10]). In comparison with nonmastery SBME instruction, mastery learning was associated with large benefit in skills (3 studies; effect size 1.17 [95% CI, 0.29-2.05]) but required more time. Pretraining and additional practice improved outcomes but, again, took longer. Studies exploring enhanced feedback and self-regulated learning in the mastery model showed mixed results. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence suggests that mastery learning SBME is superior to nonmastery instruction but takes more time.","mastery learning; health professionals; technology enhanced simulation; individualization; self regulated learning; Competency-Based Education; Computer Simulation; Education, Medical; Health Personnel; Humans; Learning; Research; Research Design; Mastery Learning; Self-Regulated Learning; Technology; Health Personnel; Computer Simulation; Individualism; Video Meta Results Raw; HETTE",Cook DA and Brydges R and Zendejas B and Hamstra SJ and Hatala R,,,0,1070
1266,Inquiry-based science education: towards a pedagogical framework for primary school teachers,"Inquiry-based science education (IBSE) has been promoted as an inspiring way of learning science by engaging pupils in designing and conducting their own scientific investigations. For primary school teachers, the open nature of IBSE poses challenges as they often lack experience in supporting their pupils during the different phases of an open IBSE project, such as formulating a research question and designing and conducting an investigation. The current study aims to meet these challenges by presenting a pedagogical framework in which four domains of scientific knowledge are addressed in seven phases of inquiry. The framework is based on video analyses of pedagogical interventions by primary school teachers participating in open IBSE projects. Our results show that teachers can guide their pupils successfully through the process of open inquiry by explicitly addressing the conceptual, epistemic, social and/or procedural domain of scientific knowledge in the subsequent phases of inquiry. The paper concludes by suggesting further research to validate our framework and to develop a pedagogy for primary school teachers to guide their pupils through the different phases of open inquiry.",Video Meta Results Raw,van Uum MS and Verhoeff RP and Peeters M,,,0,1071

Vocabulary knowledge is a complex, multidimensional construct that has been interpreted and categorized in second language research in many different ways. This review identifies methodological practices in research into L2 TMVD and provides a synthesis of learning and instructional approaches, aspects of vocabulary knowledge being investigated, and measures of vocabulary development used in this research. A sample of 82 primary studies from 2010 to 2017 was selected and coded for target methodological features. The results of the review show that TMVD research has achieved a certain degree of methodological maturity, while a number of issues have also been identified. These issues include: the practice of comparing technology-mediated instruction with \traditional\' instruction without technology",insufficient reporting of participants' L2 proficiency,Elgort I,,,0,1072
1271,A meta-analysis of perceptual and cognitive functions involved in useful-field-of-view test performance,"The useful-field-of-view (UFOV) test measures the amount of information someone can extract from a visual scene in one glance. Its scores show relatively strong relationships with everyday activities. The UFOV test consists of three computer tests, suggested to measure processing speed and central vision, divided attention, and selective attention. However, other functions seem to be involved as well. In order to investigate the contribution of these suggested and other perceptual and cognitive functions, we performed a meta-analysis of 116 Pearson's correlation coefficients between UFOV scores and other test scores reported in 18 peer-reviewed articles. We divided these correlations into nine domains: attention, executive functioning, general cognition, memory, spatial ability, visual closure, contrast sensitivity, visual processing speed, and visual acuity. A multivariate mixed-effects model analysis revealed that each domain correlated significantly with each of the UFOV subtest scores. These correlations were stronger for Subtests 2 and 3 than for Subtest 1. Furthermore, some domains were more strongly correlated to the UFOV than others across subtests. We did not find interaction effects between subtest and domain, indicating that none of the UFOV subtests is more selectively sensitive to a particular domain than the others. Thus, none of the three UFOV subtests seem to measure one clear construct. Instead, a range of visual and cognitive functions is involved. Perhaps this is the reason for the UFOV's high ecological validity, as it involves many functions at once, making it harder to compensate if one of them fails.",perception; cognition; useful-field-of-view test; Aged; Attention; Automobile Driving; Cognition; Contrast Sensitivity; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Visual Acuity; Cognition; Visual Field; Visual Perception; Test Performance; Video Meta Results Raw,Woutersen K and Guadron L and van den Berg AV and Boonstra FN and Theelen T and Goossens J,,,0,1073

Drawing on social cognitive theory and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, the meta‐analysis psychometrically cumulated k = 15 studies of 25 years of research with a total sample size of N = 2274 learners. The findings indicate that high levels of user control result in higher estimates of self‐efficacy and transfer. Offering assessment feedback after rather than during training led to higher efficacy beliefs and transfer. Effects of social, narrative and multimedia characteristics were nonsignificant. Implications for computer‐based instructional design and directions for future research associated with motivational outcomes in technology‐enhanced learning are discussed.

1273,"Children's hostile attribution bias is reduced after watching realistic playful fighting, and the effect is mediated by prosocial thoughts","Hostile attribution bias (HAB) has been found to characterize aggressive children. Watching prosocial media has been shown to have positive effects on children, and the general learning model has been used to account for these observations. This study tested the hypotheses derived from this theory that exposure to playful fighting would lead to a reduction in HAB, both immediately and after a 1-day delay, and that this effect would be mediated by positive thoughts. Four studies exposed child participants (N = 242) to playful fighting versus neutral behavior primes and then tested their HAB. In two studies, thoughts about playful fighting and about children were assessed and tested as mediators. The main hypotheses were supported. The positive effect of watching playful fighting on HAB was evident immediately but not after 1 day. This effect was mediated by positive thoughts. In line with the general learning model, watching playful fighting reduced HAB in children, and positive thoughts contribute to this effect. This extends the realm of the general learning model and suggests interventions to help children avoid aggression. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Video Meta Results Raw,Boulton MJ,,,0,1075
1274,Is the Flipped Classroom a Panacea for Medical Education?,"Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this review is to describe the flipped classroom, its advantages and disadvantages, its use specifically in medical education, and directions for future research. The flipped classroom is an instructional model in which the traditional lecture is delivered in a video format before class. The in-class time is spent on active, inquiry-based learning facilitated by an instructor.Recent FindingsThe flipped classroom is rapidly gaining in interest and popularity, and being increasingly implemented in medical education at all levels. Despite its many theoretical advantages, there are a variety of pros and cons that educators should consider when adopting this methodology. Overall, research findings to date support use of the flipped classroom in regard to learner preference and satisfaction; however, further studies are needed to determine its true effect on learning outcomes.SummaryThe flipped classroom is a relatively new educational modality that can potentially promote learner-centered, self-directed, active learning. There is significant potential for educational researchers who wish to develop assessment tools capable of evaluating deeper learning, particularly within the flipped classroom framework.",Flipped classroom; Medical education; Active learning; METAANALYSIS; MODEL; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Lewis CE,,,0,1076
1275,Laparoscopic surgical box model training for surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience,"BACKGROUND: Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. This is time consuming, costly, and of variable effectiveness. Training using a box model physical simulator is an option to supplement standard training. However, the value of this modality on trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare the benefits and harms of box model training for surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience versus standard surgical training or supplementary animal model training. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to May 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include all randomised clinical trials comparing box model trainers versus other forms of training including standard laparoscopic training and supplementary animal model training in surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience. We also planned to include trials comparing different methods of box model training. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently identified trials and collected data. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager 5. For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible. MAIN RESULTS: We identified eight trials that met the inclusion criteria. One trial including 17 surgical trainees did not contribute to the meta-analysis. We included seven trials (249 surgical trainees belonging to various postgraduate years ranging from year one to four) in which the participants were randomised to supplementary box model training (122 trainees) versus standard training (127 trainees). Only one trial (50 trainees) was at low risk of bias. The box trainers used in all the seven trials were video trainers. Six trials were conducted in USA and one trial in Canada. The surgeries in which the final assessments were made included laparoscopic total extraperitoneal hernia repairs, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic tubal ligation, laparoscopic partial salpingectomy, and laparoscopic bilateral mid-segment salpingectomy. The final assessments were made on a single operative procedure.There were no deaths in three trials (0/82 (0%) supplementary box model training versus 0/86 (0%) standard training; RR not estimable; very low quality evidence). The other trials did not report mortality. The estimated effect on serious adverse events was compatible with benefit and harm (three trials; 168 patients; 0/82 (0%) supplementary box model training versus 1/86 (1.1%) standard training; RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.02 to 8.43; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported patient quality of life. The operating time was significantly shorter in the supplementary box model training group versus the standard training group (1 trial; 50 patients; MD -6.50 minutes; 95% CI -10.85 to -2.15). The proportion of patients who were discharged as day-surgery was significantly higher in the supplementary box model training group versus the standard training group (1 trial; 50 patients; 24/24 (100%) supplementary box model training versus 15/26 (57.7%) standard training; RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.37). None of the trials reported trainee satisfaction. The operating performance was significantly better in the supplementary box model training group versus the standard training group (seven trials; 249 trainees; SMD 0.84; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.10).None of the trials compared box model training versus animal model training or versus different methods of box model training. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to determine whether laparoscopic box model training reduces mortality or morbidity. There is very low quality evidence that it improves technical skills compared with standard surgical training in trainees with limited previous laparoscopic experience. It may also decrease operating time and increase the proportion of patients who were discharged as day-surgery in the first total extraperitoneal hernia repair after box model training. However, the duration of the benefit of box model training is unknown. Further well-designed trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary. Such trials should assess the long-term impact of box model training on clinical outcomes and compare box training with other forms of training.",Video Meta Results Raw,Gurusamy KS and Nagendran M and Toon CD and Davidson BR,,,0,1077

1278,"Virtual reality in cognitive and motor rehabilitation: facts, fiction and fallacies","INTRODUCTION: Over recent decades many researchers and clinicians have started to use Virtual Reality (VR) as a new technology for implementing innovative rehabilitation treatments in cognitive and motor domains. However, the expression 'VR' has often also been improperly used to refer to video games. Further, VR efficacy, often confused with that of video-game exercises, is still debated. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we provide the scientific rationale for the advantages of using VR systems in rehabilitation and investigate whether the VR could really be a promising technique for the future of rehabilitation of patients, or if it is just an entertainment for scientists. In addition, we describe some of the most used devices in VR with their potential advantages for research and provide an overview of the recent evidence and meta-analyses in rehabilitation. EXPERT COMMENTARY: We highlight the efficacy and fallacies of VR in neurorehabilitation and discuss the important factors emerging from the use of VR, including the sense of presence and the embodiment over a virtual avatar, in developing future applications in cognitive and motor rehabilitation.","Virtual reality; cognitive and motor rehabilitation; sense of presence; body ownership and agency; immersion and interaction; serious exergame; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; PHANTOM LIMB PAIN; OF-THE-ART; BODY; OWNERSHIP; HAND; SKIN; NEUROREHABILITATION; ENVIRONMENTS; PERFORMANCE; Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering; Video Meta Results Raw",Tieri G and Morone G and Paolucci S and Iosa M,,,0,1079
1279,"Incorporating Computing Professionals' Know-how: Differences between Assessment by Students, Academics, and Professional Experts","It is important for both computer science academics and students to clearly comprehend the differences between academic and professional perspectives in terms of assessing a deliverable. It is especially interesting to determine whether the aspects deemed important to evaluate by a computer science expert are the same as those established by academics and students. Such potential discrepancies are indicative of the unexpected challenges students may encounter once they graduate and begin working. In this article, we propose a learning activity in which computer science students made a video about their future profession after hearing an expert in the field who discussed about the characteristics and difficulties of his or her work. Academics, professional experts, and students assessed the videos by means of a questionnaire. This article reports a quantitative study of the results of this experience, which was conducted for three academic years. The study involved 63 students, 6 academics, and 4 computing professionals with extensive experience, and 14 videos were evaluated. Professional experts proved to be the most demanding in the assessment, followed by academics. The least demanding group was the students. These differences are more salient if more substantial issues are examined. The experts focused more on aspects of content, whereas the student preferred to concentrate on format. The academics' focus falls between these two extremes. Understanding how experts value knowledge can guide educators in their search for effective learning environments in computing education.","Student assessment; academic assessment; professional expert assessment; computer science education; METAANALYSIS COMPARING PEER; FEEDBACK; INDUSTRY; SELF; CONSISTENCY; EXPERIENCE; BENEFITS; WORK; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw",Sanchez A and Dominguez C and Miguel Blanco J and Jaime A,,,0,1080

A sample 01 403 (133 males, 270 females) undergraduates in Introductory Psychology courses at University of New Brunswick, NB, Canada and Creighton University, NE, USA completed verbal and spatial tests and recalled their involvement in childhood activities. Convergent and divergent validity were assessed by correlating spatial and masculine scales of the Activities Questionnaire with spatial and verbal measures. Spatial and masculine activities were correlated in the predicted direction with performance in spatial measures. Childhood spatial activities were a significant predictor of adult performance on the Water Level Test and math grades over and above the influence of gender. Results confirm the value of the Activities Questionnaire, and importance of childhood activities in promoting spatial skills in adulthood. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

1283,A comprehensive review of telementoring applications in laparoscopic general surgery,"BACKGROUND: Incorporation of advanced laparoscopic procedures in the practice of institutions without respective experience is a significant impediment in the dissemination of minimally invasive techniques. On-site mentoring programs carry several cost-related and practical constraints. Telementoring has emerged as a practical and cost-effective alternative mentoring tool. The present study aimed to review the pertinent literature on telementoring applications in laparoscopic general surgery. METHODS: A systematic review using the Medline database was performed. Articles reporting on clinical experience with telementoring applications in general surgery were included. Variations in methodology, study design, and operative procedures precluded cumulative outcome evaluation. Instead, a critical appraisal of current evidence was undertaken. RESULTS: Seventy-five articles were identified in the primary search, and ten studies were considered eligible. No randomized studies comparing on-site mentoring with telementoring were identified. The included studies reported on a total of 96 laparoscopic telementored procedures: 50 cholecystectomies, 23 colorectal resections, 7 fundoplications, 9 adrenalectomies, 6 hernia repairs, and 2 splenectomies. Completion of remotely assisted procedures was feasible in the vast majority of cases, whereas technical difficulties included video and audio latency with low transfer rates (<128 kbps) and inadequate guidance regarding the correct plane for dissection. CONCLUSION: Current evidence supports the feasibility and safety of telementoring programs in general surgery.

1284,The process and delivery of CBT for depression in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for depressed adults. CBT interventions are complex, as they include multiple content components and can be delivered in different ways. We compared the effectiveness of different types of therapy, different components and combinations of components and aspects of delivery used in CBT interventions for adult depression. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials in adults with a primary diagnosis of depression, which included a CBT intervention. Outcomes were pooled using a component-level network meta-analysis. Our primary analysis classified interventions according to the type of therapy and delivery mode. We also fitted more advanced models to examine the effectiveness of each content component or combination of components. We included 91 studies and found strong evidence that CBT interventions yielded a larger short-term decrease in depression scores compared to treatment-as-usual, with a standardised difference in mean change of -1.11 (95% credible interval -1.62 to -0.60) for face-to-face CBT, -1.06 (-2.05 to -0.08) for hybrid CBT, and -0.59 (-1.20 to 0.02) for multimedia CBT, whereas wait list control showed a detrimental effect of 0.72 (0.09 to 1.35). We found no evidence of specific effects of any content components or combinations of components. Technology is increasingly used in the context of CBT interventions for depression. Multimedia and hybrid CBT might be as effective as face-to-face CBT, although results need to be interpreted cautiously. The effectiveness of specific combinations of content components and delivery formats remain unclear. Wait list controls should be avoided if possible.","Cognitive-behavioural therapy; depression; multimedia; network meta-analysis; systematic review; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; INTERVENTIONS; TRIALS; Psychology, Clinical; Psychiatry; Psychology; Psychology; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw",López-López JA and Davies SR and Caldwell DM and Churchill R and Peters TJ and Tallon D and Dawson S and Wu Q and Li J and Taylor A and Lewis G and Kessler DS and Wiles N and Welton NJ,,,0,1084

A systematic search was conducted for experimental studies comparing the impact of animated vs. static graphics displays in the context of knowledge acquisition. A total of 50 papers were considered, and consecutively 61 primary studies (N = 7036), yielding 140 pair-wise comparisons of animated vs. static graphic visualizations in multimedia instructional material were analyzed using a random-effects model. An overall positive effect of animation over static graphics was found, with a Hedges’s g effect size of 0.226 (95% confidence interval = 0.12–0.33). Additional moderator analyses indicated substantial effect sizes when the animation was system-paced (g = 0.309), when it was coupled with auditory commentary (g = 0.336) or when the instruction did not include any accompanying text (g = 0.883).

1286,A Meta-Analysis of the Cognitive and Motivational Effects of Serious Games,"It is assumed that serious games influences learning in 2 ways, by changing cognitive processes and by affecting motivation. However, until now research has shown little evidence for these assumptions. We used meta-analytic techniques to investigate whether serious games are more effective in terms of learning and more motivating than conventional instruction methods (learning: k = 77, N = 5,547; motivation: k = 31, N = 2,216). Consistent with our hypotheses, serious games were found to be more effective in terms of learning (d = 0.29, p .05) than conventional instruction methods. Additional moderator analyses on the learning effects revealed that learners in serious games learned more, relative to those taught with conventional instruction methods, when the game was supplemented with other instruction methods, when multiple training sessions were involved, and when players worked in groups.",Video Meta Results Raw,Wouters P and van Nimwegen C and van Oostendorp H and van der Spek ED,,,0,1086
1289,Technology use to support employment-related outcomes for people with intellectual and developmental disability: an updated meta-analysis,"Objectives The aim of this study is to update and extend an original meta-analysis which included papers published up to and including 2003 and investigated the impact of technology use on employment-related outcomes for people with intellectual and developmental disability. Methods Following on from the original meta-analysis, this study is a meta-analysis of pertinent single-subject experimental design studies conducted from 2004 to 2016 and employs the same metric methods as the original contribution. Results The results are generally consistent with those of the original meta-analysis, namely, applied cognitive technology effectively supports employment-related outcomes for people with intellectual and developmental disability. Nevertheless, significant differences in the intervention effects were found (a) between groups of individuals with varying levels of disability, and (b) between interventions utilizing technology with and without universal design features. Conclusions In line with the original contribution, applied cognitive technology seems to support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to better achieve employment-related outcomes. More research is needed though to explore the impact of different types of technology on employment-related outcomes.","intellectual and developmental disability; applied cognitive technology; assistive technology; meta-analysis; employment-related outcomes; HIGH-SCHOOL-STUDENTS; PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANT; TEACHING COOKING SKILLS; SINGLE-SUBJECT RESEARCH; DAILY LIVING SKILLS; YOUNG-ADULTS; TASK COMPLETION; PROMPTING SYSTEM; JOB-PERFORMANCE; VIDEO MODELS; Education, Special; Rehabilitation; Education & Educational Research; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw",Damianidou D and Arthur-Kelly M and Lyons G and Wehmeyer ML,,,0,1087
1290,Resident and student education in otolaryngology: A 10-year update on e-learning,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: E-learning, in its most rudimentary form, is the use of Internet-based resources for teaching and learning purposes. In surgical specialties, this definition encompasses the use of virtual patient cases, digital modeling, and online tutorials, as well as standardized video and imaging. As new technological frontiers rapidly emerge within otolaryngology, e-learning may be an effective alternative to traditional teaching. Here we present a systematic review of the literature assessing the efficacy of e-learning for otolaryngology education and a discussion of the relevance of these programs for both medical students and residents within the field. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was conducted according to the guidelines defined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. RESULTS: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. These studies measured a range of outcomes from basic science anatomical knowledge to clinically relevant endpoints such as diagnostic accuracy. Nearly all of the studies reported greater satisfaction and/or significantly increased objective knowledge using the e-learning intervention compared to traditional techniques. CONCLUSIONS: E-learning proves to be a powerful alternative to standard teaching techniques within otolaryngology education for both residents and medical students. Future work should focus on validating specific e-learning programs and accessing long-term knowledge retention using these innovative platforms.

1291,Boundary conditions of the politeness effect in online mathematical learning,"Higher mathematics is an obligatory subject for most students at technical universities and is especially difficult to understand. Many multimedia studies have shown that politeness in instructions and feedback can enhance learning outcomes. Thus, this study aimed to investigate if politeness could improve the learning performance of students in an online mathematics course that was presented within a year. In our experiment, 277 students were randomly assigned to a 2 (politeness in instructions; polite vs. direct) x 2 (politeness in feedback; polite vs. direct) factorial between-subjects design. The learning material consisted of four chapters of higher mathematics and four post-tests. Unexpectedly, politeness in instructions did not influence the results. Furthermore, groups receiving polite feedback spent more time on the exercises in the chapters and achieved higher scores in chapters and post-tests. In sum, politeness in feedback influenced learning positively, but politeness in instructions did not have any influence.","Mathematical online learning; Politeness; Instructions and feedback; Multimedia learning; Long-term study; FEEDBACK; STUDENTS; INSTRUCTIONS; METAANALYSIS; TUTORS; HELPS; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology, Experimental; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Mikheeva M and Schneider S and Beege M and Rey GD,,,0,1089
1292,The cognitive psychology of Internet gaming disorder,"Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has received nomenclatural recognition as a potential mental health disorder, despite evident variability in its core psychopathology and psychometric assessment. Although cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for IGD, the underlying cognitions of the disorder are not well understood. This review aimed to synthesise research evidence on Internet gaming cognition toward identification of cognitive factors underlying IGD. A systematic review of 29 quantitative studies on Internet gaming cognition and 7 treatment studies employing cognitive therapy for IGD was conducted. Four cognitive factors underlying IGD were identified. Factors included (a) beliefs about game reward value and tangibility, (b) maladaptive and inflexible rules about gaming behaviour, (c) over-reliance on gaming to meet self-esteem needs, and (d) gaming as a method of gaining social acceptance. It is proposed that IGD-related cognition may be more complex than \preoccupation\' (i.e.",criterion A of IGD). IGD cognition may involve the persistent overvaluation of video gaming rewards,King DL and Delfabbro PH,,,0,1090
1294,Gamification Solutions to Enhance Software User Engagement—A Systematic Review,"Gamification is the use of video-game mechanics and elements in nongame contexts to enhance user engagement and performance. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review to have an in-depth investigation into the existing gamification solutions targeted at solving user engagement problems in different categories of software. We carried out this systematic review by proposing a framework of gamifying process, which is the basis for comparison of existing gamification solutions. In order to report the review, the primary studies are categorized according to the following: a) gamified software and their platforms; b) elements of the gamifying process; c) gamification solutions in each software type; d) gamification solutions for software user engagement problems; e) gamification solutions in general; and f) effects of gamification on software user engagement and performance. Based on the search procedure and criteria, a total of 78 primary studies were extracted. Most of the studies focused on educational and social software, which were developed for web or mobile platforms. We concluded that the number of studies on motivating users to use software content, solving problems in learning software, and using real identity is very limited. Furthermore, few studies have been carried out on gamifying the following software categories: productivity software, cloud storage, utility software, entertainment software, search engine software, tool software, fitness software, software engineering, information worker software, and health-care software. In addition, a large number of gamification solutions are relatively simple and require improvement. Thus, for future studies, researchers can work on the items discovered in this review; they can improve the quality of the current gamified systems by using a wide variety of game mechanics and interface elements, utilizing a combination of contextual types of rewards and giving users the ability to use received rewards 'in-game' and 'out-game.'

1295,Thoracoscopic surgical ablation versus catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation,"For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are refractory to anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs), minimally invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical ablation (SA) and catheter ablation (CA) are potential alternative treatment options. The recent FAST randomized study suggested that thoracoscopic SA was superior to CA in achieving freedom of AF in patients who have failed at least one prior AAD. To assess the relative merits and risks of SA versus CA, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Electronic searches were performed using six databases from their inception to December 2014. Relevant studies comparing thoracoscopic SA and CA were identified; data were extracted and analysed according to predefined clinical endpoints. Relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference were used as summary statistics. Freedom from AF/arrhythmias was significantly higher in SA versus CA at 12-month off-AAD (78.4 vs 53%; RR, 1.54; P < 0.0001) and on-AAD (82.6 vs 45.7%; RR, 1.85; P < 0.00001). This difference was maintained in paroxysmal and persistent AF subgroups. The SA cohort had a significantly lower requirement for repeat ablations compared with the CA cohort (4.7 vs 24.4%; RR, 0.21; P = 0.0001). However, major complications were significantly higher in the SA group (28.2 vs 7.8%; RR, 3.30; P = 0.0003), driven by pleural effusion and pneumothorax. SA may be more efficacious than CA treatment in a selected patient population with refractory AF and prior failed catheter intervention. Improved freedom from arrhythmias at up to 12-month follow-up is counterbalanced by higher procedural complication rates.",Atrial fibrillation; Catheter ablation; Surgical ablation; Thoracoscopic; Video-assisted; Video Meta Results Raw,Phan K and Phan S and Thiagalingam A and Medi C and Yan TD,,,0,1092
1296,Systematic review of recess interventions to increase physical activity,"Background: With the rapid increase in obesity rates among youth, efforts to increase physical activity (PA) have become a priority. School-based strategies for PA promotion must be cost-effective, unobtrusive, and linked to improved academic performance. Efforts to maximize recess PA are advocated because of both health and academic benefits. The purpose of this manuscript was to review recess interventions aimed to improve PA among youth, and make recommendations to develop related best practices. Methods: An extensive literature search was conducted to include all primary research articles evaluating any recess intervention with PA as an outcome. Results: The included 13 interventions represented both settings within the U.S and internationally, among preschools and elementary/primary schools. A variety of strategies were used within the design and implementation of each of the interventions including: added equipment/materials, markings, zones, teacher involvement, active video games, activity of the week, and activity cards. Of the included studies, 95% demonstrated positive outcomes as a result of the recess intervention. Conclusions: A number of simple, low-cost strategies can be implemented to maximize the amount of recess time students are allotted. Long-term followup studies are warranted for each of the recess strategies identified to be effective.

1298,Teaching tools in evidence based practice: evaluation of reusable learning objects (RLOs) for learning about meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: All healthcare students are taught the principles of evidence based practice on their courses. The ability to understand the procedures used in systematically reviewing evidence reported in studies, such as meta-analysis, are an important element of evidence based practice. Meta-analysis is a difficult statistical concept for healthcare students to understand yet it is an important technique used in systematic reviews to pool data from studies to look at combined effectiveness of treatments. In other areas of the healthcare curricula, by supplementing lectures, workbooks and workshops with pedagogically designed, multimedia learning objects (known as reusable learning objects or RLOs) we have shown an improvement in students' perceived understanding in subjects they found difficult. In this study we describe the development and evaluation of two RLOs on meta-analysis. The RLOs supplement associated lectures and aim to improve students' understanding of meta-analysis in healthcare students. METHODS: Following a quality controlled design process two RLOs were developed and delivered to two cohorts of students, a Master in Public Health course and Postgraduate diploma in nursing course. Students' understanding of five key concepts of Meta-analysis were measured before and after a lecture and again after RLO use. RLOs were also evaluated for their educational value, learning support, media attributes and usability using closed and open questions. RESULTS: Students rated their understanding of meta-analysis as improved after a lecture and further improved after completing the RLOs (Wilcoxon paired test, p < 0.01 in all cases) Whilst the media components of the RLOs such as animations helped most students (86%) understand concepts including for example Forest plots, 93% of students rated usability and control as important to their learning. A small number of students stated they needed the support of a lecturer alongside the RLOs (7% 'Agreed' and 21% 'Neutral'). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis RLOs that are openly accessible and unrestricted by usernames and passwords provide flexible support for students who find the process of meta-analysis difficult.",Video Meta Results Raw,Bath-Hextall F and Wharrad H and Leonardi-Bee J,,,0,1094
1299,The Academic Diligence Task (ADT): assessing individual differences in effort on tedious but important schoolwork,"The current study reports on the development and validation of the Academic Diligence Task (ADT), designed to assess the tendency to expend effort on academic tasks which are tedious in the moment but valued in the long-term. In this novel online task, students allocate their time between solving simple math problems (framed as beneficial for problem solving skills) and, alternatively, playing Tetris or watching entertaining videos. Using a large sample of high school seniors (N = 921), the ADT demonstrated convergent validity with self-report ratings of Big Five conscientiousness and its facets, self-control and grit, as well as discriminant validity from theoretically unrelated constructs, such as Big Five extraversion, openness, and emotional stability, test anxiety, life satisfaction, and positive and negative affect. The ADT also demonstrated incremental predictive validity for objectively measured GPA, standardized math and reading achievement test scores, high school graduation, and college enrollment, over and beyond demographics and intelligence. Collectively, findings suggest the feasibility of online behavioral measures to assess noncognitive individual differences that predict academic outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

1300,Learning symbols from permanent and transient visual presentations: Don't overplay the hand,"Instructional dynamic pictures (animations and videos) contain transient visual information. Consequently, when learning from dynamic pictures, students must process in working memory the current images while trying to remember the images that left the screen. This additional activity in working memory may lead dynamic pictures to be less suitable instructional materials than comparable static pictures, which are more permanent. In order to directly show the influence of transient visual information on dynamic learning environments, we designed a well-matched comparison between a permanent and a transient presentation of an abstract-symbol memory task on the computer. In the task, 104 university students (50% females) had to memorize the type, color, and position of the symbols in a rectangular configuration. In addition, an embodied cognition factor was included where the symbols in the task were either shown with a precision grasping static hand or not. We also assessed how individual characteristics (spatial ability, spatial memory span, and gender) influenced performance. Results showed that (a) permanent outperformed transient presentations, (b) observing hands hindered learning, and (c) high spatial ability and high spatial memory span were beneficial, but gender did not affect performance.

Results indicated that chaplains who used the M-App exhibited lesser emotional exhaustion and depersonalization as burnout markers and higher personal achievement and resilience as compared to leisure app (L-App) users. The M-App was effective (Cohen?s d range = 3.08?5.07, p?=?.001) for the intervention cohort. Male chaplains, highly qualified, attached to assisted living hospices, who used the M-App once-twice a day, perused both videos and learning sessions and self-practiced regularly, reported lower emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and higher personal achievement and resilience post-test.

1304,Functional brain changes following cognitive and motor skills training: A quantitative meta-analysis,"Background: Functional neuroimaging is increasingly used in rehabilitation research to map the neural mechanisms subserving training targets. These data can inform intervention design and improve evaluation of treatment outcomes. Reliable neural markers may provide standard metrics of treatment impact and allow consideration of behavioral outcomes in the context of functional brain changes. Objective: To identify common patterns of functional brain changes associated with training across a diverse range of intervention protocols. Reliable brain changes could inform development of candidate neural markers to guide intervention research. Methods: Taking a quantitative meta-analytic approach, we review the functional neuroimaging studies of cognitive and motor skills training interventions in healthy young adults (N = 38). Results: Reliable decreases in functional brain activity from pretraining to posttraining were observed in brain regions commonly associated with cognitive control processes, including lateral prefrontal, left anterior inferior parietal lobule, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Training-related increases were observed in the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate and angular gyrus, core regions of the default network. Activity within the subcortical striatum also showed reliable increases pretraining to posttraining. Conclusions: These data suggest that altered engagement of large-scale, spatially distributed cortical brain networks and subcortical striatal brain regions may serve as candidate neural markers of training interventions. The development of reliable metrics based on activity and functional connectivity among large-scale brain networks may prove fruitful in identifying interactions between domain-general and -specific changes in brain activity that affect behavioral outcomes.

1305,Assistive Technology Interventions for Adolescents and Adults with Learning Disabilities: An Evidence-Based Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: An increasing amount of assistive technology interventions exist for adolescents and adults with learning disabilities, but there has been no systematic review of their effectiveness. Purpose: Are assistive technology interventions effective in learning disabilities for participants ages 14 and up? How do these interventions affect the lived experience of users? We performed a systematic review of both qualitative and quantitative studies to answer these questions. Methods: Using 5 search methods, we located 38 quantitative group-design and single-subject intervention studies, 5 survey studies and 13 qualitative studies. We sorted the group-design and single-subject studies into groups by intervention type and performed meta-analyses. We provided a narrative summary of survey and qualitative publications. We used a modified version of the Downs-Black checklist to assess study quality, where applicable. Results: While assistive interventions proved overall beneficial, the most commonly used interventions were unexpectedly not the most effective. Interventions based on word processing, multimedia and hypertext proved the most effective, while smart pens and text-to-speech systems presented mixed results. Speech-to-text systems had a small positive effect. Participants had mixed emotions and attitudes about their assistive technology. Conclusions: Assistive technology interventions can be helpful for adolescents and adults with learning disabilities, but interventions need to be carefully compared, and customized to the individual.

1306,Computer-based interventions to improve social and emotional skills in individuals with autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review,"Objective: To review studies involving the use of computer-based interventions (CBI) to improve the social and emotional skills (e. g. emotional recognition) of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Methods: The use of computer-based intervention (CBI) in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may offer some advantages to traditional one-to-one or group instruction including easier differentiation of instruction, decreased distractions and the incorporation of an individual's relative visual learning strengths. However, the results of past research suggest varying outcomes for CBI with individuals with ASD. This review provides a systematic analysis of studies investigating CBI to improve social and emotional skills (e.g. emotion recognition) of individuals with ASD. Electronic database searches and ancestral searches were used to identify studies that met pre-determined inclusion criteria. The included studies were then summarized in terms of: (a) participant characteristics, (b) social and emotional skills targeted, (c) details of the CBI, (d) results, and (e) certainty of evidence. Results: The results of these studies indicated that CBI's effect on social and emotional skills was mixed, with the majority of studies reporting unacceptable outcomes following intervention. Conclusions: Overall, this review suggests that the use of CBI to improve the social and emotional skills of individuals with ASD is a promising practice. A comparison of CBI plus tutoring and face-to-face social skills training suggests that CBI can be as effective as face-to-face instruction. Practitioners should carefully consider the preferences and existing abilities of individuals with ASD and the customizability of the software when deciding to use CBI and selecting a software program.",Video Meta Results Raw,Ramdoss S and Machalicek W and Rispoli M and Mulloy A and Lang R and O'Reilly M,,,0,1100

Methods: Twenty-one YouTube videos meeting selection criteria were identified. The videos were reviewed for instances of seven implementer errors and, where appropriate, presence of a physical prompter. Results: Forty-three per cent of videos and 61% of PECS exchanges contained errors in parent implementation of specific teaching strategies of the PECS training protocol. Vocal prompts, incorrect error correction and the absence of timely reinforcement occurred most frequently, while gestural prompts, insistence on speech, incorrect use of the open hand prompt and not waiting for the learner to initiate occurred less frequently. Conclusions: Results suggest that parents engage in vocal prompting and incorrect use of the 4-step error correction strategy when using PECS with their children, errors likely to result in prompt dependence.",Video Meta Results Raw,Jurgens A and Anderson A and Moore DW,,,0,1101

A meta‐analysis of recent studies,"Computer-assisted learning is known to be an effective tool for improving learning in both adults and children. Recent years have seen the emergence of the so-called ‘serious games (SGs)’ that are flooding the educational games market. In this paper, the term ‘serious games’ is used to refer to video games (VGs) intended to serve a useful purpose. The objective was to review the results of experimental studies designed to examine the effectiveness of VGs and SGs on players’ learning and engagement. After pointing out the varied nature of the obtained results and the impossibility of reaching any reliable conclusion concerning the effectiveness of VGs and SGs in learning, we stress the limitations of the existing literature and make a number of suggestions for future studies.

1310,Is the gender difference in mental rotation disappearing?,Several investigators have used meta-analysis to compare the results of studies of gender differences on various spatial tests and have concluded that the magnitude of the gender difference in spatial ability is decreasing over time. The present study used meta-analytic techniques to compare the effect size (d) of the gender difference in 14 studies published from 1975 to 1992 which administered the Mental Rotations test to adolescents and young adults. Males scored significantly higher than females in all the studies. Analyses of the d's computed for the studies revealed that the magnitude of the gender difference on the Mental Rotations test has remained stable over time. Neither the Pearson correlation relating the d's to the publication dates of the studies nor the Z test of the linear contrast relating the publication dates of the studies to the effect sizes showed a linear change in the size of the gender difference over time. The finding of a stable gender difference on the Mental Rotations test argues against the general conclusion that the gender difference in spatial ability is decreasing.,Video Meta Results Raw,Masters MS and Sanders B,,,0,1104
1311,Unimodal and Multimodal Human Perception of Naturalistic Non-Basic Affective States during Human-Computer Interactions,"The present study investigated unimodal and multimodal emotion perception by humans, with an eye for applying the findings towards automated affect detection. The focus was on assessing the reliability by which untrained human observers could detect naturalistic expressions of non-basic affective states (boredom, engagement/ flow, confusion, frustration, and neutral) from previously recorded videos of learners interacting with a computer tutor. The experiment manipulated three modalities to produce seven conditions: face, speech, context, face+speech, face+context, speech+context, face+speech+context. Agreement between two observers (OO) and between an observer and a learner (LO) were computed and analyzed with mixed-effects logistic regression models. The results indicated that agreement was generally low (kappas ranged from.030 to.183), but, with one exception, was greater than chance. Comparisons of overall agreement (across affective states) between the unimodal and multimodal conditions supported redundancy effects between modalities, but there were superadditive, additive, redundant, and inhibitory effects when affective states were individually considered. There was both convergence and divergence of patterns in the OO and LO data sets; however, LO models yielded lower agreement but higher multimodal effects compared to OO models. Implications of the findings for automated affect detection are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,D'Mello SK and Dowell N and Graesser A,,,0,1105

In a sample of 516 freshmen (304 women), we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between digit ratio and mathematics grades. Males and females show the same pattern. Participants with both high and low digit ratios earn lower grades in mathematics, while participants which have intermediate digit ratios achieve the highest grades in mathematics. We also find that there is no statistically significant relationship between the digit ratio and the average grades earned by students in other courses except mathematics taken in the first semester at the Faculty of Business and Economics.

1313,Standardized Technique of Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banded Plication with 4-Year Results,"BACKGROUND: No bariatric procedure is perfect, and a plethora of such procedures itself is a proof for the same. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has a high safety profile, but also a high rate of re-operation has been reported (Schouten, Wiryasaputra, van Dielen et al. Obes Surg 20(12):1617-26, 2010). Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is becoming popular, but has its own set of complications and is irreversible. We introduced laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded plication (LAGBP) in 2009 (Huang, Lo, Shabbir et al. Surg Obes Relat Dis 8(1):41-5, 2012) In a case matched comparative study with LSG, LAGBP showed similar results at 2 years in terms of weight loss, comorbidity resolution, and complications. (Huang, Chhabra, Goel et al. Obes Surg 23(8):1319-23, 2013). Several authors have reported variations in their technique, bougie size, and suture material used to perform plication. (Ramos, Galvao Neto, Galvao et al. Obes Surg 20(7):913-8, 2010, (Mui, Lee, Lam et al. Obes Surg 23(2): 179-83, 2013, Brethauer, Harris, Kroh et al. Surg Obes Relat Dis 7(1):15-22, 2011) Our initial technique of placing the band first and then plicating the stomach resulted in higher incidence of gastric fundus herniation compared to that reported in a systematic review (Abdelbaki, Huang, Ramos et al. Obes Surg 22(10):1633-9, 2012). After the first 65 cases, we reversed the order by performing the gastric plication first which ensures proper plication of the fundus and a more uniformly placed plication line. This technique has become our standard, and the same is described in this video in a stepwise fashion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed LAGBP in 202 cases over the last 4 years and recorded the findings. Our standardized technique is shown in this video. The T-suspension technique was used for liver retraction. (Zachariah, Tai, Chang et al. J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A 23(4):311-5, 2013) Gastric plication formula is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Gastric plication formula RESULTS: Two hundred two (69 male, 133 female) patients in over the last 4 years underwent LAGBP. Follow-up at 1 year was 168 patients, and 56 patients reached 4-year follow-up. Age was 16-60 years (mean = 31.1). Mean BMI was 39.5 ± 3.18 and body weight 110 kg ± 19.4. Mean operative time was 104 min ± 39 and length of hospital stay after surgery 2.1 ± 2.3 days. No mortality was recorded. Excess weight loss at 1 year was 57.84 % and at four years 68 %. CONCLUSION: LAGBP has been proven to be an effective bariatric procedure in the midterm results. Standardization with plication first and then placement of the band could be important to achieve best outcomes.",Video Meta Results Raw,Ahluwalia JS and Kuo HC and Chang PC and Sun PL and Hung KC and Huang CK,,,0,1107

1316,A systematic review of the diagnostic utility of simple tests of change after trial removal of cerebrospinal fluid in adults with normal pressure hydrocephalus,"OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the evidence regarding the diagnostic value of simple ancillary tests post cerebrospinal fluid drainage in normal pressure hydrocephalus. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane library databases; last searched on 12 September 2017. REVIEW METHODS: This review was performed applying the steps of the PRISMA statement. The QUADAS 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Prospective and retrospective trials were systematically reviewed, and data on diagnostic accuracy were extracted. Meta-analysis (where possible) was performed. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic package was used to calculate pooled estimates of included diagnostic studies. RESULTS: Seventeen trials (with 812 subjects in total) were identified for inclusion in the meta-analyses for the 18-meter walk test, video-recorded gait performance, cognitive test, and Timed Up and Go Test. The summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for the 18-meter walk test was 0.83 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.99) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.95), video-recorded gait performance was 0.85 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.99) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.96), cognitive test was 0.82 (95% CI 0.41-0.99) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.39-0.99), and Timed Up and Go Test was 0.89 (95% CI 0.79-0.95) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.24-0.90), respectively. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the diagnostic value of the 18-meter walk test, video-recorded gait performance, cognitive test, and Timed Up and Go Test in predicting shunt outcomes among adults with normal pressure hydrocephalus.","normal pressure hydrocephalus; diagnostic criteria; ancillary tests; tap test; Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts; Exercise Test; Humans; Hydrocephalus, Normal Pressure; Neuropsychological Tests; Spinal Puncture; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Diagnosis; Hydrocephalus; Medical Treatment (General); Diagnostic Criteria; Video Meta Results Raw",Scully AE and Lim EC and Teow PP and Tan DM,,,0,1109
1317,ASSESSMENT OF INNOVATION BEHAVIOUR - HOW TO TRAIN THE ASSESSORS OF COMPLEX COMPETENCIES,"Cognitive Competencies like logical thinking or language proficiency are relatively easy to assess by standardised tests. For those competencies it is quite obvious how to apply the respective assessment tools. But adequate tools are lacking when it comes to the assessment of complex competencies, which are mainly visible in certain kinds of behaviour like innovation competencies. Behaviour assessment in general and especially the assessment of innovative behaviour requires assessors who are able to observe accurately according to certain standards, who are able to avoid common errors in observation and assessment, and who are able to follow a prescribed frame of reference they did not necessarily share before. A special training will be presented to train teachers in Higher Education Institutions (HEI), Human Resource (HR) personnel in companies as well as students and employees to observe and rate behaviour that is connected to innovation competence. This rater training can be carried out in two different formats: a traditional face-to-face training form for small groups, which is accompanied by a training manual, and as an open online training for individual users or mini-groups. On the basis of research starting in the 1980s and 90s [1] a new form of rater training has been developed. It combines three promising methods from the early days of rater training (behaviour observation training, rater error training and frame of reference training) and recent findings [2, 27]. The major methodological emphasis is on modern forms of video-training. This toolkit for behaviour assessment is part of a larger research project which after a concise needs analysis of companies and HEI developed a measurement tool for the assessment of innovation competence in students and company staff [4]. The project aims at smoothing the way for students from the university into working life and at helping HR personnel to identify and develop innovation competencies in their company ' s staff. Mainly the training is constructed for improving 3rd person assessments but it is also possible to use it for self-assessments. It generally aims at increasing interrater-accuracy and therefore may be regarded as a means for helping to close the gap between 1st and 3rd person assessments. The presentation will describe the structure and development of the assessment toolkit and show interactive examples of the new rater training. There will also be an overview of first experiences from companies and universities.",Innovation Competencies; Rater Training; University-Company-Cooperation; FRAME-OF-REFERENCE; PERFORMANCE-APPRAISAL; HIGHER-EDUCATION; ACCURACY; METAANALYSIS; RATINGS; IMPACT; SELF; BIAS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Stange C and Helker H,,,0,1110
1318,An Exploration of Multimedia Supports for Diverse Learners During Core Math Instruction,"In the present study, mobile technology was leveraged as a learning tool for core math instruction during a whole number multiplication and division unit. The researchers redesigned paper-pencil worksheets from the math curriculum into multimedia-enhanced, interactive math practice (the eWorkbook) accessed by students on an iPad. With this eWorkbook, which was conceptualized within a Universal Design for Learning framework, we aimed to reduce barriers and capitalize on strengths by embedding flexible scaffolds/supports, allowing for student choice, and incorporating evidence-based teaching practices. Results of this case study suggest students with and without learning disabilities can leverage multimedia to foster unique opportunities for the understanding and expression of mathematical knowledge. Additional affordances of the eWorkbook include extending the reach of teacher support while encouraging self-support.

1319,Game on: The gamification of the pharmacy classroom,"BACKGROUND: Gamification is the use of game mechanics to promote engagement and enjoyment of problem-solving in non-game situations. Gamification has been used widely in recent years in industry and academia as a tool for training and education. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of gamification and digital game-based learning (DGBL), review the use of digital games in health professional education, and provide suggestions for future use in pharmacy curricula. DISCUSSION: Many examples of game-based learning in pharmacy and other health professional curricula have been published, however the body of literature on DGBL is less developed. Overall, evaluations of these techniques show that students find them engaging and enjoyable. A recent meta-analysis of studies comparing DGBL to non-game based learning in primary, secondary, post-secondary education found that DGBL significantly enhances learning. Challenges to implementing game-based learning are financial, cultural, and technological. CONCLUSION: Many areas of the pharmacy curriculum could be appropriate for digital gamification. With more students entering pharmacy school familiar with video games and game-based living the time has come for pharmacy educators to explore how these instructional technologies could benefit a new generation of pharmacy students. As serious games are developed and researched in pharmacy curricula, test scores, student confidence in knowledge and skills, and retention of knowledge and skills are all outcomes that, if published, will help advance the adoption of DGBL into the pharmacy school classroom.",Active learning; Game-based learning; Gamification; Pharmacy education; Video Meta Results Raw,Sera L and Wheeler E,,,0,1112
1320,Effects of Smartphone-Based Mobile Learning in Nursing Education: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Purpose: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of smartphone-based mobile learning for nurses and nursing students. Methods: Electronic literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ProQuest Central, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Educational Resource Information Center (ERIC) was conducted. Two authors independently reviewed empirical studies for inclusion and extracted the design, sample size, intervention method, outcome variables, and statistical values of them. Methodological quality was assessed using Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool. To estimate the effect size, meta-analysis was performed using R meta program. Results: Authors identified 11 randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials of a total of 3,419 studies. Overall effect sizes by random-effects model was large [Hedges'g (g) = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-1.52], with learning attitude (g = 1.69), skills (g = 1.41), knowledge (g = 1.47), and confidence in performance (g = 1.54). For heterogeneity, subgroup analyses using meta-analysis of variance were performed, but no significant difference was found. Finally, a funnel plot and Egger's regression test along with trim-and-fill analysis and fail-safe N were conducted to check for publication bias, but no significant bias was detected. Conclusion: Smartphone-based mobile learning had significantly positive influence on nursing students' knowledge, skills, confidence in performance, and learning attitude. Smartphone-based mobile learning may be an alternative or supportive method for better education in nursing fields.

1321,"The more total cognitive load is reduced by cues, the better retention and transfer of multimedia learning: A meta-analysis and two meta-regression analyses","Cueing facilitates retention and transfer of multimedia learning. From the perspective of cognitive load theory (CLT), cueing has a positive effect on learning outcomes because of the reduction in total cognitive load and avoidance of cognitive overload. However, this has not been systematically evaluated. Moreover, what remains ambiguous is the direct relationship between the cue-related cognitive load and learning outcomes. A meta-analysis and two subsequent meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore these issues. Subjective total cognitive load (SCL) and scores on a retention test and transfer test were selected as dependent variables. Through a systematic literature search, 32 eligible articles encompassing 3,597 participants were included in the SCL-related meta-analysis. Among them, 25 articles containing 2,910 participants were included in the retention-related meta-analysis and the following retention-related meta-regression, while there were 29 articles containing 3,204 participants included in the transfer-related meta-analysis and the transfer-related meta-regression. The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant cueing effect on subjective ratings of cognitive load (d = -0.11, 95% CI = [-0.19, -0.02], p < 0.05), retention performance (d = 0.27, 95% CI = [0.08, 0.46], p < 0.01), and transfer performance (d = 0.34, 95% CI = [0.12, 0.56], p < 0.01). The subsequent meta-regression analyses showed that dSCL for cueing significantly predicted dretention for cueing (β = -0.70, 95% CI = [-1.02, -0.38], p < 0.001), as well as dtransfer for cueing (β = -0.60, 95% CI = [-0.92, -0.28], p < 0.001). Thus in line with CLT, adding cues in multimedia materials can indeed reduce SCL and promote learning outcomes, and the more SCL is reduced by cues, the better retention and transfer of multimedia learning.",cognitive load; cues; multimedia learning; meta-analysis; retention; transfer; Attention; Cognition; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Cues; Humans; Learning; Multimedia; Regression Analysis; Cues; Human Channel Capacity; Retention; Transfer (Learning); Multimedia; Instructional Media; Meta Analysis; Video Meta Results Raw,Xie H and Wang F and Hao Y and Chen J and An J and Wang Y and Liu H,,,1,1114
1322,Interacting with hypertext: A meta-analysis of experimental studies,"The meta-analysis compared and synthesized the results of 23 experimental studies on hypertext. The analysis was based on 56 pairs of effect sizes and significance levels of the impact of users, tasks, and tools on interactions with hypertext. This analysis focused on three factors that prevailingly influence the use of hypertext: the cognitive styles and spatial ability of users; the complexity of tasks; and the structure of information organization and the visualization of the structure. The meta-analysis found that this group of experimental studies reported significantly discrepant findings, indicating that substantial differences exist among individual experiments. Individual differences in cognition did not yield enough evidence to conclude that the effect sizes are significantly apart from zero. The meta-analysis showed that the overall performance of hy pertext users tended to be more effective than that of nonhypertext users, but the differences in efficiency measures were consistently in favor of nonhypertext users. Users benefited more from hypertext tools for open tasks. Overall, the complexity of tasks has the largest combined effect sizes. Graphical maps that visualize the organization of hypertext have significant impact on the usefulness of a hypertext system. This meta-analysis raised two issues concerned with the present hypertext literature: (a) the absence of a taxonomy of tasks for analyzing and comparing hypertext usability across studies, and (b) the weaknesses of the connections between abstract hypertext reference models and specific hypertext systems. These weaknesses may considerably undermine the significance of individual findings on hypertext usability. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that the discrepancies among empirical findings are related to these weaknesses. Future work on hypertext usability should emphasize task taxonomies along with longitudinal and ethnographic studies for a deep understanding of the interactions between users and hypertext.

1323,Endoscopic closure of large colonic perforations with a novel endoscopic clip device: An animal study (with videos),"Background and Aim An endoscopic clip device was newly designed to accomplish the closure of large gastrointestinal defects. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and efficacy of this device in an ex vivo experimental setting. Methods This prospective study was conducted in porcine colons (n = 5). A large (3-4 cm) linear full-thickness incision was created using a scalpel externally. The device was used for endoscopic closure. The procedure time, number of clips, and success rate of closure were determined. Results Ten defects were created in five porcine colons (two incisions in each specimen). Successful closure was achieved in all defects. The mean procedure time was 24.30 +/- 4.42 min, the mean leak pressure is 28.30 +/- 9.49 mmHg, and the mean number of additional conventional hemostatic clips used was 5.10 +/- 0.99. Conclusions The results indicated that this clip achieved the convenient and reliable closure of large defects in the colon wall in an ex vivo porcine model and seems to be a promising option for closing large gastrointestinal perforations.",closure; endoscopic clip; GI defect; iatrogenic perforation; colon; SUBMUCOSAL DISSECTION; MANAGEMENT; EMR; METAANALYSIS; EFFICACY; DEFECT; Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Video Meta Results Raw,Wang ZJ and Li SY and Zhang YH and Chen Y and Zhang PP and Li ZS and Bai Y and Wang D,,,0,1116
1324,Engaging children with cerebral palsy in interactive computer play-based motor therapies: theoretical perspectives,"Purpose: To provide a theoretically grounded understanding of engagement in interactive computer play-based motor therapies by children with cerebral palsy in home settings. Methods: A motivational framework for engagement and its relationship with three contemporary theories (self-determination theory, expectancy-value theory, social cognitive theory of self-regulation) was overviewed. A scoping review was conducted to understand how engagement is influenced by features of the technology and intervention design that impact intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, child and parent values and expectancies, and the processes of self-regulation. Multiple reviewers screened and extracted data from 26 articles describing home-based clinical trials of interactive computer play-based motor interventions for children with cerebral palsy. A narrative synthesis framework was used for analysis. Results: Features of the technology and the intervention influence feelings of autonomy (e.g., personalization), competence (e.g., calibration), and relatedness (e.g., social play, virtual therapist/coach). There may be multiple and differently valued goals in interactive computer play-based interventions (e.g., game- and therapy-focused) that, if disconnected or unmet, negatively impact engagement. Multiplayer interactions, real-time feedback and progress tracking provide information that influences self-regulation and engagement over time. Conclusions: Optimizing engagement in interactive computer play-based motor interventions requires closer alignment with client-led values/goals; design of technologies and interventions that sustain intrinsic motivation; and feedback that informs/builds self-efficacy.",Engagement; motivation; computer play; video game; pediatric; rehabilitation; therapy; cerebral palsy; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; EXPECTANCY-VALUE THEORY; VIRTUAL-REALITY; PEDIATRIC REHABILITATION; ENGAGEMENT; GAMES; ADOLESCENTS; MOTIVATION; MODEL; TELEREHABILITATION; Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation; Video Meta Results Raw,Biddiss E and Chan-Viquez D and Cheung ST and King G,,,0,1117
1325,"Development and Validation of Two Instruments Measuring Intrinsic, Extraneous, and Germane Cognitive Load","Cognitive Load Theory is one of the most powerful research frameworks in educational research. Beside theoretical discussions about the conceptual parts of cognitive load, the main challenge within this framework is that there is still no measurement instrument for the different aspects of cognitive load, namely intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load. Hence, the goal of this paper is to develop a differentiated measurement of cognitive load. In Study 1 (N = 97), we developed and analyzed two strategies to measure cognitive load in a differentiated way: (1) Informed rating: We trained learners in differentiating the concepts of cognitive load, so that they could rate them in an informed way. They were asked then to rate 24 different learning situations or learning materials related to either high or low intrinsic, extraneous, or germane load. (2) Naive rating: For this type of rating of cognitive load we developed a questionnaire with two to three items for each type of load. With this questionnaire, the same learning situations had to be rated. In the second study (N = between 65 and 95 for each task), we improved the instrument for the naive rating. For each study, we analyzed whether the instruments are reliable and valid, for Study 1, we also checked for comparability of the two measurement strategies. In Study 2, we conducted a simultaneous scenario based factor analysis. The informed rating seems to be a promising strategy to assess the different aspects of cognitive load, but it seems not economic and feasible for larger studies and a standardized training would be necessary. The improved version of the naive rating turned out to be a useful, feasible, and reliable instrument. Ongoing studies analyze the conceptual validity of this measurement with up to now promising results.","Cognitive Load Theory; differentiated measurement; instructional design; multimedia research; multimedia design principles; DUAL-TASK METHODOLOGY; INSTRUCTIONAL-DESIGN; EDUCATIONAL-RESEARCH; WORKED EXAMPLES; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; INCREASE; PROMPTS; THOUGHT; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Psychology; Video Meta Results Raw",Klepsch M and Schmitz F and Seufert T,,,0,1118
1326,Success in Difficult Airway Managements with Video Laryngoscope After Two Failures in Intubation with Macintosh and McCoy Laryngoscope: A Case Report,"Introduction: Currently, creating a secure airway for general anesthesia is an integral part of the process of anesthesia. The difficulty of this process effects morbidity and mortality rates. In order to achieve further success in these patients, it is advised to use video laryngoscope. Case Presentation: The patient was a 45-year-old female, who was a candidate for cholecystectomy along with laparoscopic surgery, and had referred to Peimaniyeh hospital of Jahrom, Iran, during September 2016. In the initial assessment, the patient seemed to be in a difficult airway class, while in her surgery documents from 5 and 10 years ago and in her previous records no history of this problem was mentioned. After the administration of drugs before surgery and anesthesia induction, tracheal intubation had failed by use of routine laryngoscope and McCoy laryngoscope in two stages. Finally, the use of video laryngoscope for tracheal intubation was successful. During the intubation attempts, the patient was ventilated with 100% oxygen mask and her arterial blood oxygen saturation had not decreased. Conclusions: Therefore, it is recommended for the patient to be investigated carefully in terms of airway management. In addition, in case of difficult intubation, selecting video laryngoscope to facilitate intubation may be appropriate. The mere absence of a difficult airway management is not a reason that the problem will not occur in the future.","General Anesthesia; Airway Management; Intubation; Video Laryngoscope; Macintosh; McCoy Laryngoscope; TRACHEAL INTUBATION; METAANALYSIS; PREDICT; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Abbasijahromi A and Jahromi MS and Farzaneh M and Javadpour S and Montaseri MA and Kalani N,,,0,1119
1327,Development and Feasibility Testing of Internet-Delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Severe Health Anxiety: Pilot Study,"Background: Severe health anxiety (hypochondriasis), or illness anxiety disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, is characterized by preoccupation with fear of suffering from a serious illness in spite of medical reassurance. It is a debilitating, prevalent disorder associated with increased health care utilization. Still, there is a lack of easily accessible specialized treatment for severe health anxiety. Objective: The aims of this paper were to (1) describe the development and setup of a new internet-delivered acceptance and commitment therapy (iACT) program for patients with severe health anxiety using self-referral and a video-based assessment; and (2) examine the feasibility and potential clinical efficacy of iACT for severe health anxiety. Methods: Self-referred patients (N=15) with severe health anxiety were diagnostically assessed by a video-based interview. They received 7 sessions of clinician-supported iACT comprising self-help texts, video clips, audio files, and worksheets over 12 weeks. Self-report questionnaires were obtained at baseline, post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was Whiteley-7 Index (WI-7) measuring health anxiety severity. Depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), life satisfaction, and psychological flexibility were also assessed. A within-group design was employed. Means, standard deviations, and effect sizes using the standardized response mean (SRM) were estimated. Post-treatment interviews were conducted to evaluate the patient experience of the usability and acceptability of the treatment setup and program. Results: The self-referral and video-based assessments were well received. Most patients (12/15, 80%) completed the treatment, and only 1 (1/15, 7%) dropped out. Post-treatment (14/15, 93%) and 3-month follow-up (12/15, 80%) data were available for almost all patients. Paired t tests showed significant improvements on all outcome measures both at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up, except on one physical component subscale of HRQoL. Health anxiety symptoms decreased with 33.9 points at 3-month follow-up (95% CI 13.6-54.3, t(11)=3.66, P=.004) with a large within-group effect size of 1.06 as measured by the SRM. Conclusions: Treatment adherence and potential efficacy suggest that iACT may be a feasible treatment for health anxiety. The uncontrolled design and small sample size of the study limited the robustness of the findings. Therefore, the findings should be replicated in a randomized controlled trial. Potentially, iACT may increase availability and accessibility of specialized treatment for health anxiety.",health anxiety; illness anxiety disorder; hypochondriasis; internet intervention; feasibility; acceptance and commitment therapy; behavior therapy; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR THERAPY; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; PRIMARY-CARE; HYPOCHONDRIASIS; DISORDER; INTERVENTIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SOMATIZATION; METAANALYSIS; PREVALENCE; Psychiatry; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Hoffmann D and Rask CU and Hedman-Lagerloef E and Ljotsson B and Frostholm L,,,0,1120
1328,Video game training enhances cognition of older adults: a meta-analytic study,"It has been suggested that video game training enhances cognitive functions in young and older adults. However, effects across studies are mixed. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the hypothesis that training healthy older adults with video games enhances their cognitive functioning. The studies included in the meta-analysis were video game training interventions with pre- and posttraining measures. Twenty experimental studies published between 1986 and 2013, involving 474 trained and 439 healthy older controls, met the inclusion criteria. The results indicate that video game training produces positive effects on several cognitive functions, including reaction time (RT), attention, memory, and global cognition. The heterogeneity test did not show a significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 20.69%) but this did not preclude a further examination of moderator variables. The magnitude of this effect was moderated by methodological and personal factors, including the age of the trainees and the duration of the intervention. The findings suggest that cognitive and neural plasticity is maintained to a certain extent in old age. Training older adults with video games enhances several aspects of cognition and might be a valuable intervention for cognitive enhancement.","aging; meta-analysis; cognitive functions; moderating factors; video game training; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Cognition; Humans; Memory; Middle Aged; Reaction Time; Video Games; Aging; Cognitive Ability; Computer Games; Training; Cognition; Video Meta Results Raw",Toril P and Reales JM and Ballesteros S,,,0,1121
1329,Light Alcohol Consumption Does Not Protect Cognitive Function: A Longitudinal Prospective Study,"Studies show that light to moderate alcohol consumption is related to better health and higher cognitive performance. However, it has been suggested that this association is caused by a systematic bias in the control group as many people abstain from drinking or quit because of health issues. Therefore, the group of non-drinkers is biased towards poor health and may not be suitable as a control group. The present study examined the effect of alcohol on cognitive performance while addressing this bias by excluding the non-drinkers. Thus, instead of comparing different levels of alcohol consumption to a non-drinking control group, a dose-response association was calculated between all levels of alcohol intake and cognitive performance. The study used information from a sample of people in the Swedish Twin Registry, who in their midlife (1967) participated in a survey on alcohol intake and 25 years later participated in a longitudinal study on cognitive aging (N = 486). The cognitive aging study took place on five occasions, at 2-year intervals, and included the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), tests of episodic memory, semantic memory and spatial ability. The association between midlife alcohol consumption and later cognitive performance was analyzed using growth curve models, adjusting for background variables. The findings showed that there was a significant negative dose-response association between alcohol intake in midlife and the MMSE, and the tests of episodic memory, such that higher intake in midlife was related to lower performance in old age. The associations between alcohol and semantic memory, and spatial ability respectively, were not significant. In contrast to findings from other studies, which show that low to moderate alcohol intake promotes cognitive function, the current study showed that alcohol intake was related to lower cognitive performance in a dose-response manner, even at low levels. The results from this study indicate that the observed benefits of moderate alcohol intake for cognitive function reported by others might be solely due to comparisons to an inappropriate control group, a group that is biased towards poor health. Hence, it is concluded that light alcohol intake may not protect cognitive function.",cognitive aging; memory; alcohol consumption; abstainer bias; longitudinal study; REDUCED MORTALITY RISK; SWEDISH TWIN REGISTRY; SYSTEMATIC-ERROR; DEMENTIA; DECLINE; DRINKING; MEN; METAANALYSIS; IMPAIRMENT; MEMORY; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Neurosciences; Geriatrics & Gerontology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Video Meta Results Raw,Hassing LB,,,0,1122

1331,New endoscopic platform for endoluminal en bloc tissue resection in the gastrointestinal tract (with videos),"Endoscopic removal of gastrointestinal tract lesions is increasingly popular around the world. We evaluated feasibility, safety, effectiveness, and user learning curve of new endoscopic platform for complex intraluminal interventions. A novel system, consisting of expandable working chamber with two independent instrument guides (LIG), was inserted into colon. Simulated colonic lesions were removed with endoscopic submucosal (ESD) and submuscular (ESmD) dissection. In all nine in vivo models, an intraluminal chamber and its dynamic tissue retractors (via LIG) provided a stable working space with excellent visualization and adequate access to target tissue. Endoscopic platform facilitated successful completion of 11 en bloc ESDs (mean size 43.0 +/- A 11.3 mm, mean time 46.3 +/- A 41.2 min) and eight ESmD (mean size 50.0 +/- A 14.1 mm, mean time 48.0 +/- A 21.2 min). The learning curve for ESD using this platform demonstrated three phases: rapid improvement in procedural skills took place during the first three procedures (mean ESD time 98.7 +/- A 40.0 min). A plateau phase then occurred (procedures 4-7) with mean procedure time 42.0 +/- A 13.4 min (p = 0.04), followed by another sharp improvement in procedural skills (procedures 8-11) requiring only 16.3 +/- A 11.4 min (p = 0.03) to complete ESD. Especially dramatic (p = 0.002) was the time difference between the first three procedures (mean time 98.7 +/- A 40.0 min) and subsequent eight procedures (mean time 29.1 +/- A 17.9 min). A newly developed endoscopic platform provides stable intraluminal working space, dynamic tissue retraction, and instrument triangulation, improving visualization and access to the target tissue for safer and more effective en bloc endoscopic submucosal and submuscular dissection. The learning curve for ESD was markedly facilitated by this new endoscopic platform.",Video Meta Results Raw,Kantsevoy SV and Bitner M and Piskun G,,,0,1124
1332,Parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disability (Review),"Background Research suggests that the number of intellectually disabled people with children is increasing. Intellectual disabilities do not inevitably cause parenting difficulties, but it may impact on an individual's capacity to parent a child effectively. Children of parents with intellectual disabilities may be at increased risk of neglectful care, which could lead to health, developmental and behavioural problems, or increased risk of intellectual disability. Compared with other parents, those with intellectual disabilities are more likely to be involved in care proceedings. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities designed to support parenting, parent-child relations, safe parenting or family environments, or to develop parenting skills. Search methods In July 2017, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and six other databases as well as two trials registers. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field to identify additional ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities with treatment as usual or a control group. Data collection and analysis We used standardised Cochrane methods. Main results As of July 2017, we identified four trials with 192 participants that met the review inclusion criteria. Participating parents were mostly mothers (seven fathers were included in two studies), and children's ages ranged from one month to six years and five months. One study was conducted in Australia, one in Canada, one in the Netherlands, and one in the USA. Each studied a different intervention and considered different outcomes. Three interventions were delivered at home, and one in a community venue (e.g. a church). Interventions varied in duration from seven weeks to 12 months. They included a range of practical childcare skills, home safety and developing parents' ability to respond sensitively to their children. Parents in the comparison groups included in the review received treatment as usual and most of these received the index intervention after the study was complete. One study was funded by the Ontario Mental Health Foundation and the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services Research Grants Program; one by the Alabama Development Disabilities Council; one by the Best Practice Parenting Education Initiative of the Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services and the New South Wales Aging and Disability Department; and one by ZonMw, The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. It was not possible for us to conduct a meta-analysis. The GRADE quality assessment varied from very low to moderate across the studies. Primary outcomes No study reported on the 'attainment of specific parenting skill targets'. 'Safe home practices' and 'understanding of child health': one study (30 parents, very low-quality evidence) reported some improvements in parents' knowledge of life-threatening emergencies, ability to recognise dangers, and identify precautions, in favour of the intervention group. It also found limited, very low-quality evidence that parent training improved parents' ability to understand child health, implement precautions, use medicines safely, recognise child illness and symptoms, and seek medical advice (i.e. visit the doctor). Another study (22 mothers, very low-quality evidence) reported improved attainment of skills related to childcare and safety, in favour of the intervention group. Secondary outcomes 'Parent-child interaction': one study (40 mothers, very low-quality evidence) reported improved maternal-child interaction following parent training at 12 months follow-up. Another study (83 mothers, 2 fathers, moderate-quality evidence) reported that inclusion in the intervention group led to a steeper decline in parenting stress related to the child compared to the control group. 'Parents' retention of child': one study (22 participants; very low-quality evidence) reported that before joining the programme nine of 11 (82%) families with a previous child had had the child removed from their care by child protection authorities due to maternal maltreatment, compared with only four of 22 (19%) families after participating in the programme (only one of these four mothers had also had a previous child removed). No study reported data on: 'return to independent care of child' or 'lifting of child-related court order'. Authors' conclusions There is some very low-quality evidence that some parents, mainly mothers, with intellectual disabilities are able to provide adequate parenting if they are given appropriate training and support to learn the parenting skills they need. However, there are few studies exploring how interventions might work, for whom and in what circumstances. In particular, there have been few studies that include fathers with intellectual disabilities, or that explore the views of parents themselves. There is a need for larger RCTs of parenting interventions, with longer follow-up, before conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of parent training for this group of parents.","*Child Rearing; *Mentally Disabled Persons; *Parenting; Child of Impaired Parents; Fathers [*education]; Mother-Child Relations; Mothers [*education]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Safety; Child; Child; Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; VIDEO-FEEDBACK INTERVENTION; CHILD-CARE SKILLS; SENSITIVE DISCIPLINE; MENTAL-RETARDATION; EDUCATION PROJECT; DECISION-MAKING; HOME INVENTORY; SOCIAL SUPPORT; MOTHERS; PROGRAM; Medicine, General & Internal; General & Internal Medicine; Video Meta Results Raw",Coren E and Ramsbotham K and Gschwandtner M,,,0,1125
1333,Kirkpatrick's Evaluation of Simulation and Debriefing in Health Care Education: A Systematic Review,"Background: Simulation is an integral component of health care education. Research suggests a positive relationship between simulation and learning outcomes. Kirkpatrick's framework is a four-level model based on the premise that learning resulting from training programs can be classified into four levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and results. Evaluation of educational impact provides valuable feedback to educators that may assist with development and improvement of teaching methods. Method: This review is based on the PRISMA guidelines for conducting a systematic review. Inclusion criteria included articles (a) written in the English language, (b) published between 2000 and 2016, (c) describing a debriefing intervention after high-fidelity patient simulation, and (d) based in health care. Results: Thirteen studies met criteria for inclusion in the review. Conclusion: Results indicated a paucity of studies at the highest levels of evaluation, indicating an area where future research is needed to assist with the development and improvement of simulation education.",INTERPROFESSIONAL EDUCATION; SELF-CONFIDENCE; VIDEO; SATISFACTION; MANAGEMENT; STUDENTS; Nursing; Nursing; Video Meta Results Raw,Johnston S and Coyer FM and Nash R,,,0,1126
1334,Testing Two Types of Self-Help CBT-I for Insomnia in Older Adults With Arthritis or Coronary Artery Disease,"Objective: The present study tested two methods of self-help cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) for 106 older adults (mean age = 68) with osteoarthritis = 33) or coronary artery disease in = 33) or no significant medical condition (n = 40). The latter was employed as a comparison group to test the differential efficacy between primary and comorbid insomnia. Method: Self-help CBT-I has demonstrated efficacy in previous studies, so two treatments were compared rather than employing a no treatment control group. Participants were randomly assigned to a book version or an enhanced multimedia version of CBT-I. Results: Both versions of CBT-I demonstrated efficacy in improving all measures of sleep at posttreatment, using intent-to-treat analyses. These sleep improvements were maintained among 86 treatment completers who participated in I-year follow-up assessment. There were no significant differences in treatment response between primary (no medical condition) and comorbid insomnia participants and no significant differences between the two types of self-help according to sleep log measure. However, multimedia participants compared to book participants showed more improvement on three global sleep measures administered at posttreatment only. Conclusions: Although outcomes were attenuated relative to those obtained in therapist led intervention studies, the results suggest that self-help CBT-I has good potential to serve as a first-line, cost-effective treatment for both primary and comorbid insomnia in older adults.",Video Meta Results Raw,Rybarczyk B and Mack L and Harris JH and Stepanski E,,,0,1127
1336,Action Video Game Training for Healthy Adults: A Meta-Analytic Study,"Action video game (AVG) has attracted increasing attention from both the public and from researchers. More and more studies found video game training improved a variety of cognitive functions. However, it remains controversial whether healthy adults can benefit from AVG training, and whether young and older adults benefit similarly from AVG training. In the present study, we aimed to quantitatively assess the AVG training effect on the cognitive ability of adults and to compare the training effects on young and older adults by conducting a meta-analysis on previous findings. We systematically searched video game training studies published between January 1986 and July 2015. Twenty studies were included in the present meta-analysis, for a total of 313 participants included in the training group and 323 participants in the control group. The results demonstrate that healthy adults achieve moderate benefit from AVG training in overall cognitive ability and moderate to small benefit in specific cognitive domains. In contrast, young adults gain more benefits from AVG training than older adults in both overall cognition and specific cognitive domains. Age, education, and some methodological factors, such as the session duration, session number, total training duration, and control group type, modulated the training effects. These meta-analytic findings provide evidence that AVG training may serve as an efficient way to improve the cognitive performance of healthy adults. We also discussed several directions for future AVG training studies.",action video game training; healthy adults; meta-analysis; cognitive functions; moderator variable; Cognitive Ability; Cognitive Processes; Computer Games; Training; Video Meta Results Raw,Wang P and Liu HH and Zhu XT and Meng T and Li HJ and Zuo XN,,,0,1128
1337,Ultrasound scalpel in thyroidectomy. Prospective randomized study,"OBJECTIVE: The ultrasonic scalpel is a surgical shear that uses high-frequency mechanical energy to enable simultaneous vessel sealing and tissue coagulation at the same time. We conducted a prospective randomized study to compare the outcome of total thyroidectomy using the ultrasonic scalpel versus standard clamp and tie (CT) procedure in terms of safety, operative time, overall drainage volume, complications, hospital stay. METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2010, 200 patients (130 women, 70 men; mean age 4 6 years) undergoing thyroidectomy were randomized into two groups: group A, where CT technique were used, and group B, where the ultrasonic device was used. RESULTS: There was no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, gender, indication for thyroidectomy, thyroid gland weight and diameter, histopathologic diagnosis, preoperative and postoperative serum calcium levels, postoperative complications and reoperative thyroid surgery. In group B there is a statistically significant reduction of the operative times (63 +/- 9' vs 85 +/- 15', P<0.001) and overall drainage volume (50 +/- 20cc vs 70 +/- 25cc, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The ultrasonic scalpel is safe, effective, useful, and time-saving alternative to the traditional suture ligation technique for thyroid surgery. They simplified total thyroidectomy, eliminating the need for clamp-and-tie maneuvers while achieving efficient hemostasis. Our study shows that the use of ultrasound in thyroid surgery reduces significantly surgical time and overall drainage volume. Furthermore, we also verified a decrease in hospitalization time, postoperative pain and blood loss, without increasing complication rates, for patients who underwent total thyroidectomy with the ultrasonically activated shear.",Video Meta Results Raw,Docimo G and Ruggiero R and Gubitosi A and Casalino G and Bosco A and Gili S and Conzo G and Docimo L,,,0,1129
1338,Practical Aspects of Neuroendoscopic Techniques and Complication Avoidance: A Systematic Review,"Although endoscopic techniques have many advantages including improved visualization and magnification, they are also associated with limitations. The objective of this review is to discuss the practical aspects that can reduce complications after endoscopic procedures, and their management. The review is based on the personal experience of more than 2000 neuroendoscopic procedures performed by the senior author. Topic search was made on PubMed using Neuroendoscopy, complications and neuroendoscopy, complication avoidance and neuroendoscopy, endoscopic neurosurgery, and minimally invasive neurosurgery. Relevant articles were selected after analyzing abstracts and/or topics. Endoscopic procedures are also associated with limitations such as obstruction in instruments manipulation, steep learning curve, blind area, difficulty in visualization, disorientation, loss of stereoscopic image and others. Neuroendoscopy is distinct from microsurgery and the surgeon has to learn endoscopic skills in addition to microsurgical techniques. Difficulties in controlling bleeding, working in a limited area, higher complication rate during the initial learning curve and longer operative time are some of the limitations. Attending live workshops, practicing on models, and hands on cadaveric workshops can reduce the learning curve. Proper case selection, multidisciplinary team approach, watching operative video, visiting other departments, observing a skillful endoscopic surgeon, lab training, and simulators can improve results and shorten the learning curve. Limitations of this review are that the search is limited to the English literature and personal experience of a single surgeon that may create some bias. Although neuroendoscopic techniques are associated with improved results in some indications, they have many limitations. Neuroendoscopic skills need to be learned to improve results.",Complication; Endoscopic surgical procedure; Minimal invasive procedure; Neuroendoscopy; Training program; ENDOSCOPIC 3RD VENTRICULOSTOMY; VASCULAR DECOMPRESSION; DISC DISEASE; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; NEUROSURGERY; MENINGIOMAS; EXPERIENCE; CHILDREN; HEMATOMA; Clinical Neurology; Surgery; Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,Yadav YR and Bajaj J and Parihar V and Ratre S and Pateriya A,,,0,1130
1340,Area-dependent time courses of brain activation during video-induced symptom provocation in social anxiety disorder,"Background: Previous functional imaging studies using symptom provocation in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) reported inconsistent findings, which might be at least partially related to different time-dependent activation profiles in different brain areas. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we used a novel video-based symptom provocation design in order to investigate the magnitude and time course of activation in different brain areas in 20 SAD patients and 20 healthy controls. Results: The disorder-related videos induced increased anxiety in patients with SAD as compared to healthy controls. Analyses of brain activation to disorder-related versus neutral video clips revealed amygdala activation during the first but not during the second half of the clips in patients as compared to controls. In contrast, the activation in the insula showed a reversed pattern with increased activation during the second but not during the first half of the video clips. Furthermore, a cluster in the anterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex showed a sustained response for the entire duration of the videos. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that different regions of the fear network show differential temporal response patterns during video-induced symptom provocation in SAD. While the amygdala is involved during initial threat processing, the insula seems to be more involved during subsequent anxiety responses. In accordance with cognitive models of SAD, a medial prefrontal region engaged in emotional-cognitive interactions is generally hyperactivated.",Video Meta Results Raw,Boehme S and Mohr A and Becker MP and Miltner WH and Straube T,,,0,1131
1341,A systematic review of serious games in asthma education,"BACKGROUND: Serious games may be useful tools for asthma education. The objectives of this systematic review were to identify the available articles on serious games designed to educate patients and the general public about asthma and to assess their impact on patient's knowledge, behavior, and clinical outcomes related to asthma. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsychInfo, and Web of Science were systematically searched from January 1980 to December 2015 for studies investigating serious games in asthma education. Two investigators independently assessed studies against inclusion criteria and rated those included on indicators of quality. Investigators extracted data on serious games' content and learning objectives, and on outcomes following Kirkpatrick classification. RESULTS: A total of 12 articles were found to be relevant, describing a total of 10 serious games. All serious games were directed toward children, with eight games for children with asthma and two for school-based intervention. The average Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument score was 13.9 of 18, which is high. Most of the serious games were associated with high rates of satisfaction and improvement in children's knowledge. Seven studies evaluated the impact of serious games on clinical outcomes and found no significant difference relative to control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although serious games designed for asthma education have evolved with advances in technology, results of their evaluation remained similar across studies, with clear improvements in knowledge but little or no change in behaviors and clinical outcomes.",asthma; health education; patient education; pediatrics; video game; SELF-MANAGEMENT; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; DIGITAL GAMES; VIDEO GAMES; HEALTH; COMPUTER; CHILDREN; PROGRAM; METAANALYSIS; Allergy; Immunology; Pediatrics; Allergy; Immunology; Pediatrics; Video Meta Results Raw,Drummond D and Monnier D and Tesnière A and Hadchouel A,,,0,1132
1342,Video Games for Well-Being: A Systematic Review on the Application of Computer Games for Cognitive and Emotional Training in the Adult Population,"Background: Although several excellent reviews and meta-analyses have investigated the effect of video game trainings as tools to enhance well-being, most of them specifically focused on the effects of digital games on brain plasticity or cognitive decline in children and seniors. On the contrary, only one meta-analysis results to be focused on the adult population, and it is restricted to examining the effects of training with a particular genre of games (action video games) on cognitive skills of healthy adults. Objectives: This systematic review was aimed to identify research evidences about the impact on cognitive [i.e., processing and reaction times (RTs), memory, task-switching/multitasking, and mental spatial rotation] and emotional skills of video games training in the healthy adult population. Methods: A multi-component analysis of variables related to the study, the video games, and the outcomes of the training was made on the basis of important previous works. Databases used in the search were PsycINFO, Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), PubMed, and Scopus. The search string was: [(\Video Games\' OR \'Computer Games\' OR \'Interactive Gaming\')] AND [(\'Cognition\') OR (\'Cognitive\') OR (\'Emotion\') OR (\'Emotion Regulation\')] AND [\'Training\']. Results: Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and were further classified into the different analysis' variables.

1344,Localization of Wireless Capsule Endoscope: A Systematic Review,"Wireless capsule endoscope (WCE) is a notable invention introduced in the biomedical industry. It involves swallowing a small disposable video capsule that takes photographic images as it passes through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. WCE allows physicians to visualize and diagnose disorders covering the full length of the GI tract. Although WCE can provide useful images of the internal GI tract, the identification of the exact location of the detected disease remains unclear. Location information is very crucial for the subsequent treatment of the detected disease either through surgery or through local drug delivery. The huge potential of WCE in future endoscopic practice relies on the successful tracking of the wireless capsule. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review on the recent developments in WCE localization techniques that have been reported in credible sources, namely, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Springer Link, and Google Scholar. Detailed analysis and systematic comparison are provided to highlight the achievement and future direction of WCE localization.

1345,Stein’s double cross-lip flaps combined with Johanson’s step technique for subtotal lower lip reconstruction,"Background: In a previous study, a single cross-lip flap (Abbe flap) combined with Johanson’s step technique for repair of defects of more than 2/3 of the lower lip was superior, in terms of aesthetic and functional outcome, compared with Bernard Webster–related techniques (cheek advancement). Herewith, a double cross-lip flap (Stein procedure) is proposed for repair of subtotal lower lip defects. A systematic review of the Stein procedure is provided. Methods: Two patients underwent a paramedian double cross-lip flap, preserving the aesthetic subunit philtrum column combined with the Johanson’s step technique. The aesthetic and functional outcomes and the surgical steps are demonstrated in the videos. An electromyographic study was performed 6 months and 4 years after surgery. A PubMed and a Google Scholar search were performed for the Stein procedure published in 1848. Results: Lip competence was achieved directly after sectioning of the cross-lip pedicles in both patients. Lips progressivity expanded in the first 6 months. No microstomia was observed. Electromyography showed successful reinnervation of the transplanted muscles at 6 months. Four years after surgery, the electromyographic findings were consolidated. Since 1975, 7 articles on the double cross-lip procedure have been published: 4 in English, 1 in French, and 2 in Japanese. None of those articles reported on any supplemental lower lip advancement or on any electromyographic study. Conclusions: The rationale of using 2 cross-lip flaps and a lip-cheek advancement according to Johanson seems to achieve functionally and aesthetically superior results compared with other techniques described for subtotal lower lip reconstruction.

1346,Implementing Cognitive Training Into a Surgical Skill Course: A Pilot Study on Laparoscopic Suturing and Knot Tying,"Mini-invasive surgery-for example, laparoscopy-has challenged surgeons' skills by extending their usual haptic space and displaying indirect visual feedback through a screen. This may require new mental abilities, including spatial orientation and mental representation. This study aimed to test the effect of cognitive training based on motor imagery (MI) and action observation (AO) on surgical skills. A total of 28 postgraduate residents in surgery took part in our study and were randomly distributed into 1 of the 3 following groups: (1) the basic surgical skill, which is a short 2-day laparoscopic course + MI + AO group; (2) the basic surgical skill group; and (3) the control group. The MI + AO group underwent additional cognitive training, whereas the basic surgical skill group performed neutral activity during the same time. The laparoscopic suturing and knot tying performance as well as spatial ability and mental workload were assessed before and after the training period. We did not observe an effect of cognitive training on the laparoscopic performance. However, the basic surgical skill group significantly improved spatial orientation performance and rated lower mental workload, whereas the 2 others exhibited lower performance in a mental rotation test. Thus, actual and cognitive training pooled together during a short training period elicited too high a strain, thus limiting potential improvements. Because MI and AO already showed positive outcomes on surgical skills, this issue may, thus, be mitigated according to our specific learning conditions. Distributed learning may possibly better divide and share the strain associated with new surgical skills learning.",motor imagery; observation; minimally invasive surgery; learning; mental workload; VISUAL-SPATIAL ABILITY; MOTOR IMAGERY; MENTAL PRACTICE; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; NASA-TLX; METAANALYSIS; MAINTENANCE; ACQUISITION; PERFORMANCE; WORKLOAD; Surgery; Surgery; Video Meta Results Raw,De Witte B and Di Rienzo F and Martin X and Ye Haixia and Collet C and Hoyek N,,,0,1136
1347,Sex differences in fluid intelligence: Some findings from Bosnia and Herzegovina,"This study has been conducted with the aim of analyzing sex differences in fluid intelligence of schoolchildren of different ages. Three samples of schoolchildren participated in this study. Fluid intelligence was measured by Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM), Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices Plus (SPM Plus), Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), Culture fair intelligence test, Scale II, (CFIT), D-70 and Problem solving test, (PT). Results obtained in our study indicate that at ages of 12.6 and 16 effect sizes of sex difference in performance on tests of fluid intelligence were small. At age of 17.2 boys scored almost one standard deviation higher than girls. Gender stratification could have led to different experience of boys and girls, which, in turn, could have caused investment of cognitive resources in different domains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

1348,The Effect of Age on Teachers' Intention to Use Educational Video Games: A TAM Approach,"Educational video games (EVGs) are gaining momentum as a means of increasing students' motivation in their learning process. Nevertheless, teachers might face several barriers that dissuade them from using educational video games in their courses. This study analyses factors affecting teachers' behavioural intention to use educational video games in their courses using a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach. The research model is tested via structural equation modelling (SEM) on a sample of 312 teachers in Higher Education institutions. Results suggest that perceived usefulness influences in a direct and positive way teachers' intention to use educational video games. Results also suggest that perceived ease of use indirectly influence intentions through perceived usefulness. Age was found to moderate the effect of teachers' perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness of EVGs. Regarding managerial implications, our findings highlight the importance of addressing specific Teacher Training Programmes focusing on teachers' age and perceived usefulness of EVGs in order to encourage teachers to adopting this educational innovation in their courses. Limitations of the study and future research lines are also addressed.",Educational Video Games; TAM (Technology Acceptance Model); Higher Education; Behavioural intention; Age; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY USAGE; SERIOUS GAMES; ACCEPTANCE MODEL; SECONDARY-SCHOOL; COMPUTER GAMES; ATTITUDE; GAMIFICATION; INTERNET; BEHAVIOR; METAANALYSIS; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw,Sanchez-Mena A and Marti-Parreno J and Aldas-Manzano J,,,0,1138
1349,The effect of interactive cognitive-motor training in reducing fall risk in older people: a systematic review,"Background: It is well-known physical exercise programs can reduce falls in older people. Recently, several studies have evaluated interactive cognitive-motor training that combines cognitive and gross motor physical exercise components. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effects of these interactive cognitive-motor interventions on fall risk in older people. Methods: Studies were identified with searches of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases from their inception up to 31 December 2013. Criteria for inclusion were a) at least one treatment arm that contained an interactive cognitive-motor intervention component; b) a minimum age of 60 or a mean age of 65 years; c) reported falls or at least one physical, psychological or cognitive fall risk factor as an outcome measure; d) published in Dutch, English or German. Single case studies and robot-assisted training interventions were excluded. Due to the diversity of populations included, outcome measures and heterogeneity in study designs, no meta-analyses were conducted. Results: Thirty-seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Reporting and methodological quality were often poor and sample sizes were mostly small. One pilot study found balance board training reduced falls and most studies reported training improved physical (e.g. balance and strength) and cognitive (e.g. attention, executive function) measures. Inconsistent results were found for psychological measures related to falls-efficacy. Very few between-group differences were evident when interactive cognitive-motor interventions were compared to traditional training programs. Conclusions: The review findings provide preliminary evidence that interactive cognitive-motor interventions can improve physical and cognitive fall risk factors in older people, but that the effect of such interventions on falls has not been definitively demonstrated. Interactive cognitive-motor interventions appear to be of equivalent efficacy in ameliorating fall risk as traditional training programs. However, as most studies have methodological limitations, larger, high-quality trials are needed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Schoene D and Valenzuela T and Lord SR and de Bruin ED,,,0,1139
1350,Computer treatment for common mental health problems,"Perhaps the most complex and controversial role for the computer in clinical practice is as a treatment medium in which the computer effectively replaces the psychotherapist. This article outlines the historical development of computer treatment, from dialogue generators in the 1960s through to the interactive, multimedia programs of the 2000s. In evaluating the most recent developments in computer treatment, we present a small meta-analytic study demonstrating large effect sizes in favor of computer treatments for anxiety and depression for pre/post outcomes and treatment as usual/waitlist comparators. Next, we review studies of the cost effectiveness of computer treatments. Finally, we outline the implications for research, policy, and practice of this new generation of treatment options.

1351,Effectiveness of Computer-Assisted Instruction in Statistics: A Meta-Analysis,"Although previous meta-analyses have documented the efficacy of computer-assisted statistics instruction, the current study examined a range of specific features that presumably influence its effectiveness, such as the level of learner engagement, learner control, and the nature of feedback. In 45 experimental studies with a control condition, computer-assisted statistics instruction provided a meaningful average performance advantage (d = 0.33). Because of great methodological heterogeneity among the studies, the authors employed a conservative but appropriate mixed effects model to examine potential moderator effects. The authors' analyses revealed three statistically significant findings. Larger effects were reported in studies in which treatment groups received more instructional time than control groups, in studies that recruited graduate students as participants, and in studies employing an embedded assessment. A newly developed second order standardized mean effect size, d(diff), reveals that additional study characteristics may serve as meaningful moderators. Tight experimental control is needed to assess the importance of specific instructional features in computer-assisted statistics instruction.",Video Meta Results Raw,Sosa GW and Berger DE and Saw AT and Mary JC,,,0,1141
1352,Toward a set of design principles for mathematics flipped classrooms: A synthesis of research in mathematics education,"This paper analyzed the journal publications of mathematics flipped classroom studies in K-12 and higher education contexts. We focused specifically on a set of flipped classroom studies in which pre-class instructional videos were provided prior to face-to-face class meetings. We examined the following four major issues: (a) the types of out-of-class and in-class instructional activities used, (b) the effect of flipped learning on student achievement, (c) the participant perceptions of flipped classroom benefits, and (d) the main challenges of flipped classroom implementations. A meta-analysis of 21 comparison studies showed an overall significant effect in favor of the flipped classroom over the traditional classroom for mathematics education (Hedges’ g = 0.298, 95% CI [0.16, 0.44]), with no evidence of publication bias. A broader research synthesis of 61 studies revealed that the flipped classroom approach benefited student learning in three main aspects: increasing in-class time for task/practice, integrating new knowledge with existing beliefs, and real-time feedback. The two most frequently reported flipped classroom challenges were students’ unfamiliarity with flipped learning and significant start-up effort on the part of instructors. We hence propose a set of design principles to help foster the transition to the flipped classroom and improve the out-of-class and in-class learning designs. This set of design principles can also provide a more focused agenda for future research to examine the effect of the flipped classroom approach on student learning and motivation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Flipped classroom; Inverted classroom; Mathematics education; Statistics education; Teaching approach; LINEAR ALGEBRA COURSE; STUDENT PERFORMANCE; LEARNING-PERFORMANCE; CALCULUS CLASSROOM; NURSING-EDUCATION; INSTRUCTION; METAANALYSIS; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCE; Education & Educational Research; Education & Educational Research; Video Meta Results Raw; Unsorted,Lo CK and Hew KF and Chen G,,,0,1142
1353,Pilot trial of home-administered transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of depression,"Background: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, neuromodulation approach with promising efficacy for treating depression. To date, tDCS has been limited to clinical or research centre settings with treatment administered by staff. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy, tolerability and feasibility of home-administered, remotely-supervised tDCS for depression. Methods: In an open label trial, 34 participants used a Soterix 1 x 1 mini-CT device to self-administer 20-28 tDCS sessions (2 mA, 30 min, F3-anode and F8-cathode montage according to 10-20 EEG placement) over 4 weeks followed by a taper phase of 4 sessions 1 week apart. Participants were initially monitored via video link and then through completion of an online treatment diary. Mixed effects repeated measures analyses assessed change in mood scores. Results: Mood improved significantly from baseline (27.47 on Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) to 1 month after the end of acute treatment (15.48) (p < 0.001). Side effects were largely transient and minor. Outcomes were comparable to those reported in clinic-based trials. Protocol adherence was excellent with a drop-out rate of 6% and 93% of scheduled sessions completed. Limitations: The tDCS and remote monitoring procedures employed in this study require a level of manual dexterity and computer literacy, which may be challenging for some patients. This study did not have a control condition. Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence that home-based, remotely-supervised tDCS treatment may be efficacious and feasible for depressed patients and has high translational potential.",Major depressive disorder; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Clinical trial; Safety; Psychiatric somatic therapies; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; ELECTRICAL-CURRENT THERAPY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; MOTOR CORTEX; DOUBLE-BLIND; TDCS; SAFETY; METAANALYSIS; Clinical Neurology; Psychiatry; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry; Video Meta Results Raw,Alonzo A and Fong J and Ball N and Martin D and Chand N and Loo C,,,0,1143
1356,Does teaching with PowerPoint increase students' learning? A meta-analysis,"PowerPoint has become a ubiquitous tool for instructors who teach college students. Almost two decades of student learning research has examined the impact of traditional instruction (i.e., chalk and talk) versus instruction aided by PowerPoint. This research has revealed inconsistent and contrasting results. To probe this inconsistency, a meta-analysis of 48 studies was conducted to determine if students learn more when taught the same material using PowerPoint compared to traditional instruction. Results revealed that on average, there was no difference in students' learning based on the type of instruction they received (Hedges' g = 0.067; 95% CI: −0.103 to 0.236). Moderation analyses revealed that the sampling frame, such as a focus on K-12 versus college students, explained heterogeneity in the findings. Specifically, K-12 students' cognitive learning increased as a result of PowerPoint instruction, but this effect did not emerge for college students. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that researchers should move past strictly comparing the absence or presence of this instructional tool, to instead examine how instructors are integrating features of PowerPoint in ways that help students learn.

1357,THE EFFICACY OF COMPUTER-ASSISTED-INSTRUCTION (CAI) - A METAANALYSIS,"There has been a long-standing dispute about the efficacy of computer assisted instruction (CAI) with regard to the interpretation of effect size estimates in reviews using techniques of meta-analysis. It has been claimed that the data used to calculate these estimates come from studies which are methodologically flawed. The aim of this study was to provide an updated meta-analysis on the learning effect of (CAI) over a broad range of study features with particular attention focused on the effectiveness debate. Using standard procedures, the results and estimates were similar to previous reviews and showed a learning benefit for CAI. The mean effect size for CAI was (.24) for the years 1987-1992, with more recent studies showing an average of (.33). Although moderate, these estimates tended to raise the average student from at least the 50th and 60th percentile. However, studies which controlled for teacher and materials, and were of longer duration, and studies using pencil and paper equivalents of CAI showed no learning advantage over traditional forms of instruction. It is suggested that what accounts for the typical learning advantage of CAI in this meta-analysis and others is the better quality instruction provided by CAI materials. These materials seem versatile enough to be used effectively over a broad range of subjects and educational settings. While the materials did not seem to improve substantially over the past two decades as reflected by effect sizes, these estimates did not include the newer multimedia technology. It is concluded that educational approaches should be judged by a number of criteria including achievement gains and when this is done CAI may far surpass other forms of instruction.",Video Meta Results Raw,Fletcherflinn CM and Gravatt B,,,0,1145
1358,TRAINING SPATIAL SKILLS IN MEN AND WOMEN,"Recent studies suggest that even short-term video game training may transfer to other cognitive tasks. With the popularity of the Nintendo Wii with women, more of them might be exposed to the games that will increase their mental rotation skills. Because performance on mental rotation tests (MRT) has been linked to math performance in women, and thus may ultimately contribute to the under-representation of women in STEM fields, it is important to continue to explore ways to decrease or eliminate the robust sex difference in mental rotation. The present study of 30 men and 30 women provides additional evidence that women may benefit from short-term (1 hour) training on either a Nintendo Wii T or GameCube console to increase their mental rotation skills. One hour of video game training not only increased women's MRT scores to a level similar to men's scores, but also produced greater average improvement for women, even when controlling for experiential factors such as spatial and masculine childhood activities that could contribute to the sex difference in spatial ability.",Video Meta Results Raw,Cherney ID and Bersted K and Smetter J,,,0,1146
1359,Diagnostic Yield of Video Capsule Endoscopy for Small Bowel Bleeding: Eight Consecutive Years of Experience at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System,"Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic yield of video capsule endoscopy (VCE) in patients with small bowel gastrointestinal bleeding and examine the impact of this diagnostic technology on the clinical management of this complaint. Methods: This was a retrospective study in which all patients who underwent VCE (May 7, 2003 - December 31, 2011) were included. Records were reviewed for the type of bleeding (overt vs. occult; when present), demographic data, lab results, and capsule endoscopy findings. Information regarding medical treatment (i.e., endoscopic intervention, surgical therapy, or both) was also recorded. Results: A total of 229 subjects were included in the study. Most were men; the mean age of all the subjects was 69.8 years. Of the 229 VCEs, 154 (67.3%) were done because of occult bleeding and 75 (32%) because of overt bleeding. VCEs were normal in 34 (14.9%) cases and non-diagnostic in 15 (6.6%). Angiodysplasia, erosions, and ulcers were the most common findings (48.5%, 24.5%, and 10.92% respectively). Active bleeding was reported in 7 cases (3%). Nearly 20% of the 229 cases required either endoscopic or surgical intervention. Conclusion: In our study, VCE achieved a diagnostic yield of 78.6%. In 1 of every 5 subjects, video capsule endoscopy led to the identification of small bowel lesions that required either endoscopic or surgical resection, rather than conservative treatment with iron replacement. VCE proved to be a very useful investigative tool, not only for establishing the source of bleeding but also, most importantly, for directing the appropriate therapy for lesions that would otherwise have been missed by conventional studies.",Video Meta Results Raw,Grigg-Gutierrez N and Laboy C and Ramos L and Amaral K and Toro DH,,,0,1147
1360,"A Multimedia Situational Test With a Constructed-Response Format Its Relationship With Personality, Cognitive Ability, Job Experience, and Academic Performance","Advances in computer technology have created opportunities for the development of a multimedia situational test in which responses are filmed with a webcam. This paper examined the relationship of a so-called webcam test with personality, cognitive ability, job experience, and academic performance. Data were collected among 153 psychology students. In line with our expectations, scores on the webcam test, intended to measure interpersonally oriented leadership, were related to extraversion, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and job experience. Furthermore, the webcam tests significantly predicted students' learning activities during group meetings over and above a cognitive ability test and a personality questionnaire. Overall, this study demonstrates that webcam tests can be a valid complement to traditional predictors in selection contexts.",Video Meta Results Raw,Oostrom JK and Born MP and Serlie AW and van der Molen HT,,,0,1148
1362,Game-based e-learning is more effective than a conventional instructional method: a randomized controlled trial with third-year medical students,"BACKGROUND: When compared with more traditional instructional methods, Game-based e-learning (GbEl) promises a higher motivation of learners by presenting contents in an interactive, rule-based and competitive way. Most recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis of studies on Game-based learning and GbEl in the medical professions have shown limited effects of these instructional methods. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness on the learning outcome of a Game-based e-learning (GbEl) instruction with a conventional script-based instruction in the teaching of phase contrast microscopy urinalysis under routine training conditions of undergraduate medical students. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 145 medical students in their third year of training in the Department of Urology at the University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany. 82 subjects where allocated for training with an educational adventure-game (GbEl group) and 69 subjects for conventional training with a written script-based approach (script group). Learning outcome was measured with a 34 item single choice test. Students' attitudes were collected by a questionnaire regarding fun with the training, motivation to continue the training and self-assessment of acquired knowledge. RESULTS: The students in the GbEl group achieved significantly better results in the cognitive knowledge test than the students in the script group: the mean score was 28.6 for the GbEl group and 26.0 for the script group of a total of 34.0 points with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.71 (ITT analysis). Attitudes towards the recent learning experience were significantly more positive with GbEl. Students reported to have more fun while learning with the game when compared to the script-based approach. CONCLUSIONS: Game-based e-learning is more effective than a script-based approach for the training of urinalysis in regard to cognitive learning outcome and has a high positive motivational impact on learning. Game-based e-learning can be used as an effective teaching method for self-instruction.","article,comparative effectiveness,controlled study,human,intermethod comparison,learning style,*medical education,medical student,motivation,outcome assessment,personal experience,phase contrast microscopy,questionnaire,randomized controlled trial,scoring system,self evaluation,*student attitude,student satisfaction,undergraduate student,urinalysis,*conventional instructional method,*game based e learning,EMBASE,All Databases,MEDLINE; Uploaded; Video Meta Results Raw; Videos vs Lectures",Boeker M and Andel P and Vach W and Frankenschmidt A,,,0,1149
1363,Applying the modality principle to real-time feedback and the acquisition of higher-order cognitive skills,"Effectively presenting complex material is a crucial component of instructional design within simulation-based training (SBT) environments. One approach to facilitate the acquisition of higher-order knowledge is to embed instructional strategies within the systems themselves. Currently, however, there are few established guidelines to inform developers how best to implement such strategies. In response, this study aims to explore the presentation of one such strategy-feedback-during SBT of a complex decision-making task. Specifically, this study extends past research on the modality principle of multimedia learning by comparing the use of spoken- versus printed-text real-time feedback in an SBT environment. During two primarily visual training scenarios, participants received spoken-text (Spoken Group), printed-text (Printed Group), or no feedback (Control Group) based on their performance. Results indicated that the Spoken Group demonstrated greater decision-making performance during training and assessment compared to the Printed Group. These findings are consistent with those of past research and suggest that the modality principle can be extended to the presentation of real-time feedback during SBT of higher-order cognitive skills.",Video Meta Results Raw,Fiorella L and Vogel-Walcutt JJ and Schatz S,,,0,1150
1364,EMERGING FOCUS ON FAKE NEWS ISSUES IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: A PRELIMINARY META-ANALYSIS APPROACH,"The Internet medium has dramatically changed the possibilities of information access globally; digitally savvy internet users worldwide continuously rely on arguably one of the biggest inventions for information dissemination in modern history. Moreover, one of the biggest issues of internet information space of the 21st century is actually the information overload as the internet medium keeps growing in information volume at a fascinating blistering pace. Every minute several millions of search queries occur on search engines, several million videos watched on popular video sharing networks, few hundred million emails sent and almost a million US dollars spent online - all in 60 seconds of every hour, all day, every day. However, there are more than a few growing concerns and challenges of the internet medium and one of the most alarming ones is popularly acclaimed as fake news (phenomenon). The term is often defined as the intentional presentation of false or misleading claims in order to manipulate the audience's cognitive processes. It has undoubtedly fanned the flames of scientific curiosity and academic responsibility in many different fields of study worldwide but also raised many concerns of public figures and organizations alike. The paper is based on a topic meta-analysis approach in order to describe the historical academic interest development and current status of scientific studies of the fake news phenomenon in the context of internet misinformation activities. Meta-analysis is based on 393 articles in Clarivate Analytics database (Web of Science) utilizing its categorization and filtering functionality. An overview of academic research is provided with a focus on the scientific field, time scope and country of origin.",internet information space; fake news; misinformation; meta-analysis; MEDIA; Management; Business & Economics; Video Meta Results Raw,Bilos A,,,0,1151
1367,Psychophysiological responses to emotions of others in young children with autism spectrum disorders: Correlates of social functioning,"Studying cognitive and affective mechanisms of social behavior could lead to identifying early indicators of derailing social behavior in young children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The present study combined sensitive and objective techniques, such as eyetracking and psychophysiology, to provide insight into early neurodevelopmental mechanisms that are more difficult to uncover when relying on behavioral measures. Social attention towards faces and changes in affective arousal were investigated together in 28 young children with ASD (42-75 months) and 45 nonclinical controls (41-81 months). Children were shown a social-emotional video clip while eyetracking and heart rate were measured. Children with ASD fixated less on key social-emotional features within the clip as compared to controls, even though both groups attended equally toward the screen. In contrast to the control group, children with ASD did not show an increase or modulation in affective arousal in response to the social-emotional scenes. Severity of ASD symptoms, specifically social problems, was associated with arousal modulation and social attention within the ASD group. Early ASD symptoms are associated with impairments in fundamental building blocks of social behavior as expressed in a lack in spontaneous social attention and affective arousal. Such sensitive and objective measures of underlying mechanisms might serve as indicators for tailored approaches in treatment and may help in evaluating effectiveness of early interventions aimed at positively influencing social development and related quality of life in individuals with ASD.

1368,Gymnasts and Orienteers Display Better Mental Rotation Performance Than Nonathletes,"The aim of this study was to examine whether athletes differ from nonathletes regarding their mental rotation performance. Furthermore, it investigated whether athletes doing sports requiring distinguishable levels of mental rotation (orienteering, gymnastics, running), as well as varying with respect to having an egocentric (gymnastics) or an allocentric perspective (orienteering), differ from each other. Therefore, the Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was carried out with 20 orienteers, 20 gymnasts, 20 runners, and 20 nonathletes. The results indicate large differences in mental rotation performance, with those actively doing sports outperforming the nonathletes. Analyses for the specific groups showed that orienteers and gymnasts differed from the nonathletes, whereas endurance runners did not. Contrary to expectations, the mental rotation performance of gymnasts did not differ from that of orienteers. This study also revealed gender differences in favor of men. Implications regarding a differentiated view of the connection between specific sports and mental rotation performance are discussed.",Video Meta Results Raw,Schmidt M and Egger F and Kieliger M and Rubeli B and Schueler J,,,0,1153
