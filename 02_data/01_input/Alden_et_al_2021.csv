4,"These guidelines for the treatment of patients who have sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were developed by CDC staff members after consultation with a group of invited experts who met in Atlanta on February 10-12, 1997. The in-formation in this report updates the '1993 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines' (MMWR 1993;42[no. RR-14]). Included are new recommendations for treatment of primary and recurrent genital herpes and management of pelvic inflammatory disease; a new patient-applied medication for treatment of genital warts; and a revised approach to the management of victims of sexual assault. Revised sections describe the evaluation of urethritis and the diagnostic evaluation of congenital syphilis. These guidelines also include expanded sections concerning STDs among infants, children, and pregnant women and the management of patients who have asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection, genital warts, and genital herpes. Guidelines are provided for vaccine-preventable STDs, including recommendations for the use of hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines.","(1998).  1998 guidelines for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases MMWR: Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report, 47(2),  1-116",0,,1
20,"During power outages after hurricanes, survivors can be at risk for carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning if they use portable generators improperly. On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike struck the coast of Texas, leaving approximately 2.3 million households in the southeastern portion of the state without electricity. Six days later, 1.3 million homes were still without electrical power. To assess the impact of storm-related CO exposures and to enhance prevention efforts, CDC analyzed data from five disparate surveillance sources on CO exposures reported during September 13--26 in counties of southeast Texas that were declared disaster areas by the federal government. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that one data source, Texas poison centers, received reports of 54 persons with storm-related CO exposures during the surveillance period. Another data source, the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) hyperbaric oxygen treatment database, reported that 15 persons received hyperbaric oxygen treatment for storm-related CO poisoning. Medical examiners, public health officials, and hospitals in Texas reported that seven persons died from storm-related CO poisoning. Among the data sources, the percentage of reported storm-related CO exposures caused by improper generator use ranged from 82% to 87%. These findings underscore the need for effective prevention messages during storm preparation, warnings, and response periods regarding the correct use of generators and the installation and maintenance of battery-powered CO detectors.","(2009).

21,"During a 3-month period in 2008 in Japan, 208 persons committed suicide by mixing household chemicals and, while in a confined space, breathing in the resultant poisonous gas. The large number of similar suicides is believed to have resulted from the posting of directions for generating poisonous gas on the Internet. In addition to claiming the suicide victim, lethal gas generated by intentionally mixing household chemicals can leak from confined spaces, triggering evacuations, and exposing bystanders and first responders to injury. Chemical suicides similar to those in Japan in 2008 have been reported increasingly in the United States, with the majority occurring inside automobiles. To characterize such incidents in the United States, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) analyzed reports of chemical suicides and attempted suicides that occurred in automobiles, using 2006--2009 data from states participating in the Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) system and 2010 data from states participating in the new National Toxic Substance Incidents Program (NTSIP). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which found that, during 2006--2010, a total of 10 chemical suicide incidents were reported from six states, resulting in the deaths of nine suicide victims and injuries to four law enforcement officers. When responding to suspected chemical suicide incidents, emergency responders must take precautions to ensure both their safety and the safety of any bystanders in the immediate vicinity.","(2011).

29,"Objective:To investigate developmental paths in multisite musculoskeletal pain (MPS) and depressive symptoms (DPS) and the effects of job demands (JD), job resources (JR), optimism and health-related lifestyle on these paths. We expected to find four trajectories – Low Symptoms, High Pain, High Depression and High Symptoms – and hypothesised that high JDs, low JRs, low optimism and adverse lifestyle predict belonging to trajectories with high symptom levels. Design:Data on Finnish firefighters (N = 360) were collected in 1996, 1999 and 2009. The effects of JDs (mental and physical workload), JRs (supervisory relations, interpersonal relations, task resources), optimism and lifestyle (alcohol consumption, smoking, physical exercise, sleeping) on MPS and DPS were assessed. Latent class growth modelling and multinomial logistic regression were applied. Results:Three trajectories emerged: Low Symptoms; High Pain; and High Depression. In a multivariable model, high mental workload (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5–5.5), poor interpersonal relations (2.6, 1.4–5.0), sleeping problems (2.7, 1.4–5.2) and low optimism (2.0, 1.0–3.7) predicted belonging to High Depression. Alcohol consumption (2.4, 1.4–4.1) and sleeping problems (2.1, 1.3–3.6) were related to High Pain. Conclusions:Different developmental paths in MPS and DPS are possible.

A multistage random sample was used to recruit nurses and physicians from 57 health centres. A total of 207 participants completed the Arabic version of the Disaster Preparedness Evaluation Tool. Participants perceived themselves as having moderate preparation for disaster management [mean score 74.9 (SD 21.6)], moderate knowledge [mean 49.9 (SD 12.3)] and moderate to weak skills in disaster management [mean 35.3 (SD 12.7)]. Significant differences were revealed in participants' perceptions of their disaster preparedness, knowledge and skills according to their sex, specialty and exposure to a real disaster situation. Further education and training courses are needed to enhance providers' preparedness for disaster management in Jordan.

31,"The Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) model comprises both situational components (i.e. effort and reward) and a person-specific component (overcommitment). The aims of this study were to investigate the role of theoretically and historically linked personality variables (i.e. overcommitment and Type A personality) within the ERI model and to expand and extend the ERI model by investigating the contribution of individual reward components to both psychological (i.e. psychological distress) and attitudinal (i.e. affective commitment) employee strain indicators. A total of 897 police officers from a large Australian police agency participated in the study. The results provided no evidence of an interaction effect of effort or reward with overcommitment. The Type A variables did, however, make significant contributions and were involved in a number of interactions, suggesting that the person-specific component of the ERI model could be extended with the Type A personality profile. The findings also suggest that the esteem component of reward has the greatest relevance to employee outcomes, although tangible aspects of reward are more likely to act as a buffer of perceived work demand.","Amanda Allisey, John Rodwell, Andrew Noblet (2012).

32,"Using data from a randomized trial (N = 329), this study examines which low-income urban crime victims initiate case management and/or trauma-focused psychotherapy offered following emergency medical treatment. More hyperarousal symptoms, fewer avoidance symptoms, and interest in discussing one's injuries predicted case management initiation. Being stably housed, employed, and having fewer avoidance symptoms predicted psychotherapy initiation, while being a weekly drug user was associated with decreased odds of initiating psychotherapy. Results suggest that active outreach to urban crime victims may diminish gender and ethnic disparities typically seen in treatment settings, but that certain subgroups of victims with high service needs may require additional engagement efforts.","J.

Overall, IPV men did not make more errors decoding facial affect slides than did NV men. However, GVA batterers showed deficits while BD batterers were particularly accurate in identifying emotions. Clinical implications are that emotional recognition skills training techniques may be useful for GVA batterers only.","J. Babcock, C. E. Green, S. A. Webb (2008).

37,"Nerve agents are extremely toxic and are some of the most lethal substances on earth. This group of chemicals consists of sarin, cyclosarin, soman, tabun, VX, and VR. It is currently unknown how many countries possess these chemicals and in what quantities. These agents work through altering the transmission and breakdown of acetylcholine by binding to, and inactivating, acetylcholinesterase. This results in an uncontrolled and overwhelming stimulation of both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Receptor activation at these sites can lead to a wide variety of clinical symptoms, with death frequently resulting from pulmonary edema. Antidotal therapy in this setting largely consists of atropine, pralidoxime, and benzodiazepines, all of which must be administered emergently to limit the progression of symptoms and prevent the enzyme inactivation from becoming permanent. This article reviews the mechanism of action of the nerve agents and their effects on the human body, the currently available therapies to mitigate their impact, and important therapeutic considerations for health care practitioners in the emergency department.","Abby M.

39,"Songwriting as a therapeutic intervention has received increasing attention in the field of music therapy over the past decade however much of the publications focus on clinical outcomes rather than methods of practice. This paper, part of a two-part research report into trends in the clinical practice of songwriting, aims to describe the most frequently employed goal areas across a range of clinical populations and compare these findings with the published literature. Responses to a 21-question on-line survey were obtained from 477 professional music therapists practicing in 29 countries which focused on approaches to songwriting within their practice with a single clinical population. Chi-square or comparable Exact tests (Fisher-Freeman-Halton) were applied to the data and significant associations were found according to different clinical populations particularly with respect to the aims of songwriting in clinical practice and the frequency with which songwriting is employed in practice. The data highlights that songwriting is frequently employed in developmental disability and ASD practice, with reports on songwriting with these diagnostic groups being underrepresented in the music therapy literature. The survey identified that the most frequently endorsed goal areas align with the literature base and included a) experiencing mastery, develop self-confidence, enhance self-esteem; b) choice and decision making; c) develop a sense of self; d) externalising thoughts, fantasies, and emotions; e) telling the client's story; and f) gaining insight or clarifying thoughts and feelings.","F.

40,"While prolonged exposure is considered one of the “gold standard” and recommended treatments for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), it has been poorly utilised in clinical practice. Individuals with PTSD often find it too distressing to confront memories, and therapists may be uncomfortable using the therapy. A new Emotional Processing Therapy is described in which an emotional approach to prolonged exposure provides individuals with a new insight into how trauma is processed. A conceptual analysis of exposure suggests that it is exposure to distressingemotional experienceswhich is a key element. Viewing it as an emotion-based therapy, allows the creative addition of new emotional elements. Through exploring the individual’s emotional processing style, previously learned and unhelpful patterns can be addressed, and the addition of an “emotional preparation” phase helps them understand why it is important to face emotionally distressing memories before exposure sessions begin. Emotional Processing Therapy is intuitive and makes sense to those affected by PTSD. It is framed in an emotional context and is presented as part of a lifestyle change that may reduce the likelihood of psychological problems developing in the future.","Roger Baker, Lisa Gale, Gareth Abbey, Sarah Thomas (2013).

41,"INTRODUCTION: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), but can be limited by poor adherence. In New Zealand (NZ), ethnicity has been shown to be a predictor of CPAP adherence. This study aimed to explore Maori, Pacific and NZ European patients' experience of CPAP treatment. METHODS: Patients identifying as Maori, Pacific, or NZ European ethnicity referred for CPAP treatment for OSA attended separate, 1.5-hour group discussions facilitated by a health care worker of the same ethnic group, using an interview template. Thematic analysis was applied to the discussion transcripts independently by two investigators, following published guidelines. FINDINGS: Five Maori, five Pacific, and eight NZ Europeans participated (mean age 47, range 30-71 years, mean ± standard deviation CPAP adherence 6.32 ±1.25 hours/night). Patients in all three groups reported that they had little knowledge of OSA or CPAP prior to treatment initiation. All groups identified barriers to treatment (both at the CPAP initiation phase and long term), reported feelings of being 'overwhelmed' with information during the initial CPAP education session, and discussed the importance of successful role models. Family and friends were generally reported as being supportive of CPAP therapy. CONCLUSION: The three groups all reported similar initial CPAP experiences, highlighting access barriers to publicly funded assessment and treatment pathways, and sleep health knowledge as key issues. Educational resources to improve access, enable self-management, and increase community awareness of OSA would help overcome some of the issues identified in this study.","Jessie P. Bakker, Karyn M.

44,"Background: Elements of voice content and characteristics of a hallucinatory voice are considered to be associated with compliance and resistance to auditory command hallucinations. However, a need for further exploration of such features remains. Aims: To explore the associations across different types of commands (benign, self-harm, harm-other) with a range of symptom measures and a trait measure of expressed compliance with compliance to the most recent command and command hallucinations over the previous 28 days. Methods: Participants meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, with auditory hallucinations in the previous 28 days were screened. Where commands were reported a full-assessment of positive symptoms, social-rank, beliefs about voices and trait compliance was completed. Results: Compliance with the last self-harm command was associated with elevated voice malevolence, heightened symptom presentation and perceived consequences for non-compliance. Compliance with the last harm-other command was associated with elevated symptom severity, higher perceived consequences for non-compliance and higher levels of voice social rank. However, these associations were not maintained for compliance during the previous 28 days. Conclusions: Findings indicate the importance of identifying the content of commands, overall symptom severity and core variables associated with compliance to specific command categories. The temporal stability of established mediating variables needs further examination.","A. L. Barrowcliff, G. Haddock (2010).

45,"The issue of the role of HIV testing in HIV prevention is an important one. Some commentators have argued that HIV testing should be encouraged more widely on the grounds that it can stimulate behaviour change to safe sex and drug use. Testing has been advanced as an important means to control the epidemic. There is, however, insufficient evidence to support this contention at this time. The hypothesis of a link between HIV testing and behaviour change is based on the assumption of a linear relationship. It is argued that this assumption is based on two others, that the 'stimulus' of testing and counselling is uniform, and that information will be perceived and used by all recipients in an identical way. It is argued that there is currently insufficient research evidence to encourage more widespread testing on prevention grounds. Issues which should be considered in future research designs are discussed.","S. Beardsell (1994).  Should wider HIV testing be encouraged on the grounds of HIV prevention?

One hundred and sixty-four undergraduates were asked to give the reasons why they think men sexually offend against children and to rate them using Benson's Attributional Scale across four dimensions: stability, locus, controllability and globality. A Grounded Theory methodology was applied to these reasons and a set of nine categories derived from the data. The results showed that undergraduates' reasons for child sexual abuse strongly parallel contemporary scientific theories of abuse, and that there were significant gender differences in the frequency with which participants cited various types of reasons given for sexual abuse. Females endorsed significantly more victim reasons than males, and also more power and control reasons than did males. In contrast, males endorsed significantly more sexual reasons for offending than did females. Furthermore, significant gender differences were found between the ways in which participants construed the reasons for sexual abuse, with females seeing the phenomenon as significantly more stable and internal than males. No significant gender differences were found on the dimensions of controllability and globality.","J. Beling, S. M. Hudson, T. Ward (2001).

49,"BACKGROUND: Transportation industry workers are at high risk for exposure to traumatic incidents in the workplace. A considerable number of those exposed to such incidents will develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, which leads to high rates of absenteeism and are costly to the public transit corporation and workplace safety compensation insurance. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the newly implemented Best Practice Intervention (BPI) provides superior outcomes when compared with Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) interventions in improving workers' rates of return to work (RTW), decreasing duration of time lost from work and overall reduction in severity of PTSD symptoms 6 months after exposure. METHODS: A sequential mixed methods approach was used with qualitative analysis followed by a pre-post intervention design. Sixty-two participants were recruited to the (TAU) phase of the study and 79 to the (BPI) phase. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the TAU and BPI groups in number of lost work days (TAU: 20 days vs. BPI: 52 days, p = 0.02). PTSD symptoms decreased with time (MPPS score: 51.3 vs. 24.35; p < 0.001). One-fifth of the participants (21 %) did not return to work by the end of the 6 months follow-up period.

50,"Sleep is a basic activity of living. Its restorative properties in healthcare settings--both hospital and community--should be considered by healthcare workers. Its significance in gerontological nursing should not be underestimated. As older people are prone to multiple pathology, disease processes may mask their need for effective sleep and rest. 'Sleep architecture' is a term that applies to the mechanics of sleep or its stages and clinicians may fail to identify when this is disrupted. 'Sleep hygiene' refers to measures or interventions used to promote sleep and a person-centred approach is necessary, with support from specialist agencies to achieve effective sleep hygiene. The need for long periods of sleep may diminish owing to ageing. However, the quality of the sleep experiences, i.e. feeling rested and refreshed, should be the same. Several factors have been identified in the causation of insomnia. In healthcare settings, environmental factors such as noise and light pollution are the commonest features. Other issues that may be present in both healthcare and community settings are related to varied perspectives, such as physiological, psychological and spiritual-religious. Providing a climate conducive to healthy sleep in all settings becomes a requisite in the planning of care.","G. Béphage (2005).  Clinical skills.

Higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with previous traumatic exposures, subsequent life events, and higher levels of PTSD symptoms; higher levels of PTSD symptoms were associated with greater peritraumatic dissociation and initial emotional response.Conclusion: Acute exposures of highly trained professionals to potentially fatal events may not result in high levels of posttraumatic symptoms.

This study examines Troop Education for Army Morale, a postdeployment early intervention based on Psychological First Aid. MA soldiers (N = 126) were randomized to intervention or comparison groups 1-month postdeployment. Intervention sessions were held at 2, 3, 4, and 7 months. Assessments of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and quality of life (QOL) were conducted at 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 months for both groups. At baseline, 25.0% of the total sample had probable PTSD (17-item PTSD Checklist M = 35.4, SD = 16.9) and 23.6% had probable depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale M = 7.8, SD = 6.9). Over 10 months, PTSD and depression symptoms decreased and QOL improved for the total sample. At study conclusion, intervention and comparison groups were not different. Intervention group males showed a transient symptom increase at 2 to 3 months. Males attended fewer intervention sessions than females. Lower attendance was associated with more symptoms and lower QOL. Higher attendance was associated with greater intervention benefits. Findings highlight the need for better understanding postdeployment interventions and facilitating attendance. Further intervention for MA soldiers is indicated.","Quinn M. Biggs, Carol S.

55,"Pain is a common problem for older persons who need professional help for their daily living. In this study 94 older persons (75+) in persistent pain were compared with 52 care providers concerning the pain management methods they had used/administered during the previous week and how helpful they perceived these methods to be. Interviews were based on 16 items from the original version of the pain management inventory (PMI). Both groups perceived prescribed medication, rest and distraction as the most frequently utilized methods. Specific methods such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or bracing/splinting or bandaging the affected body part were seldom employed, although most users perceived these methods as helpful. Care providers perceived most methods for managing pain as more effective than older persons did. The results imply that care providers need skills in a variety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods to manage pain and a need to evaluate effectiveness of the methods in a systematic way.","K.

57,"Objectives. We investigated patterns of childhood and adolescent experiences that correspond to later justice system entry, including persistence into adulthood, and explored whether timing of potential supports to the child or onset of family poverty, according to developmental periods and gender, would distinguish among latent classes. Methods. We constructed a database containing records for 8587 youths from a Midwestern metropolitan region, born between 1982 and 1991, with outcomes. We used data from multiple publicly funded systems (child welfare, income maintenance, juvenile and criminal justice, mental health, Medicaid, vital statistics). We applied a latent class analysis and interpreted a 7-class model. Results. Classes with higher rates of offending persisting into adulthood were characterized by involvement with multiple publicly funded systems in childhood and adolescence, with the exception of 1 less-urban, predominantly female class that had similarly high system involvement coupled with lower rates of offending. Conclusions. Poverty and maltreatment appear to play a critical role in offending trajectories. Identifying risk factors that cluster together may help program and intervention staff best target those most in need of more intensive intervention.","Charlotte Lyn Bright, Melissa Jonson-Reid (2015).

The STORM Study (STORM is an acronym for 'services for treating older residents' mental health') is the first step in the development of an evidence-based disaster mental health intervention for this vulnerable and underserved population. Demographic characteristics were collected on participating residents and staff. Program evaluation forms were completed by staff participants during the pilot test and nurse training session. Staff and resident discussion groups were conducted during the pilot test to collect qualitative data on the use of PFA in nursing homes. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the PFA program to train staff to provide residents with PFA during disasters.

60,"Changes in electrodermal activity (EDA) correlate with arousal and stress during stimulating experiences. We hypothesized that associations exist between short-term performance gains and changes in EDA. A total of 187 combat medics were randomly assigned to simulation (S), live tissue (L), or video (V) based training in the recognition and treatment of nerve agent casualties. Change in EDA from baseline to training was quantified for tonic and phasic responses and was categorized as positive (>+10%), no change (±10%), or negative (<-10%). Cognitive and psychomotor skills assessments were applied before and after the baseline/training period to quantify short-term performance changes. Statistically significant differences in both EDA arousal measures between training modalities (p < 0.001 with L > S ∼ V) were observed. Notably, larger proportions of trainees experienced negative changes in tonic (67%) and phasic (21%) EDA measures in the V group when compared to the L and S groups. Regardless of training modality, negative tonic and phasic EDA responses were associated with lower psychomotor performance gains and this finding approached statistical significance (tonic: p = 0.056, phasic: p = 0.08). No significant differences were noted in pre- to post-training cognitive performance between EDA response categories. As quantified by EDA response to training, reduced arousal was associated with lower short-term psychomotor, but not cognitive, performance gains.","Alex Bukoski, Rindi Uhlich, Johnny Tucker, Chris Cooper, Steve Barnes (2016).

63,"Objective: This review draws on current knowledge of risk for youth suicide to categorise strategies for intervention. Its goal is to identify areas of 'research need' and to provide an evidence base to identify 'best buy' preventive interventions for youth suicide. Method: The design, development, implementation and evaluation of prevention strategies ranging from clinical interventions to population-based universal approaches are considered within five risk factor domains: individual, family, community, school and peer. Results: There is a paucity of evidence on the effects of interventions targeting depression and suicidal behaviour. Nevertheless, there are effective indicated, selective and universal interventions for important risk factors for depression and suicidal behaviour. Little evidence has emerged to support the efficacy of some traditional approaches to suicide prevention, such as school based suicide education programs and telephone hotlines. Conclusions: Youth suicide prevention strategies in Australia have generally employed traditional approaches that focus on clinical interventions for self-harmers, restricting access to lethal means, providing services to high risk groups and enhancing general practitioner responses. Both program development and research evaluation of interventions for many important risk and protective factors for suicide have been neglected.","J. M. Burns, G. C. Patton, J. Burns (2000).

64,"Purpose: To compare the level of perceived stress and somatization experienced by spouses of deployed versus nondeployed servicemen, and to determine the relationship between stress and somatization. Data sources: Using Lazarus and Folkman's theory of Stress and Coping, a descriptive correlational design was used with 130 participants; 68 spouses of nondeployed servicemen and 62 spouses of servicemen deployed to a combat zone. Participants completed a Perceived Stress Scale-10 and Patient Heath Questionnaire-15. An independent t-test was used to determine the level of perceived stress and somatization in each sample. The Pearson's correlation was used to determine the relationship between perceived stress score and level of somatization in the total sample. Conclusions: Spouses of deployed servicemen had significantly higher perceived stress scores than spouses of nondeployed service members ( p <.001). Somatization scores were also significantly higher in spouses of deployed versus nondeployed servicemen ( p <.001). A significant positive correlation was found between level of perceived stress and level of somatization ( r = .878, p <.001).

67,"Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is often associated with extended fluoroscopic exposure during placement of the devices. The objective of this study was to measure the radiation exposure sustained by different parts of the body of patients and operators during fluoroscopically guided cardiac resynchronization device implantation. Methods: Dosimetry data were prospectively recorded in a series of 104 consecutive patients, who underwent resynchronization device implantation or upgrade in our cardiac catheterization laboratory. Five Chipstrate dosimeters were fixed to the patient's skin around the thorax (right and left paravertebral, right and left parasternal, and sternal positions), one dosimeter was attached to the forehead, and one to the pubis. The operator was equipped with one dosimeter on the forehead at eye level and a ring dosimeter was worn on the right hand. Results: Based on the maximum radiation dose of 9.2 mSv measured at the operator's hand in a single implantation session, it might be recommended to conservatively limit the number of implantations to four per month (an annual limit value of 500 mSv). At a mean dose of 1.2 mSv, this number can be increased sevenfold. Conclusion: In patients, incipient deterministic radiation effects can theoretically be observed at dose area product >400 Gy•cm2, a dose applied in 2.9% of CRT implantation procedures. Special follow-up programs are considered necessary for these patients and for operators, as the latter may be exposed over many years given the unknown long-term impact of chronic radiation exposure and the nature of current complex electrophysiology and device procedures.

Existing literature is dated and focuses disproportionately on intrafamilial abuse. This research explores how nonoffending partners construct and understand their experiences using thematic analysis within a social constructionist framework. Findings indicate that discovery of a partner's sexual offending is a profoundly distressing experience. It can inhibit a woman's ability to process the broader implications of her partner's behavior, including issues of risk, the impact on the victim, and the additional protective responsibilities she must adopt in the future.

This paper describes the development of a Likert-type questionnaire to assess how the concept of challenging behaviour is cognitively represented in staff working with adults with learning disabilities. The Challenging Behaviour Representation Questionnaire (CBRQ) was theoretically derived, drawing on two existing measures: the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) and the Challenging Behaviour Attributions Scale (CHABA). Items for the questionnaire were generated from responses by 300 direct care staff. The questionnaire shows acceptable levels of internal and external reliability. The questionnaire has face validity and a measure of concurrent validity. There is evidence that challenging behaviour is cognitively represented in care staff in a multi-dimensional way, consistent with other studies in health psychology. This has implications for future staff training in this area.","M. Campbell (2007).

70,"BACKGROUND: There has been increasing attention focused on the epidemic of prescription drug use in the United States, but little is known about its effects in trauma. The purpose of this study was to define the prevalence of prescription controlled substance use among trauma patients and determine its effects on outcome. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to a Level 1 trauma center from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2011, was performed. Patients dying within 24 hours or without home medication reconciliations were excluded. Data review included preexisting benzodiazepine or narcotic use, sex, age, mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Scores (ISSs), intensive care unit (ICU) and overall length of stay, ventilator days, and overall cost. SAS version 9.3 was used for the analysis, and p <= 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 1,700 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 340 (20.0%) were on prescription narcotics and/or benzodiazepines at the time of admission. Patients in the narcotic/benzodiazepine group were significantly older (48 years vs. 43 years) and more likely to be women (43.7% vs. 28.9%). There was no difference in mechanism, ISS, or the presence of head injury between groups. Both ICU length of stay (3.3 days vs. 2.1 days) and total length of stay (7.8 days vs. 6.1 days) were significantly longer in patients on outpatient narcotics and/or benzodiazepines. Excluding severely injured patients, the need for mechanical ventilation was also increased among outpatient controlled substance users (15.8% vs. 11.0%). CONCLUSION: There is a substantial prevalence of preexisting controlled substance use (20%) among patients at our Level 1 trauma center. Preexisting controlled substance use is associated with longer total hospital and ICU stays. Among mildly to moderately injured patients, preinjury controlled substance is also associated with the need for mechanical ventilation.

75,"OBJECTIVE: Prompt detection of infectious disease outbreaks and rapid introduction of mitigation strategies is a primary concern for public health, emergency and security management organizations. Traditional surveillance methods rely on astute clinical detection and reporting of disease or laboratory confirmation. Although effective, these methods are slow, dependent on physician compliance and delay timely, effective intervention. To address these issues, syndromic surveillance programs have been integrated into the health care system at the earliest points of access; in Ontario, these points are primary care providers, emergency departments (ED), and Telehealth Ontario. This study explores the role of Telehealth Ontario, a telephone helpline, as an early warning system for detection of gastrointestinal (GI) illness. METHODS: Retrospective time-series analysis of the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) ED discharges and Telehealth Ontario data for GI illness from June 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006. RESULTS: Telehealth Ontario recorded 184,904 calls and the NACRS registered 34,499 ED visits for GI illness. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated to be 0.90 (p < 0.0001). Time-series analysis resulted in significant correlation at lag (weekly) 0 indicating that increases in Telehealth Ontario call volume correlate with increases in NACRS data for GI illness. CONCLUSION: Telehealth Ontario call volume fluctuation reflects directly on ED GI visit data on a provincial basis. Telehealth Ontario GI call complaints are a timely, novel and representative data stream that shows promise for integration into a real-time syndromic surveillance system for detection of unexpected events.","J.

Various strategies have been proposed, usually involving combinations of sedating drugs and physical restraint. Thus far, none guarantees safe retrieval while completely mitigating risks. This case proposes the use of propofol as an alternative to more traditionally used agents. An infusion facilitated the uneventful and safe retrieval of a patient who had demonstrated resistance and tolerance to other drugs.

78,"It is not surprising that many of the subjects of previous studies of help-seeking by Chinese parents and families have been women. After all, in almost all cultures women comprise the majority of those seeking help. Nonetheless a women's perspective on help-seeking is underrepresented in the literature. This paper, a follow-up to an earlier study, constitutes an analysis of two group interviews with 20 women living in a Hong Kong new town, all of whom had experienced a stressful life event either directly or vicariously through a family member in the previous twelve months. The study placed particular emphasis on how they viewed their problems and solutions, their help-seeking strategies and their views on such existing services as hotlines and centre-based family services. This study then forms the basis of a more wide-ranging discussion which, while it does not in all respects emerge from it, reflects possible extrapolations. The data, that is to say, are not analysed quantitatively, but rather as a consciousness-raising exercise which also serves as a possible basis for more substantial research in the future. It was found that subjects' approach to these matters was characterized by the tolerance of an unequal and overburdened gender role, self-blame over children's and marital problems and the lack of adequate support from within or outside the family. As a result these women were in double jeopardy in respect of family troubles: not only were their problem definitions closely connected with the real or imagined cultural stigma of inadequate womanhood or motherhood, but they also generally declined to seek help from either formal or informal sources. These findings support the thesis that Chinese women are socialized and subjugated into a gendered role. Their perception of available existing services offers valuable clues as to why they ceased or were discouraged from seeking help. The implications are discussed with reference to the need for gender-sensitive practices and the need to work on a deeper level of value issues.","M. Y. Chiu (2004).

84,"We describe the impact of an interprofessional education programme in mental health for professionals in six rural Canadian communities. The 10-session programme, offered primarily via videoconference, focussed on eight domains of mental health practice. One hundred and twenty-five professionals, representing 15 professions, attended at least some sessions, although attendance was variable. Data were collected between September 2006 and December 2007. The programme was evaluated using a mixed methods approach. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction for all topics and all aspects of the presentations: they were most satisfied with the opportunity to interact with other professionals and least satisfied with the videoconference technology. Professionals' confidence ( n = 49) with mental health interventions, issues and populations was measured pre- and post-programme. There was a significant increase in confidence for seven of the eight mental health interventions and four of the six mental health issues that had been taught in the programme. Participants reported developing a more reflective mental health practice, becoming more aware of mental health issues, integrating new knowledge and skills into their work and they expressed a desire for further mental health training. They noted that interprofessional referrals, inter-agency linkages and collaborations had increased. Conditions that appeared to underpin the programme's success included: scheduling the programme over an extended time period, a positive relationship between the facilitator and participants, experiential learning format and community co-ordinators as liaisons. Participants' dissatisfaction with the videoconference technology was mitigated by the strong connection between the facilitator and participants. One challenge was designing a curriculum that met the needs of professionals with varied expertise and work demands.

Results suggest that in outdoor workers exposed to urban chemical stressors there are alterations in FSH levels; therefore FSH may be used as an early biological marker, valuable for the group, used in occupational set.","Manuela Ciarrocca, Tiziana Caciari, Barnaba Giuseppina Ponticiello, Pier Agostino Gioffrè, Gianfranco Tomei, Angela Sancini, Maria Pia Schifano, Paola Palermo, Nadia Nardone, Lara Scimitto, Maria Fiaschetti, Francesco Tomei (2011).

89,"Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) have resulted in a growing number of seriously injured soldiers who are evacuated to the United States for comprehensive medical care. Trauma-related pain is an almost universal problem among these war-injured soldiers, and several military and Department of Veterans Affairs initiatives have been implemented to enhance pain care across the continuum of medical services. This article describes several innovative approaches for improving the pain care provided to OEF and OIF military personnel during acute stabilization, transport, medical-surgical treatment, and rehabilitation and presents summary data characterizing the soldiers, pain management services provided, and associated outcomes. We also identify some of the pain assessment, classification, and treatment challenges emerging from work with this population and provide recommendations for future research and practice priorities.","M.

90,"OBJECTIVE. To conduct an evidence-based review of intervention studies of older drivers with medical conditions. METHOD. We used the American Occupational Therapy Association’s classification criteria (Levels I–V, I = highest level of evidence) to identify driving interventions. We classified studies using letters to represent the strength of recommendations: A = strongly recommend the intervention; B = recommend intervention is provided routinely; C = weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes; D = recommend not to provide the intervention; I = insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the intervention. RESULTS. For clients with stroke, we recommend a graded simulator intervention (A) and multimodal training in traffic theory knowledge and on-road interventions (B); we make no recommendation for or against Dynavision, Useful Field of View, or visual–perceptual interventions (I). For clients with visual deficits, we recommend educational intervention (A) and bioptic training (B); we make no recommendation for or against prism lenses (I). For clients with dementia, we recommend driving restriction interventions (C) and make no recommendation for or against use of compensatory driving strategies (I). CONCLUSION. Level I studies are needed to identify effective interventions for medically at-risk older drivers.","Sherrilene Classen, Miriam Monahan, Beth Auten, Abraham Yarney (2014).

91,"This paper examines changes in the interval between first heroin smoking and onset of injection in a large, out-treatment sample of male heroin users in Hanoi, Vietnam (n = 1,115). Mean age at initiation of heroin use (smoking) was 18.4 and mean age of onset of heroin injection was 20.9 years. Full multivariate analysis indicates that the interval between first heroin use (smoking) and first heroin injection has been significantly attenuated among more recent heroin initiates ( P = 0.0043), suggesting that heroin users in Vietnam may be at increased risk for exposure to HIV relatively soon after onset of heroin use, highlighting the need for behavioral interventions that target heroin smokers. Critical intervention goals include delaying the onset of injection and improved education about safer drug sharing and drug injection practices.","Michael Clatts, Lloyd Goldsamt, Le Minh Giang, Vivian Colón-López (2011).

92,"The present study compared impact of participating in laboratory research assessments on couples experiencing partner violence and nonviolent couples. Across two studies, 192 couples participated in a variety of potentially distressing laboratory procedures, including discussing relationship problems, viewing videotapes of their discussions, and completing questionnaires about personal and relationship problems. At the end of each laboratory session, participants rated their emotions about their partners as a result of having participated in the study procedures. Couples, recruited from the community, were placed into one of three groups: experiencing violence (V), nonviolent but maritally distressed (NVD), and nonviolent and nondistressed (NVND). Overall, study participants did not report high levels of negative feelings toward their spouses at the end of lab sessions. Few differences between V and NVD spouses were statistically significant, suggesting that violent spouses are not at greater risk than NVD spouses for negative feelings following study participation, although the finding of greater fear among V partners in one study deserves future attention. Relative to V and NVD couples, happy couples reported more positive and fewer negative feelings; NVD wives were the most likely to report negative emotions, in sessions involving a marital problem discussion. These findings can be used in discussions with Institutional Review Boards about the potential risks of laboratory procedures for violent couples recruited from the community.","K. Clements, A.

93,"Many patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) receive inadequate or ineffective treatment, often because of multifactorial barriers that stand in the way of appropriate care. These barriers include the high prevalence of medical and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with FMS, the challenges inherent in diagnosing FMS, and the perception among many that FMS is not a 'real' disease. Another major obstacle is that there is often little or no coverage for patients with FMS who do have health insurance, and restricted access to healthcare for those who do not. This article reviews these and other patient-, physician-, and process-related barriers and explains how they interfere with treatment. The article also suggests several common-sense strategies aimed at overcoming these obstacles and improving care for patients with FMS.","S. P. Cohen (2009).

All women 18-years and older who were served in the clinic in a one-year period (N=1690) were asked about episodes of violence. The number of positives responses was assessed in a retrospective chart review of all women's charts seen in the clinic before and after an educational intervention and screening protocol were added to the intake procedures. Previous to the intervention, no charts of women were identified who reported current violent against them. A second retrospective chart review was conducted after the intervention. Six women were identified and referred to support agencies for violence against them. The investigators concluded that education of staff and adding the screening protocol about violence against women visits can increase the ability to identify violence against women.","S. M.

100,"At-risk youth come from diverse backgrounds and may be vulnerable as they struggle between acceptance and identity development during the transition between childhood and adulthood. As youth seek to form their own identities and find a place for themselves within their world, many turn to music as a foundation of this community and identity formation. This qualitative study seeks to determine how young rappers use the development and creation of rap to create community and form meaningful connections. Through ecological analysis, the study demonstrates how young people use rap music to form relationships, tell stories about their lives and build relationships founded on trust. The participants included five males aged eighteen to twenty-two. Ecomaps were created for each participant, resulting in a graphic that identifies important groups and individuals in their lives and the communication patterns between them. This study revealed that participants have small inner circles that they relate to more as family than their biological families. Findings present an opportunity to learn about the inner workings of young people who are involved in rap music as an activity with peers and an outlet for processing issues of daily life. By using the ecosystems theory as the foundation of the study, the researcher is able to create a deeper understanding of the meaning of music in the lives of youth and how social workers may be able to use this in their practice with at-risk youth.","Marcus R.

The results showed women who have felt their lives were in danger are more likely to have been victimized. In addition, women who were both abused by their partner and sexually abuse as children are the ones that perceive more situations of danger in their adult couple relationship.

The purpose of the present study was to examine participants’ phenomenological experiences of spiritual and religious posttraumatic growth (PTG). Transcribed data from semi-structured interviews with 10 women, self-identified as Christian, who had experienced spiritual or religious growth following various trauma were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results indicated how religion provided a framework that assisted participants to incorporate life changes, and to find meaning in their suffering. The most salient themes identified in relation to religious and spiritual PTG included: process of spiritual and religious growth, strengthening of religious and spiritual beliefs, and personal and spiritual growth and healing. Participants’ trauma and associated distress prompted a process of questioning and meaning-making that facilitated deeply experienced personal and spiritual growth, and was related to intrinsic religiosity.","Rosemary de Castella, Janette Graetz Simmonds (2013).  “There's a deeper level of meaning as to what suffering's all about”: experiences of religious and spiritual growth following trauma Mental Health, Religion & Culture, 16(5),  536-556",0,,69
105,"Children's appraisals of conflictual and aggressive parental interactions mediate their effect on children's adjustment. Previous studies have relied almost exclusively on self-report questionnaires to assess appraisals; consequently we know little about perceptions that occur naturally when children witness interparental aggression. This study employed a semi-structured interview to assess the thoughts and feelings of 34 children (ages 7-12) whose mothers were receiving services at domestic violence agencies, and mothers reported on interparental aggression that took place in the home. Children's thoughts centered on consequences and efforts to understand why fights occurred. They generally viewed their mother's partner as responsible for violence, though a significant number viewed both parents as playing a role. Sadness and anger were more common than anxiety, and children often attempted to stop or withdraw from fights or both. When asked why family violence occurs, most focused on perpetrators' lack of control of anger or personal characteristics, but approximately one-third viewed victims as provoking aggression. These findings support the idea that children actively attempt to understand the causes and consequences of interparental violence and suggest that their perceptions and interpretations are important for understanding the development of beliefs regarding the use of violence in close relationships.","Renee DeBoard-Lucas, John Grych (2011).

107,"With the growing interest in the role of cognitions in PTSD, this prospective study examined the course and bi-directional relationship between post-trauma cognitions and symptoms of PTSD. A sample of Israeli combat veterans, including former prisoners of war, was assessed in 1991, and later followed up in 2003 and 2008. PTSD symptoms were measured at three time points. Cognitions concerning the self and the world were measured twice. Applying Autoregressive Cross-Lagged (ARCL) modeling strategy, initial PTSD symptoms predicted subsequent negative cognitions but not vice versa. In addition, repeated measures design revealed that individuals with chronic PTSD symptoms had relatively negative cognitions that further amplified with time. More specifically, increasingly negative cognitions were documented among ex-prisoners of war. The main findings suggest that negative cognitions are fueled by PTSD and that in chronic PTSD there is an amplification of pathogenic outcomes over time. Discussion of the findings is in the context of current cognitive models of PTSD.","Sharon Dekel, Tamar Peleg, Zahava Solomon (2013).

111,"AIMS AND DESIGN: This study investigated equity of access to treatment and barriers to treatment for illicit drug use, using Andersen's behavioural model of health service utilization. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 492 drug users who had received treatment and 193 who had not. Measurements: Participants were interviewed to gather data relating to 19 predisposing, need and enabling variables. FINDINGS: Never-treated participants exhibited less need for treatment than those who had received treatment. They experienced less negative emotion, used their main drug less often, had fewer drug-related health problems and fewer drug-using friends, were less likely to have blood-borne virus infections and were more likely to be using drugs for 'fun'. They also had more negative attitudes towards drug treatment staff, were less likely to believe that appropriate treatment was available and less likely to believe that professional help was necessary to get off drugs. Prevalence of physical and mental health problems was high in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study documented significant unmet treatment need and identified several sources of inequity and barriers to treatment that would be amenable to policy and service development. Drug user organizations and peer educators and motivational interventions in primary care settings should be utilized to market the nature and benefits of treatment effectively, and to address the causes of drug users' negative attitudes towards treatment.","E.

However, older adults have generally not been included in randomized clinical trials of psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This review examined reports of psychological treatment for trauma-related problems, primarily PTSD, in studies with samples of at least 50% adults aged 55 and older using standardized measures.Methods:A systematic review of the literature was conducted on psychotherapy for PTSD with older adults using PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo, CINAHL, PILOTS, and Google Scholar.Results:A total of 42 studies were retrieved for full review; 22 were excluded because they did not provide at least one outcome measure or results were not reported by age in the case of mixed-age samples. Of the 20 studies that met review criteria, there were: 13 case studies or series, three uncontrolled pilot studies, two randomized clinical trials, one non-randomized concurrent control study and onepost hoceffectiveness study. Significant methodological limitations in the current older adult PTSD treatment outcome literature were found reducing its internal validity and generalizability, including non-randomized research designs, lack of comparison conditions and small sample sizes.Conclusion:Select evidence-based interventions validated in younger and middle-aged populations appear acceptable and efficacious with older adults. There are few treatment studies on subsets of the older adult population including cultural and ethnic minorities, women, the oldest old (over 85), and those who are cognitively impaired.

Individuals receiving crisis counseling and enhanced services responded to confidential telephone interviews about 18 and 24 months, respectively, after the attacks. Impairment was compared between groups to determine whether enhanced services recipients reported improved functioning and fewer symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress, and complicated grief.Methods: Crisis counseling recipients (N=153) were interviewed once and enhanced services recipients (N=76) were interviewed twice about symptomatology and daily functioning.Results: The samples did not differ in age or gender. Significantly greater proportions of enhanced services recipients reported knowing someone who died as a result of the attacks, having been involved in rescue efforts, or having lost their job because of the attacks. Compared with crisis counseling respondents, enhanced services recipients at their first interview reported significantly more symptoms of depression, grief, and traumatic stress and significantly poorer daily functioning in five life areas. At follow-up, enhanced services respondents reported significant improvement in three of five functioning domains, significantly fewer symptoms of depression and grief, and marginally less traumatic stress.Conclusions: Recipients of enhanced services were more impaired than people who received only crisis counseling. On the basis of reports from service recipients, meaningful improvements in functioning and symptoms may be associated with the receipt of enhanced services.","S. A. Donahue, C. T. Jackson, K. M.

The women's explanations for the violence they experienced, discussions of how they made sense of the violence, and references to the meaning or purpose of the violence in their lives were analyzed using grounded theory methods. The women indicated that their victimizing experiences had taught them 'the harsh realities of life'; that is, the world is violent and society tolerates and, in some cases, promotes violence against women. This lesson forced them to take it upon themselves to create a better life. This psychosocial process of 'taking it upon oneself' involved three tasks: pursuing one's own safety, taking justice into one's own hand, and making something good out of something bad. By accomplishing these tasks, the women found meaning in their suffering.","C. B. Draucker (2001).

METHOD: One to two months following a 7.4-magnitude quake in Turkey, 160 students were examined by self-report questionnaire, psychiatric interview, clinician-administered post-traumatic stress disorder scale (CAPS), and depression and anxiety inventories. At baseline, 96 students were diagnosed with PTSD, and 49 had comorbid depression with anxiety symptoms. After 18-20 months, 74 of 96 students were found and reassessed by psychiatric interview and CAPS; 25 had been treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmocotherapy, and 49 did not have any treatment. Binary logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors of persistent PTSD. Variables entered included pre-quake, quake and post-quake factors, having co-morbid depression upon initial interview, receipt of drug therapy, and number of months of CBT. RESULTS: At follow-up, many had symptoms of PTSD with anxiety, but only 14 subjects met the full criteria of PTSD, and four students had major depression with anxiety symptoms. Only one variable--having been in serious personal danger during the quake (e.g., trapped in the house or under rubble)--was significantly associated with being symptomatic at follow-up.

130,"Background: Attempted suicide is a major health problem internationally and a common cause of presentation to emergency department. The identification of the potential contributing factors associated with suicide attempts is of great importance for effective suicide prevention. Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with attempted suicide presenting in a Greek emergency department. Methods: A cross-sectional, retrospective study was conducted including all episodes of attempted suicide attending to emergency departments in a general hospital in Greece from January 2014 to December 2014. Data was collected using a standard registration form. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to identify the factors associated with attempted suicide. Results: A total of 203 suicide attempt presentations were made to the emergency department by 195 individuals. The male-to-female attempted suicide ratio was 1:1.5. The mean age of patients was 40.5 ± 15.6 years and the largest numbers by age groups were 25-34 year-old (28.6%). The most common method used for attempted suicide was self-poisoning (80.8%) mainly with benzodiazepines (36.6%) and analgesics (18.6%). The majority of self-harm involved self-cutting/stabbing (63.9%) and hanging (13.9%). The most frequently reported reason for attempted suicide was related to interpersonal relationships (59.6%). Psychosocial assessment by specialist mental health personnel occurred in 44.3% of cases. Self-poisoning were significantly associated with gender and education in multivariable analysis. Conclusions: Attempted suicide is a multi-determined act which results from an interaction between a wide range of socio-demographic and clinical factor. Further researches are required to enhance our understanding of patients' profile that predispose to suicide attempt and contribute to implementation of targeted treatment approaches.","George Filippatos, Evridiki Karasi (2017).

131,"The aim of the study was to use audit data and case-derived material to explore and illustrate the work of a mainstream, NHS tertiary care psychosexual service. A total of 100 consecutive cases from two psychosexual therapists' caseloads over a 12-month period were examined for evidence of the prevalence of mental disorder and the nature of referred problems. Case illustrations were generated to illuminate the variety of problems this clientele actually present. It was found that only 11% of clients had a severe mental illness, while another 27% had mental disorders (depression, anxiety) commonly treated in primary care settings. Most (62%) had no mental disorders other than their referred or assessed psychosexual problems. Many clients presented with significant social, material and medical problems not reported at referral. It is concluded that most clients might be seen more appropriately in primary care or other non-psychiatric settings. Referring agents might undertake more careful scrutiny of clients' broader biopsychosocial needs before referring them to psychosexual services. Psychosexual services may be confronted with over-facing issues of medical and psychosocial need and risk unless future commissioning processes demarcate their remit accurately.","Malcolm Thomas Firth (2012).  100 psychosexual therapy clients: a complex specialism Sexual & Relationship Therapy, 27(4),  391-404",0,,89

We review what is known about trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder following sexual abuse and explore the different treatment needs for these two survivor groups. For children, clergy-perpetrated sexual abuse can catastrophically alter the trajectory of psychosocial, sexual, and spiritual development. Depending on the age at which abuse occurred, adult clients may present with clinical issues that are more appropriate for a younger developmental stage. Additionally, the symptoms of traumatic stress may be misunderstood when clients conceptualize their abuse as an 'affair' or 'consensual' relationship.

This project utilized a CBPR approach to enhance cultural relevance, acceptability, and utility of the findings and subsequent program development. Two focus groups of youth and youth-involved Latino community leaders (n = 18) yielded three overarching themes crucial to a culturally tailored depression prevention intervention: (1) utilize a multipronged and sustainable intervention approach, (2) raise awareness about depression in culturally meaningful ways, and (3) promote Latino youth's social connection and cultural enrichment activities. Findings suggest that both adaptation of existing prevention programs and development of hybrid approaches may be necessary to reduce depression/suicide disparities for Latino youth.

140,"Violence against women, a global epidemic, frequently begins in childhood. Many abused women are mothers and many children witness the abuse of their mothers. To better understand the intergenerational impact and associated health outcomes, we tested 300 mother-child pairs using structural equation modeling. Mother's history of abuse during childhood directly impacted the level of adult abuse, which predicted her child's witness to the abuse. Maternal pain predicted maternal symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Mother's mental health predicted the degree of child dysfunction, such as aggression and depression. These findings offer evidence for the urgent need to provide mental health interventions to improve maternal functioning of abused mothers as a conduit intervention to prevent child dysfunction and promote mother-child health.","Nina Fredland, Lene Symes, Heidi Gilroy, Rene Paulson, Angeles Nava, Judith McFarlane, Jacquelyn Pennings (2015).

This study used electronic medical record data to examine the covariation of multiple risk factors regularly assessed among primary care patients. It also examined the health care utilization of those patients identifying where the health care system came in contact with them to help identify the ideal locations these interventions may be most often used. We obtained data for six risk factors, as well as the number of primary care, mental health, and emergency department visits, from Veteran patients with a primary care visit. There were three main groups of primary care patients, identified using latent class analysis and regression. Although the smallest group, the ""High Treatment Need"" group, had an increased probability of screening positive for all four risk factors, the post-traumatic stress disorder screen was a significant discriminator of this group from the others. Results show that this group had the greatest number of encounters in all health care locations suggesting significant opportunities for intervention. However, future research is needed to examine the current interventions offered and potential avenues where risk factors may be addressed simultaneously.","Jennifer S.

144,"Background: Among HIV+ patients, alcohol use is a highly prevalent risk factor for both HIV transmission and poor adherence to HIV treatment. The large-scale implementation of effective interventions for treating alcohol problems remains a challenge in low-income countries with generalized HIV epidemics. It is essential to consider an intervention's cost-effectiveness in dollars-per-health-outcome, and the long-term economic impact -or ""return on investment"" in monetary terms.Methods: We conducted a cost-benefit analysis, measuring economic return on investment, of a task-shifted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered by paraprofessionals to reduce alcohol use in a modeled cohort of 13,440 outpatients in Kenya. In our base-case, we estimated the costs and economic benefits from a societal perspective across a six-year time horizon, with a 3% annual discount rate. Costs included all costs associated with training and administering task-shifted CBT therapy. Benefits included the economic impact of lowered HIV incidence as well as the improvements in household and labor-force productivity. We conducted univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results.Results: Under the base case, total costs for CBT rollout was $554,000, the value of benefits were $628,000, and the benefit-to-cost ratio was 1.13. Sensitivity analyses showed that under most assumptions, the benefit-to-cost ratio remained above unity indicating that the intervention was cost-saving (i.e., had positive return on investment). The duration of the treatment effect most effected the results in sensitivity analyses.Conclusions: CBT can be effectively and economically task-shifted to paraprofessionals in Kenya. The intervention can generate not only reductions in morbidity and mortality, but also economic savings for the health system in the medium and long term. The findings have implications for other countries with generalized HIV epidemics, high prevalence of alcohol consumption, and shortages of mental health professionals.Trial Registration: This paper uses data derived from ""Cognitive Behavioral Treatment to Reduce Alcohol Use Among HIV-Infected Kenyans (KHBS)"" with ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT00792519 on 11/17/2008; and preliminary data from ""A Stage 2 Cognitive-behavioral Trial: Reduce Alcohol First in Kenya Intervention"" ( NCT01503255 , registered on 12/16/2011).","Omar Galárraga, Burke Gao, Benson N.

146,"BACKGROUND: Case management by health care assistants in small primary care practices provides unclear benefit for improving depression symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether case management provided by health care assistants in small primary care practices is more effective than usual care in improving depression symptoms and process of care for patients with major depression. DESIGN: Cluster randomized, controlled trial. A central automated system generated the randomization scheme, which was stratified by urban and rural practices; allocation sequence was concealed until groups were assigned. SETTING: 74 small primary care practices in Germany from April 2005 to September 2007. PATIENTS: 626 patients age 18 to 80 years with major depression. INTERVENTION: Structured telephone interview to monitor depression symptoms and support for adherence to medication, with feedback to the family physician. MEASUREMENTS: Depression symptoms at 12 months, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); secondary outcomes were patient assessment of chronic illness care, adherence to medication, and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 310 patients were randomly assigned to case management and 316 to usual care. At 12 months, 249 intervention recipients and 278 control patients were assessed; 555 patients were included in a modified intention-to-treat-analysis (267 intervention recipients vs. 288 control patients). Compared with control patients, intervention recipients had lower mean PHQ-9 values in depression symptoms (-1.41 [95% CI, -2.49 to -0.33]; P = 0.014), more favorable assessments of care (3.41 vs. 3.11; P = 0.011), and increased treatment adherence (2.70 vs. 2.53; P = 0.042). Quality-of-life scores did not differ between groups. LIMITATION: Patients, health care assistants, family physicians, and researchers were not blinded to group assignment, and 12-month follow-up of patients was incomplete.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with truck drivers who transport grains to Paranaguá Port, PR, Brazil. The truck drivers were interviewed, and they completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding their sociodemographics, lifestyles, working conditions, and consumption of IPS over the past 30 days. The statistical analysis included logistic regression models progressively adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables. Results: A total of 670 male drivers with a mean age of 41.9 (±11.1) years were assessed. The prevalence of IPS consumption over the past 30 days was 10.9% (n=73). The drugs used primarily consisted of amphetamines (n=61). After adjusting for working characteristics, sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, the following working conditions were associated with the consumption of IPS: driving mostly at night (OR=3.91; 95% CI 1.75 to 8.74), driving while tired (OR=2.26; 95% CI 1.31 to 3.89), and earning a higher monthly income (OR=2.08; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.72).

152,"OBJECTIVE: To measure change in services provided to young people with first-episode psychosis following the introduction of specialized early psychosis teams and staff training. METHOD: A standardized tool was developed to audit services provided to young people with first-episode psychosis. The tool initially comprised 27 clinical indicators measuring aspects of optimal care derived from the Australian clinical guidelines for early psychosis. The first 12 months of treatment, as documented in the case records, were audited for all young people receiving their first treatment for psychosis during a 6-month period prior to the introduction of these service developments (n = 47). These subjects were compared with those who received treatment after the implementation of service development strategies (n = 70). A comparison was also made within the second group, between those receiving some treatment from a specialized early psychosis team and those being exclusively treated by other services. RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability was achieved for 24 of the 27 indicators. Improvements were found on 10 indicators which measured psychosocial interventions, prescribing practices, family interventions and continuity of care. There was no significant deterioration on any of the indicators. Clients who attended early psychosis teams were significantly more likely to receive psychoeducation.

The CDC estimates that each year 385.000 needlesticks and other sharps-related injuries are sustained by hospital healthcare personnel. Nurses emerge as the staff group reporting the highest proportion of such injuries. The aim of the present study was to explore the reasons that may cause injuries as well as the level of nurses' knowledge about this occupational hazard. Material-method: Study sample consisted of 124 nurses of 6 General Hospital in Attica working at Emergency departments. The data were collected by the completion of a specific questionnaire designed for the needs of the research. Statistic analyses were conducted by means of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 16.0 and the statistical method used was pearson correlation. Results: From the 124 participants, 79.8% were women and 20.2% men. Regarding age, 14.5% of the sample studied were 8-25 years old, 26.6% 26-35, 43.5% 36-45 and 15.3%>45 years old. As for education level, 56.5% of the participants were of technological education, 32.3% of secondary and 4.8% of university. 87.1% of the participants reported exposure to blood or other liquids while 52.8% reported exposure during evening shift, 30.6% during morning shift and 16.7% during night. In regard to the degree of exposure, 10.3% reported deep wound, 32.7% middle and 57.0% surface wound whereas in 25% of the cases the type of exposure regarded skin and its' continuity. 77.2% reported through the skin needle stick injury, 42.3% needle stick injury with visible blood and the 82.2% reported that the needle stick had been already used to other patient. 86.4% of men reported the exposure to the Committee of Infectious Disease whereas the percentage of women was 63.4%.

154,"PURPOSE: Common sources of lead exposure, the primary clinical effects of lead toxicity, and current recommendations for managing lead toxicity, including chelation therapy, are reviewed. SUMMARY: Common sources of lead exposure in children and adults include industrial and mining activities, paint, dust, soil, water, air, the workplace, food, trinkets, ethnic folk remedies, and cosmetics. The absorption and biological fate of lead are affected by a variety of factors, including an individual's nutritional status, health, and age. Children with a blood lead concentration of >10 mug/dL and adults with a blood lead concentration of >/=45 mug/dL should undergo further evaluation. Symptoms and time to onset of symptoms postexposure may vary, and it can be difficult to identify the early, subtle neurologic effects of lead toxicity. The classic symptoms of lead toxicity generally correlate with blood lead concentrations of 25-50 mug/dL in children and 40-60 mug/dL in adults. Management of lead toxicity requires extensive risk assessment and caregiver education. Chelation is generally not indicated for adults with blood lead concentrations of <45 mug/dL because of the potential risk of adverse drug events and concerns about remobilized lead, and chelation for children with blood lead concentrations of <45 mug/dL remains controversial. Dimercaprol, edetate calcium disodium, and succimer are the three agents primarily used for chelation. CONCLUSION: Lead toxicity remains a significant public health concern. Elimination of elevated blood lead levels in children can be accomplished by educating appropriate health care providers and caregivers, recognizing potential lead sources, and adopting aggressive prevention and case management measures.","R.

Contrary to predictions derived from Johnson's theory, regression analysis showed that control accounted significant proportions of the variance in the use of physical aggression for all three relationship categories. Some support was provided, however, as it was found that the pattern of both interrelationships of the five types of controlling behaviors, and control and physical aggression, supported Johnson's distinction.","N.

Several men experienced troubled childhoods, involving abuse in the home and outside and adulthoods were marked by employment difficulties, psychiatric morbidity and criminality. Static-99 found most men presented a medium-high or higher risk of re-offending and risk was mostly linked to sexual deviance and range of victims. Thematic analysis suggested sexual violence was primarily motivated by factors such as anger/violence; psychotic drive; sexual disinhibition and paedophilia. However, medication was the primary treatment intervention, with no treatments aimed at addressing other motivational or risk factors. Although men with a mental illness exhibit similar psychiatric features, this study found they commit sexual violence for a variety of reasons. However, whilst anti-psychotic medication is an important treatment, there is a need to consider others if the nature and level of their future risk is to be effectively managed.","P. V. Greenall, L.

159,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. Therefore, efforts to optimize the healthcare process for patients with CAP are warranted. An organized approach to management is likely to improve clinical results. Assessing the severity of CAP is crucial to predicting outcome, deciding the site of care, and selecting appropriate empirical therapy. Unfortunately, current prognostic scoring systems for CAP such as CURB-65 (confusion, uraemia, respiratory rate, low blood pressure and 65 years of age) or the Pneumonia Severity Index have not been validated specifically in older adults, in whom assessment of mortality risk alone might not be adequate for predicting outcomes.Obtaining a microbial diagnosis remains problematic and may be particularly challenging in frail elderly persons, who may have greater difficulties producing sputum. Effective empirical treatment involves selection of a regimen with a spectrum of activity that includes the causative pathogen. Although most cases of CAP are probably caused by a single pathogen, dual and multiple infections are increasingly being reported. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the overriding aetiological agent, particularly in very elderly people. However, respiratory viruses and 'atypical' organisms such as Chlamydia pneumoniae are being described with increasing frequency in old patients, and aspiration pneumonia should also be taken into consideration, particularly in very elderly subjects and those with dementia. Age >65 years is a well established risk factor for infection with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. Clinicians should be aware of additional risk factors for acquiring less common pathogens or antibacterial-resistant organisms that may suggest that additions or modifications to the basic empirical regimen are warranted. In addition to administration of antibacterials, appropriate supportive therapy, covering management of severe sepsis and septic shock, respiratory failure, as well as management of any decompensated underlying disease, may be critical to improving outcomes in elderly patients with CAP. Immunization with pneumococcal and influenza vaccines has also been demonstrated to be beneficial in numerous large studies.There is good evidence that implementation of guidelines leads to improvement in clinical outcomes in elderly patients with CAP, including a reduction in mortality. Protocols should address a comprehensive set of elements in the process of care and should periodically be evaluated to measure their effects on clinically relevant outcomes. Assessment of functional clinical outcome variables, in addition to survival, is strongly recommended for this population.","F. Gutiérrez, M. Masiá (2008).

160,"AIMS: To investigate the triggering effects of alcohol, illegal substances and major classes of prescribed psychotropic drugs on criminal violence. DESIGN: A case-crossover design, using each subject as its own control. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive sample of 133 violent offenders was recruited from a forensic psychiatric evaluation unit and a national prison evaluation unit in Sweden during 2002-03. Measurements Offenders were assessed with structured interviews. Risk estimates were based on hazard periods of 24 hours. We used standard Mantel-Haenszel methods for statistical analyses. FINDINGS: A 13.2-fold increase of risk of violence [95% confidence interval (CI): 8.2-21.2] was found within 24 hours of alcohol consumption. This increase in violence risk was similar among individuals combining alcohol with benzodiazepines [Relative risk (RR) = 13.2, 95% CI: 4.9-35.3]. Use of benzodiazepines alone in regular doses (RR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.5) or antidepressants [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclics] (RR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8) was associated with a lowered risk for violence. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that alcohol is a strong trigger of criminal violence. Benzodiazepines in combination with alcohol caused no further increase of violence risk. Benzodiazepines in regular doses and antidepressants may inhibit violence, but further studies are needed to verify causality. The case-crossover method can contribute to research on the proximal causes of criminal violence.","U. Haggård-Grann, J. Hallqvist, N. Långström, J. Möller (2006).

Four groups were compared: individuals who had lodged a workers' compensation claim, people who had sought psychological assistance for the management of work-related stress reactions but who had not lodged a workers' compensation claim; people who had experienced stress symptoms but who had not lodged a claim or sought help; and people who experienced stressful work events but who had not developed symptoms. Examination was made of cognitive distortion, irrational beliefs and coping resources as individual factors, and stressful life events, daily hassles and work environment factors as environmental variables. The Compensation group was distinguished from other groups only on the basis of work environmental factors.

Results revealed no group differences in responsibility ratings among respondents with and without child sexual abuse histories. However, among the 133 respondents with child sexual abuse histories, results indicated that similarity to victim moderated the relationship between vignette characteristics, respondent history, and responsibility attributions.

167,"Background: In the context of the new education program for German paramedics, a discussion has been fueled regarding the emergency care competencies of paramedics. In 1999 a system for training and qualification of paramedics was established in the emergency medical service (EMS) area of Reutlingen (Germany), including an algorithm for analgesia using ketamine and midazolam. Under defined circumstances analgesia may be administered to patients in the absence of a physician.Aim: The objectives of the study were to evaluate the effectiveness of pain reduction measured by a recognized assessment scale and the safety of analgesia with ketamine and midazolam administered by paramedics. This study specifically focused on the medical results and associated processes and not on the legal aspects.Materials and Methods: In a retrospective analysis analgesia performed by paramedics who had undergone standardized training with annual controls and under medical supervision was investigated with regard to administration processes and efficacy. Analysis endpoints included vital signs at baseline and on transfer to the emergency department, pain score as defined by a numeric rating scale (NRS 0-10), the amount of ketamine administered and the occurrence of side effects (e.g. respiratory and circulatory disorders, nausea, qualitative and quantitative disturbance of consciousness).Results: A total of 528 instances of analgesia performed by paramedics were registered. The average patient age was 48 ± 23 years (range 5-95 years). Trauma to the extremities was the most common indication for the administration of analgesia with 48 % and 38 % attributable to the upper and lower extremities, respectively. Serious complications were not observed. Administration of analgesia resulted in a highly significant reduction in pain scores (NRS p<0.0001). Mean initial pain score was 8 with an interquartile range (IQR) of 7-8 and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 7.5-7.9 which was decreased to 3 (IQR 2-3, 95% CI 2.2-2.7) on transfer to the emergency department. The number of patients with a pain score of NRS ≤4 in the emergency department was 96 % (n=506). All other vital signs were essentially unchanged and the rate of side effects was low (2.8 %). Potentially life-threatening complications were not reported. The mean midazolam dosage administered was 1 ± 0.4 mg and the mean dosage of ketamine was 27 ± 12 mg. The investigation was limited by restricted documentation and patients who were not treated with analgesics were not included in the study.Conclusion: After appropriate training and regular control analgesia administered by paramedics in the present system was safely and effectively applied.","D.

168,"The benefits of interprofessional care in providing mental health services have been widely recognized, particularly in rural communities where access to health services is limited. There continues to be a need for more continuing interprofessional education in mental health intervention in rural areas. There have been few reports of rural programs in which mental health content has been combined with training in collaborative practice. The current study used a sequential mixed-method and quasi-experimental design to evaluate the impact of an interprofessional, intersectoral education program designed to enhance collaborative mental health capacity in six rural sites. Quantitative results reveal a significant increase in positive attitudes toward interprofessional mental health care teams and self-reported increases in knowledge and understanding about collaborative mental health care delivery. The analysis of qualitative data collected following completion of the program, reinforced the value of teaching mental health content within the context of collaborative practice and revealed practice changes, including more interprofessional and intersectoral collaboration. This study suggests that imbedding explicit training in collaborative care in content focused continuing professional education for more complex and chronic health issues may increase the likelihood that professionals will work together to effectively meet client needs.","Olga Heath, Elizabeth Church, Vernon Curran, Ann Hollett, Peter Cornish, Terrence Callanan, Cheri Bethune, Lynda Younghusband (2015).

169,"Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) is an asthma-like illness that develops after a single high-level exposure to a pulmonary irritant. Two different cases are reviewed, in which the exposure circumstances were not sufficient to result in adverse health effects yet resulted in persistent respiratory symptoms and a clinical diagnosis of RADS. Potential explanations for an erroneous diagnosis of RADS included an incomplete exposure assessment, medication adverse effects that can contribute to respiratory symptoms, and alternative explanations for respiratory symptoms or test findings. In particular, the empirical use of bronchodilator medications without a clear indication appeared to contribute to continued respiratory symptoms. Without a clear understanding of the patient's exposure, a RADS diagnosis should be carefully considered. The possibility of an iatrogenic sequence of events in which medication adverse effects facilitate respiratory symptoms and a mistaken RADS diagnosis should be considered, particularly in patients who have a poorly defined exposure history.","David J.

170,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), including a cost-effectiveness analysis, comparing high-intensity and low-intensity back schools with usual care in occupational health care. DESIGN: RCT and cost-effectiveness analysis. STUDY POPULATION: Employees sick-listed for a period of 3 to 6 weeks because of nonspecific low back pain. Interventions High-intensity back school treatment consists of a training program based on the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Low-intensity back school treatment is comparable to the original Swedish Back School. Usual care is provided by the occupational physician according to the Dutch guidelines for the occupational health treatment of patients with low back pain. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures are return to work, pain intensity, functional status, and general improvement. Secondary outcome measures are kinesiophobia and pain coping. The cost-effectiveness analysis includes the direct and indirect costs. The outcome measures are assessed before randomization and 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization. CONCLUSION: RCTs of different methodological quality have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of back schools in occupational health care. The large variation in type, content, and intensity of back schools has led to conflicting evidence. Therefore, 2 different forms of back schools are compared. Moreover, this is the first RCT to include a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing low-intensity and high-intensity back schools with usual care in occupational health care.","M. W. Heymans, H. C. W.

173,"There has been a recent increase in the prevalence of asthma worldwide; however, the 5-10% of patients with severe disease account for a substantial proportion of the health costs. Although most asthma cases can be satisfactorily managed with a combination of anti-inflammatory drugs and bronchodilators, patients who remain symptomatic despite maximum combination treatment represent a heterogeneous group consisting of those who are under-treated or non-adherent with their prescribed medication. After excluding under-treatment and poor compliance, corticosteroid refractory asthma can be identified as a subphenotype characterised by a heightened neutrophilic airway inflammatory response in the presence or absence of eosinophils, with evidence of increased tissue injury and remodelling. Although a wide range of environmental factors such as allergens, smoking, air pollution, infection, hormones, and specific drugs can contribute to this phenotype, other features associated with changes in the airway inflammatory response should be taken into account. Aberrant communication between an injured airway epithelium and underlying mesenchyme contributes to disease chronicity and refractoriness to corticosteroids. The importance of identifying underlying causative factors and the recent introduction of novel therapeutic approaches, including the targeting of immunoglobulin E and tumour necrosis factor alpha with biological agents, emphasise the need for careful phenotyping of patients with severe disease to target improved management of the individual patient's needs.","S.

METHODS: We used subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory and Harvard Trauma Questionnaire to interview 204 trafficked girls and women in 7 posttrafficking service settings. Multivariate logistic regression models based on interview data were fitted for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) separately and adjusted for pretrafficking abuse to determine impact of trafficking-related trauma exposures. RESULTS: Injuries and sexual violence during trafficking were associated with higher levels of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Sexual violence was associated with higher levels of PTSD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3, 25.4). More time in trafficking was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.1, 4.5). More time since trafficking was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety but not of PTSD.

One group was composed of older people and the other of women. The research adopted qualitative research methods. Data were collected by focus group meetings and in-depth individual interviews. The 24 research participants were mainly asked to describe their lives before and after joining the groups. The findings indicated that disaster survivors had resilience to loss and trauma and could recover themselves. Group participation facilitated disaster survivors' self recovery and had positive effects on them. Before joining the groups, many members of both groups felt bored and depressed. After joining, they felt better physically and psychologically and enjoyed socialising with each other. Their lives became more meaningful and their social network was broadened and strengthened.

A sample of six community health centres was selected and equally divided into an experimental and a control group. All nurses at the experimental centres attended a web-based course focusing on evidence-based interventions for postpartum emotional distress. All new mothers were screened 9 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). If they scored 12 points or more they were eligible for the study. Mothers answered the EPDS at three different points in time, (9, 15 and 24 weeks postpartum) and the Parent Stress Index: Short Form (PSI/SF) at two times (9 and 15 weeks). Results showed no significant difference in the rate of depressive symptoms between study centres at 9 weeks. At 15 and 24 weeks there was, however, a significant difference between mothers at the experimental and control centres. Nurses at the experimental centres documented significantly more evidence-based interventions than did nurses at the control centres, and they had more frequent contact with new mothers suffering from postpartum emotional distress. There was no significant variation in PSI scores between the groups at any time. More women at the experimental centres were on antidepressants compared to the control centres. Of the total of 32 women eligible for the study, 10 declined participation. The findings are limited by small sample size and a probable confounding effect of antidepressants with the nursing interventions.

187,"BACKGROUND: Previous reports suggest that sarcoidosis occurs with abnormally high frequency in firefighters. We sought to determine whether exposure to World Trade Center (WTC) 'dust' during the collapse and rescue/recovery effort increased the incidence of sarcoidosis or 'sarcoid-like' granulomatous pulmonary disease (SLGPD). METHODS: During the 5 years after the WTC disaster, enrollees in the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) WTC monitoring and treatment programs who had chest radiograph findings suggestive of sarcoidosis underwent evaluation, including the following: chest CT imaging, pulmonary function, provocative challenge, and biopsy. Annual incidence rates were compared to the 15 years before the WTC disaster. RESULTS: After WTC dust exposure, pathologic evidence consistent with new-onset sarcoidosis was found in 26 patients: all 26 patients had intrathoracic adenopathy, and 6 patients (23%) had extrathoracic disease. Thirteen patients were identified during the first year after WTC dust exposure (incidence rate, 86/100,000), and 13 patients were identified during the next 4 years (average annual incidence rate, 22/100,000; as compared to 15/100,000 during the 15 years before the WTC disaster). Eighteen of 26 patients (69%) had findings consistent with asthma. Eight of 21 patients (38%) agreeing to challenge testing had airway hyperreactivity (AHR), findings not seen in FDNY sarcoidosis patients before the WTC disaster. CONCLUSION: After the WTC disaster, the incidence of sarcoidosis or SLGPD was increased among FDNY rescue workers. This new information about the early onset of WTC-SLGPD and its association with asthma/AHR has important public health consequences for disease prevention, early detection, and treatment following environmental/occupational exposures.","G.

188,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to compare the intubation success rates of etomidate and midazolam when used for sedative-facilitated intubation, without paralytics, in out-of-hospital adult patients. METHODS: This prospective, double-blind, randomized trial was conducted with 2 ground out-of-hospital advanced life support systems (ALS); all patients aged 18 or older who required out-of-hospital sedative-facilitated intubation were eligible for participation. The ambulances were stocked with blinded numbered syringes containing either 7 mg of midazolam or 20 mg of etomidate. No paralytics were used. If sedation was not achieved with the study drug, medics could request additional sedation from a medical command physician; only midazolam or diazepam were available outside of the study. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients were enrolled in the study; 55 patients received midazolam and 55 patients received etomidate. The 2 groups were similar with regard to age, sex, initial vital signs, and reasons for intubation or sedation. The overall intubation success rate was 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 68% to 84%); 75% (41/55) for midazolam (95% CI 64% to 86%) and 76% (42/55) for etomidate (95% CI 65% to 87%). There was also no difference in incidence of hypotension, number of intubation attempts, or perceived difficulty of intubation. Additional sedation was requested almost equally for the 2 groups: 14 patients in the midazolam group and 12 patients in the etomidate group. A benzodiazepine was successful for rescue of a failed etomidate intubation 10 of 12 times (83%; 95% CI 62% to 100%). When used for rescue of failed midazolam intubations, benzodiazepines were effective in only 5 of 14 (36%, 95% CI 11% to 61%) attempts. CONCLUSION: There were no observed differences between midazolam and etomidate in sedation-facilitated intubation success rates; we could not fully evaluate global outcomes of these agents or the sedative-facilitated intubation strategy itself.","J.

189,"This study was undertaken to identify the role of six facets of trait-emotional intelligence (EI) in men's aggressive tendencies toward intimate partners ( N = 131). Consistent with past research, hierarchical regression showed emotional self-regulation and empathy were negatively and uniquely predictive of four self-reported aggressive tendencies: physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility. Canonical correlations yielded two distinct patterns of relationships between EI and aggressive tendencies. The first canonical correlation supported an overall negative relationship, especially involving dependent variables anger and hostility. A second canonical correlation revealed higher physical and verbal aggression were associated with higher emotional self-recognition, regulation of others' emotions, nonverbal emotional expression, and lower empathy. Findings support a multidimensional understanding of EI and aggressive tendencies.","Anna Jaffe, Daniel Simonet, Robert Tett, Rachael Swopes, Joanne Davis (2015).

191,"Context: In April 2015, a major earthquake struck northern regions of Nepal affecting one-third of the population, and many suffered mental health problems. Aims: This study aimed to conduct a preliminary investigation of prevalence and feasibility of brief therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among earthquake survivors. Settings and Design: This is an exploratory cross-sectional study of prevalence and feasibility of brief trauma-focused therapy for PTSD among survivors 3 and '' months after the earthquake in affected areas near Kathmandu. Methodology: A team of local nonspecialist mental health volunteers was trained to identify survivors with PTSD using the PTSD checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (PCL-5) (cutoff score 38). They were trained to deliver either shortened versions of narrative exposure therapy (NET)-revised or group-based control-focused behavioral treatment (CFBT). Results: Altogether, 333 survivors were surveyed (130 in July 2015 and 203 in March 2016) with PCL-5 as the screening instrument, using the cutoff score of 38 or more for diagnosing PTSD. A PTSD prevalence of 33% was noted in 2015 and 28.5% in 2016. This drop of 4.5% prevalence in the intervening 8 months suggests that a significant number of survivors are still suffering from PTSD. Most participants were female, aged 40 or above, married, and poorly educated. Compared to the brief (four sessions) individual NET-revised, a group-based CFBT was found more acceptable and affordable. Conclusions: PTSD is common following earthquake trauma, and if untreated, survivors continue to suffer for a long time. Management of PTSD should be included in future disaster management plans.","Arun Jha, Suraj Shakya, Zang Yinyin, Nishita Pathak, Prabhat Kiran Pradhan, Khem Raj Bhatta, Sabitri Sthapit, Shanta Niraula, Rajesh Nehete (2017).

Few studies, however, have attempted to examine factors that may contribute to this lack of agreement. This study addressed this gap by examining youth and maternal-reported youth traumatic event exposure using a sample of 100 urban, African American adolescent-maternal dyads. Cumulative report of youth potentially traumatic event exposure (57%) was higher than youth (41%) and maternal (27%) reports. Findings indicate that there was agreement for sexual assault, being shot or stabbed, and auto accidents. Maternal depression was the only factor that was associated with both youth and maternal report of youth qualifying event. Other factors that distinguished youth reports included maternal event exposure, substance use disorder, antisocial personality behaviors, and youth reports of arguments with the mother and running away from home.

The incidence of MVA was 11 %. More than 50 % of the accident victim sub-sample reported hyperarousal, with exaggerated startle, intrusive recollections, situational avoidance, emotional reactivity, and cognitive avoidance. The high incidence of trauma-related symptoms is noteworthy given 59 % of victims reported sustaining no or mild accident injury, and only 27 % were admitted to hospital for severe injury. Trauma-related symptoms were related to measures of injury severity, psychological and social functioning, and persistent medical problems. Pre- and post-accident factors, that is, experience of additional trauma, experience of stressful life events and post-accident social contact were the most important predictors of trauma-related symptoms severity.

To examine barriers that mental health case managers experience in implementing homework and to identify strategies to promote successful homework administration. Method. One hundred thirty-four surveys were completed by mental health case managers. The survey examined their use of homework for individuals diagnosed with a severe mental health problem. It also asked them to identify barriers to regularly implement homework and describe strategies to promote more regular use of homework. Results. On average, homework was used at 50%% of clinical contacts. The primary reasons for not using homework included allocating insufficient time at appointments, perceived client resistance for using homework and concerns that the client was too unwell. Strategies used to overcome these difficulties included prioritising the use of homework and ensuring that homework assignments were achievable. Conclusions. Clinicians are able to identify a range of practical strategies to promote the use of homework. Discussion focuses on the application of the suggested strategies to promote regular use of homework. This includes discussion of possible training approaches to enhance systematic homework administration.","Peter J. Kelly, Frank P. Deane (2011).

202,"Purpose This study examined the factor structure of the Injustice Experience Questionnaire (IEQ; Sullivan et al. in J Occup Rehabil 18:249-261, ) using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Two models were proposed for analysis: a single factor and a two-factor model. Methods A total of 150 participants (81 males and 69 females, mean age = 45.48 years, SD = 10.71), with a chronic work-related musculoskeletal disorder (53 % back condition), and a mean duration of work disability of 4.34 years (SD = 5.14), completed the IEQ and measures of depression and anger. CFA was performed on the IEQ data using the maximum likelihood estimation method. Results Neither proposed model provided an acceptable fit; however, a good fitting model with two highly correlated factors and one error covariance was derived through post hoc model fitting. The two-factors were differentially correlated to depression and duration of work disability, but not anger. Conclusions The IEQ appears to be a useful tool to support the comprehensive psychosocial assessment of injured workers with long-term disability secondary to a musculoskeletal disorder. In addition to identifying perceived injustice, the IEQ may also be used to inform the choice of psychological interventions. The IEQ has construct validity and generalizability across different populations of injured workers.","Linda Kennedy, Debra Dunstan (2014).

203,"AIMS: This paper reviews available literature regarding the effectiveness, safety and utility of intranasal (i.n.) naloxone for the treatment of heroin overdose. METHODS: Scientific literature in the form of published articles during the period January 1984 to August 2007 were identified by searching several databases including Medline, Cinahl and Embase for the following terms: naloxone, narcan, intranasal, nose. The data extracted included study design, patient selection, numbers, outcomes and adverse events. RESULTS: Reports of the pharmacological investigation and administration of i.n. naloxone for heroin overdose are included in this review. Treatment of heroin overdose by administration of i.n. naloxone has been introduced as first-line treatment in some jurisdictions in North America, and is currently under investigation in Australia. CONCLUSION: Currently there is not enough evidence to support i.n. naloxone as first-line intervention by paramedics for treatment of heroin overdose in the pre-hospital setting. Further research is required to confirm its clinical effectiveness, safety and utility. If proved effective, the i.n. route may be useful for drug administration in community settings (including peer-based administration), as it reduces risk of needlestick injury in a population at higher risk of blood-borne viruses. Problematically, naloxone is not manufactured currently in an ideal form for i.n. administration.","D. Kerr, P. Dietze, A. Kelly (2008).

204,"Aims: Primary: to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous sedation for cardiac procedures administered by non-anesthesia personnel. Secondary: to assess cost effectiveness of such sedation.Methods: Anesthesiologists trained non-anesthesia personnel, and established our sedation protocol, which was then used in 9,558 patients who had cardiac procedures with sedation by non-anesthesia personnel, recorded on a computerized database. Most sedation used was midazolam (MID) and morphine (MOR). Complications and problems were derived from the database and quality assurance committee records. Doses were based on desired level of sedation and procedure duration; highest dose used: MID 78 mg, MOR 84 mg.Results: Data included catheterization (n = 3,819) and transesophageal echo procedures (n = 260); and overall electrophysiology (n = 5,479) and selected subsets. There were complications or problems in only 9 patients (0.1%), a strong safety statement. There were 3 deaths in electrophysiology related procedures, 2 deaths in catheterization related procedures, all in very sick patients and not definitely related to sedation; 4 others developed clinical instability (hives, hypotension and heart failure-all with no sequellae), 2 of which needed reversal medications. Three patients (<0.03%) proved difficult to sedate, and their procedures were completed with help from the anesthesia department; by protocol this was not a complication. A total of $5,365,691 was saved during the last decade on cardiac procedures performed with conscious sedation.Conclusion: Non-anesthesia personnel can administer intravenous sedation for cardiac procedures in cardiac settings, with safety and cost-effectiveness demonstrated over many years.

206,"In Japan, suicide has long been depicted as an act of free will, even aestheticized in the cultural notion suicide of resolve. Amid the record-high Japanese suicide rates since the 1990s, however, Japanese psychiatrists have been working to medicalize suicide and, in the process, confronting this deeply ingrained cultural notion. Drawing on two years of fieldwork at psychiatric institutions around Tokyo, I examine how psychiatrists try to persuade patients of the pathological nature of their suicidal intentions and how patients respond to such medicalization. I also explore psychiatrists' ambivalent attitudes toward pathologizing suicide and how they limit their biomedical jurisdiction by treating only what they regard as biological anomaly, while carefully avoiding the psychological realm. One ironic consequence of this medicalization may be that psychiatrists are reinforcing the dichotomy between normal and pathological, ""pure"" and ""trivial,"" suicides, despite their clinical knowledge of the tenuousness of such distinctions and the ephemerality of human intentionality. Thus, while the medicalization of suicide is cultivating a conceptual space for Japanese to debate how to bring the suicidal back onto the side of life, it scarcely seems poised to supplant the cultural discourse on suicide that has elevated suicide to a moral act of self-determination.","J.

207,"Background The impact of staff and service user gender on responses of staff in intellectual disability (ID) services is poorly understood. The present study set out to assess the role of gender in influencing staff emotions, attributions and behavioural intentions in response to aggression displayed by adults with ID. Method A new scale measuring staff behavioural intentions was developed. A two × two (staff gender × service user gender) between subjects design was used to compare the responses of day and residential support staff to physical aggression by a hypothetical service user. In response to a vignette depicting a service user with ID assaulting a member of staff, 160 respondents completed measures of affective responses, causal attributions and behavioural intentions while imagining themselves as the target of the service user's assault. Results Female participants reported feeling more fear/anxiety, more depression/anger and less confident/relaxed than male participants. The longer staff had worked with people with ID, the more likely they were to favour safety-focused behaviours. More confident female participants were less likely to favour safety-focused behaviours, but confidence had no effect on male participants' endorsement of these behaviours. Increased confidence in both was associated with lower agreement of safety-focused behaviours in relation to the female vignette, regardless of participant gender. The more control women believed the service user had over their behaviour, the more likely they were to choose safety-focused behaviours. Punitive behaviours were favoured more in response to the male rather than the female service user. Punitive behaviours were also favoured more by more junior staff and by participants who expected feeling more depressed/angry in response to the vignettes. Conclusions Both staff and service user gender influenced staff responses to aggression, yet the latter played a smaller role than expected. The role of gender in staff-service user interactions should be the focus of further research and should be considered in service delivery.","I. Kleinberg, K. Scior (2014).

This medical anthropology study describes the process of identifying Nepali idioms of distress and local ethnopsychology and ethnophysiology models that promote effective communication about psychological trauma in a manner that minimizes stigma for service users. Psychological trauma is shown to be a multifaceted concept that has no single linguistic corollary in the Nepali study population. Respondents articulated different categories of psychological trauma idioms in relation to impact on the heart-mind, brain-mind, body, spirit, and social status, with differences in perceived types of traumatic events, symptom sets, emotion clusters and vulnerability. Trauma survivors felt blamed for experiencing negative events, which were seen as karma transmitting past life sins or family member sins into personal loss. Some families were reluctant to seek care for psychological trauma because of the stigma of revealing this bad karma. In addition, idioms related to brain-mind dysfunction contributed to stigma, while heart-mind distress was a socially acceptable reason for seeking treatment. Different categories of trauma idioms support the need for multidisciplinary treatment with multiple points of service entry.","B. A. Kohrt, D. J. Hruschka, Brandon A. Kohrt, Daniel J.

Behavioral treatment programs appear to be effective in managing these co-existing problems, such as domestic violence and substance abuse. However, evidence-supported interventions are rarely exemplified in complicated clinical cases, especially within child welfare settings. Therefore, in this case example, we describe the process of adapting an evidence-supported treatment to assist in managing significant co-existing health-related problems in a mother who was referred due to child neglect and drug abuse. At the conclusion of therapy, the participant reported improvements in perceived family relationships, illicit drug use, child maltreatment potential, whereas other health-related outcomes were mixed. Most improvements were maintained at 4-month follow-up. Issues relevant to implementing evidence-based treatments within community contexts are discussed, including methods of increasing the likelihood of valid outcome assessment, managing treatment integrity, and adjusting standardized treatments to accommodate co-occurring problems.

217,"OBJECTIVES: This article presents a study of naturally occurring attributions recorded by care staff following incidents of restraint in a psychiatric secure unit. The relationship between control for patient, control for staff and behavioural outcomes including use of medication, seclusion and duration of restraint were explored for male and female patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: In all, 557 forms documenting incidents of control and restraint, and completed over a four-year period by nurses in a UK psychiatric hospital, were content analysed using the Leeds Attributional Coding System (LACS; Munton, Silvester, & Hanks, 1999). Additional information concerning duration of restraint, severity of injuries sustained by patient and care staff, use of medication and seclusion, and patient was also gathered. It was hypothesized that perceived patient control over causes of the restraint incident would be associated with duration of restraint, use of seclusion and medication. It was also predicted that male patients would be perceived as having more control over incidents, and thus be more likely to be secluded and less likely to be prescribed medication, than female patients. RESULTS: Seclusion was associated with controllable attributions for patient and uncontrollable attributions for care staff. Use of medication was associated with uncontrollable attributions for patient, but only for male patients. Contrary to prediction, female patients were more likely to be secluded than males and less likely to receive medication. Staff were also more likely to state that they had 'no explanation' for restraint incidents involving female patients. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation of naturally occurring attributions raises important questions regarding the relationship between patient gender and attributional models of helping behaviour. The results are discussed in terms of their potential implications for future research and health care practice.","J. Leggett, J. Silvester (2003).

220,"Introduction This study aimed to investigate the impact of psychological symptoms on return to work (RTW) in workers after occupational injuries. Methods Our study candidates were injured workers who were hospitalized for 3 days or longer and received hospitalization benefits from the Labor Insurance. A self-reported questionnaire including Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-50) and RTW was sent to workers at 12 weeks after injury. At 1 year, all participants were contacted again to determine whether or not they had RTW. Results A total of 2001 workers completed the questionnaire (response rate 45.5 %) at 12 weeks after injury, among them, 1,149 had returned to work. Among the 852 who were unable to return to work at 12 weeks after injury, 225 reportedly returned to work by 1 year. A proportional hazards regression indicated that after adjusting for all possible risk factors, higher scores in BSRS-50 and BSRS-5 at 12 weeks after injury were significant risk factors for not return to work (NRTW) at 1 year after injury. Other risk factors were gender, education level, length of hospitalization, affected physical appearance, and injury type. Among 10 psycho-physiological symptoms of BSRS-50, a proportional hazards regression indicated that high score in phobic-anxiety scale was a risk factor for NRTW. Conclusions After considering all other factors, psychological symptoms further predicted poorer probability of returning to work after occupational injury, and phobic-anxiety was the most significant symptom predicting poor RTW. Development of preventive measures among injured workers according to the risk factors identified in this study is warranted.","Kuan-Han Lin, Nai-Wen Guo, Shu-Chu Shiao, Shih-Cheng Liao, Pei-Yi Hu, Jin-Huei Hsu, Yaw-Huei Hwang, Yue Guo (2013).

221,"Young injecting drug users (IDUs) in Australia are a group about whom little is known. It is suggested, however, that their drug using behaviours and life styles put them at particular risk for HIV/AIDS. Data collected in Perth from 195 respondents in the Australian National AIDS and Injecting Drug Use Study was analyzed with emphasis on the distinctions between young and older injecting drug users. It was found that, relative to those aged 23 or over, IDUs under 23 used more stimulants and LSD and fewer opiates and benzodiazepines; were more likely to inject all or most of their drugs; were less likely to have been in treatment; had more sex partners; were less likely to have changed their drug taking behaviour because of AIDS; were less likely to use alone; shared needles less frequently but shared at least some of the time; and had less knowledge of AIDS and were more pessimistic about the long term outcomes of AIDS. Such characteristics need to be taken into account if effective intervention and prevention strategies for this group are planned.","W. Loxley, A. Marsh (1991).

222,"The aim of this study was two-fold: first, to examine both the immediate and the lasting effects of presenteeism on health; second, to explore the moderating effect of self-efficacy on the presenteeism-health relationship in a Chinese context. We employed a two-wave study design in which presenteeism, health (i.e. physical health, mental health and exhaustion), and self-efficacy were assessed at Time 1; health was measured again at Time 2 three months later. We surveyed a diverse sample of 345 full-time Chinese employees working in Taiwan and mainland China. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that presenteeism over the previous six months was negatively related to employees' physical health, mental health and exhaustion at Time 1. However, we found no association between presenteeism and health at Time 2, after controlling for the baseline level of health, indicating that presenteeism may not have a lasting effect. Self-efficacy was found to moderate the relationships between presenteeism and all three aspects of health at Time 2, suggesting that for some individuals presenteeism may not on balance be a bad thing. The study sheds light on the association between presenteeism and health. The findings on self-efficacy also extend the literature to incorporate individual characteristics in the presenteeism context.","Luo Lu, Si-Qing Peng, Hui Yen Lin, Cary L. Cooper (2014).

223,"Differences among workers and workplace stressors both contribute to perceiving work as stressful. However, the relative importance of these sources to work stress is not well delineated. Moreover, the extent to which work stress additionally reflects unique matches between specific workers and particular job stressors is also unclear. In this study, we use generalizability theory to specify and compare sources of variance in stress associated with police work. US police officers (N = 115) provided ratings of 60 stressors commonly associated with policing duties. Primary and secondary stress appraisal ratings reflected differences among officers in tendencies to generally perceive work stressors as stressful (14–15% officer effect), and also agreement among officers in viewing some stressors as more stressful than others (18–19% stressor effect). However, ratings especially reflected distinct pairings of officers and stressors (38–41% interaction effect). Additional analyses revealed individual differences and stressor characteristics associated with each variance component, including an officer × stressor interaction – compared to officers low in neuroticism, highly neurotic officers provided lower primary appraisal ratings of stressors generally seen as not serious, and also higher primary appraisal ratings of stressors that were seen as serious. We discuss implications of the current approach for the continued study of stress at work.","Todd Lucas, Nathan Weidner, James Janisse (2012).  Where does work stress come from?

The majority of workers (82%) directly experienced the traumatic event while the rest witnessed the event. Over half (54%) of those directly experiencing the event were involved in armed robberies, whereas 38% were physically or verbally assaulted in nonrobbery situations. Almost half of the workers were assigned a coexisting mood or anxiety diagnosis. Psychoactive medication was prescribed to 66% of workers, and 93% of all workers received some form of psychological/psychiatric treatment. Twenty-three percent of the group received vocational rehabilitation assistance and only 43% returned to their previous job with the accident employer.

225,"OBJECTIVES: The study applied Weiner's (1980, 1986) attributional model of helping behaviour to Accident and Emergency (A&E) staff's care of patients presenting with deliberate self-harm. It was hypothesized that where staff attributed precipitants of the act of deliberate self-harm to controllable, internal, and stable patient factors, then staff would display greater negative affect, less optimism, and less willingness to help the patient. DESIGN: Using four hypothetical scenarios in a two-factor between-subjects design, contextual factors describing a self-harm patient were manipulated. METHOD: Participants were 89 A&E medical and nursing staff. They were asked to rate attributions for the cause of the deliberate self-harm and their emotional responses, optimism for change, and willingness to help change the behaviour. Their general attitudes towards deliberate self-harm patients and perceived needs for training in the care of these patients were also assessed. RESULTS: The findings were consistent with Weiner's attributional model of helping. The greater attributions of controllability, the greater the negative affect of staff towards the person, and the less the propensity to help. The higher the ratings of stability of outcome, the less staff optimism for the success of their input. Male staff and medical staff had more negative attitudes, and medical staff saw less need for further training. CONCLUSION: Formulating A&E staff's responses to deliberate self-harm using a cognitive-emotional model offers the possibility of working with staffs' beliefs, emotions, and behaviour to improve the care and treatment of deliberate self-harm patients.","N.

227,"Violence victims who are the primary caregivers for their children sometimes become justice-involved through efforts to protect and defend against intimate partner violence (IPV). Judges often mandate these victims to community-based services, although little is known about these services. Given increasing numbers of such victims, two human service agencies collaborated to create a program for female IPV victims who were their children's primary caregivers and who were mandated to services for violence against a male partner. Our research team conducted a feasibility study of the program using an exploratory qualitative study design to collect data from program participants ( n = 18) and providers ( n = 7). Analyses determined three key findings: (a) the importance of a welcoming, comfortable environment; (b) the value of certain aspects of the program content; and (c) the importance of support from like others for participant improvement. These findings point to indispensable program elements. Implications for other communities and providers serving justice-involved IPV victims who are also primary caregivers are described.","Rebecca Macy, Dania Ermentrout, Cynthia Rizo (2012).

229,"The Department of Health (DoH) published a set of good practice implementation guidelines on dual diagnosis in May 2002. This guidance suggests that in order to improve the prognosis for clients who have mental health problems and who drink or take drugs problematically, mental health and substance misuse services should adopt an integrated service model. There is a considerable amount of American-based research supporting this approach, but little evidence from the UK researchers demonstrating its application in the UK. This article offers an example of a service that has been developed in the city of Nottingham and argues that this client group will be served most effectively if mental health services support specialist dual-diagnosis resources. Integrated care pathways for this client group can be developed and led by specialist clinicians acting as consultants to mental health services (DoH, 2002a). This consultancy role within mental health services enhances the links needed between substance misuse and mental health services. As a result, specialist dual-diagnosis teams are best placed to increase positive prognoses for clients by ensuring evidence-based substance misuse skills are utilized and adapted by mental health teams to ensure fully integrated care coordination.","D.

231,"OBJECTIVES: To identify factors significantly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression at 3 months post-injury; to develop a generic model to predict the occurrence of PTSD, anxiety, and depression at 3 months post-injury; and to validate this model in a test data set of patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Participants were 823 patients attending an emergency department (ED) following accidental injury. Baseline questionnaires were completed, with 1 and 3 months postal follow-ups. Predictor variables demonstrating significant associations with two of the three outcome measures (3-month HAD anxiety and depression scores and PTSD symptoms) were included in multivariate regression models for each outcome. Non-significant predictor variables were removed until all remaining independent variables made the most significant contribution to each of the three models. Models were validated using a test dataset. RESULTS: Previous history of mental health problems, neuroticism score and having PTSD symptoms at 1 month predicted adverse outcomes at 3 months. When used on the test datasets, the areas under the receiver operating curve (ROC) curve for the models predicting outcomes at 3 months were: PTSD=0.91 (sensitivity=88.5%); anxiety=0.87 (sensitivity=93.7%); and depression=0.87 (sensitivity=96.7%).

232,"OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of psychological morbidity among injured patients admitted to an Emergency Department (ED). DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were consecutive male ED attenders. 210 (97.7%) patients consented to participate. At one month, 128 (61.0%) responded, at six months, 114 (54.3%), at eighteen months 96 (45.7%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures immediately following injury were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the McGill pain questionnaire. Recovery at one month was recorded using the SF-36 Health Survey, COPE scale, Perceived Stress Scale and Revised Impact of Events Scale. At six and eighteen months outcome was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (28 items) and Revised Impact of Events Scale. Multivariate analysis identified pre-morbid, accident-related and recovery factors influencing outcome at six and eighteen months. RESULTS: The strongest predictors of outcome were initial levels of anxiety and depression, prior history of mental health problems, early PTSD symptoms and involvement in litigation. These factors predicted between 40-60% of the variance at six months (p<0.001), and 50-60% of the variance in psychological distress at eighteen months (p<0.001).

Methods An open, uncontrolled trial (feasibility study) was conducted among patients treated in Montreal family practices. Eligible patients were aged 40 years or over, had one or more of the targeted chronic physical illnesses for at least 6 months (arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and were evaluated as having at least mild depressive symptoms (a score of⩾5 onthe 9- item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9). Participants received a package of six self-care tools (information booklet, video, Internet programme, action plan, workbook and mood-monitoring tool) with telephone support by a lay coach for up to 6 months. Results In total, 63 eligible patients provided written consent and completed the baseline interview; 57 (90%) and 55 (87%) patients completed 2-month and 6-month follow-up interviews, respectively. The mean number of telephone calls made by coaches to participants was 10.5 (SD 4.0), and the average length of these calls was 10.6 minutes.

Significant differences were found on only one measure. Content analysis also revealed differences in identification of stimuli that evoked anxiety. Examination of qualitative data provided further support for a conceptual model using a cognitive perspective. Overall, results indicated that childhood sexual abuse can be considered a traumatic event that can result in symptoms similar to those demonstrated by individuals who have experienced war-related trauma.

239,"Background Job stress and cumulative exposure to traumatic events experienced by critical care nurses can lead to psychological distress and the development of burnout syndrome and posttraumatic stress disorder. Resilience can mitigate symptoms associated with these conditions. Objective To identify factors that affect resilience and to determine if the factors have direct or indirect effects on resilience in development of posttraumatic stress disorder. Methods Data from 744 respondents to a survey mailed to 3500 critical care nurses who were members of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses were analyzed. Mplus was used to analyze a mediation model. Results Nurses who worked in any type of intensive care unit other than the medical unit and had high scores for resilience were 18% to 50% less likely to experience posttraumatic stress disorder than were nurses with low scores. Nurses with a graduate degree in nursing were 18% more likely to experience posttraumatic stress disorder than were nurses with a bachelor's degree. Conclusion Because of their effects on resilience, working in a medical intensive care unit and having a graduate degree may influence the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. Future research is needed to better understand the impact of resilience on health care organizations, development of preventive therapies and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder for critical care nurses, and the most appropriate mechanism to disseminate and implement strategies to address posttraumatic stress disorder.","Meredith Mealer (2017).

In this research, we examined the role of depressive symptoms as a moderator in the relationship between interpersonal conflict at work and psychological and physical well-being. We assumed that people with relatively high levels of chronic depressive symptoms react particularly strongly to conflict. We tested our hypotheses with a cross-sectional study (N= 218) and with a diary study over two weeks (N= 127). Both studies were conducted in Switzerland. The results of both studies showed that conflict was related to impaired psychological well-being (depressive mood and job satisfaction) and physical well-being (somatic complaints). In line with our assumption, this effect was particularly strong for people with high levels of chronic depressive symptoms. Thus, our findings suggest that conflict may lead to depressive symptoms, which make people even more vulnerable to conflicts, indicating a vicious circle with high psychological and economic costs.","Laurenz L.

244,"Ukraine has one of the most severe HIV/AIDS epidemics in Europe, with an estimated 1.63% of the population living with HIV/AIDS in 2007. Injection drug use (IDU) remains the predominant mode of transmission in Kiev - the capital and largest city. Prior reports suggest that the HIV infection rate among IDUs in Kiev reaches 33%, and many have poor and inequitable access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Among those with access to HAART, little is understood about barriers and facilitators to HAART medication adherence. In May 2009, two semi-structured focus groups were conducted with HIV-infected IDUs seeking treatment at the City AIDS Center, Kiev. The goal was to use this information to adapt and tailor, to Ukrainian culture, an evidence-based intervention for improving adherence to HAART. All 16 participants attributed HIV infection to IDU. Their average age was 31.6 (SD=7.0), average time with HIV 5.7 years (SD=4.0), average time on HAART 2.5 years (SD=1.7), average time as IDU 14.6 years (SD=6.8), and 88% were on opioid substitution therapy. The most salient themes related to adherence barriers included: (1) harassment and discrimination by police; (2) opioid dependence; (3) complexity of drug regimen; (4) side effects; (5) forgetting; (6) co-occurring mental health problems; and (7) HIV stigma. Facilitators of adherence included: (1) cues for pill taking; (2) support and reminders from family, significant other, and friends; (3) opioid substitution therapy; and (4) wanting improved health. Additional factors explored included: (1) knowledge about HAART; (2) storage of medications; and (3) IDU and sexual risk behaviors. Findings highlighted structural and individual barriers to adherence. At the structural level, police discrimination and harassment was reported to be a major barrier to adherence to opioid substitution therapy and HAART. Privacy and stigma were barriers at the individual level. Recommendations for adherence interventions included education, training, and identification cards to show police that medication was for treatment of HIV, not for abuse; and involving family members and other systems of support for HIV treatment.","M.

Seeking Safety (SS) is an evidence-based behavioral therapy model for this comorbidity. This article reports results of a study of SS conducted in a military setting. Our pilot trial addressed outcomes, feasibility, and satisfaction. SS was conducted as is to evaluate its impact without adaptation for military culture. The sample was 24 outpatient service members (from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines) with 33% minority representation. Inclusion criteria were current PTSD and/or SUD. Ten clinicians participated in this study after receiving SS training. Results showed significant improvements on most outcomes, including substance use on the Brief Addiction Monitor; PTSD symptoms on the PTSD Checklist-Military Version (total and criterion D); and the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40 (sexual abuse trauma index and anxiety subscale); functioning on the Sheehan Disability Scale (total and family subscale); psychopathology on the Zung Depression Scale total; the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS)-24 (total and subscales depression functioning, emotional liability, and psychosis); and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (total and anxiety subscale); and coping on the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale (total).

252,"This paper reports on evaluation of an initiative to use paramedics as the first-level mental health counsellors of abused women in rural Bangladesh (2003-2004) from the perspective of the abused women who participated in one or more counselling sessions. Thirty in-depth interviews, followed by a survey(n=372), targeted to cover all participants, were conducted in 2006. Overall, the arrangement, management of ethical issues, and skills of paramedics were rated favourably. Most (89%) abused women (n=372) considered the session useful; one-fourth of these women considered it very useful; and only a few abused women considered the session useless. Usefulness of the session was expressed mostly in terms of relief attained after talking about the issue. Most (87%) women reported being encouraged to be self-confident. In a context characterized by low self-confidence of women, lack of opportunity to talk about violence, and absence of professional mental health counselling services, this initiative is sufficiently promising to warrant further testing.","R.

New techniques were used to demonstrate the detectable persistence of mustard metabolites in the patient's blood for at least 41 days after exposure, validating these techniques for the first time for a human mustard patient; they were also used for the first time with human mustard blister fluid. The techniques extend eightfold the period of time that mustard exposure can be definitively diagnosed, compared with previous techniques. Although this patient's lesions were never life-threatening, he required 2 weeks of intensive burn care. He has been left with ongoing posttraumatic stress disorder and has had an incomplete dermatological recovery.

254,"Inasmuch as research has held the increase in youth gang activities responsi ble for the escalating level of crime and delinquency in Chinese societies, ascertaining risk or protective factors of gang involvement among Chinese youths is crucial. The factors include those associated with social control, social learning, and cognitive development. To investigate these factors across different sociocultural contexts, we surveyed delinquents in three diverse Chinese cities-Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. Because of the sociocultural differences among the three cities, social control by parents and cognitive development are likely to be greater protective factors in terms of youths' gang involvement in Hong Kong, while social control by teachers is likely to be a greater protective factor in mainland cities. Results bear out these hypotheses.","N. Ngai, C. Cheung, S. S. Ngai (2007).

256,"OBJECTIVES: We examined whether retail tobacco outlet density was related to youth cigarette smoking after control for a diverse range of neighborhood characteristics. METHODS: Data were gathered from 2116 respondents (aged 11 to 23 years) residing in 178 census tracts in Chicago, Ill. Propensity score stratification methods for continuous exposures were used to adjust for potentially confounding neighborhood characteristics, thus strengthening causal inferences. RESULTS: Retail tobacco outlets were disproportionately located in neighborhoods characterized by social and economic disadvantage. In a model that excluded neighborhood confounders, a marginally significant effect was found. Youths in areas at the highest 75th percentile in retail tobacco outlet density were 13% more likely (odds ratio [OR]=1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.99, 1.28) to have smoked in the past month compared with those living at the lowest 25th percentile. However, the relation became stronger and significant (OR=0.21; 95% CI=1.04, 1.41) after introduction of tract-level confounders and was statistically significant in the propensity score-adjusted model (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.001, 1.44).

The current study of 505 college students who drink examines the relationships among self-reported stress, drinking related problems (socioemotional and community-related), and gender with three distinct drinking contexts, (convivial, intimate and negative coping). Results support the direct relationship between stress and excessive drinking across all three contexts, but also show that stress and self-reported social-emotional drinking problems interact to predict drinking to cope with negative emotions. Men with greater self-reported stress also appear more likely to drink to cope with negative emotions.

263,"Purpose: Many of the events that cause spinal cord injury (SCI) are traumatic events that can result in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It therefore appears that most persons with SCI are at risk for developing PTSD. This study retrospectively examined risk factors for PTSD symptoms in a sample of 71 persons with SCI. Method: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was used to assess full and partial PTSD diagnoses. Self-administered questionnaires were used to measure potential risk factors. Results: Results indicated that 11% of the participants met the criteria for full PTSD, and an additional 20% met the criteria for partial PTSD at some point after their SCI. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed that trauma history, peritraumatic reactions, and intolerance of uncertainty predicted the number of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of trauma history, peritraumatic reactions, and intolerance of uncertainty in the development of PTSD symptoms. Patients at risk for PTSD should be identified early in the rehabilitation process and could benefit from psychological interventions with the aim of preventing PTSD development.","Catherine Otis, André Marchand, Frédérique Courtois (2012).

267,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections have emerged as a major infectious disease threat in recent decades as a result of the significant mortality of pseudomonal pneumonia and bacteraemia, and the evolving resistance exhibited by the pathogen to numerous antibacterials. Pseudomonas possesses a large genome; thus, the pathogen is environmentally adaptable, metabolically flexible, able to overcome antibacterial pressure by selecting for resistant strains and even able to accumulate resistance mechanisms, leading to multidrug resistance (MDR), an increasingly recognized therapeutic challenge. In fact, most research currently does not focus on maximizing the efficacy of available antibacterials; rather, it focuses on maximizing their ecological safety. The elderly population may be particularly prone to pseudomonal infection as a result of increased co-morbidities (such as diabetes mellitus and structural lung disease), the presence of invasive devices such as urinary catheters and feeding tubes, polypharmacy that includes antibacterials, and immune compromise related to age. However, age per se, as well as residence in nursing homes, may not predispose individuals to an increased risk for pseudomonal infection. On the other hand, age has been repeatedly outlined as a risk factor for MDR pseudomonal infections. The severity of pseudomonal infections necessitates prompt administration of appropriate antibacterials upon suspicion. Progress has been made in recognizing risk factors for P. aeruginosa infections both in hospitalized and community-residing patients. Antimicrobial therapy may be instituted as a combination or monotherapy: the debate cannot be definitively resolved since the available data are extracted from studies with varying targeted populations and varying definitions of response, adequacy and MDR. Empirical combination therapy maximizes the chances of bacterial coverage and exerts a lower resistance selection pressure. Although associated with increased percentages of adverse events, mainly as a result of the included aminoglycosides, empirical combination therapy seems a reasonable choice. Upon confirmation of Pseudomonas as the causative agent and awareness of its susceptibility profile, monotherapy is advocated by many, but not all, experts. Infections involving MDR strains can be treated with colistin, which has adequate efficacy and few renal adverse events, or doripenem. In the elderly, in addition to making dose modifications that are needed because of loss of renal function, the prescriber should be more cautious about the use of aminoglycoside-containing regimens, possibly replacing them with a combination of quinolone and a beta-lactam, notwithstanding the possible increased pressure for selection of resistance with the latter combination.","G.

268,"Background: Depression and anxiety disorders are common mental disorders worldwide. The MANAS trial aimed to test the effectiveness of an intervention led by lay health counsellors in primary care settings to improve outcomes of people with these disorders.Methods: In this cluster randomised trial, primary care facilities in Goa, India, were assigned (1:1) by computer-generated randomised sequence to intervention or control (enhanced usual care) groups. All adults who screened positive for common mental disorders were eligible. The collaborative stepped-care intervention offered case management and psychosocial interventions, provided by a trained lay health counsellor, supplemented by antidepressant drugs by the primary care physician and supervision by a mental health specialist. The research assessor was masked. The primary outcome was recovery from common mental disorders as defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems-10th revision (ICD-10) at 6 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00446407.Findings: 24 study clusters, with an equal proportion of public and private facilities, were randomised equally between groups. 1160 of 1360 (85%) patients in the intervention group and 1269 of 1436 (88%) in the control group completed the outcome assessment. Patients with ICD-10-confirmed common mental disorders in the intervention group were more likely to have recovered at 6 months than were those in the control group (n=620 [65·0%] vs 553 [52·9%]; risk ratio 1·22, 95% CI 1·00-1·47; risk difference=12·1%, 95% CI 1·6%-22·5%). The intervention had strong evidence of an effect in public facility attenders (369 [65·9%] vs 267 [42·5%], risk ratio 1·55, 95% CI 1·02-2·35) but no evidence for an effect in private facility attenders (251 [64·1%] vs 286 [65·9%], risk ratio 0·95, 0·74-1·22). There were three deaths and four suicide attempts in the collaborative stepped-care group and six deaths and six suicide attempts in the enhanced usual care group.

279,"This review addresses some of the issues related to women's drinking at a time when this is extremely topical. Evidence suggests that there has been a marked increase in alcohol consumption amongst young women in the United Kingdom (UK). Teenage girls have even been shown to be engaging in 'binge' or 'heavy episodic' drinking more than their male counterparts. Levels of adverse effects, such as liver disease and psychiatric hospital admissions amongst young women have been increasing. Some of the factors associated with these changes are considered. These include changing social roles, feminism, gender stereotypes, occupation and advertising. Some of the powerful positive effects associated with the consumption of beverage alcohol are considered, together with the adverse consequences. The latter include both acute consequences, such as intoxication, injuries and accidents, as well as long-term or chronic consequences, such as liver disease, cancer and alcohol dependence. This review also describes some of the available evidence related to treatment for alcohol problems amongst women including special populations, relapse and the issue of professional training. Finally, the implications for both alcohol control policy and research into alcohol-related issues are considered. It is concluded that existing UK alcohol policies are not fully evidence based.

280,"Occupational therapy is now consistently described as a profession concerned with enabling occupation. A crucial step in enabling occupation is understanding the occupational performance of our clients. Dynamic Performance Analysis (DPA) is a new approach to occupational analysis that focuses on the client's actual performance. DPA, acknowledging that optimal performance is the product of the interaction of person, environment, and occupation, and thus highly individualistic, places the client and his or her occupation, in interaction with the environment, at the center of the analysis process. Embedded in a top-down framework, DPA is a dynamic, iterative process, carried out as the client performs the occupation. The purpose of DPA is to identify where performance breaks down and test out solutions. In this article, the rationale, origins, and basic assumptions of DPA are discussed, and a detailed description of the DPA process together with two clinical examples is presented.","H. J.

281,"This report describes the successful treatment of a 33-year-old Chinese woman who had affect dysregulation and chronic trauma symptoms resulting from an intra-familial childhood sexual abuse. A strategically phased multimodal treatment tailored to the needs of the client was used. The treatment framework consisted of three phases: training on affect management, strengthening the ego and re-processing the trauma. Hypnosis was utilized as a means for grounding and stabilizing the overwhelming emotions; for addressing the negative self-schema; and also for re-processing the traumatic memories in a safe and controlled way. Data from self-reports, observation and objective measures indicates a significant reduction in the trauma symptoms. Copyright © 2007 British Society of Experimental & Clinical Hypnosis.

Supervision is one important way to provide adequate support that focuses on both professional and personal competencies. The inclusion of art therapy principles and practices within supervision further creates a dynamic platform for sustained self-reflection. A 6-week art therapy–based supervision group provided opportunities for developing emotional awareness, recognizing professional strengths, securing collegial relationships, and reflecting on death-related memories. The structure, rationale, and feedback are discussed.","Jordan S. Potash, Faye Chan, Andy H. Y. Ho, Xiao Lu Wang, Carol Cheng (2015).

285,"Group therapy can effectively reduce posttraumatic stress symptoms. However, the available literature on multifaceted programs for military samples is limited and available studies typically do not evaluate outcomes on a broad range of related problems. This study describes a retrospective evaluation of a multimodal, exposure-based group treatment program for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated symptoms in 22 peacekeeping veterans who successfully completed treatment. Treatment consisted of exposure-based CBT, case management, psycho-education, creative arts therapy, psychomotor therapy, psychodrama, and socio-therapy, which were provided one day a week for approximately 21 months. Analysis of pre- and posttreatment assessments showed that coping styles and professional and personality functioning had improved and that anxiety, somatic, depressive, and PTSD symptoms were reduced after treatment. Because significant improvement was observed on several parameters, the program may have successfully addressed a broad range of problems frequently reported by veterans with complex and chronic PTSD.","A.

287,"This article reviews the literature on the efficacy of treatment for voice disorders primarily using studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Voice disorders are defined, their frequency of occurrence across the life span is reported, and their impact on the lives of individuals with voice disorders is documented. The goal of voice treatment is to maximize vocal effectiveness given the existing disorder and to reduce the handicapping effect of the voice problem. Voice treatment may be (a) the preferred treatment to resolve the voice disorder when medical (surgical or pharmacological) treatments are not indicated; (b) the initial treatment in cases where medical treatment appears indicated; it may obviate the need for medical treatment; (c) completed before and after surgical treatment to maximize long-term post-surgical voice; and (d) a preventative treatment to preserve vocal health. Experimental and clinical data are reviewed that support these roles applied to various disorder types: (a) vocal misuse, hyperfunction and muscular imbalance (frequently resulting in edema, vocal nodules, polyps or contact ulcers); (b) medical or physical conditions (e.g., laryngeal nerve trauma, Parkinson disease); and (c) psychogenic disorders (e.g., conversion reactions, personality disorders). Directions for future research are suggested which maximize clinical outcomes and scientific rigor to enhance knowledge on the efficacy of voice treatment.","L. O. Ramig, K. Verdolini (1998).

288,"Nurses working in five Swedish forensic psychiatric units filled in a questionnaire designed for general psychiatric nursing, modified for forensic use. Data reflecting work satisfaction, clinical supervision and nursing activities were analysed. Seven factors were identified. The nurses were most satisfied with 'co-operation', 'information', and 'workrole', and they were less satisfied with relatives' and patients' influence. The focus of clinical supervision was mainly directed towards a patient's mental problems and how to interact with him/her. The nurses preferred that the patients problem should be formulated by the patient, or by the patient and the nurse together. The most salient findings of the present study were: (1) in spite of working in a clinical environment characterised by violent patients and conflict, work satisfaction was almost the same as nurses and occupational therapists in Swedish general psychiatric care; (2) the item with which they were most dissatisfied concerned the patients' relatives involvement in the care process.","M.

289,"Accidentally killing or feeling responsible for another person's death constitutes an event that is different from many typical traumatic stressors in that the responsibility for causing the trauma is located in the person themselves, rather than another person or persons. Research exploring the perspective of those who have accidentally caused a death is extremely sparse. This study aimed to gain an insight into the lived experiences of people who have caused an accidental death. Five participants were recruited through an on-line advertisement; all were drivers directly involved in a road traffic accident that occurred unexpectedly, without intention and resulted in a person's death. An interpretive phenomenological approach was used to analyse data collected through semi-structured interviews. Three main themes emerged from the participants' accounts: trying to make sense of a life changing moment; struggling to cope with the trauma of causing a death, and a changed sense of self. These findings highlight the considerable and enduring trauma associated with causing an accidental death, and emphasise the need to develop appropriate interventions to help alleviate this psychological distress.","Sara B.

291,"Objective: We examined the capacity of the disaster mental health workforce in Victoria, Australia, to provide the three evidence-supported intervention types of psychological first aid, skills for psychological recovery, and intensive mental health treatments. Method: Utilizing data from a cross-professional, state-level disaster mental health workforce survey ( n = 791), we developed composite capacity indicators (CCI) for each intervention and performed logistic regression analyses to examine key predictors of disaster mental health workforce capacity. Results: CCI profiles highlighted significant gaps in the disaster mental health capacity of Victorian providers, with only 32-42% able to deliver current best practice interventions. Key predictors of workforce capacity common and unique to interventions were highlighted. Conclusions: Key strategies to raise Victoria's disaster mental health workforce capacity should focus on targeted multilevel training in best practice interventions, creation of practice opportunities, and structural provider support/engagement. CCIs focused on best practice interventions provide a methodology for rapid workforce capacity assessment that can facilitate disaster preparedness planning, capacity building, and delivery of quality disaster mental health services.","Lennart Reifels, Lucio Naccarella, Grant Blashki, Jane Pirkis (2014).

292,"Purpose To investigate stress levels and causes of stress among radiologic technologists and determine whether an intervention could reduce stress in a selected radiologic technologist population. Methods Demographic characteristics and data on preintervention stress sources and levels were collected through Internet-based questionnaires. A 6-week, self-administered, mindfulness-based stress-reduction program was conducted as a pilot intervention with 42 radiologic technologists from the Veterans Administration Medical Center. Data also were collected postintervention. Identified sources of stress were compared with findings from previous studies. Results Some radiologic technologists experienced improvement in their perceptions of stress after the intervention. Sources of stress for radiologic technologists were similar to those shown in earlier research, including inconsistent management, poor management communication, conflicting demands, long work hours, excessive workloads, lack of work breaks, and time pressures. Conclusion The mindfulness-based stress-reduction program is an example of an inexpensive method that could improve personal well-being, reduce work errors, improve relationships in the workplace, and increase job satisfaction. More research is needed to determine the best type of intervention for stress reduction in a larger radiologic technologist population.","Lynn Reingold (2015).

293,"Background. Rehabilitation as soon as possible after trauma decreases sedentary behavior, deconditioning, length of stay, and risk of rehospitalization. Objective. The study objectives were to describe exposure of older patients with trauma to rehabilitation and to explore factors associated with the number and initiation of therapy sessions. Design. This was a retrospective study of data from electronic medical records. Methods. Randomly selected older patients with trauma were described with regard to demographics, trauma diagnoses, comorbidities, preadmission function, and exposure to therapy. Regression analyses explored factors associated with number of therapy sessions and days until therapy was ordered and completed. Results. Records for 137 patients were randomly selected from records for 1,387 eligible patients who had trauma and were admitted over a 2-year period to a level I trauma center. The 137 patients received 303 therapy sessions. The sample included 63 men (46%) and 74 women (54%) who were 78 (SD= 10) years of age; most patients were white (n=115 [84%]). All patients had orders for therapy, although 3 patients (2%) were never seen. An increase in comorbidities was associated with an increase in therapy sessions, a decrease in the number of days until an order was written, but an increase in the number of days from admission to evaluation. Injury severity was associated with a decrease in the number of days from admission to an order being written. A postponed or canceled therapy session was associated with increases in the number of days from admission to evaluation and in the number of days from an order being written to evaluation. Limitations. This study was a retrospective review of a small sample with subjective measures and several dichotomous variables. Conclusions. Increased injury severity, increased numbers of comorbidities, and postponed or canceled therapy sessions were associated with decreased time from admission to therapy orders, increased time from admission and orders to evaluation, and increased number of therapy sessions.","Barbara Resnick, Chris L.

294,"French national guidelines for the management of HIV non-occupational post-exposure (nPEP) were issued in 1998 and updated in 2003. NPEP is available and free of charge in all emergency or AIDS care units of French hospitals. A regional survey was carried out to study physicians' adherence to national guidelines, and determinants of adherence to nPEP follow-up in individuals sexually exposed to HIV. The survey was based on retrospective data collection of all consultations for nPEP made in the three AIDS information centers in South-Eastern France (January 2001-December 2002). Information included personal data, type of exposure, and treatment at the first visit after exposure and during follow-up. Exposures were classified into high risk (treatment highly recommended), moderate risk (treatment possibly recommended) and negligible risk (treatment never recommended) categories, according to the level of HIV risk of sexual transmission as indicated by the French national nPEP guidelines. Among the 910 sexual exposures, 56%, 37%, and 4% were classified as cases with high, moderate, and no risk respectively. NPEP was prescribed to 85% of cases. HIV risk of sexual exposure was significantly associated with nPEP receipt though more than half of the cases with negligible risk received nPEP. Independent characteristics associated with non-adherence to nPEP follow-up were younger age, being referred to hospital by a physician, sexual exposure with a casual partner or sexual assault, and 'moderate risk' exposure. Better information should be provided to physicians prescribing nPEP to limit over-prescription while new strategies should be implemented to improve follow-up of individuals receiving nPEP, especially those who are younger or survivors of sexual assault.","D.

295,"Background: A number of different systems of classification of delusional content exist. The basis for these systems is unclear.Aims: The objective of this study was to investigate the manifest themes of delusions.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with twenty-five participants. Interpretive phenomenological analysis was used to generate a typology of themes. A second type of analysis used a data-display matrix of participants and themes. The latter matrix displayed the pattern of themes for each individual. A range of verification methods was used.Results: A typology was constructed of 34 themes that fell into 6 general topic 'domains' namely, negative self, negative interaction, special self, identity and relationships, specific mental experience, and entities. The majority of themes related to aspects of the self and social relationships. Each individual had a unique selection of themes that tended to cohere as a whole. We also found, as Freeman and Garety (2000) suggested, that some conventional definitions of content are not adequate.Conclusions: The conventional systems for classifying delusions are distorting since they imply that individuals fit into distinct groups, for example, 'the grandiose'. Our analysis suggests individuals tend to have a complex set of interconnected themes drawing uniquely from several possible domains.Declaration of interest: No financial support was given for this study.

296,This prospective field trial compared two post-trauma support systems following armed robberies - Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD) as a stand alone group intervention and integrated Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) - delivered to two groups of raided employees. Morbidity was measured using two measures of post-traumatic stress and a general health measure. Morbidity in both groups was equivalent at day 3 and one month post-raid. The CISM group had significantly less posttrauma morbidity at follow-up (3-12 months post raid) compared to CISD alone supplying evidence for the superior efficacy of postdisaster interventions when these are delivered in an integrated CISM format. Calls to cease 'debriefing' are premature and integrated CISM systems should now be the subject of randomised controlled studies.,"D. Richards (2001).

297,"Outdoor electronic dance-music festivals (EDMFs) are typically summer events where attendees can dance for hours in hot temperatures. EDMFs have received increased media attention because of their growing popularity and reports of illness among attendees associated with recreational drug use. MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is one of the drugs often used at EDMFs. MDMA causes euphoria and mental stimulation but also can cause serious adverse effects, including hyperthermia, seizures, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, and multiorgan failure. In this report, MDMA and other synthetic drugs commonly used at dance festivals are referred to as 'synthetic club drugs.' On September 1, 2013, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) received reports of two deaths of attendees at an EDMF (festival A) held August 31-September 1 in NYC. DOHMH conducted an investigation to identify and characterize adverse events resulting in emergency department (ED) visits among festival A attendees and to determine what drugs were associated with these adverse events. The investigation identified 22 cases of adverse events; nine cases were severe, including two deaths. Twenty-one (95%) of the 22 patients had used drugs or alcohol. Of 17 patients with toxicology testing, MDMA and other compounds were identified, most frequently methylone, in 11 patients.

298,"Chronic stress is among the most common diagnoses in Sweden, most commonly in the form of exhaustion syndrome ( ICD-10 classification - F43.8). The majority of patients with this syndrome also have disturbed breathing (hyperventilation). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between hyperventilation and exhaustion syndrome. Thirty patients with exhaustion syndrome and 14 healthy subjects were evaluated with the Nijmegen Symptom Questionnaire ( NQ). The participants completed questionnaires about exhaustion, mental state, sleep disturbance, pain and quality of life. The evaluation was repeated 4 weeks later, after half of the patients and healthy subjects had engaged in a therapy method called ' Grounding', a physical exercise inspired by African dance. The patients reported significantly higher levels of hyperventilation as compared to the healthy subjects. All patients' average score on NQ was 26.57 ± 10.98, while that of the healthy subjects was 15.14 ± 7.89 ( t = −3.48, df = 42, p < 0.001). The NQ scores correlated strongly with two measures of exhaustion ( Karolinska Exhaustion Scale KES r = 0.772, p < 0.01; Shirom Melamed Burnout Measure SMBM r = 0.565, p < 0.01), mental status [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) depression r = 0.414, p < 0.01; HADS anxiety r = 0.627, p < 0.01], sleep disturbances ( r = −0.514, p < 0.01), pain ( r = −.370, p < 0.05) and poor well-being ( Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 questionnaire- SR Health r = −0.529, p < 0.05). In the logistic regression analysis, the variance in the scores from NQ were explained to a high degree ( R2 = 0.752) by scores in KES and HADS. The brief Grounding training contributed to a near significant reduction in hyperventilation ( F = 2.521, p < 0.124) and to significant reductions in exhaustion scores and scores of depression and anxiety. The conclusion is that hyperventilation is common in exhaustion syndrome patients and that it can be reduced by systematic physical therapy such as Grounding.","Heli Ristiniemi, Aleksander Perski, Eugene Lyskov, Margareta Emtner (2014).

300,"Objective: To analyze the relation between the work environment and psychoactive substance consumption among hospital nurses. Methods: Cross-sectional and descriptive study, involving nurses from three public hospitals in a city in the South of Brazil, being two medium-complexity and one high-complexity institution. The study population consisted of 221 nurses. Based on this figure, the stratified sample size was calculated, considering a 50% proportion, 95% confidence level and 5% maximum error, resulting in a minimum number of 175 participants. Through proportional stratification per institution, a minimum of 103 high-complexity nurses was defined, as well as 36 nurses from each medium-complexity institution. The following inclusion criteria were adopted: having worked at the institution for at least one year and not being on leave. The data were collected between October 2015 and April 2016. In the data collection, sociodemographic and occupational information, the Nursing Work Index - Revised and the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test. The data were analyzed in the software Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 20.0. Initially, the normality was verified by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Descriptive analyses were developed by absolute and relative frequencies for the categorical variables; and medians and dispersion measures for the numerical variables. Results: Alcohol, tobacco and sedatives were the most consumed substances. The monthly income was positively correlated with alcohol consumption among nurses at the medium-complexity hospitals (p=0.01). At the high-complexity hospital, alcohol consumption was negatively correlated with the physician-nurse index (p=0.03). Autonomy, physician-nurse index and organizational support were negatively correlated with the use of sedatives (p<0.01; p<0.01; p=0.02, respectively). Conclusion: The more negative the nurse's work environment, mainly in the relation with physicians, organizational support and autonomy, the greater the consumption of psychoactive substances.

Few data, however, explain the interrelationship of tissue morphology to these factors among patients with clinical presentation of median nerve pathology. Therefore, our primary objective was to examine the relationship of various risk factors that may be predictive of subjective reports of symptoms or functional deficits accounting for median nerve morphology. Using diagnostic ultrasonography, we observed real-time median nerve morphology among 88 participants with varying reports of symptoms or functional limitations resulting from median nerve pathology. Body mass index, educational level, and nerve morphology were the primary predictive factors. Monitoring median nerve morphology with ultrasonography may provide valuable information for clinicians treating patients with symptoms of median nerve pathology.

The intervention consisted of a possible five modules that were presented to groups of up to 50 personnel. Data were collected on reported sexual behaviors, condom beliefs, sexual risk behaviors with casual partners, and number of interventions attended. Data indicated significant increases in reported condom use with casual partners and positive condom beliefs at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Risk behavior was reduced 30% from baseline at 6 months and 23% from baseline at 12 months. There was also a significant dose-response effect for number of interventions attended.

305,"AIMS: To date, no data exist assessing the impact of either methadone or buprenorphine on adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the long term. This study was conducted in order to evaluate whether receiving take-home methadone and buprenorphine may ensure better adherence to HAART in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through injection drug use (IDU). DESIGN: Longitudinal data on adherence, opioid substitution treatment (OST) and patient behaviours starting from their first HAART prescription were collected for 276 individuals HIV-infected through drug use (n=1558 visits). SETTING: Out-patient hospital services delivering HIV care in Marseilles, Avignon, Nice and Ile de France. MEASUREMENTS: At any given visit, patients were classified both according to the type of OST received and ongoing injection. Patients who reported no injection and no OST over the whole study period were considered as 'abstinent' and used as a reference category. A logit model based on generalized estimation equations (GEE) was used to identify predictors of non-adherence. FINDINGS: After adjustment for alcohol consumption, depression and self-reported side effects, patients ceasing injection during OST and abstinent patients exhibited comparable adherence. Patients reporting injection, on OST or not, had a twofold and threefold risk, respectively, of non-adherence compared with abstinent patients (P<0.01 linear trend). Duration on OST without injecting was associated significantly with virological success. CONCLUSIONS: Both access to and effectiveness of OST contribute to sustaining adherence to HAART in HIV-infected IDUs. These results advocate strongly the need of wider use of OST in countries scaling-up HAART where HIV is driven by IDUs.","P. Roux, M. P. Carrieri, V. Villes, P. Dellamonica, I. Poizot-Martin, I.

308,"OBJECTIVE: The research aimed to investigate how people diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder avoided episodes of illness and managed to stay well. The research also examined the role that personal, social and environmental factors played in helping people with bipolar mood disorder to stay well. METHOD: This project used a combination of qualitative research methods. The design contained three (3) components: recruitment from general community, preliminary written questionnaire and semistructured interviews. To meet the criteria for inclusion, the participant must have stayed well for the past 2 years. The two main analytical categories were 'stay well concept' and 'strategies to stay well'. The main category 'strategies to stay well' contained a number of subcategories. These subcategories were acceptance of diagnosis, mindfulness, education, identify triggers, recognize warning signals, manage sleep and stress, make lifestyle changes, treatment, access support, and stay well plans. RESULTS: 100 people were eligible for inclusion in the study. The sample included 63 women and 37 men. The ages ranged from 18 to 83 years, with 86% over the age of 30. Duration of time since last episode of illness ranged from 2 years to >50 years. In the sample, 76% of participants were in paid employment. In addition, 36% of participants were parents. Participants actively managed bipolar disorder by developing a range of strategies to stay well. These strategies were based on participants' individual needs and social contexts. The strategies included acceptance of the diagnosis, education about bipolar disorder, identifying both triggers and warning signals, adequate amounts of sleep, managing stress, medication and support networks. CONCLUSION: Staying well involved participants being mindful of their illness, which enabled them to develop an individual stay-well plan, including intervention strategies to prevent episodes of illness.","S.

309,"AIDS stigma must be acknowledged and reduced to advance HIV prevention and HIV/AIDS care in a variety of settings worldwide, including in the West Indies where national epidemics are thought to be growing rapidly. Regarded by international health organizations as a formidable barrier to service delivery and receipt, AIDS stigma refers to prejudice and discrimination directed toward people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA), persons perceived as being at risk for HIV infection, and the informal and formal service providers who care for PLHA. However, there is little evidence of successful antistigma interventions in the literature. Furthermore, beyond studies of willingness in various professions to serve clients or patients with HIV/AIDS, the stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors of service delivery personnel, paraprofessionals and volunteers have been inadequately studied. This paper uses data obtained during an AIDS awareness workshop with sports coaches in Barbados to illustrate principles of an antistigma intervention framework being developed for social service and health personnel. The Awareness/Acceptance/Action Model (AAAM) draws on principles of mindfulness, rooted in ancient Asian traditions, and recently adapted to a range of physical and mental health interventions in Western contexts. Mindfulness techniques encourage awareness of one's current state and environment, acceptance of the implications of one's attitudes and behaviors, and the development of intentional responses rather than habitually patterned reactions. In this initial effort, community leaders were guided through a series of self-reflective exercises focusing AAAM principles on their tendencies toward AIDS stigma, and exploring more compassionate and functional alternatives.","S.

310,"Objectives:Prior integrative reminiscence interventions have had a limited focus on attachment themes. The attachment-focused integrative reminiscence (AFIR) intervention differs from these in its central emphasis on attachment themes. The wide range of health benefits resulting from integrative reminiscence may be due in part to reminiscing about, mourning, and integrating unresolved attachment experiences. Method:Participants were randomized into treatment and wait-list control conditions, completed a pre-test, met for eight consecutive weekly two-hour sessions of largely attachment-focused reminiscence, then completed post-tests immediately following the intervention and again six months later. Results:Results show treatment effects for depression (p= .01 and .05 at eight weeks and six months), perceived stress (p= .01 and .04), and emergency room (ER) visits at six months (p= .04), with the intervention group showing lower depression and stress and fewer ER visits. Conclusion:Integrative reminiscence interventions are cost effective, have rapid impact, and carry a certain appeal to older adults. Augmenting such interventions with a focus on attachment experiences may reduce perceived stress, an important health risk factor. Wider application of AFIRs may further reduce health disparities among US older adults.","Myra Sabir, Charles R. Henderson, Suk-Young Kang, Karl Pillemer (2016).

312,"This is the first in a series of four empirical investigations to develop International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Sets for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The objective here was to use a comprehensive scoping review approach to identify the concepts of functional ability and disability used in the scientific ADHD literature and link these to the nomenclature of the ICF-CY. Systematic searches were conducted using Medline/PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC and Cinahl, to extract the relevant concepts of functional ability and disability from the identified outcome studies of ADHD. These concepts were then linked to ICF-CY by two independent researchers using a standardized linking procedure. Data from identified studies were analysed until saturation of ICF-CY categories was reached. Eighty studies were included in the final analysis. Concepts contained in these studies were linked to 128 ICF-CY categories. Of these categories, 68 were considered to be particularly relevant to ADHD (i.e., identified in at least 5 % of the studies). Of these, 32 were related to Activities and participation, 31 were related to Body functions, and five were related to environmental factors. The five most frequently identified categories were school education (53 %), energy and drive functions (50 %), psychomotor functions (50 %), attention functions (49 %), and emotional functions (45 %). The broad variety of ICF-CY categories identified in this study underlines the necessity to consider ability and disability in ADHD across all dimensions of life, for which the ICF-CY provides a valuable and universally applicable framework. These results, in combination with three additional preparatory studies (expert survey, focus groups, clinical study), will provide a scientific basis to define the ICF Core Sets for ADHD for multi-purpose use in basic and applied research, and every day clinical practice.","Elles Schipper, Aiko Lundequist, Anna Wilteus, David Coghill, Petrus Vries, Mats Granlund, Martin Holtmann, Ulf Jonsson, Sunil Karande, Florence Levy, Omar Al-Modayfer, Luis Rohde, Rosemary Tannock, Bruce Tonge, Sven Bölte (2015).

313,"With the rising attention to global trauma, there is increased interest in utilising effective trauma healing (TH) models, especially those that integrate a spiritual component. This paper examines the effectiveness of a Scripture-based TH model developed by the Trauma Healing Institute utilised in a pilot study with Nicaraguan adults who experienced non-sexualised-related crime, disaster-related trauma, and/or interpersonal violence. An additional focus of this study was on whether increased spiritual well-being would result from this healing model. In this first empirical study on the TH model, initial results indicated that participants (N = 23) experienced both a reduction in trauma-related symptoms as well as an upward trend in spiritual well-being from pre-test to six-month follow-up. Spearman results also showed an inverse relationship between trauma symptoms and spiritual well-being. Factors that may have impacted results, limitations to this pilot study, and considerations for future studies are discussed.","Tammy Schultz, Jerry Vuncannon, Kari Bump (2016).

314,"There is little research on the associations between acceptance of and experiences with intimate partner violence (IPV) in rural samples, which may be different from associations in urban areas due to the higher prevalence of IPV in rural areas and the social and physical environment issues related to seeking help. The purpose of our study was to determine the proportion of participants who reported accepting male- and female-perpetrated IPV and the associations between experiences of IPV and acceptance of IPV. Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey of rural residents in one Midwest state. Approximately 4 % of participants reported it is ever acceptable for a male to hit his partner. Approximately 20 % of males and 12 % of females reported it is ever acceptable for a female to hit her partner. A higher proportion of individuals who were victims or perpetrators of IPV reported accepting retaliatory IPV (i.e., when partner hits first) perpetrated by individuals of their own gender. This finding suggests the previously reported high rates of bidirectional IPV in rural areas may be fueled by this acceptance of physical retaliation. Interventions to break this cycle of IPV may be guided by qualitative research into the specific ways the rural environment contributes to acceptance of retaliatory aggression.","Laura Schwab-Reese, Lynette Renner (2017).

Data were drawn from a 37-year follow-up examination of the effects of the Vietnam prisoner of war (POW) experience. The Robert E. Mitchell Center for POW Studies is a unique institution holding the only longitudinal study of the effects of the American POW experience in existence. The study used a sample of 440 Vietnam repatriated prisoners of war (RPWs). Psychiatric disorders were assessed at repatriation (1973) and were continued annually by a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. Sleep issues before, during, and after captivity were assessed upon repatriation during medical examinations. Odds ratios examining presence of sleep symptoms show resilient RPWs reporting fewer symptoms compared to nonresilient RPWS before, during, and after captivity. Logistic regression comparing before, during, and after indicates fewer reported sleep disturbance symptoms after captivity was the strongest predictor of resilience (b = -0.82, Wald chi2 (1) = 16.70, p < 0.000).

316,"Approaches to trance and possession in anthropology have tended to use outmoded models drawn from psychodynamic theory or treated such dissociative phenomena as purely discursive processes of attributing action and experience to agencies other than the self. Within psychology and psychiatry, understanding of dissociative disorders has been hindered by polemical ""either/or"" arguments: either dissociative disorders are real, spontaneous alterations in brain states that reflect basic neurobiological phenomena, or they are imaginary, socially constructed role performances dictated by interpersonal expectations, power dynamics and cultural scripts. In this paper, we outline an approach to dissociative phenomena, including trance, possession and spiritual and healing practices, that integrates the neuropsychological notions of underlying mechanism with sociocultural processes of the narrative construction and social presentation of the self. This integrative model, grounded in a cultural neuroscience, can advance ethnographic studies of dissociation and inform clinical approaches to dissociation through careful consideration of the impact of social context.","R.

317,"The literature relevant to the treatment of Whiplash-Associated Disorders (WAD) is extensive and heterogeneous. Methods: A Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach was used to engage a chiropractic community of practice and stakeholders in a systematic review to address a general question: 'Does chiropractic management of WAD clients have an effect on improving health status?' A systematic review of the empirical studies relevant to WAD interventions was conducted followed by a review of the evidence. Results: The initial search identified 1,155 articles. Ninety-two of the articles were retrieved, and 27 articles consistent with specific criteria of WAD intervention were analyzed in-depth. The best evidence supporting the chiropractic management of clients with WAD is reported. Further review identified ways to overcome gaps needed to inform clinical practice and culminated in the development of a proposed care model: the WAD-Plus Model. Conclusions: There is a baseline of evidence that suggests chiropractic care improves cervical range of motion (cROM) and pain in the management of WAD. However, the level of this evidence relevant to clinical practice remains low or draws on clinical consensus at this time. The WAD-Plus Model has implications for use by chiropractors and interdisciplinary professionals in the assessment and management of acute, subacute and chronic pain due to WAD. Furthermore, the WAD-Plus Model can be used in the future study of interventions and outcomes to advance evidence-based care in the management of WAD.","L. Shaw, M. Descarreaux, R. Bryans, M.

319,"Objective: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) by definition represents a diagnosis of exclusion. Late stage or 'Chronic Lyme' infection with or without 'co-infections' is a difficult diagnosis to establish. The symptom complex of both conditions can be very similar. This case study represents an attempt to support serious consideration for a subpopulation of patients otherwise diagnosed with 'CFS,' as actually representing chronic Lyme disease. Method: A case study is presented of a 33-year-old man, who for two years, was being managed as having CFS. However, after ~2 years of utilizing multiple modalities of management with limited success, the diagnosis of Lyme was reconsidered. Historical exposure risks to Lyme in this individual were high. He had prolonged exposure in the highly tick-infested mountains of North Carolina for 18 months, several years prior to becoming ill. More aggressive investigation confirmed the diagnosis of Lyme. Appropriate changes in management were associated with an improved level of functioning that was far in excess of what maximal management of CFS was able to achieve. The features of CFS and chronic Lyme can be very similar and include the following: Profound fatigue often associated with cognitive impairment. Other common symptoms related to both of these conditions include sleep disturbances, fibromyalgia, and dysautonomias. In pursuing clarification of this diagnosis, the author was exposed to a contrast in medical opinion regarding diagnostic tools and criteria that were perceived as creating potential barriers to the management of patients presenting with these symptoms. Conclusion: Acceptance and awareness of the possibility that Lyme disease can present as CFS has important therapeutic and prognostic implications.","S. Shor (2006).

He outlines the breadth of evidence that shows the efficacy, and effectiveness in the field of Psychodynamic Therapy for anxiety and depression and a broad range of other disorders and co-morbidities. He goes on to describe the problematic nature of the guidelines' categorizations of disorders for psychodynamic practitioners.

325,"A conceptual framework is advanced that assumes that psychological symptoms emerge within multiple contexts, such as the workplace, and are influenced by the interplay of individual and situational risk and protective factors over time. This framework was utilized to examine the impact of work and work-family role stressors, coping, and work-related social support on psychological symptoms among 239 female, secretarial employees in the USA, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models. Work stressors and avoidance coping were viewed as risk factors, and active coping and social support as protective factors. Work stressors contributed substantially to increased symptoms, primarily through a direct pathway in the cross-sectional model, but also indirectly to both Time 1 and Time 2 symptoms (4 months later) via pathways through active and avoidance coping. In both models, avoidance coping also predicted increased symptoms. Avoidance coping also served to partially mediate the relationship between work stressors and symptoms in the cross-sectional model, but not in the longitudinal model. Active coping was related to fewer psychological symptoms in both models, thereby reducing the negative effect of work stressors on symptoms. Likewise, work-related social support served an indirect protective function by contributing to lower levels of reported work stressors and greater use of active coping. Work stressors but not active coping mediated the relationship between social support and symptoms. Implications for future research and workplace interventions are discussed.","D. L. Snow, S. C.

Few interventions have been developed to reduce the negative effects of work stress in this environment. Objective This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a workplace intervention for increasing resilience to stress. The intervention was implemented within the unique constraints characteristic of surgical intensive care units. Methods Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The mindfulness-based intervention included meditation, mild yoga movement, and music and was conducted in a group format 1 hour a week for 8 weeks in a surgical intensive care unit during work hours. Assessments were performed 1 week before and 1 week after the intervention. Results The intervention was well received, with a 97% overall retention rate and 100% retention in the intervention group. Work satisfaction, measured with the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, increased significantly in the intervention group with no change in the control group. Negative correlations were found between the vigor subscale scores of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and scores for emotional exhaustion on the Maslach Burnout Inventory and scores for burnout on the Professional Quality of Life scale.

335,"Maltreatment by parents inhibits a child's ability to form relationships with other children. Given that many sex offenders experienced parental abuse, investigation of their relationships with siblings and peers could provide new directions for early childhood interventions. Interview transcripts of 23 community-dwelling perpetrators of sexual abuse against children were examined in this secondary data analysis. Ages of participants ranged from 20s to 70s, and education ranged from GED to PhD. Phenomenological analysis revealed that neither sibling nor peer relationships adequately promoted participants' capacity for developing and maintaining healthy relationships in adulthood. Until societal preventive actions and early clinical interventions are more successful, the crime of child sexual abuse will continue to be far too common.","Sandra P.

336,"PROBLEM: Youth violence research often focuses on risk factors arising from early familial interactions rather than school-related factors. METHODS: Via an Internet questionnaire, 282 girls and boys (ages 7-19, mean 15.3) from 47 states and Washington, DC, reported on school connectedness, interpersonal relationships, and anger behaviors. FINDINGS: Substantial percentages of violent youth did not perceive themselves to be liked by classmates and reported loneliness. If not liked by classmates, 80% hated school. Likers and haters of school differed on seven variables (all p < or = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient attention is paid to the alienation experienced by disliked and lonely students. Mental health nurses could play a pivotal role in fostering change in the social climate of schools and helping youth to achieve better anger management and social skills.","S. P. Thomas, H.

337,"This article describes the development and testing of the psychometric properties of the Partner Violence Entrapment Scale (PVES), an instrument that evaluates the women's perceived reasons for staying in violent partner relationships. After initial pilot testing, the scale was administered to 213 Spanish women who were victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). An exploratory factor analysis identified six factors: Socio-Economic Problems, Attachment and Fear of Loneliness, Blaming Oneself and Resignation, Impact on Children, Fear of Harm and Worry for the Partner, and Feelings of Confusion. Discriminant validity was established by demonstrating associations between PVES factors and socio-demographic, clinical and abuse variables. The scale appears to be a useful assessment tool for social and clinical settings. Its factor structure, reliability, and validity need to be replicated in other populations and samples.","Anna Torres, Purificación Navarro, Fernando Gutiérrez, Maria Tarragona, Maria Imaz, Carlos Ascaso, Zoe Herreras, Manuel Valdés, Lluïsa Garcia-Esteve (2016).

339,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interventions are efficacious in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but are challenging to implement in acute care and other non-specialty mental health settings. This investigation identified barriers impacting CBT delivery through a content analysis of interventionist chart notes from an acute care PTSD prevention trial. Only 8.5%% of all intervention patients were able to complete CBT. Lack of engagement, clinical and logistical barriers had the greatest impact on CBT entry. Treatment preferences and stigma only prevented entry when more primary barriers resolved. Patients with prior diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence were able to enter CBT after six months of sobriety. Based on the first trial, we developed a CBT readiness assessment tool. We implemented and evaluated the tool in a second early intervention trial. Lack of engagement emerged again as the primary impediment to CBT entry. Patients who were willing to enter CBT treatment but demonstrated high rates of past trauma or diagnosis of PTSD were also the least likely to engage in any PTSD treatment one month post-discharge. Findings support the need for additional investigations into engagement and alternative delivery strategies, including those which dismantle traditional office-based, multi-session CBT into stepped, deliverable components.","Sarah Geiss Trusz, Amy W.

Furthermore, investigates whether the indirect relation of religious involvement to well-being through CSE is conditional on age group (elderly vs. adults). Two different samples were examined: an elderly (N = 300) and an adult community sample (N = 294). To determine whether the strength of these effects depend on (moderated by) age group, we used multiple regression analyses and bootstrapping framework to probe conditional indirect (i.e., moderated mediation) effects. The results showed that CSE mediates the relationship between religious involvement (i.e., religious attendance and intrinsic religiosity) and both aspects of subjective well-being. However, the moderated mediation models revealed that this mechanism exists only for elderly. Implications of these results for improving the quality of life in elderly are discussed and directions for future research are provided.","Ioannis Tsaousis, Evangelos Karademas, Dimitra Kalatzi (2013).

341,"Objectives The current study examined shame in a clinical sample recovering from a first episode of psychosis by focusing on the contribution of different types of shame to post-psychotic trauma while controlling for current affective symptoms. Design The study used a cross-sectional correlational design. Method Fifty individuals who met the criteria for a psychotic disorder whose acute psychotic symptoms were in remission completed measures of internal and external shame associated with psychosis, general shame, post-psychotic trauma, and depression. Results Post-psychotic trauma symptoms were correlated with internal and external shame associated with psychosis and general shame. However, the relation between post-psychotic trauma and external shame associated with psychosis remained after controlling for general shame and current affective symptoms. In addition, internal shame had a stronger association with depression. Thus, internal and external shame due to psychosis had different associations with different types of post-psychotic emotional dysfunction. Conclusions The results support the importance of assessing shame as a multi-faceted construct and suggest that assessing shame directly associated with mental illness is a worthwhile endeavour. Practitioner Points Assessing different types of shame following psychosis can inform assessments, formulations, and interventions with post-psychotic trauma., Our results support the application of Compassionate Mind Therapy to psychosis., However, we did not assess self-criticism or self-reassurance., We also did not investigate the relation between specific psychotic symptoms and different types of shame.","Michelle H.

344,"The city of Baltimore is a typical, large, urban center in the United States with several major academic medical institutions surrounded by disadvantaged neighborhoods with multiple poor health indices. In order to understand the extent to which academic research agendas reflect the health concerns of Baltimore’s local population, a systematic review was conducted to identify research about four key, health-related topic areas. We classified papers on: disease prevalence and health status, utilization of health services, population-based interventions, and the unmet health needs of Baltimore City residents. Approximately 4,150 citations were identified in the search and two levels of screening yielded a total of 288 papers. The majority of articles ( n = 189) examined prevalence of health conditions such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), mental health and mental disorders, and sexually transmitted diseases. Papers about specific target populations focused primarily on adults, African Americans, and females. Despite a significant body of research concerning several health conditions and priority populations, significant gaps in knowledge about health services utilization, community interventions, unmet health needs, and the prevalence of specific health issues remain. This review provides valuable insight into the extent of health research conducted about the city of Baltimore and whether community health priorities have been investigated. It provides a basis for examining the potential directions of academic research centers to effectively identify and address collective, urban health priorities of the communities in which they reside.","N.

345,"The prevalence of negative life events (NLE) and daily hassles, and their direct and moderated associations with depression, were examined among HIV-infected adolescents. Specifically, we examined whether the negative association with depression of NLE, daily hassles, and/or passive coping were moderated by social support or active coping strategies. Demographic characteristics, depression, coping, social support, NLE, and daily hassles were collected at baseline as part of the Adolescent Impact intervention via face-to-face and computer-assisted interviews. Of 166 HIV-infected adolescents, 53% were female, 72.9% black, 59.6% with perinatally acquired HIV (PIY), the most commonly reported NLE were death in family (81%), violence exposure (68%), school relocation (67%), and hospitalization (61%); and for daily hassles “not having enough money (65%)”. Behaviorally infected youth (BIY – acquired HIV later in life) were significantly more likely to experience extensive (14–21) lifetime NLE (38.8% vs. 16.3%,p < .012) than PIY. In multiple stepwise regression analysis, the model accounting for the greatest variability in depression scores (32%) included (in order of entry): daily hassles, low social support, behaviorally acquired HIV, minority sexual orientation, and passive coping. A significant passive coping-by-social support interaction revealed that the association between passive coping and depression was exacerbated when social support was low. Social support moderated the effect of NLE, such that NLE were associated with greater depression when social support was low, although the effect did not remain statistically significant when main effects of other variables were accounted for. Daily hassles, poor coping, and limited social support can adversely affect the psychological well-being of HIV-infected adolescents, particularly sexual minority youth with behaviorally acquired HIV. Multimodal interventions that enhance social support and teach adaptive coping skills may help youth cope with environmental stresses and improve mental health outcomes.","Jennifer V.

Such violence triggers a syndrome of episodic, clustered, psychological and physiological symptoms that may be fatal. Despite its pervasiveness, many clinicians fail to recognize as many as 95% of cases among veterans and active duty personnel. Many victims receive inadequate medical treatment or education. They face a decreased quality of life, high morbidity and mortality rates, and economic losses. Their children may also be at risk for abuse. In many settings, clinicians may not realize the high prevalence of this military sexual abuse among veterans and active duty personnel.

347,"Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the readmission rate, and the level of patient disturbance and community care associated with readmission following Community Treatment Orders (CTOs) in New South Wales, Australia. Method: The readmission rates of all patients given CTOs within a 4-year period and a matched comparison group were investigated. The following factors were compared before, during and following a CTO: medication non-compliance, number of clinical services and duration of disturbed behaviour preceding hospitalisations. Results: Of 123 patients on CTOs (mean length, 288 days; SD, 210 days), 38 were readmitted during the CTO, the majority in the first 3 months and a further 21 patients were readmitted following termination of the CTO. Evidence of lower severity of illness in the comparison patients prevented meaningful evaluation of the readmission rates of the two groups. While on CTOs, patients receiving depot medications showed high compliance and a significantly reduced readmission rate compared with that of patients receiving oral medications. In the 2 months prior to hospitalisations during CTOs, compared with those before or after CTOs, patients received more frequent consultations and showed a shorter duration of medication non-compliance and disturbed behaviour. The level of services in the 3 months following discharge were comparable for patients on CTOs and the comparison group. Conclusions: CTOs may reduce rehospitalisations by use of depot medication. Earlier and possibly more frequent readmissions in the CTO group shortened the disturbance associated with illness recurrence. It would appear that to establish a control group with equivalent severity of disorder necessary to evaluate the impact of CTOs requires a random allocation design.","K. Vaughan, N. McConaghy, C.

This article presents a scoping review of interventions which seek to promote mental wellbeing and reduce inequities in children and young people living in high income countries. We used Fair Foundations: The VicHealth framework for health equity (VicHealth (2013) Melbourne, Australia: The Victorian Health Promotion Foundation) to identify points of entry at three layers of influence: (i) socio-economic, cultural and political contexts, (ii) daily living conditions, and (iii) individual and family health-related factors. We identified more than 1000 interventions which aimed to prevent or treat childhood mental illness, but there were far fewer that aimed to promote children's or young people's mental wellbeing. The interventions we studied were either universal or specifically targeted children from disadvantaged families: none explicitly used an equity framework to guide their design or evaluation or addressed social gradients in wellbeing. Most interventions remained focused on proximate factors, although we also identified a handful of interventions that sought to address children's access to services and their educational and neighbourhood environments. However, we found encouraging evidence that interventions in family and educational settings were successful in building children's strengths and supporting positive parenting, universally and within disadvantaged groups. Such positive programme evaluations signal the potential for using a proportionate universalism approach that emphasizes equity in the promotion of mental wellbeing.","Jennifer Welsh, Lyndall Strazdins, Laura Ford, Sharon Friel, Kerryn O'Rourke, Stephen Carbone,Carlon,Leanne (2015).

Yet to have an appreciable public health impact, physicians will need to be educated about these new HIV prevention modalities. Massachusetts physicians were recruited via e-mail to complete an online survey of their knowledge and use of HIV prevention interventions. Data were collected before (July-December, 2010) ( n=178) and after (December, 2010-April, 2011) ( n=115) the release of iPrEx data. Over the two time intervals, knowledge of oral PrEP significantly increased (79% to 92%, p<0.01), whereas knowledge about topical microbicides was already high (89% pre-iPrEx). Post-iPrEx, specialists were more knowledgeable about oral PrEP ( p<0.01) and topical microbicides ( p<0.001) than generalists. The majority of the respondents would prefer to prescribe topical microbicides (75%) than oral PrEP (25%; p<0.001), primarily because they perceived fewer side effects (95%). Respondents indicated that PrEP should be available if it were a highly effective, daily pill; however, ongoing concerns included: potential drug resistance (93%), decreased funds for other forms of HIV prevention (88%), medication side effects (83%), and limited data regarding PrEP's clinical efficacy (75%). Participants indicated that formal CDC guidelines would have the greatest impact on their willingness to prescribe PrEP (96%). Among Massachusetts physicians sampled, chemoprophylaxis knowledge was high, but current experience was limited.

Although reductions in depressive symptoms with physical activity have been demonstrated in white adults, little research has examined the mental health benefits of physical activity in African American women. Further, it is unknown whether physical activity can offset the effects of living in disadvantaged neighborhoods on depressive symptoms. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among neighborhood characteristics, adherence to a physical activity intervention, and change over time in depressive symptoms in midlife African American women. METHODS: Two hundred seventy-eight women participated in a home-based, 24-week moderate-intensity walking intervention. Either a minimal treatment (MT) or enhanced treatment (ET) version of the intervention was randomly assigned to one of the two community health centers. Walking adherence was measured as the percentage of prescribed walks completed. Objective and perceived measures of neighborhood deterioration and crime were included. RESULTS: Adjusting for demographics, body mass index (BMI), and depressive symptoms at baseline, walking adherence and objective neighborhood deterioration were associated with significantly lower depressive symptoms, whereas perceived neighborhood deterioration was associated with significantly higher depressive symptoms at 24 weeks.

Method: We surveyed the majority of Army behavioral health providers ( n = 2,310); surveys were obtained from 543 (26%). These clinicians reported clinical data on a total sample of 399 service member patients. Of these patients, 110 (28%) had a reported PTSD diagnosis. Data were weighted to account for sampling design and nonresponses. Results: Army providers reported 86% of patients with PTSD received evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP) for PTSD. As formal training hours in EBPs increased, reported use of EBPs significantly increased. Although EBPs for PTSD were reported to be widely used, clinicians who deliver EBP frequently reported not adhering to all core procedures recommended in treatment manuals; less than half reported using all the manualized core EBP techniques. Conclusions: Further research is necessary to understand why clinicians modify EBP treatments, and what impact this has on treatment outcomes. More data regarding the implications for treatment effectiveness and the role of clinical context, patient preferences, and clinical decision-making in adapting EBPs could help inform training efforts and the ways that these treatments may be better adapted for the military.","Joshua E.

METHOD: The vignettes varied in response topography and the age of the victim. Regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between causal attributions, emotional responses, and willingness to invest extra time and effort in the service user's care. RESULTS: No support was found for the pathway: low controllability --> increased sympathy and/or decreased negative emotions --> increased helping. However, strong support was found for the pathway: low stability --> high optimism --> increased helping, particularly in direct care staff. High levels of sympathy were also associated with increased helping, the effect again being mediated by feelings of optimism. CONCLUSIONS: The data provide support for one (but not the other) strand of attribution theory as applied to inappropriate sexual behaviour. The discussion considers the discrepancy between the present data and the far less encouraging literature on attribution theory as applied to challenging behaviour.","P. Willner, M. Smith (2008).

366,"This study was designed to assess social service workers’ perceptions of nonoffending caregivers in cases of child sexual abuse. Attributions of blame were examined by administering questionnaires to staff at local social service agencies. It was hypothesized that social service workers who worked in the field longer, were male, or had less education would attribute more blame to the nonoffending caregivers. The findings revealed that respondent gender was the only significant predictor of blame attribution toward nonoffending caregivers, with level of education approaching significance as a predictor. There was no relationship between attribution of blame and years in job. The findings have important contributions for informing the practice of social service professionals who work with families of child sexual abuse.","Paula M. Wolfteich, Monica L. Cline (2013).

Her presentation was complicated by traumatic events during childhood and a recent decline in physical abilities due to multiple sclerosis. Cognitive behavioral therapy was used and excellent outcomes were achieved. This article describes how cognitive behavioral therapy was effectively adapted to treat this patient whose longstanding physical disability was progressively intruding into the patient's quality of life and her interactions with others, particularly her husband. In writing this account of how therapy was delivered, the authors pay particular attention to the need for flexibility so that the cognitive behavioral therapy met this patient's individual needs.","Dichelle Wong, Ken Laidlaw (2012).

370,"Objective: Although mindfulness meditation (MM) is increasingly used for chronic pain treatment, limited evidence supports its clinical application for opioid-treated chronic low back pain (CLBP). The goal of this study was to determine feasibility, acceptability, and safety of an MM-based intervention in patients with CLBP requiring daily opioid therapy. Design: 26-week pilot randomized controlled trial comparing MM-based intervention, combined with usual care, to usual care alone. Setting: Outpatient. Patients: Adults with CLBP treated with ≥30 mg of morphine-equivalent dose (MED) per day for 3 months or longer. Interventions: Targeted MM-based intervention consisted of eight weekly 2-hour group sessions and home practice (30 minutes/d, 6 days/wk) during the study. 'Usual care' for opioid-treated CLBP was provided to participants by their regular clinicians. Outcome measures: Feasibility and acceptability of the MM intervention were assessed by adherence to intervention protocol and treatment satisfaction among experimental participants. Safety was evaluated by inquiry about side effects/adverse events and opioid dose among all study participants. Results: Thirty-five participants enrolled during the 10-week recruitment period. The mean age (±standard deviation) was 51.8 ± 9.7 years; the patients were predominantly female, with substantial CLBP-related pain and disability, and treated with 148.3 ± 129.2 mg of MED per day. All participants completed baseline assessments; none missed both follow-up assessments or withdrew. Among experimental participants ( n = 21), 19 attended 1 or more intervention sessions and 14 attended 4 or more. They reported, on average, 164.0 ± 122.1 minutes of formal practice per week during the 26-week study and 103.5 ± 111.5 minutes of brief, informal practice per week. Seventeen patients evaluated the intervention, indicating satisfaction; their qualitative responses described the course as useful for pain management ( n = 10) and for improving pain coping skills ( n = 8). No serious adverse events or safety concerns occurred among the study participants. Conclusions: MM-based intervention is feasible, acceptable, and safe in opioid-treated CLBP.","Aleksandra E.

371,"Little is known about how people living with HIV in low prevalence contexts face the challenges of stigma and discrimination. Low prevalence and rural communities are unique environments in which HIV-related stigma and discrimination may be intensified due to lower tolerance of differences among people and greater fear of HIV. This study examined the experiences of 16 individuals living with HIV who reside in a predominantly rural area with low HIV prevalence. We used in-depth interviews to explore participants' experience with stigma and discrimination in social and health care settings and their behavioral and emotional responses. In their day-to-day lives, participants described feeling social rejection, being forced to follow different rules of social contact, and being treated differently. In health care settings, participants described specific instances when they felt providers were afraid of them and when they were refused or discouraged treatment or treated differently based on their HIV status. Participants experienced stigma and acts of discrimination in different settings (e.g., physician and dentist offices and hospitals) and from a range of types of providers (e.g., physicians, nurses, and dentists). Behavioral and emotional responses to perceived acts of stigma and discrimination included anger, shame, social isolation, and self-advocacy. Findings point to a need to develop tailored interventions to address stigma and discrimination for individuals, health care personnel and the community-at-large.","A. P. Zukoski, S.

The amount of assistance required for walking was recorded by placing the patients in 1 of 6 functional ambulation categories. Emotional stress of the main caregiver was assessed by the General Health Questionnaire. The extent of rehabilitation treatment and community support service utilization was also recorded., Main results: , Patients in both groups showed an improvement in Barthel index and Motor Club assessment scores at 6 months (P <= 0.003 for the difference between baseline and follow-up scores). The improvement in functional ability was greater, however, for patients treated with home physiotherapy (Barthel index, median difference 2, 95% CI 0 to 3, P = 0.01; and Motor Club assessment, median difference 2, CI 1 to 5, P = 0.01). At 6 months, 45% of the patients treated with home physiotherapy were able to walk outside on uneven ground and slopes compared with 23% of the patients attending day hospitals (P = 0.03). 21% of patients treated with home physiotherapy were receiving treatment at 6 months compared with 52% of day-hospital patients (P = 0.002). {The absolute risk reduction of 31% means that 4 patients would need to be treated with home physiotherapy (rather than attend day hospitals) to prevent 1 additional patient from the need for treatment at 6 months, CI 2 to 8; the relative risk reduction was 59%, CI 29% to 77%.}* The home physiotherapy group received fewer hours of therapy time overall (P < 0.001).

373,"Objective: , To determine if loss of employment and early retirement increases the risk for death in middle-aged British men., Design: , Cohort analytic study. Men in the British Regional Heart Study were questioned for employment information 5 years after screening and then were followed for a mean of 5.5 years., Setting: , 1 general practice in each of 24 towns in the United Kingdom., Participants: , 6191 men (mean age, 50 y) who had been continuously employed during the 5 years before the initial screening., Assessment of Risk Factors: , At enrollment into the Heart Study, geographic distribution, occupational history, employment status, social class, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, weight, and pre-existing disease were ascertained. After 5 years a questionnaire was mailed to obtain detailed information regarding employment status during the 5 years before screening and the 5 years between screening and the questionnaire., Main Outcome Measures: , All-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and noncardiovascular death., Main Results: , 4412 men were continuously employed full-time throughout the 5 years after the initial screening. 1779 men experienced some unemployment or retired during the 5 years after screening. 379 men died during follow-up; of them 174 had been continuously employed and 205 had experienced unemployment or had retired. Men who had experienced unemployment or retired were twice as likely to die as the continuously employed men (age-adjusted relative risk [RR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.71 to 2.65). After adjustment for geographic location, social class, smoking, alcohol intake, and preexisting disease, the RR for death was slightly reduced (RR, 1.95; CI, 1.57 to 2.43). Men who stated that their unemployment was because of ill health had the highest adjusted RR, 3.14 (CI, 2.35 to 4.21). Men who were unemployed for reasons other than ill health also had an increased adjusted risk for death (RR, 1.47; CI, 1.10 to 1.96).

Bibliographies of retrieved articles were scanned for additional articles., Study selection: , English-language, randomized controlled trials were selected if they evaluated the effectiveness of analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, antidepressants, epidural steroid injections, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, traction, behavior therapy, orthoses, electromyographic biofeedback, or acupuncture in nonsurgical patients with acute (persisting <= 6 wk) or chronic (persisting >= 12 wk) low-back pain. Studies of cervical pain were excluded., Data extraction: , Trials were assessed for methodologic quality (17 criteria). Data were extracted on type of therapy, number of patients, pain intensity, overall improvement, functional status, and whether the study conclusion was positive (the experimental therapy was more effective) or negative (no difference was shown between the therapies studied, or the reference therapy was more effective)., Main results: , 150 trials (68 on acute low-back pain, 81 on chronic low-back pain, and 1 on both) met the selection criteria. 35% of acute and 25% of chronic low-back pain trials were of high methodologic quality. Results were reported on the basis of the level of evidence; strong evidence referred to multiple high-quality trials., For acute low-back pain, strong evidence showed that NSAIDs were more effective than placebo but not more effective than analgesics. Different NSAIDs were equally effective. Similarly, strong evidence showed that muscle relaxants were more effective than placebo and that all types were equally effective. In contrast, strong evidence showed that bed rest and exercise were not effective for acute low-back pain., For chronic low-back pain, strong evidence showed that manipulation, intensive back school programs in an occupational setting, and exercise were all effective., Conclusions: , Few trials of therapies for low-back pain have high methodologic quality.

Patients were excluded if they could not walk, had severe sensory or cognitive impairment, or had symptomatic ischemic heart disease. Follow-up was 90%., Intervention: , After stratification by sex and primary nature of lung disease (obstructive or nonobstructive), patients were allocated to a 6-week multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program (rehabilitation group, n = 99) or to standard medical management (control group, n = 101). The rehabilitation program used services from occupational therapists, physiotherapists, dietitians, respiratory nurses, and smoking-cessation counselors. It consisted of 18 visits (lasting about 2 h each) that involved exercise and education on pulmonary disease, nutrition, stress management, and medications. At the end of the program, patients were invited to join a patient-run group for social activities and exercise., Main outcome measures: , Use of health services, walking ability, and general and disease-specific health status., Main results: , Analysis was by intention to treat. Of the patients who were hospitalized, those in the rehabilitation group had lower mean numbers of admissions (1.7 vs 2.2, P = 0.048) and days spent in the hospital (10.4 vs 21.0, P = 0.022) than did those in the control group. Patients in the rehabilitation group had a higher mean number of consultations at the general practitioner's office (8.6 vs 7.3, P = 0.033) and a lower mean number of general practitioner home visits (1.5 vs 2.8, P = 0.037) than did those in the control group. Patients in the rehabilitation group showed greater improvement in walking ability (P = 0.002) and general and disease-specific health status (P < 0.05) than did those in the control group. Rehabilitation and control groups did not differ for the numbers of patients admitted to the hospital (40 vs 41, P = 0.98)., Conclusion: , An outpatient multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program decreased the use of health services and improved the general and disease-specific health status of patients with disabling chronic lung disease.","(2000).

Outcomes were the number of persons who fell, the number of falls, and the severity of falls., Main results:, 40 studies met the selection criteria. 14 RCTs evaluated exercise or physical-therapy interventions: Participants in an individually tailored program of progressive muscle strengthening, balance-retaining exercises, and a walking plan (3 RCTs) had lower rates of falls and injurious falls than did control-group participants at 1 year . Participants exposed to a 15-week tai chi untargeted group intervention (1 RCT) had a lower rate of falling than did control-group participants (risk ratio [RR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.73). 1 RCT evaluated a home-safety intervention by an occupational therapist: Among patients with a history of >= 1 fall in the previous year, the rate of falls was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (RR 0.64, CI 0.49 to 0.84). 1 RCT evaluated a placebo-controlled medication withdrawal program: The overall risk for falls was lower for the psychotropic medication withdrawal group (relative hazard 0.34, CI 0.16 to 0.74). Multidisciplinary, multifactorial, health, or environmental risk-factor screening or intervention programs, both for unselected community-dwelling older persons and for older persons selected because of known risk factors, were evaluated in 7 and 2 RCTs, respectively: For both unselected (3 RCTs) and selected persons (2 RCTs), the intervention groups had lower rates of falls than did control groups ., Conclusions:, In community-dwelling elderly persons, intervention programs that target both intrinsic and environmental risk factors may reduce the incidence of falls.

Training regimens consisted of 5 weekly 45-minute sessions for 12 days, with instructions for continuing the exercises at home. The strength group used an elastic band to do high-intensity, isometric neck-strengthening and stabilization exercises. The endurance group exercised the neck flexor muscles by lifting the head from supine and prone positions. Both groups used dumbbells to do dynamic exercises for the shoulders and upper arms and ended the session with 20 minutes of stretching.

378,"Background, Stroke Unit care is now accepted as an effective service model for hospital care, but the effectiveness of outpatient care is less certain. This review focuses on therapy-based rehabilitation services targeted at stroke patients living at home., Objectives, To assess the effects of therapy-based rehabilitation services targeted towards stroke patients resident in the community within one year of stroke onset/discharge from hospital following stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched May 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1996 to November 2001), EMBASE (1980 to November 2001), CINAHL (1983 to November 2001), PsycINFO (1967 to November 2001), AMED (1985 to November 2001), Wilson Social Sciences Abstracts (1984 to November 2001), Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index (1981 to November 2001). Other strategies to ensure identification of all potentially relevant trials included scanning reference lists of relevant articles and original papers, personal communication and hand searching journals., Selection criteria, All unconfounded, truly randomised controlled trials of stroke patients resident in the community receiving a therapy service intervention compared with conventional or no care. Therapy services were those provided by physiotherapy, occupational therapy, or multidisciplinary staff working with patients primarily to improve task-orientated behaviour and hence increase activity and participation., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data on a number of prespecified outcomes. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients who had deteriorated or were dependent in personal activities of daily living and performance in personal activities of daily living at the end of follow up., Main results, We identified 14 trials including 1617 patients. Therapy-based rehabilitation services reduced the odds of a poor outcome (Peto odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.92; P = 0.009) and increased personal activity of daily living scores (standardised mean difference 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.25; P = 0.02). For every 100 stroke patients resident in the community receiving therapy-based rehabilitation services, 7 (95% CI 2 to 11) patients would be spared a poor outcome, assuming 37.5% would have had a poor outcome with no treatment., Authors' conclusions, Therapy-based rehabilitation services targeted towards stroke patients living at home appear to improve independence in personal activities of daily living. However, the evidence is derived from a review of heterogeneous interventions and therefore further exploration of the interventions is justifiable.","(2010).

379,"Background, Organised stroke unit care is provided by multidisciplinary teams that exclusively manage stroke patients in a ward dedicated to stroke patients, with a mobile stroke team or within a generic disability service (mixed rehabilitation ward)., Objectives, To assess the effect of stroke unit care compared with alternative forms of care for people following a stroke., Search methods, We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (January 2013) and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group (January 2013), MEDLINE (2008 to September 2012), EMBASE (2008 to September 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to September 2012). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched 17 trial registers (January 2013), performed citation tracking of included studies, checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted trialists., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled clinical trials comparing organised inpatient stroke unit care with an alternative service. After formal risk of bias assessment, we have now excluded previously included quasi-randomised trials., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors initially assessed eligibility and trial quality. We checked descriptive details and trial data with the co-ordinators of the original trials., Main results, We included 28 trials, involving 5855 participants, comparing stroke unit care with an alternative service. More-organised care was consistently associated with improved outcomes. Twenty-one trials (3994 participants) compared stroke unit care with care provided in general wards. Stroke unit care showed reductions in the odds of death recorded at final (median one year) follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.94; P = 0.005), the odds of death or institutionalised care (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89; P = 0.0003) and the odds of death or dependency (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.90; P = 0.0007). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the observed benefits remained when the analysis was restricted to securely randomised trials that used unequivocally blinded outcome assessment with a fixed period of follow-up. Outcomes were independent of patient age, sex, initial stroke severity or stroke type, and appeared to be better in stroke units based in a discrete ward. There was no indication that organised stroke unit care resulted in a longer hospital stay., Authors' conclusions, Stroke patients who receive organised inpatient care in a stroke unit are more likely to be alive, independent, and living at home one year after the stroke. The benefits were most apparent in units based in a discrete ward. We observed no systematic increase in the length of inpatient stay.","(2017).

380,"Background, Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder that is characterised by persistent low mood, diminished interest, and loss of pleasure. Music therapy may be helpful in modulating moods and emotions. An update of the 2008 Cochrane review was needed to improve knowledge on effects of music therapy for depression., Objectives, 1. To assess effects of music therapy for depression in people of any age compared with treatment as usual (TAU) and psychological, pharmacological, and/or other therapies., Search methods, We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD-CTR; from inception to 6 May 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; to 17 June 2016); Thomson Reuters/Web of Science (to 21 June 2016); Ebsco/PsycInfo, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and PubMed (to 5 July 2016); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Guideline Clearing House, and OpenGrey (to 6 September 2016); and the Digital Access to Research Theses (DART)-Europe E-theses Portal, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database (to 7 September 2016). We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and contacted trialists and subject experts for additional information when needed. We updated this search in August 2017 and placed potentially relevant studies in the 'Awaiting classification' section; we will incorporate these into the next version of this review as appropriate., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing music therapy versus treatment as usual (TAU), psychological therapies, pharmacological therapies, other therapies, or different forms of music therapy for reducing depression., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I(superscript 2) statistic., Main results, We included in this review nine studies involving a total of 421 participants, 411 of whom were included in the meta-analysis examining short-term effects of music therapy for depression. Concerning primary outcomes, we found moderate-quality evidence of large effects favouring music therapy and TAU over TAU alone for both clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.69 to -0.27, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 219) and patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.85, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.34, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 142). Music therapy was not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU. Regarding secondary outcomes, music therapy plus TAU was superior to TAU alone for anxiety and functioning. Music therapy and TAU was not more effective than TAU alone for improved quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.80, P = 0.20, n = 67, low-quality evidence). We found no significant discrepancies in the numbers of participants who left the study early (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.70, P = 0.26, 5 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 293, moderate-quality evidence). Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy added to TAU provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression if compared to TAU alone. Additionally, we are uncertain about the effects of music therapy versus psychological therapies on clinician-rated depression (SMD -0.78, 95% CI -2.36 to 0.81, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -1.28, 95% CI -3.75 to 1.02, 4 RCTs, n = 131, low-quality evidence), quality of life (SMD -1.31, 95% CI - 0.36 to 2.99, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), and leaving the study early (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.49, 4 RCTs, n = 157, moderate-quality evidence). We found no eligible evidence ad","Sonja Aalbers, Laura Fusar-Poli, Ruth E. Freeman, Marinus Spreen, C. F. Johannes Ket, Annemiek C.

384,"Background, Since the mid-1970s, short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies (STPP) for a broad range of psychological and somatic disorders have been developed and studied. Early published meta-analyses of STPP, using different methods and samples, have yielded conflicting results, although some meta-analyses have consistently supported an empirical basis for STPP. This is an update of a review that was last updated in 2006., Objectives, To evaluate the efficacy of STPP for adults with common mental disorders compared with wait-list controls, treatments as usual and minimal contact controls in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). To specify the differential effects of STPP for people with different disorders (e.g. depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, mixed disorders and personality disorder) and treatment characteristics (e.g. manualised versus non-manualised therapies)., Search methods, The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) was searched to February 2014, this register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1967-). We also conducted searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, DARE and Biological Abstracts (all years to July 2012) and all relevant studies (identified to 2012) were fully incorporated in this review update. We checked references from papers retrieved. We contacted a large group of psychodynamic researchers in an attempt to find new studies., Selection criteria, We included all RCTs of adults with common mental disorders, in which a brief psychodynamic therapy lasting 40 or fewer hours in total was provided in individual format., Data collection and analysis, Eight review authors working in pairs evaluated studies. We selected studies only if pairs of review authors agreed that the studies met inclusion criteria. We consulted a third review author if two review authors could not reach consensus. Two review authors collected data and entered it into Review Manager software. Two review authors assessed and scored risk of bias. We assessed publication bias using a funnel plot. Two review authors conducted and reviewed subgroup analyses., Main results, We included 33 studies of STPP involving 2173 randomised participants with common mental disorders. Studies were of diverse conditions in which problems with emotional regulation were purported to play a causative role albeit through a range of symptom presentations. These studies evaluated STPP for this review's primary outcomes (general, somatic, anxiety and depressive symptom reduction), as well as interpersonal problems and social adjustment. Except for somatic measures in the short-term, all outcome categories suggested significantly greater improvement in the treatment versus the control groups in the short-term and medium-term. Effect sizes increased in long-term follow-up, but some of these effects did not reach statistical significance. A relatively small number of studies (N < 20) contributed data for the outcome categories. There was also significant heterogeneity between studies in most categories, possibly due to observed differences between manualised versus non-manualised treatments, short versus longer treatments, studies with observer-rated versus self report outcomes, and studies employing different treatment models., Authors' conclusions, There has been further study of STPP and it continues to show promise, with modest to large gains for a wide variety of people. However, given the limited data, loss of significance in some measures at long-term follow-up and heterogeneity between studies, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, variability in treatment delivery and treatment quality may limit the reliability of estimates of effect for STPP. Larger studies of higher quality and with specific diagnoses are warranted.","Allan A. Abbass, Steve R. Kisely, Joel M.

386,"Background, In recent years there has been a rise in the participation rate of women in employment. Some may become pregnant while in employment and subsequently deliver their babies. Most may decide to return early to work after giving birth for various reasons. Unless these mothers get support from their employers and fellow employees, they might give up breastfeeding when they return to work. As a result, the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding to the recommended age of the babies would be affected., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of workplace interventions to support and promote breastfeeding among women returning to paid work after the birth of their children, and its impact on process outcomes pertinent to employees and employers., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 August 2012)., Selection criteria, Two authors independently assessed all identified studies for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared workplace interventions with no intervention or two or more workplace interventions against each other., Data collection and analysis, Two authors planned to evaluate the methodological quality of the eligible trials and extract data., Main results, There were no randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials identified., Authors' conclusions, No trials have evaluated the effectiveness of workplace interventions in promoting breastfeeding among women returning to paid work after the birth of their child. The impact of such intervention on process outcomes is also unknown. Randomised controlled trials are required to establish the benefits of various types of workplace interventions to support, encourage and promote breastfeeding among working mothers.","Omar A.

387,"Background, Onchocerciasis, also known as 'river blindness,' is a parasitic disease that is caused by infection from the filarial nematode (roundworm), Onchocerca volvulus. Nematodes are transmitted from person to person by blackflies of the Simulium genus, which usually breed in fast flowing streams and rivers. The disease is the second leading infectious cause of blindness in endemic areas., Objectives, The primary aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of doxycycline plus ivermectin versus ivermectin alone for prevention and treatment of onchocerciasis. The secondary aim was to assess the effectiveness of doxycycline plus ivermectin versus ivermectin alone for prevention and treatment of onchocercal ocular lesions in communities co-endemic for onchocerciasis and Loa loa (loiasis) infection., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (Issue 7, 2015), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2015), PubMed (1948 to July 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to July 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) () (last searched 1 July 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov () and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 15 July 2015., Selection criteria, We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had compared doxycycline plus ivermectin versus ivermectin alone. Participants with or without one or more characteristic signs of ocular onchocerciasis resided in communities where onchocerciasis was endemic., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane., Main results, We identified three RCTs including a total of 466 participants with a diagnosis of onchocerciasis. All trials compared doxycycline plus ivermectin versus ivermectin alone. One study investigated improvement in visual impairment at six-month follow-up; the other two studies measured microfilarial loads in skin snips to assess sustained effects of treatment at follow-up of 21 months or longer. The studies were conducted at various centers across three countries (Cameroon, Ghana, and Liberia). We judged all studies to be at overall high risk of bias because of inadequate randomization and lack of masking (one study), missing data (two studies), and selective outcome reporting (three studies)., Authors' conclusions, Available evidence on the effectiveness of doxycycline plus ivermectin compared with ivermectin alone in preventing and treating onchocerciasis is unclear. Limited evidence of very low quality from two studies indicates that a six-week course of doxycycline followed by ivermectin may result in more frequent macrofilaricidal and microfilaricidal activity and sterilization of female adult Onchocerca compared with ivermectin alone; however, effects on vision-related outcomes are uncertain. Future studies should consider the effectiveness of treatments in preventing visual acuity and visual field loss and their effects on anterior and posterior segment lesions, particularly chorioretinitis. These studies should report outcomes in a uniform and consistent manner at follow-up of three years or longer to allow detection of meaningful changes in vision-related outcomes.","Ayokunle T.

388,"Background, This is an update of a Cochrane review that was first published in 2011 of the effects of reducing dietary salt intake, through advice to reduce salt intake or low-sodium salt substitution, on mortality and cardiovascular events., Objectives, 1. To assess the long-term effects of advice and salt substitution, aimed at reducing dietary salt, on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity., Search methods, We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2013, Issue 4), MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to April week 3 2013), EMBASE (OVID, 1947 to 30 April 2013) and CINAHL (EBSCO, inception to 1 April 2013) and last ran these on 1 May 2013. We also checked the references of included studies and reviews. We applied no language restrictions., Selection criteria, Trials fulfilled the following criteria: (1) randomised, with follow-up of at least six months, (2) the intervention was reduced dietary salt (through advice to reduce salt intake or low-sodium salt substitution), (3) participants were adults and (4) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data were available. Two review authors independently assessed whether studies met these criteria., Data collection and analysis, A single author extracted data and assessed study validity, and a second author checked this. We contacted trial authors where possible to obtain missing information. We extracted events and calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)., Main results, Eight studies met the inclusion criteria: three in normotensives (n = 3518) and five in hypertensives or mixed populations of normo- and hypertensives (n = 3766). End of trial follow-up ranged from six to 36 months and the longest observational follow-up (after trial end) was 12.7 years., Authors' conclusions, Despite collating more event data than previous systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, there is insufficient power to confirm clinically important effects of dietary advice and salt substitution on cardiovascular mortality in normotensive or hypertensive populations. Our estimates of the clinical benefits from advice to reduce dietary salt are imprecise, but are larger than would be predicted from the small blood pressure reductions achieved. Further well-powered studies would be needed to obtain more precise estimates. Our findings do not support individual dietary advice as a means of restricting salt intake. It is possible that alternative strategies that do not require individual behaviour change may be effective and merit further trials.","Alma J.

389,"Background, Ayurvedic medicine has been used to treat mental health problems since1000 BC., Objectives, To review effects of Ayurvedic medicine or treatments for schizophrenia., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2007) and AMED (March 2007), inspected references of all identified studies and contacted the first author of each included study., Selection criteria, We included all clinical randomised trials comparing Ayurvedic medicine or treatments with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses., Data collection and analysis, We independently extracted data and calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD)., Main results, From the three small (total n=250) short included studies, we were unable to extract any data on many broad clinically important outcomes such as global state, use of services, and satisfaction with treatment. When Ayurvedic herbs were compared with placebo, about 20% of people left the studies early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.37 to 1.62). Mental state ratings were mostly equivocal with the exception of the brahmyadiyoga group using Ayurvedic assessment (n=68, 1 RCT, RR not improved 0.56 CI 0.36 to 0.88, NNT 4 CI 3 to 12). Behaviour seemed unchanged (n=43, 1 RCT, WMD Fergus Falls Behaviour Rating 1.14 CI -1.63 to 3.91). Nausea and vomiting were common in the brahmyadiyoga group (n=43, RR 13.13 CI 0.80 to 216.30). When the Ayurvedic herbs were compared with antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine), again, equal numbers left the study early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR for brahmyadiyoga 0.91 CI 0.42 to 1.97) but people allocated herbs were at greater risk of no improvement in mental state compared to those allocated chlorpromazine (n=45, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.98). Again, nausea and vomiting were found with use of brahmyadiyoga (n=45, 1 RCT, RR 20.45 CI 1.09 to 383.97, NNH 2 CI 2 to 38). Finally, when Ayurvedic treatment, in this case a complex mixture of many herbs, is compared with chlorpromazine in acutely ill people with schizophrenia, it is equally (~10% attrition, n=36, RR 0.67 CI 0.13 to 3.53), but skewed data does seem to favour the chlorpromazine group., Authors' conclusions, Ayurvedic medication may have some effects for treatment of schizophrenia, but has been evaluated only in a few small pioneering trials.","Vishesh Agarwal, Akhil Abhijnhan, Prakash Raviraj (2009).

392,"Background, Outwardly-directed aggressive behaviour is a significant part of problem behaviours presented by people with intellectual disabilities. Prevalence rates of up to 50% have been reported in the literature, depending on the population sampled. Such behaviours often run a long-term course and are a major cause of social exclusion. This is an update of a previously published systematic review (see Hassiotis 2004; Hassiotis 2008)., Objectives, To evaluate the efficacy of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions on outwardly-directed aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities when compared to standard intervention or wait-list controls., Search methods, In April 2014 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and eight other databases. We also searched two trials registers, checked reference lists, and handsearched relevant journals to identify any additional trials., Selection criteria, We included studies if more than four participants (children or adults) were allocated by random or quasi-random methods to either intervention, standard treatment, or wait-list control groups., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently identified studies and extracted and assessed the quality of the data., Main results, We deemed six studies (309 participants), based on adult populations with intellectual disabilities, suitable for inclusion in the current version of this review. These studies examined a range of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches: anger management (three studies (n = 235); one individual therapy and two group-based); relaxation (one study; n = 12), mindfulness based on meditation (one study; n = 34), problem solving and assertiveness training (one study; n = 28). We were unable to include any studies using behavioural interventions. There were no studies of children., Authors' conclusions, The existing evidence on the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions on outwardly-directed aggression in children and adults with intellectual disabilities is limited. There is a paucity of methodologically sound clinical trials and a lack of long-term follow-up data. Given the impact of such behaviours on the individual and his or her support workers, effective interventions are essential. We recommend that randomised controlled trials of sufficient power are carried out using primary outcomes that include reduction in outward-directed aggressive behaviour, improvement in quality of life, and cost effectiveness.","Afia Ali, Ian Hall, Jessica Blickwedel, Angela Hassiotis (2015).

393,"Background, Spasticity is commonly experienced by people with multiple sclerosis (MS), and it contributes to overall disability in this population. A wide range of non pharmacological interventions are used in isolation or with pharmacological agents to treat spasticity in MS. Evidence for their effectiveness is yet to be determined., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of various non pharmacological interventions for the treatment of spasticity in adults with MS., Search methods, A literature search was performed using the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Review Group on using the Cochrane MS Group Trials Register which among other sources, contains CENTRAL, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDRO in June 2012. Manual searching in the relevant journals and screening of the reference lists of identified studies and reviews were carried out. Abstracts published in proceedings of conferences were also scrutinised., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported non pharmacological intervention/s for treatment of spasticity in adults with MS and compared them with some form of control intervention (such as sham/placebo interventions or lower level or different types of intervention, minimal intervention, waiting list controls or no treatment; interventions given in different settings), were included., Data collection and analysis, Three review authors independently selected the studies, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool for best-evidence synthesis. A meta-analysis was not possible due to methodological, clinical and statistical heterogeneity of included studies., Main results, Nine RCTs (N = 341 participants, 301 included in analyses) investigated various types and intensities of non pharmacological interventions for treating spasticity in adults with MS. These interventions included: physical activity programmes (such as physiotherapy, structured exercise programme, sports climbing); transcranial magnetic stimulation (Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS), Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)); electromagnetic therapy (pulsed electromagnetic therapy; magnetic pulsing device), Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS); and Whole Body Vibration (WBV). All studies scored 'low' on the methodological quality assessment implying high risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, There is 'low level' evidence for non pharmacological interventions such as physical activities given in conjunction with other interventions, and for magnetic stimulation and electromagnetic therapies for beneficial effects on spasticity outcomes in people with MS. A wide range of non pharmacological interventions are used for the treatment of spasticity in MS, but more robust trials are needed to build evidence about these interventions.","Bhasker Amatya, Fary Khan, Loredana La Mantia, Marina Demetrios, Derick T.

397,"Background, Racial and ethnic disparities in health status are pervasive at all stages of the life cycle. One approach to reducing health disparities involves mobilizing community coalitions that include representatives of target populations to plan and implement interventions for community level change. A systematic examination of coalition-led interventions is needed to inform decision making about the use of community coalition models., Objectives, To assess effects of community coalition-driven interventions in improving health status or reducing health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations., Search methods, We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, Social Science Citation Index, Dissertation Abstracts, System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) (from January 1990 through September 30, 2013), and Global Health Library (from January 1990 through March 31, 2014)., Selection criteria, Cluster-randomized controlled trials, randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies, and prospective controlled cohort studies. Only studies of community coalitions with at least one racial or ethnic minority group representing the target population and at least two community public or private organizations are included. Major outcomes of interest are direct measures of health status, as well as lifestyle factors when evidence indicates that these have an effect on the direct measures performed., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each study., Main results, Fifty-eight community coalition-driven intervention studies were included. No study was considered to be at low risk of bias. Behavioral change outcomes and health status change outcomes were analyzed separately. Outcomes are grouped by intervention type. Pooled effects across intervention types are not presented because the diverse community coalition-led intervention studies did not examine the same constructs or relationships, and they used dissimilar methodological designs. Broad-scale community system level change strategies led to little or no difference in measures of health behavior or health status (very low-certainty evidence). Broad health and social care system level strategies leds to small beneficial changes in measures of health behavior or health status in large samples of community residents (very low-certainty evidence). Lay community health outreach worker interventions led to beneficial changes in health behavior measures of moderate magnitude in large samples of community residents (very low-certainty evidence). Lay community health outreach worker interventions may lead to beneficial changes in health status measures in large samples of community residents; however, results were not consistent across studies (low-certainty evidence). Group-based health education led by professional staff resulted in moderate improvement in measures of health behavior (very low-certainty evidence) or health status (low-certainty evidence). Adverse outcomes of community coalition-led interventions were not reported., Authors' conclusions, Coalition-led interventions are characterized by connection of multi-sectoral networks of health and human service providers with ethnic and racial minority communities. These interventions benefit a diverse range of individual health outcomes and behaviors, as well as health and social care delivery systems. Evidence in this review shows that interventions led by community coalitions may connect health and human service providers with ethnic and racial minority communities in ways that benefit individual health outcomes and behaviors, as well as care delivery systems. However, because information on characteristics of the coalitions themselves is insufficient, evidence does not provide an explanation for the underlying mechanisms of benefic","Laurie M.

399,"Background, Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are estimated to affect up to 15% of the UK population at any one time, and health care systems worldwide need to implement interventions to reduce the impact and burden of these conditions. Collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety., Search methods, We searched the following databases to February 2012: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR-References and CCDANCTR-Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years); the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP); ClinicalTrials.gov; and CINAHL (to November 2010 only).

We also screened reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews., Selection criteria, We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to facilitate RTW of workers with adjustment disorders compared to no or other treatment. Eligible interventions were pharmacological interventions, psychological interventions (such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and problem solving therapy), relaxation techniques, exercise programmes, employee assistance programmes or combinations of these interventions. The primary outcomes were time to partial and time to full RTW, and secondary outcomes were severity of symptoms of adjustment disorder, work functioning, generic functional status (i.e. the overall functional capabilities of an individual, such as physical functioning, social function, general mental health) and quality of life., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We pooled studies that we deemed sufficiently clinically homogeneous in different comparison groups, and assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach., Main results, We included nine studies reporting on 10 psychological interventions and one combined intervention. The studies included 1546 participants. No RCTs were found of pharmacological interventions, exercise programmes or employee assistance programmes. We assessed seven studies as having low risk of bias and the studies that were pooled together were comparable. For those who received no treatment, compared with CBT, the assumed time to partial and full RTW was 88 and 252 days respectively. Based on two studies with a total of 159 participants, moderate-quality evidence showed that CBT had similar results for time (measured in days) until partial RTW compared to no treatment at one-year follow-up (mean difference (MD) -8.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) -23.26 to 5.71). We found low-quality evidence of similar results for CBT and no treatment on the reduction of days until full RTW at one-year follow-up (MD -35.73, 95% CI -113.15 to 41.69) (one study with 105 participants included in the analysis). Based on moderate-quality evidence, problem solving therapy (PST) significantly reduced time until partial RTW at one-year follow-up compared to non-guideline based care (MD -17.00, 95% CI -26.48 to -7.52) (one study with 192 participants clustered among 33 treatment providers included in the analysis), but we found moderate-quality evidence of no significant effect on reducing days until full RTW at one-year follow-up (MD -17.73, 95% CI -37.35 to 1.90) (two studies with 342 participants included in the analysis)., Authors' conclusions, We found moderate-quality evidence that CBT did not significantly reduce time until partial RTW and low-quality evidence that it did not significantly reduce time to full RTW compared with no treatment. Moderate-quality evidence showed that PST significantly enhanced partial RTW at one-year follow-up compared to non-guideline based care but did not significantly enhance time to full RTW at one-year follow-up. An important limitation was the small number of studies included in the meta-analyses and the small number of participants, which lowered the power of the analyses.","Iris Arends, David J.

401,"Background, Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) appears to be effective in the treatment of antisocial behavior both in adolescents and adults. Treatment of antisocial behavior in youth in residential settings is a challenge since it usually involves more serious behavioral problems and takes place in a closed setting. The motivation for change is usually low and there is little possibility to address the maintenance of any behavioral changes following release., Objectives, To investigate the effectiveness of CBT in reducing recidivism of adolescents placed in secure or non-secure residential settings. A secondary objective was to see if interventions that focus particularly on criminogenic needs are more effective than those with a more general focus on cognitions and behavior., Search methods, We searched a number of databases including: CENTRAL 2005 (Issue 2), MEDLINE 1966 to May 2005, Sociological Abstracts 1963 to May 2005, ERIC 1966 to November 2004, Dissertation Abstracts International 1960s to 2005. We contacted experts in the field concerning current research., Selection criteria, Both randomised controlled trials and studies with non-randomized comparison groups were included. Participants had to be young people aged 12-22 and placed in a residential setting for reasons of antisocial behavior., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently reviewed 93 titles and abstracts; 35 full-text reports were retrieved and data from 12 trials eligible for inclusion were extracted and entered into RevMan. Results were synthesized using a random effects model, due to the significant heterogeneity across included studies. Results are reported at 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment, and presented in graphical (forest plots) form. Odds ratios are used throughout and intention-to-treat analyses were made with drop-outs imputed proportionally. Pooled estimates were weighted with inverse variance methods and 95% confidence intervals were used., Main results, The results for 12 months follow-up show that although single studies generally show no significant effects, the results for pooled data are clearly significant in favor of CBT compared to standard treatment with an odds ratio of 0,69. The reduction in recidivism is about 10% on the average. There is no evidence of effects after 6 or 24 months or when CBT is compared to alternative treatments., Authors' conclusions, CBT seems to be a little more effective than standard treatment for youth in residential settings. The effects appear about one year after release, but there is no evidence of more long-term effects or that CBT is any better than alternative treatments.","BengtAke Armelius, Henning Tore Andreassen (2009).

402,"Background, Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic demonstrated to be superior in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia which causes fewer movement disorders. Clozapine, however, entails a significant risk of serious blood disorders such as agranulocytosis which could be potentially fatal. Currently there are a number of newer antipsychotics which have been developed with the purpose to find both a better tolerability profile and a superior effectiveness., Objectives, To compare the clinical effects of clozapine with other atypical antipsychotics (such as amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone and zotepine) in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (June 2007) and reference lists of all included randomised controlled trials. We also manually searched appropriate journals and conference proceedings relating to clozapine combination strategies and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised, at least single-blind trials, comparing clozapine with other atypical antipsychotics, any dose and oral formulations, for people with schizophrenia or related disorders., Data collection and analysis, We selected trials and extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a random-effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) again based on a random-effects model., Main results, The review currently includes 27 blinded randomised controlled trials, which involved 3099 participants. Twelve randomised control trials compared clozapine with olanzapine, five with quetiapine, nine with risperidone, one with ziprasidone and two with zotepine. Attrition from these studies was high (overall 30.1%), leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Clozapine had a higher attrition rate due to adverse effects than olanzapine (9 RCTs, n=1674, RR 1.60 CI 1.07 to 2.40, NNT 25 CI 15 to 73) and risperidone (6 RCTs, n=627, RR 1.88 CI 1.11 to 3.21, NNT 16 CI 9 to 59). Fewer participants in the clozapine groups left the trials early due to inefficacy than risperidone (6 RCTs, n=627, RR 0.40 CI 0.23 to 0.70, NNT 11 CI 7 to 21), suggesting a certain higher efficacy of clozapine., Authors' conclusions, Clozapine may be a little more efficacious than zotepine and risperidone but further trials are required to confirm this finding. Clozapine differs more clearly in adverse effects from other second generation antipsychotics and the side-effect profile could be key in the selection of treatment depending on the clinical situation and a patient's preferences. Data on other important outcomes such as cognitive functioning, quality of life, death or service use are currently largely missing, making further large and well-designed trials necessary. It is also important to take into account that the large number of people leaving the studies early limits the validity and interpretation of our findings.","Claudia Asenjo Lobos, Katja Komossa, Christine RummelKluge, Heike Hunger, Franziska Schmid, Sandra Schwarz, Stefan Leucht (2010).

403,"Background, Psychosis is three times more common in people with an intellectual disability than in those without an intellectual disability. A low intelligence quotient (IQ) is a defining characteristic for intellectual disability and a risk factor for poor outcome in psychosis. Clozapine is recommended for treatment-resistant psychosis. The effect of psychotropic medication can be different in people with intellectual disability; for example, they may be more prone to side effects. People with an intellectual disability and psychosis form a special subgroup and we wanted to examine if there is randomised controlled trial (RCT) data in this population to support the use of clozapine., Objectives, To determine the effects of clozapine for treating adults with a dual diagnosis of intellectual disability and psychosis., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and eight other databases up to December 2014. We also searched two trials registers, the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials, and contacted the manufacturers of clozapine., Selection criteria, RCTs that assessed the effects of clozapine, at any dose, for treating adults (aged 18 years and over) with a dual diagnosis of intellectual disability and psychotic disorder, compared with placebo or another antipsychotic medication., Data collection and analysis, Three review authors independently screened all titles, abstracts and any relevant full-text reports against the inclusion criteria., Main results, Of the 1224 titles and abstracts screened, we shortlisted 38 full-text articles, which we subsequently excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. These studies were not RCTs. Consequently, no studies are included in this Cochrane review., Authors' conclusions, There are currently no RCTs that assess the efficacy and side effects of clozapine in people with intellectual disabilities and psychoses. Given the use of clozapine in this vulnerable population, there is an urgent need for a RCT of clozapine in people with a dual diagnosis of intellectual disability and psychosis to fill the evidence gap.","Muhammad Ayub, Khalid Saeed, Tariq A.

404,"Background, Cognitive impairments, particularly memory problems, are a defining feature of the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are specific interventional approaches designed to address difficulties with memory and other aspects of cognitive functioning. The present review is an update of previous versions of this review., Objectives, The main aim of the current review was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia in relation to important cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes for the person with dementia and the primary caregiver in the short, medium and long term., Search methods, The CDCIG Specialized Register, ALOIS, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS and many other clinical trial databases and grey literature sources, was most recently searched on 2 November 2012., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, comparing cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive training interventions with control conditions, and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the family caregiver, were considered for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, Eleven RCTs reporting cognitive training interventions were included in the review. A large number of measures were used in the different studies, and meta-analysis could be conducted for 11 of the primary and secondary outcomes of interest. Several outcomes were not measured in any of the studies. The unit of analysis in the meta-analysis was the change from baseline score. Overall estimates of treatment effect were calculated using a fixed-effect model, and statistical heterogeneity was measured using a standard Chi(superscript 2) statistic. One RCT of cognitive rehabilitation was identified, allowing examination of effect sizes, but no meta-analysis could be conducted., Main results, Cognitive training was not associated with positive or negative effects in relation to any reported outcomes. The overall quality of the trials was low to moderate. The single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation found promising results in relation to a number of participant and caregiver outcomes, and was generally of high quality., Authors' conclusions, Available evidence regarding cognitive training remains limited, and the quality of the evidence needs to improve. However, there is still no indication of any significant benefit derived from cognitive training. Trial reports indicate that some gains resulting from intervention may not be captured adequately by available standardised outcome measures. The results of the single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation show promise but are preliminary in nature. Further, well-designed studies of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are required to obtain more definitive evidence. Researchers should describe and classify their interventions appropriately using available terminology.","Alex BaharFuchs, Linda Clare, Bob Woods (2013).

405,"Background, Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder complicating pregnancy, and is associated with a range of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. There is strong evidence however, that the adequate control of asthma can improve health outcomes for mothers and their babies. Despite known risks of poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy, a large proportion of women have sub-optimal asthma control, due to concerns surrounding risks of pharmacological agents, and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and safety of different management strategies., Objectives, To assess the effects of interventions (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) for managing women's asthma in pregnancy on maternal and fetal/infant outcomes., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 June 2014) and the Cochrane Airways Group's Trials Register (4 June 2014)., Selection criteria, Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention used to manage asthma in pregnancy, with placebo, no intervention, or an alternative intervention. We included pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (including combined interventions). Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion (but none were identified). Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, At least two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy., Main results, We included eight trials in this review, involving 1181 women and their babies. Overall we judged two trials to be at low risk of bias, two to be of unclear risk of bias, and four to be at moderate risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, Based on eight included trials, of moderate quality overall, no firm conclusions about optimal interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy can be made. Five trials assessing pharmacological interventions did not provide clear evidence of benefits or harms to support or refute current practice. While inhaled magnesium sulphate for acute asthma was shown to reduce exacerbations, this was in one small trial of unclear quality, and thus this finding should be interpreted with caution. Three trials assessing non-pharmacological interventions provided some support for the use of such strategies, however were not powered to detect differences in important maternal and infant outcomes. While a FENO-based algorithm reduced exacerbations, the effects on perinatal outcomes were less certain, and thus widespread implementation is not yet appropriate. Similarly, though positive effects on asthma control were shown with PMR and pharmacist-led management, the evidence to date is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions.","Emily Bain, Kristen L.

406,"Background, Multi-strategic community wide interventions for physical activity are increasingly popular but their ability to achieve population level improvements is unknown., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of community wide, multi-strategic interventions upon population levels of physical activity., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Public Health Group Segment of the Cochrane Register of Studies,The Cochrane LibraryMEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, ASSIA, the British Nursing Index, Chinese CNKI databases, EPPI Centre (DoPHER, TRoPHI), ERIC, HMIC, Sociological Abstracts, SPORTDiscus, Transport Database and Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index). We also scanned websites of the EU Platform on Diet, Physical Activity and Health; Health-Evidence.org; the International Union for Health Promotion and Education; the NIHR Coordinating Centre for Health Technology (NCCHTA); the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NICE and SIGN guidelines. Reference lists of all relevant systematic reviews, guidelines and primary studies were searched and we contacted experts in the field. The searches were updated to 16 January 2014, unrestricted by language or publication status., Selection criteria, Cluster randomised controlled trials, randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs which used a control population for comparison, interrupted time-series studies, and prospective controlled cohort studies were included. Only studies with a minimum six-month follow up from the start of the intervention to measurement of outcomes were included. Community wide interventions had to comprise at least two broad strategies aimed at physical activity for the whole population. Studies which randomised individuals from the same community were excluded., Data collection and analysis, At least two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Each study was assessed for the setting, the number of included components and their intensity. The primary outcome measures were grouped according to whether they were dichotomous (per cent physically active, per cent physically active during leisure time, and per cent physically inactive) or continuous (leisure time physical activity time (time spent)), walking (time spent), energy expenditure (as metabolic equivalents or METS)). For dichotomous measures we calculated the unadjusted and adjusted risk difference, and the unadjusted and adjusted relative risk. For continuous measures we calculated percentage change from baseline, unadjusted and adjusted., Main results, After the selection process had been completed, 33 studies were included. A total of 267 communities were included in the review (populations between 500 and 1.9 million). Of the included studies, 25 were set in high income countries and eight were in low income countries. The interventions varied by the number of strategies included and their intensity. Almost all of the interventions included a component of building partnerships with local governments or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (29 studies). None of the studies provided results by socio-economic disadvantage or other markers of equity. However, of those included studies undertaken in high income countries, 14 studies were described as being provided to deprived, disadvantaged or low socio-economic communities. Nineteen studies were identified as having a high risk of bias, 10 studies were unclear, and four studies had a low risk of bias. Selection bias was a major concern with these studies, with only five studies using randomisation to allocate communities. Four studies were judged as being at low risk of selection bias although 19 studies were considered to have an unclear risk of bias. Twelve studies had a high risk of detection bias, 13 an unclear risk and four a low risk of bias. Generally, the better designed studies showed no improvement in the primary outcome measure of physical activity at a population","R. A. Philip Baker, Daniel P. Francis, Jesus Soares, Alison L.

408,"Background, This is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in 2005 on selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for preventing migraine and tension-type headache. The original review has been split in two parts and this review now only regards tension-type headache prevention. Another updated review covers migraine. Tension-type headache is the second most common disorder worldwide and has high social and economic relevance. As serotonin and other neurotransmitters may have a role in pain mechanisms, SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been evaluated for the prevention of tension-type headache., Objectives, To determine the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs and SNRIs compared to placebo and other active interventions in the prevention of episodic and chronic tension-type headache in adults., Search methods, For the original review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2003, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1994 to May 2003), and Headache Quarterly (1990 to 2003). For this update, we revised the original search strategy to reflect the broader type of intervention (SSRIs and SNRIs). We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10) on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to November 2014), EMBASE (1980 to November 2014), and PsycINFO (1987 to November 2014). We also checked the reference lists of retrieved articles and searched trial registries for ongoing trials., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with any type of control intervention in participants 18 years and older, of either sex, with tension-type headache., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently extracted data (headache frequency, index, intensity, and duration; use of symptomatic/analgesic medication; quality of life; and withdrawals) and assessed the risk of bias of trials. The primary outcome is tension-type headache frequency, measured by the number of headache attacks or the number of days with headache per evaluation period., Main results, The original review included six studies on tension-type headache. We now include eight studies with a total of 412 participants with chronic forms of tension-type headache. These studies evaluated five SSRIs (citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine) and one SNRI (venlafaxine). The two new studies included in this update are placebo controlled trials, one evaluated sertraline and one venlafaxine. Six studies, already included in the previous version of this review, compared SSRIs to other antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, sulpiride, mianserin). Most of the included studies had methodological and/or reporting shortcomings and lacked adequate power. Follow-up ranged between two and four months., Authors' conclusions, Since the last version of this review, the new included studies have not added high quality evidence to support the use of SSRIs or venlafaxine (a SNRI) as preventive drugs for tension-type headache. Over two months of treatment, SSRIs or venlafaxine are no more effective than placebo or amitriptyline in reducing headache frequency in patients with chronic tension-type headache. SSRIs seem to be less effective than tricyclic antidepressants in terms of intake of analgesic medications. Tricyclic antidepressants are associated with more adverse events; however, this did not cause a greater number of withdrawals. No reliable information is available at longer follow-up. Our conclusion is that the use of SSRIs and venlafaxine for the prevention of chronic tension-type headache is not supported by evidence.","Rita Banzi, Cristina Cusi, Concetta Randazzo, Roberto Sterzi, Dario Tedesco, Lorenzo Moja (2016).

409,"Background, Activity limitations of the upper extremity are a common finding for individuals living with stroke. Mental practice (MP) is a training method that uses cognitive rehearsal of activities to improve performance of those activities., Objectives, To determine if MP improves the outcome of upper extremity rehabilitation for individuals living with the effects of stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (November 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane LibraryNovember 2009), PubMed (1965 to November 2009), EMBASE (1980 to November 2009), CINAHL (1982 to November 2009), PsycINFO (1872 to November 2009), Scopus (1996 to November 2009), Web of Science (1955 to November 2009), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), CIRRIE, REHABDATA, ongoing trials registers, and also handsearched relevant journals and searched reference lists., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials involving adults with stroke who had deficits in upper extremity function., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion. We considered the primary outcome to be the ability of the arm to be used for appropriate tasks (i.e. arm function)., Main results, We included six studies involving 119 participants. We combined studies that evaluated MP in addition to another treatment versus the other treatment alone. Mental practice in combination with other treatment appears more effective in improving upper extremity function than the other treatment alone (Z = 3.48, P = 0.0005; standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 2.15). We attempted subgroup analyses, based on time since stroke and dosage of MP; however, numbers in each group were small. We evaluated the quality of the evidence with the PEDro scale, ranging from 6 to 9 out of 10; we determined the GRADE score to be moderate., Authors' conclusions, There is limited evidence to suggest that MP in combination with other rehabilitation treatment appears to be beneficial in improving upper extremity function after stroke, as compared with other rehabilitation treatment without MP. Evidence regarding improvement in motor recovery and quality of movement is less clear. There is no clear pattern regarding the ideal dosage of MP required to improve outcomes. Further studies are required to evaluate the effect of MP on time post stroke, volume of MP that is required to affect the outcomes and whether improvement is maintained long-term. Numerous large ongoing studies will soon improve the evidence base.","Ruth E. BarclayGoddard, Ted J. Stevenson, William Poluha, Leyda Thalman (2011).

410,"Background, Childbirth is a complex life event that can be associated with both positive and negative psychological responses. When giving birth is experienced as particularly traumatic this can have a negative impact on a woman's postnatal emotional well-being. There has been an increasing focus on women's psychological trauma symptoms following childbirth, including the relatively rare phenomenon of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the benefit of debriefing interventions to prevent this. In this review we examined the evidence for debriefing as a preventative intervention for psychological trauma following childbirth., Objectives, To assess the effects of debriefing interventions compared with standard postnatal care for the prevention of psychological trauma in women following childbirth., Search methods, The trials registers of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDANCTR-References and CCDANCTR-Studies) and the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group were searched up to 4 March 2015. These registers include relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Library (all years to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Additional searches were conducted in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Maternity and Infant Care. The reference lists of all included studies were checked for additional published reports and citations of unpublished research. Experts in the field were contacted., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials comparing postnatal debriefing interventions with standard postnatal care for the prevention of psychological trauma of women following childbirth. The intervention consisted of at least one debriefing intervention session, which had the purpose of allowing women to describe their experience and to normalise their emotional reaction to that experience., Data collection and analysis, Three authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Meta-analysis was conducted where there were more than two trials examining the same outcomes., Main results, We included seven trials (eight articles) from three countries (UK, Australia and Sweden) that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The number of women contributing data to each outcome varied from 102 to 1745. Methodological quality was variable and most of the studies were of low quality. The quality of evidence for the prevalence of psychological trauma (primary outcome) and the prevalence of depression symptoms was rated low or very low, based on few studies (ranging from a single study to three studies) with high risk of bias in main domains such as performance bias, random sequence generation, allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. The quality of evidence for the remaining outcomes (that is prevalence of anxiety, prevalence of fear of childbirth, prevalence of general psychological morbidity, health service utilization and attrition from treatment) was not assessed as data were not available., Authors' conclusions, We did not find any high quality evidence to inform practice, with substantial heterogeneity being found between the studies conducted to date. There is little or no evidence to support either a positive or adverse effect of psychological debriefing for the prevention of psychological trauma in women following childbirth. There is no evidence to support routine debriefing for women who perceive giving birth as psychologically traumatic.","Helena Maria Bastos, Marie Furuta, Rhonda Small, Kirstie McKenzieMcHarg, Debra Bick (2015).

411,"Background, Pain is one of the most common symptoms in children and young people (CYP) with life-limiting conditions (LLCs) which include a wide range of diagnoses including cancer. The current literature indicates that pain is not well managed, however the evidence base to guide clinicians is limited. There is a clear need for evidence from a systematic review to inform prescribing., Objectives, To evaluate the evidence on the effectiveness of different pharmacological interventions used for pain in CYP with LLCs., Search methods, The following electronic databases were searched up to December 2014: CENTRAL (in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL. In addition, we searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included studies. For completeness, we also contacted experts in the field. No language restrictions were applied., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised studies and other studies that included a clearly defined comparator group were included. The studies investigated pharmacological treatments for pain associated with LLCs in CYP. The treatment included those specifically developed to treat pain and those that acted as an adjuvant, where the treatment was not primarily developed to treat pain but has pain relieving properties. The LLC was identified by its inclusion in the Richard Hain Directory of LLCs., Data collection and analysis, Citations were screened by five review authors. Data were extracted by one review author and checked by a second. Two review authors assessed the risk of bias of included studies. A sufficient number of studies using homogeneous outcomes was not identified so a meta-analysis was not possible., Main results, We identified 24,704 citations from our database search. Nine trials with 379 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Participants had cerebral palsy (CP) in five of the studies and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) in the other four. Participants across the trials ranged in age from 2 to 19 years. All studies, apart from one cross-over trial, were parallel designed RCTs. Three of the trials on CP evaluated intrathecal baclofen (ITB) and two botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A). All of the OI trials evaluated the use of bisphosphonates (two alendronate and one pamidronate). No trials were identified that evaluated a commonly used analgesic in this patient group. Pain was a secondary outcome in five of the eight identified studies. Overall the quality of the trials was mixed. Only one study involved over 100 participants., Authors' conclusions, Published, controlled evidence on the pharmacological interventions for pain in CYP with LLCs is limited. The evidence that is currently available evaluated pain largely as a secondary outcome and the drugs used were all adjuvants and not always commonly used in general paediatric palliative care for pain. Based on current data this systematic review is unable to determine the effects of pharmacological interventions for pain for CYP with LLCs. Future trials with larger populations should examine the effects of the drugs commonly used as analgesics; with the rising prevalence of many LLCs this becomes more necessary.","Emma Beecham, Bridget Candy, Richard Howard, Renee McCulloch, Jo Laddie, Henrietta Rees, Victoria Vickerstaff, Myra Bluebond-Langner, Louise Jones (2017).

412,"Background, Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disorder worldwide and is associated with significant pain and disability., Objectives, To assess the effects of viscosupplementation in the treatment of OA of the knee. The products were hyaluronan and hylan derivatives (Adant, Arthrum H, Artz (Artzal, Supartz), BioHy (Arthrease, Euflexxa, Nuflexxa), Durolane, Fermathron, Go-On, Hyalgan, Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc Hylan G-F 20), Hyruan, NRD-101 (Suvenyl), Orthovisc, Ostenil, Replasyn, SLM-10, Suplasyn, Synject and Zeel compositum)., Search methods, MEDLINE (up to January (week 1) 2006 for update), EMBASE, PREMEDLINE, Current Contents up to July 2003, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched. Specialised journals and reference lists of identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and pertinent review articles up to December 2005 were handsearched., Selection criteria, RCTs of viscosupplementation for the treatment of people with a diagnosis of OA of the knee were eligible. Single and double-blinded studies, placebo-based and comparative studies were eligible. At least one of the four OMERACT III core set outcome measures had to be reported (Bellamy 1997)., Data collection and analysis, Each trial was assessed independently by two reviewers for its methodological quality using a validated tool. All data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer Continuous outcome measures were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). However, where different scales were used to measure the same outcome, standardized mean differences (SMD) were used. Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed by relative risk (RR)., Main results, Seventy-six trials with a median quality score of 3 (range 1 to 5) were identified. Follow-up periods varied between day of last injection and eighteen months. Forty trials included comparisons of hyaluronan/hylan and placebo (saline or arthrocentesis), ten trials included comparisons of intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, six trials included comparisons of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), three trials included comparisons of physical therapy, two trials included comparisons of exercise, two trials included comparisons of arthroscopy, two trials included comparisons of conventional treatment, and fifteen trials included comparisons of other hyaluronans/hylan. The pooled analyses of the effects of viscosupplements against 'placebo' controls generally supported the efficacy of this class of intervention. In these same analyses, differential efficacy effects were observed for different products on different variables and at different timepoints. Of note is the 5 to 13 week post injection period which showed a percent improvement from baseline of 28 to 54% for pain and 9 to 32% for function. In general, comparable efficacy was noted against NSAIDs and longer-term benefits were noted in comparisons against IA corticosteroids. In general, few adverse events were reported in the hyaluronan/hylan trials included in these analyses., Authors' conclusions, Based on the aforementioned analyses, viscosupplementation is an effective treatment for OA of the knee with beneficial effects: on pain, function and patient global assessment; and at different post injection periods but especially at the 5 to 13 week post injection period. It is of note that the magnitude of the clinical effect, as expressed by the WMD and standardised mean difference (SMD) from the RevMan 4.2 output, is different for different products, comparisons, timepoints, variables and trial designs. However, there are few randomised head-to-head comparisons of different viscosupplements and readers should be cautious, therefore, in drawing conclusions regarding the relative value of different products. The clinical effect for some products, against placebo, on some variables at some timepoints is in the moderate to large effect-size range. Readers should refer to relevant tables to review specific detail given the heterogeneity in effect","Nicholas Bellamy, Jane Campbell, Vivian Welch, Travis L. Gee, Robert Bourne, George A.

413,"Background, Most cases of stroke are caused by impairment of blood flow to the brain (ischaemia), which results in a reduction in available oxygen and subsequent cell death. It has been postulated that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) may reduce the volume of brain that will die by greatly increasing available oxygen, and it may further improve outcomes by reducing brain swelling. Some centres are using HBOT routinely to treat people with stroke. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2005., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive HBOT in the treatment of people with acute ischaemic stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched April 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (April 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2014), EMBASE (1980 to April 2014), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to April 2014), the Database of Randomised Controlled Trials in Hyperbaric Medicine (DORCTIHM) (searched April 2014) and the reference lists of articles. We handsearched relevant publications and contacted researchers to identify additional published and unpublished studies., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of adjunctive HBOT versus those of no HBOT (no treatment or sham)., Data collection and analysis, Three review authors independently extracted data, assessed each trial for internal validity and resolved differences by discussion., Main results, We included 11 RCTs involving 705 participants. The methodological quality of the trials varied. We could pool data only for case fatalities. No significant differences were noted in the case fatality rate at six months in those receiving HBOT compared with the control group (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 2.75, P value 0.96). Four of 14 scale measures of disability and functional performance indicated improvement following HBOT, for example, the mean Trouillas Disability Scale score was lower with HBOT (mean difference (MD) 2.2 point reduction with HBOT, 95% CI 0.15 to 4.3, P value 0.04), and the mean Orgogozo Scale score was higher (MD 27.9 points, 95% CI 4.0 to 51.8, P value 0.02)., Authors' conclusions, We found no good evidence to show that HBOT improves clinical outcomes when applied during acute presentation of ischaemic stroke. Although evidence from the 11 RCTs is insufficient to provide clear guidelines for practice, the possibility of clinical benefit has not been excluded. Further research is required to better define the role of HBOT in this condition.","Michael H. Bennett, Stephanie Weibel, Jason Wasiak, Alexander Schnabel, Christopher French, Peter Kranke (2014).

414,"Background, Cancer-related fatigue is reported as the most common and distressing symptom experienced by patients with cancer. It can exacerbate the experience of other symptoms, negatively affect mood, interfere with the ability to carry out everyday activities, and negatively impact on quality of life. Educational interventions may help people to manage this fatigue or to cope with this symptom, and reduce its overall burden. Despite the importance of education for managing cancer-related fatigue there are currently no systematic reviews examining this approach., Objectives, To determine the effectiveness of educational interventions for managing cancer-related fatigue in adults., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, OTseeker and PEDro up to 1st November 2016. We also searched trials registries., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of educational interventions focused on cancer-related fatigue where fatigue was a primary outcome. Studies must have aimed to evaluate the effect of educational interventions designed specifically to manage cancer-related fatigue, or to evaluate educational interventions targeting a constellation of physical symptoms or quality of life where fatigue was the primary focus. The studies could have compared educational interventions with no intervention or wait list controls, usual care or attention controls, or an alternative intervention for cancer-related fatigue in adults with any type of cancer., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion. Trial authors were contacted for additional information. A third independent person checked the data extraction. The main outcome considered in this review was cancer-related fatigue. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of Findings' table., Main results, We included 14 RCTs with 2213 participants across different cancer diagnoses. Four studies used only 'information-giving' educational strategies, whereas the remainder used mainly information-giving strategies coupled with some problem-solving, reinforcement, or support techniques. Interventions differed in delivery including: mode of delivery (face to face, web-based, audiotape, telephone); group or individual interventions; number of sessions provided (ranging from 2 to 12 sessions); and timing of intervention in relation to completion of cancer treatment (during or after completion). Most trials compared educational interventions to usual care and meta-analyses compared educational interventions to usual care or attention controls. Methodological issues that increased the risk of bias were evident including lack of blinding of outcome assessors, unclear allocation concealment in over half of the studies, and generally small sample sizes. Using the GRADE approach, we rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate, downgraded mainly due to high risk of bias, unexplained heterogeneity, and imprecision., Authors' conclusions, Educational interventions may have a small effect on reducing fatigue intensity, fatigue's interference with daily life, and general fatigue, and could have a moderate effect on reducing fatigue distress. Educational interventions focused on fatigue may also help reduce anxiety and improve global quality of life, but it is unclear what effect they might have on capacity for activities of daily living or depressive symptoms. Additional studies undertaken in the future are likely to impact on our confidence in the conclusions.","Sally Bennett, Amanda Pigott, Elaine M.

415,"Background, Very early mobilisation is performed in some stroke units and recommended in acute stroke clinical guidelines. It is unclear whether very early mobilisation independently improves outcome after stroke., Objectives, To determine the benefits and harms of very early mobilisation (commenced within 48 hours of stroke) compared with conventional care., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched April 2008). In addition, we searched 25 databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2007), EMBASE (1980 to September 2007), CINAHL (1982 to December 2006), and AMED (1985 to January 2007). We also searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched January 2007) and the Chinese medical database Wanfangdata (searched March 2007), handsearched journals, searched reference lists and contacted researchers in the field., Selection criteria, Unconfounded RCTs of acute stroke patients, comparing an intervention group that started out of bed mobilisation within 48 hours of stroke and aimed to reduce time to first mobilisation and/or increase the amount or frequency (or both) of mobilisation, with conventional care., Data collection and analysis, One review author eliminated obviously irrelevant records; two review authors independently applied selection criteria to remaining studies. The primary outcome was death or poor outcome (dependency or institutionalisation) at the end of scheduled follow up. Secondary outcomes included mortality, dependency, institutionalisation, activities of daily living (ADLs), quality of life, time to walking, adverse events (e.g. deep vein thrombosis) and patient mood., Main results, One study, involving 71 participants, was included. In this study the experimental group had earlier and more frequent mobilisation than the control group (median 18.1 hours post stroke for experimental group versus 30.8 hours control; 167 minutes of mobilisation (interquartile range (IQR) 62 to 305) during admission for experimental group versus 69 (IQR 31 to 115) minutes control). Fewer patients who received early and frequent mobilisation were dead or disabled at three months, but this was not statistically significant and the confidence intervals were wide (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.79, P = 0.42). No significant difference on any secondary outcomes of interest were found., Authors' conclusions, We found insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of routine very early mobilisation after stroke, compared with conventional care. More research is required to determine the benefits and harms of very early mobilisation after stroke.","Julie Bernhardt, N. T. Matthew Thuy, Janice M. Collier, Lynn A. Legg (2010).

416,"Background, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a distressing condition, which is often treated with psychological therapies. Earlier versions of this review, and other meta-analyses, have found these to be effective, with trauma-focused treatments being more effective than non-trauma-focused treatments. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and updated in 2007., Objectives, To assess the effects of psychological therapies for the treatment of adults with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)., Search methods, For this update, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) all years to 12th April 2013. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition, we handsearched the Journal of Traumatic Stress, contacted experts in the field, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), non-trauma-focused CBT (non-TFCBT), other therapies (supportive therapy, non-directive counselling, psychodynamic therapy and present-centred therapy), group TFCBT, or group non-TFCBT, compared to one another or to a waitlist or usual care group for the treatment of chronic PTSD. The primary outcome measure was the severity of clinician-rated traumatic-stress symptoms., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data and entered them into Review Manager 5 software. We contacted authors to obtain missing data. Two review authors independently performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We pooled the data where appropriate, and analysed for summary effects., Main results, We include 70 studies involving a total of 4761 participants in the review. The first primary outcome for this review was reduction in the severity of PTSD symptoms, using a standardised measure rated by a clinician. For this outcome, individual TFCBT and EMDR were more effective than waitlist/usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.62; 95% CI -2.03 to -1.21; 28 studies; n = 1256 and SMD -1.17; 95% CI -2.04 to -0.30; 6 studies; n = 183 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between individual TFCBT, EMDR and Stress Management (SM) immediately post-treatment although there was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR were superior to non-TFCBT at follow-up, and that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT were more effective than other therapies. Non-TFCBT was more effective than waitlist/usual care and other therapies. Other therapies were superior to waitlist/usual care control as was group TFCBT. There was some evidence of greater drop-out (the second primary outcome for this review) in active treatment groups. Many of the studies were rated as being at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias in multiple domains, and there was considerable unexplained heterogeneity; in addition, we assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison as very low. As such, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution., Authors' conclusions, The evidence for each of the comparisons made in this review was assessed as very low quality. This evidence showed that individual TFCBT and EMDR did better than waitlist/usual care in reducing clinician-assessed PTSD symptoms. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT are equally effective immediately post-treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non-TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. There was evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups. Although a substantial number of studies were included in the review, the conclusions are compromised","Jonathan I. Bisson, Neil P.

417,"Background, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is diagnosed in between 3% and 7% of school-age children and consists of the core symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Children are often treated with medication, usually stimulant medication such as methylphenidate. Stimulant medication has been found to be effective for alleviating ADHD symptoms, at least in the short term. ADHD is also treated with a variety of psychosocial and psychoeducational interventions for parents, children, and with multicomponent interventions combined with medication management. However, many patients (10 to 13% of patients) cannot or prefer not to take medication. Family therapy without medication may help to develop structure in the family, help to manage children's behaviour, and may help families cope with distress from the presence of the disorder., Objectives, This review seeks to address the question of whether family therapy without medication can reduce the core symptoms of ADHD as compared to no treatment or standard treatment., Search strategy, The following electronic databases were searched using a specific search strategy: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2004), PsycINFO (1872 to April 2004), CINAHL (1982 to April 2004), Biosis (Biological Abstracts) (1985 to March 2004), Dissertation Abstracts (1980 to April 2004), and Sociological Abstracts (Sociofile) (1963 to April 2004). Hand searches of relevant journals and bibliographies were also conducted and experts in the field were contacted for further information., Selection criteria, Included studies were randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of behavioural family therapy, cognitive behavioural family therapy, or functional family therapy for children with ADHD or ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder)., Data collection and analysis, Studies were evaluated for methodological quality and to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria., Main results, This assessment yielded two studies. Data were extracted for both studies. The findings from Jensen 1999 (N=579) indicate that no difference can be detected between the efficacy of behavioural family therapy and treatment as usual in the community. The finding from the available data from Horn 1991 slightly favours treatment over medication placebo., Authors' conclusions, Further research examining the effectiveness of family therapy versus a no-treatment control condition is needed to determine whether family therapy is an effective intervention for children with ADHD. There were no results available from studies investigating forms of family therapy other than behavioural family therapy.","Gretchen J. Bjornstad, Paul Montgomery (2009).

418,"Background, Sleep positioning systems can be prescribed for children with cerebral palsy to help reduce or prevent hip migration, provide comfort to ease pain and/or improve sleep. As sleep disturbance is common in children with developmental disabilities, with impact on their carers' sleep, and as sleep positioning systems can be expensive, guidance is needed to support decisions as to their use., Objectives, To determine whether commercially-available sleep positioning systems, compared with usual care, reduce or prevent hip migration in children with cerebral palsy. Any negative effect of sleep positioning systems on hip migration will be considered within this objective., Search methods, In December 2014, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and 13 other databases. We also searched two trials registers. We applied no restrictions on date of publication, language, publication status or study design. We checked references and contacted manufacturers and authors for potentially relevant literature, and searched the internet using Google., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating whole body sleep positioning systems for children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) with cerebral palsy., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened reports retrieved from the search against pre-determined inclusion criteria and assessed the quality of eligible studies., Main results, We did not identify any randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of sleep positioning systems on hip migration., Authors' conclusions, We found no randomised trials that evaluated the effectiveness of sleep positioning systems to reduce or prevent hip migration in children with cerebral palsy. Nor did we find any randomised trials that evaluated the effect of sleep positioning systems on the number or frequency of hip problems, quality of life of the child and family or on physical functioning.","Sharon F.

420,"Background, The beneficial effects of regular exercise for people living with or beyond cancer are becoming apparent. However, how to promote exercise behaviour in sedentary cancer cohorts is not as well understood. A large majority of people living with or recovering from cancer do not meet exercise recommendations. Hence, reviewing the evidence on how to promote and sustain exercise behaviour is important., Objectives, To assess the effects of interventions to promote exercise behaviour in sedentary people living with and beyond cancer and to address the following questions: Which interventions are most effective in improving aerobic fitness and skeletal muscle strength and endurance? What adverse effects are attributed to different exercise interventions? Which interventions are most effective in improving exercise behaviour amongst patients with different cancers? Which interventions are most likely to promote long-term (12 months or longer) exercise behaviour? What frequency of contact with exercise professionals is associated with increased exercise behaviour? What theoretical basis is most often associated with increased exercise behaviour? What behaviour change techniques are most often associated with increased exercise behaviour?, Search methods, We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 8, 2012), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, PsycLIT/PsycINFO, SportDiscus and PEDro from inception to August 2012. We also searched the grey literature, wrote to leading experts in the field, wrote to charities and searched reference lists of other recent systematic reviews., Selection criteria, We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an exercise intervention with a usual care approach in sedentary people over the age of 18 with a homogenous primary cancer diagnosis., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors working independently (LB and KH) screened all titles and abstracts to identify studies that might meet the inclusion criteria, or that cannot be safely excluded without assessment of the full text (e.g. when no abstract is available). All eligible papers were formally abstracted by at least two members of the review author team working independently (LB and KH) and using the data collection form. When possible, and if appropriate, we performed a fixed-effect meta-analysis of study outcomes. For continuous outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness), we extracted the final value, the standard deviation of the outcome of interest and the number of participants assessed at follow-up in each treatment arm, to estimate standardised mean difference (SMD) between treatment arms. SMD was used, as investigators used heterogeneous methods to assess individual outcomes. If a meta-analysis was not possible or was not appropriate, we synthesised studies as a narrative., Main results, Fourteen trials were included in this review, involving a total of 648 participants. Only studies involving breast, prostate or colorectal cancer were identified as eligible. Just six trials incorporated a target level of exercise that could meet current recommendations. Only three trials were identified that attempted to objectively validate independent exercise behaviour with accelerometers or heart rate monitoring. Adherence to exercise interventions, which is crucial for understanding treatment dose, is often poorly reported. It is important to note that the fundamental metrics of exercise behaviour (i.e. frequency, intensity and duration, repetitions, sets and intensity of resistance training), although easy to devise and report, are seldom included in published clinical trials., Authors' conclusions, Interventions to promote exercise in cancer survivors who report better levels of adherence share some common behaviour change techniques. These involve setting programme goals, prompting practise and self-monitoring and encouraging participants to attempt to generalise behaviours learned in supervised exercise environments to ot","Liam Bourke, Kate E.

421,"Background, Unilateral spatial neglect causes difficulty attending to one side of space. Various rehabilitation interventions have been used but evidence of their benefit is lacking., Objectives, To assess whether cognitive rehabilitation improves functional independence, neglect (as measured using standardised assessments), destination on discharge, falls, balance, depression/anxiety and quality of life in stroke patients with neglect measured immediately post-intervention and at longer-term follow-up; and to determine which types of interventions are effective and whether cognitive rehabilitation is more effective than standard care or an attention control., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched June 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2011), EMBASE (1980 to June 2011), CINAHL (1983 to June 2011), PsycINFO (1974 to June 2011), UK National Research Register (June 2011). We handsearched relevant journals (up to 1998), screened reference lists, and tracked citations using SCISEARCH., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cognitive rehabilitation specifically aimed at spatial neglect. We excluded studies of general stroke rehabilitation and studies with mixed participant groups, unless more than 75% of their sample were stroke patients or separate stroke data were available., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality. For subgroup analyses, review authors independently categorised the approach underlying the cognitive intervention as either 'top-down' (interventions that encourage awareness of the disability and potential compensatory strategies) or 'bottom-up' (interventions directed at the impairment but not requiring awareness or behavioural change, e.g. wearing prisms or patches)., Main results, We included 23 RCTs with 628 participants (adding 11 new RCTs involving 322 new participants for this update). Only 11 studies were assessed to have adequate allocation concealment, and only four studies to have a low risk of bias in all categories assessed. Most studies measured outcomes using standardised neglect assessments: 15 studies measured effect on activities of daily living (ADL) immediately after the end of the intervention period, but only six reported persisting effects on ADL. One study (30 participants) reported discharge destination and one study (eight participants) reported the number of falls., Authors' conclusions, The effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation interventions for reducing the disabling effects of neglect and increasing independence remains unproven. As a consequence, no rehabilitation approach can be supported or refuted based on current evidence from RCTs. However, there is some very limited evidence that cognitive rehabilitation may have an immediate beneficial effect on tests of neglect. This emerging evidence justifies further clinical trials of cognitive rehabilitation for neglect. However, future studies need to have appropriate high quality methodological design and reporting, to examine persisting effects of treatment and to include an attention control comparator.","Audrey Bowen, Christine Hazelton, Alex Pollock, Nadina B.

422,"Background, Stroke and other adult-acquired brain injury may impair perception leading to distress and increased dependence on others. Perceptual rehabilitation includes functional training, sensory stimulation, strategy training and task repetition., Objectives, To examine the evidence for improvement in activities of daily living (ADL) six months post randomisation for active intervention versus placebo or no treatment., Search methods, We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group and the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (May 2009) but not the Injuries Group, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2009), EMBASE (1980 to August 2009), CINAHL (1982 to August 2009), PsycINFO (1974 to August 2009), REHABDATA and PsycBITE (May to June 2009). We also searched trials and research registers, handsearched journals, searched reference lists and contacted authors., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of adult stroke or acquired brain injury. Our definition of perception excluded visual field deficits, neglect/inattention and apraxia., Data collection and analysis, One review author assessed titles, abstracts and keywords for eligibility. At least two review authors independently extracted data. We requested unclear or missing information from corresponding authors., Main results, We included six single-site trials in rehabilitation settings, involving 338 participants. Four trials included people with only stroke. All studies provided sensory stimulation, sometimes with another intervention. Sensory stimulation typically involved practising tasks that required visuo-perceptual processing with occupational therapist assistance. Repetition was never used and only one study included functional training. No trials provided data on longer term improvement in ADL scores. Only three trials provided any data suitable for analysis. Two of these trials compared active to placebo intervention. There was no evidence of a difference in ADL scores at the scheduled end of intervention: mean difference (95% confidence interval (CI)) was 0.9 (-1.6 to 3.5) points on a self-care ADL scale in one study and odds ratio (95% CI) was 1.3 (0.56 to 3.1) for passing a driving test in the other, both in favour of active intervention. The trial that compared two active interventions did not find evidence of difference in any of the review outcomes., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the view that perceptual interventions are effective. Future studies should be sufficiently large, include a standard care comparison and measure longer term functional outcomes. People with impaired perception problems should continue to receive neurorehabilitation according to clinical guidelines.","Audrey Bowen, Peter Knapp, David Gillespie, Donald J.

423,"Background, Researchers have criticised epilepsy care for adults for its lack of impact, stimulating the development of various service models and strategies to respond to perceived inadequacies., Objectives, To assess the effects of any specialised or dedicated intervention beyond that of usual care in adults with epilepsy., Search methods, For the latest update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (9 December 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to June 2013), EMBASE (1988 to June 2013), PsycINFO (1887 to December 2013) and CINAHL (1937 to December 2013). In addition, we contacted experts in the field to seek information on unpublished and ongoing studies, checked the websites of epilepsy organisations and checked the reference lists of included studies., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials, controlled or matched trials, cohort studies or other prospective studies with a control group, and time series studies., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted all data, and assessed the quality of all included studies., Main results, Our review included 18 different studies of 16 separate interventions, which we classified into seven distinct groups. Most of the studies have methodological weaknesses, and many results from other analyses within studies need to be interpreted with caution because of study limitations. Consequently, there is currently limited evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to improve the health and quality of life in people with epilepsy. It was not possible to combine study results in a meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity of outcomes, study populations, interventions and time scales across the studies., Authors' conclusions, Two intervention types, the specialist epilepsy nurse and self management education, have some evidence of benefit. However, we did not find clear evidence that other service models substantially improve outcomes for adults with epilepsy. It is also possible that benefits are situation specific and may not apply to other settings. These studies included only a small number of service providers whose individual competence or expertise may have had a significant impact on outcomes. At present it is not possible to advocate any single model of service provision.","Peter M. Bradley, Bruce Lindsay, Nigel Fleeman (2016).

424,"Background, Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice that originated in India and is currently accepted in the Western world as a form of relaxation and exercise. It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia to determine its efficacy as an adjunct to standard-care treatment., Objectives, To examine the effects of yoga versus standard care for people with schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2012 and January 29, 2015), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There were no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia comparing yoga to standard-care control., Data collection and analysis, The review team independently selected studies, quality rated these, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed mixed-effect and fixed-effect models for analyses. We examined data for heterogeneity (I(superscript 2) technique), assessed risk of bias for included studies, and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)., Main results, We included eight studies in the review. All outcomes were short term (less than six months). There were clear differences in a number of outcomes in favour of the yoga group, although these were based on one study each, with the exception of leaving the study early. These included mental state (improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 1 RCT, n = 83, RR 0.70 CI 0.55 to 0.88, medium-quality evidence), social functioning (improvement in Social Occupational Functioning Scale, 1 RCT, n = 83, RR 0.88 CI 0.77 to 1, medium-quality evidence), quality of life (average change 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) quality-of-life subscale, 1 RCT, n = 60, MD 15.50, 95% CI 4.27 to 26.73, low-quality evidence), and leaving the study early (8 RCTs, n = 457, RR 0.91 CI 0.6 to 1.37, medium-quality evidence). For the outcome of physical health, there was not a clear difference between groups (average change SF-36 physical-health subscale, 1 RCT, n = 60, MD 6.60, 95% CI -2.44 to 15.64, low-quality evidence). Only one study reported adverse effects, finding no incidence of adverse events in either treatment group. This review was subject to a considerable number of missing outcomes, which included global state, change in cognition, costs of care, effect on standard care, service intervention, disability, and activities of daily living., Authors' conclusions, Even though we found some positive evidence in favour of yoga over standard-care control, this should be interpreted cautiously in view of outcomes largely based each on one study with limited sample sizes and short-term follow-up. Overall, many outcomes were not reported and evidence presented in this review is of low to moderate quality - -too weak to indicate that yoga is superior to standard-care control for the management of schizophrenia.","Julie Broderick, Abigail Knowles, Jonathan Chadwick, Davy Vancampfort (2015).

425,"Background, Accumulating evidence suggests an association between prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and increased risk of both physical anomalies and neurodevelopmental impairment. Neurodevelopmental impairment is characterised by either a specific deficit or a constellation of deficits across cognitive, motor and social skills and can be transient or continuous into adulthood. It is of paramount importance that these potential risks are identified, minimised and communicated clearly to women with epilepsy., Objectives, To assess the effects of prenatal exposure to commonly prescribed AEDs on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the child and to assess the methodological quality of the evidence., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (May 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (via Ovid) (1946 to May 2014), EMBASE (May 2014), Pharmline (May 2014) and Reprotox (May 2014). No language restrictions were imposed. Conference abstracts from the last five years were reviewed along with reference lists from the included studies., Selection criteria, Prospective cohort controlled studies, cohort studies set within pregnancy registers and randomised controlled trials were selected for inclusion. Participants were women with epilepsy taking AED treatment; the two control groups were women without epilepsy and women with epilepsy who were not taking AEDs during pregnancy., Data collection and analysis, Three authors (RB, JW and JG) independently selected studies for inclusion. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were completed by five authors (RB, JW, AS, NA, AJM). The primary outcome was global cognitive functioning. Secondary outcomes included deficits in specific cognitive domains or prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Due to substantial variation in study design and outcome reporting only limited data synthesis was possible., Main results, Twenty-two prospective cohort studies were included and six registry based studies. Study quality varied. More recent studies tended to be larger and to report individual AED outcomes from blinded assessments, which indicate improved methodological quality.The developmental quotient (DQ) was lower in children exposed to carbamazepine (CBZ) (n = 50) than in children born to women without epilepsy (n = 79); mean difference (MD) of -5.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.83 to -0.34, P = 0.04). The DQ of children exposed to CBZ (n = 163) was also lower compared to children of women with untreated epilepsy (n = 58) (MD -7.22, 95% CI -12.76 to - 1.67, P = 0.01). Further analysis using a random-effects model indicated that these results were due to variability within the studies and that there was no significant association with CBZ. The intelligence quotient (IQ) of older children exposed to CBZ (n = 150) was not lower than that of children born to women without epilepsy (n = 552) (MD -0.03, 95% CI -3.08 to 3.01, P = 0.98). Similarly, children exposed to CBZ (n = 163) were not poorer in terms of IQ in comparison to the children of women with untreated epilepsy (n = 87) (MD 1.84, 95% CI -2.13 to 5.80, P = 0.36). The DQ in children exposed to sodium valproate (VPA) (n = 123) was lower than the DQ in children of women with untreated epilepsy (n = 58) (MD -8.72, 95% -14.31 to -3.14, P = 0.002). The IQ of children exposed to VPA (n = 76) was lower than for children born to women without epilepsy (n = 552) (MD -8.94, 95% CI -11.96 to -5.92, P < 0.00001). Children exposed to VPA (n = 89) also had lower IQ than children born to women with untreated epilepsy (n = 87) (MD -8.17, 95% CI -12.80 to -3.55, P = 0.0005)., Authors' conclusions, The most important finding is the reduction in IQ in the VPA exposed group, which are sufficient to affect education and occupational outcomes in later life. However, for some women VPA is the most effective drug at controlling seizures.

426,"Background, Loss to follow-up from randomised trials can introduce bias and reduce study power, affecting the generalisability, validity and reliability of results. Many strategies are used to reduce loss to follow-up and improve retention but few have been formally evaluated., Objectives, To quantify the effect of strategies to improve retention on the proportion of participants retained in randomised trials and to investigate if the effect varied by trial strategy and trial setting., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, DARE, CINAHL, Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register, and ERIC. We handsearched conference proceedings and publication reference lists for eligible retention trials. We also surveyed all UK Clinical Trials Units to identify further studies., Selection criteria, We included eligible retention trials of randomised or quasi-randomised evaluations of strategies to increase retention that were embedded in 'host' randomised trials from all disease areas and healthcare settings. We excluded studies aiming to increase treatment compliance., Data collection and analysis, We contacted authors to supplement or confirm data that we had extracted. For retention trials, we recorded data on the method of randomisation, type of strategy evaluated, comparator, primary outcome, planned sample size, numbers randomised and numbers retained. We used risk ratios (RR) to evaluate the effectiveness of the addition of strategies to improve retention. We assessed heterogeneity between trials using the Chi(superscript 2) and I(superscript 2) statistics. For main trials that hosted retention trials, we extracted data on disease area, intervention, population, healthcare setting, sequence generation and allocation concealment., Main results, We identified 38 eligible retention trials. Included trials evaluated six broad types of strategies to improve retention. These were incentives, communication strategies, new questionnaire format, participant case management, behavioural and methodological interventions. For 34 of the included trials, retention was response to postal and electronic questionnaires with or without medical test kits. For four trials, retention was the number of participants remaining in the trial. Included trials were conducted across a spectrum of disease areas, countries, healthcare and community settings. Strategies that improved trial retention were addition of monetary incentives compared with no incentive for return of trial-related postal questionnaires (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28, P value < 0.0001), addition of an offer of monetary incentive compared with no offer for return of electronic questionnaires (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.38, P value < 0.00001) and an offer of a GBP20 voucher compared with GBP10 for return of postal questionnaires and biomedical test kits (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22, P value < 0.005). The evidence that shorter questionnaires are better than longer questionnaires was unclear (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08, P value = 0.07) and the evidence for questionnaires relevant to the disease/condition was also unclear (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14). Although each was based on the results of a single trial, recorded delivery of questionnaires seemed to be more effective than telephone reminders (RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.87, P value = 0.02) and a 'package' of postal communication strategies with reminder letters appeared to be better than standard procedures (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.67, P value < 0.0001). An open trial design also appeared more effective than a blind trial design for return of questionnaires in one fracture prevention trial (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63, P value = 0.0003)., Authors' conclusions, Most of the retention trials that we identified evaluated questionnaire response. There were few evaluations of ways to improve participants returning to trial sites for trial follow-up. Monetary incentives and offers of monetary","Valerie C.

427,"Background, Oral zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride (Clopixol) is an anti-psychotic treatment for people with psychotic symptoms, especially those with schizophrenia. It is associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a prolongation of the QTc interval, extra-pyramidal reactions, venous thromboembolism and may modify insulin and glucose responses., Objectives, To determine the effects of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride for treatment of schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (latest search 09 June 2015). There were no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride for schizophrenia. We included trials meeting our inclusion criteria and reporting useable data., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE., Main results, We included 20 trials, randomising 1850 participants. Data were reported for 12 comparisons, predominantly for the short term (up to 12 weeks) and inpatient populations. Overall risk of bias for included studies was low to unclear., Authors' conclusions, Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride appears to cause more EPSEs than clozapine, risperidone or perphenazine, but there was no difference in EPSEs when compared to placebo or chlorpromazine. Similar numbers required hypnotics/sedatives when zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride was compared to sulpiride, and similar numbers of reported side-effects were found when its isomers were compared. The other comparisons did not report adverse-effect data.","Edward J. Bryan, Ann Marie Purcell, Ajit Kumar (2017).

428,"Background, Supportive therapy is often used in everyday clinical care and in evaluative studies of other treatments., Objectives, To review the effects of supportive therapy compared with standard care, or other treatments in addition to standard care for people with schizophrenia., Search methods, For this update, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials (November 2012)., Selection criteria, All randomised trials involving people with schizophrenia and comparing supportive therapy with any other treatment or standard care., Data collection and analysis, We reliably selected studies, quality rated these and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we estimated the risk ratio (RR) using a fixed-effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where possible, we undertook intention-to-treat analyses. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) fixed-effect with 95% CIs. We estimated heterogeneity (I(superscript 2) technique) and publication bias. We used GRADE to rate quality of evidence., Main results, Four new trials were added after the 2012 search. The review now includes 24 relevant studies, with 2126 participants. Overall, the evidence was very low quality., Authors' conclusions, There are insufficient data to identify a difference in outcome between supportive therapy and standard care. There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy but these findings are based on a few small studies where we graded the evidence as very low quality. Future research would benefit from larger trials that use supportive therapy as the main treatment arm rather than the comparator.","Lucy A. Buckley, Nicola Maayan, Karla Soares-Weiser, Clive E.

430,"Background, Smoking is the leading preventable cause of illness and premature death worldwide. Some medications have been proven to help people to quit, with three licensed for this purpose in Europe and the USA: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Cytisine (a treatment pharmacologically similar to varenicline) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former socialist economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, have also been tested for effectiveness., Objectives, How do NRT, bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo and with each other in achieving long-term abstinence (six months or longer)?, How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in achieving long-term abstinence?, How do the risks of adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) compare between the treatments, and are there instances where the harms may outweigh the benefits?, Methods, The overview is restricted to Cochrane reviews, all of which include randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smokers, but we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in particular disease groups or specific settings. We cover nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline), nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine), anxiolytics, selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant), clonidine, lobeline, dianicline, mecamylamine, Nicobrevin, opioid antagonists, nicotine vaccines, and silver acetate. Our outcome for benefit is continuous or prolonged abstinence at least six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is the incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the treatments., We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in The Cochrane Libraryfor any reviews with 'smoking' in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was conducted in November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a revised version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT, bupropion and varenicline we conducted network meta-analyses, comparing each with the others and with placebo for benefit, and varenicline and bupropion for risks of serious adverse events., Main results, We identified 12 treatment-specific reviews. The analyses covered 267 studies, involving 101,804 participants. Both NRT and bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95% credible interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 respectively). Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with placebo (OR 2.88; 95% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Head-to-head comparisons between bupropion and NRT showed equal efficacy (OR 0.99; 95% CredI 0.86 to 1.13). Varenicline was superior to single forms of NRT (OR 1.57; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.91), and to bupropion (OR 1.59; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.96)., Varenicline was more effective than nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95% CredI 1.22 to 1.87), than nicotine gum (OR 1.72; 95% CredI 1.38 to 2.13), and than 'other' NRT (inhaler, spray, tablets, lozenges; OR 1.42; 95% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination NRT (OR 1.06; 95% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). Combination NRT also outperformed single formulations. The four categories of NRT performed similarly against each other, apart from 'other' NRT, which was marginally more effective than NRT gum (OR 1.21; 95% CredI 1.01 to 1.46)., Cytisine (a nicotine receptor partial agonist) returned positive findings (risk ratio (RR) 3.98; 95% CI 2.01 to 7.87), without significant adverse events or SAEs., Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1:1000), at about 1:1500. SAE meta-analysis of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.59).

This is an update of a review first published in 2010., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce falls by older people in care facilities and hospitals., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2012); The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 3; MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (all to March 2012); ongoing trial registers (to August 2012), and reference lists of articles., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of interventions to reduce falls in older people in residential or nursing care facilities or hospitals., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used a rate ratio (RaR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare the rate of falls (e.g. falls per person year) between intervention and control groups. For risk of falling we used a risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI based on the number of people falling (fallers) in each group. We pooled results where appropriate., Main results, We included 60 trials (60,345 participants), 43 trials (30,373 participants) in care facilities, and 17 (29,972 participants) in hospitals., Authors' conclusions, In care facilities, vitamin D supplementation is effective in reducing the rate of falls. Exercise in subacute hospital settings appears effective but its effectiveness in care facilities remains uncertain due to conflicting results, possibly associated with differences in interventions and levels of dependency. There is evidence that multifactorial interventions reduce falls in hospitals but the evidence for risk of falling was inconclusive. Evidence for multifactorial interventions in care facilities suggests possible benefits, but this was inconclusive.","Ian D. Cameron, Lesley D. Gillespie, Clare M. Robertson, Geoff R.

433,"Background, Patients in the terminal phase of a disease may have complex needs. It is often family and friends who play a central role in providing support, despite health professional input and regardless of whether the patient is at home or elsewhere. Such informal caring may involve considerable physical, psychological, and economic stresses. A range of supportive programmes for caregivers is being developed including psychological support and practical assistance., Objectives, To assess the effects of supportive interventions that aim to improve the psychological and physical health of informal caregivers of patients in the terminal phase of their illness., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2010); MEDLINE (1950 to May 2010); EMBASE (1980 to May 2010); PsycINFO (1872 to May 2010); CINAHL (1937 to May 2010); National Health Service Research Register (2000 to November 2008) and Dissertation Abstracts (1716 to May 2010). We searched the reference lists of relevant studies; contacted experts; and handsearched journals., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions to support adults who were caring for a friend or relative with a disease in the terminal phase. Interventions could include practical and emotional support and/or the facilitation of coping skills. Interventions could support caregivers indirectly via patient care., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently screened citations against the selection criteria. Data were extracted by one author and checked by another. This included extraction of any adverse effects. Risk of bias assessment was undertaken by two authors. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing information. Trial data were combined, where appropriate, on the review's primary outcomes., Main results, We included eleven RCTs involving 1836 caregiver participants. Nine interventions were delivered directly to the caregiver. Seven of these provided support in the caring role, another involved a family life review, and one grief therapy. None provided practical support. The other two interventions aimed to support caregivers indirectly via patient care. Overall the risk of bias is unclear, as all trials under-reported methods., Authors' conclusions, There is evidence that supportive interventions may help reduce caregivers' psychological distress. These findings suggest that practitioners should enquire about the concerns of caregivers and should consider that they may benefit from additional support. There is, however, a need for further research to explore the benefits identified, and to assess the interventions' effects on physical health, and potential harms. Trials need to report their methods fully.","Bridget Candy, Louise Jones, Robyn Drake, Baptiste Leurent, Michael King (2011).

434,"Background, Acne is a chronic skin disease characterised by inflamed spots and blackheads on the face, neck, back, and chest. Cysts and scarring can also occur, especially in more severe disease. People with acne often turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, and dietary modifications, because of their concerns about the adverse effects of conventional medicines. However, evidence for CAM therapies has not been systematically assessed., Objectives, To assess the effects and safety of any complementary therapies in people with acne vulgaris., Search methods, We searched the following databases from inception up to 22 January 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014,Issue 1), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), CINAHL (from 1981), Scopus (from 1966), and a number of other databases listed in the Methods section of the review. The Cochrane CAM Field Specialised Register was searched up to May 2014. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of articles for further references to relevant trials., Selection criteria, We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (or the first phase data of randomised cross-over trials) of any kind of CAM, compared with no treatment, placebo, or other active therapies, in people with a diagnosis of acne vulgaris., Data collection and analysis, Three authors collected data from each included trial and evaluated the methodological quality independently. They resolved disagreements by discussion and, as needed, arbitration by another author., Main results, We included 35 studies, with a total of 3227 participants. We evaluated the majority as having unclear risk of selection, attrition, reporting, detection, and other biases. Because of the clinical heterogeneity between trials and the incomplete data reporting, we could only include four trials in two meta-analyses, with two trials in each meta-analysis. The categories of CAM included herbal medicine, acupuncture, cupping therapy, diet, purified bee venom (PBV), and tea tree oil. A pharmaceutical company funded one trial; the other trials did not report their funding sources., Authors' conclusions, There is some low-quality evidence from single trials that LGLD, tea tree oil, and bee venom may reduce total skin lesions in acne vulgaris, but there is a lack of evidence from the current review to support the use of other CAMs, such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, or wet-cupping therapy, for the treatment of this condition. There is a potential for adverse effects from herbal medicines; however, future studies need to assess the safety of all of these CAM therapies. Methodological and reporting quality limitations in the included studies weakened any evidence. Future studies should be designed to ensure low risk of bias and meet current reporting standards for clinical trials.","Huijuan Cao, Guoyan Yang, Yuyi Wang, Ping Jian Liu, Caroline A.

We also searched reference lists, relevant websites and conducted hand searching., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies (more than three time points to be measured before and after the study) and interrupted time-series (ITS) studies that evaluated alcohol or drug screening interventions for occupational drivers (compared to another intervention or no intervention) with an outcome measured as a reduction in injury or a proxy measure thereof., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We contacted authors of the included studies for further information., Main results, We included two interrupted time-series studies conducted in the USA. One study was conducted in five large US transportation companies (N = 115,019) that carried passengers and/or cargo. Monthly injury rates were available from 1983 to 1999. In the study company, two interventions of interest were evaluated: mandatory random drug testing and mandatory random and for-cause alcohol testing programmes. The third study focused only on mandatory random drug testing and was conducted on federal injury data that covered all truck drivers of interstate carriers., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of drug and alcohol testing of occupational drivers for preventing injuries as a sole, effective, long-term solution in the context of workplace culture, peer interaction and other local factors. Cluster-randomised trials are needed to better address the effects of interventions for injury prevention in this occupational setting.","Clodagh M. Cashman, Jani H. Ruotsalainen, Birgit A.

439,"Background, Some authors have suggested that loxapine is more effective than typical antipsychotics in reducing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, that extrapyramidal adverse effects are not usually seen at clinically effective antipsychotic doses and that it should therefore be classed as atypical., Objectives, To determine the effects of loxapine compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and related psychoses., Search methods, For this 2007 update, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 2007)., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled clinical trials relevant to the care of schizophrenia that compared loxapine to other treatments., Data collection and analysis, We independently inspected abstracts ordered papers, re-inspected and quality assessed these. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a fixed effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed effects model., Main results, We were able to include 41 studies in this review. Compared with placebo, loxapine has an antipsychotic effect (Global effect - not improved at six weeks: n=78, 2 RCTs, RR 0.30 CI 0.1 to 0.6 NNT 3 CI 3 to 5). It is as effective as typical drugs in the short term (4 -12 weeks) (Global effect: n=580, 13 RCTs, RR 0.86 CI 0.7 to 1.1; mental state: n=915, 6 RCTs, RR 0.89 CI 0.8 to 1.1). Very limited heterogeneous data suggest that, given intramuscularly (IM), loxapine may be at least as sedating as IM haloperidol and thiothixene. Loxapine is also as effective as atypicals (risperidone, quetiapine) (n=468, 6 RCTs, RR mental state not improved 1.07 CI 0.8 to 1.5). Adverse effect profile is similar to typicals but loxapine may cause more extrapyramidal adverse effects when compared with atypicals (n=340, 4 RCTs, RR 2.18 CI 1.6 to 3.1)., Authors' conclusions, Loxapine is an antipsychotic which is not clearly distinct from typical or atypical drugs in terms of its effects on global or mental state. Loxapines profile of adverse effects is similar to that of the older generation of antipsychotic drugs.","Abhijit Chakrabarti, AnneMarie Bagnall, Pierre Chue, Mark Fenton, Vikram Palanisamy, Winson Wong, Jun Xia (2015).

440,"Background, Tobacco smoking remains one of the few preventable factors associated with complications in pregnancy, and has serious long-term implications for women and babies. Smoking in pregnancy is decreasing in high-income countries, but is strongly associated with poverty and is increasing in low- to middle-income countries., Objectives, To assess the effects of smoking cessation interventions during pregnancy on smoking behaviour and perinatal health outcomes., Search methods, In this sixth update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (13 November 2015), checked reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted trial authors., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials, cluster-randomised trials, and quasi-randomised controlled trials of psychosocial smoking cessation interventions during pregnancy., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality, and extracted data. Direct comparisons were conducted in RevMan, with meta-regression conducted in STATA 14., Main results, The overall quality of evidence was moderate to high, with reductions in confidence due to imprecision and heterogeneity for some outcomes. One hundred and two trials with 120 intervention arms (studies) were included, with 88 trials (involving over 28,000 women) providing data on smoking abstinence in late pregnancy. Interventions were categorised as counselling, health education, feedback, incentives, social support, exercise and dissemination., Authors' conclusions, Psychosocial interventions to support women to stop smoking in pregnancy can increase the proportion of women who stop smoking in late pregnancy and the proportion of infants born low birthweight. Counselling, feedback and incentives appear to be effective, however the characteristics and context of the interventions should be carefully considered. The effect of health education and social support is less clear. New trials have been published during the preparation of this review and will be included in the next update.","Catherine Chamberlain, Alison O'Mara-Eves, Jessie Porter, Tim Coleman, Susan M.

442,"Background, Bifeprunox is a novel antipsychotic drug designed to treat schizophrenia. However, research into the drug was ceased in 2009 due to rejection of licence to go to market by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who could not approve the drug for acute or long-term symptoms of schizophrenia because more research was required to demonstrate convincing effects 'beyond those already achieved' with currently licenced drugs. There were also concerns expressed over one death of a person whilst on the drug., Objectives, To investigate the clinical and adverse effects of bifeprunox for people with schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register on 23 October 2015, which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and clinical trials registries. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register., Selection criteria, All randomised clinical trials focusing on bifeprunox versus placebo for schizophrenia., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random-effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE., Main results, We included four randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found evidence of missing data and poor reporting. When bifeprunox 20 mg was compared with placebo for schizophrenia, the drug resulted in a reduction of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale score regarding positive symptoms (n = 549, 2 RCTs, MD -1.89, 95% CI -2.85 to -0.92, low-quality evidence) and the PANSS negative subscale regarding negative symptoms (n = 549, 2 RCTs, MD -1.53, 95% CI -2.37 to -0.69, low-quality evidence). There was a clear improvement regarding deterioration in the bifeprunox 20 mg group (n = 231, 1 RCT, RR 0.71 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.93, very low-quality evidence). The total number of participants with equal to or greater than 7% weight increase was similar between bifeprunox and placebo (n = 483, 1 RCT, RR 1.02 95% CI 0.31 to 3.33 moderate-quality evidence). There were no useable data for quality of life, economic outcomes, and service use., Authors' conclusions, Our results showed some positive effects and a favourable adverse effect profile for bifeprunox, although there were few data overall and none were of high quality. It would seem that these data alone would not have been enough for the FDA to decide to halt progress of the drug to market. We can only assume that we are missing important data. Both the FDA and the relevant pharmaceutical companies have not made all relevant data accessible. As some of these trials also involved an additional haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone arm, these data are not only relevant to evaluation of bifeprunox. In not making all data accessible, it is hard to see how the FDA and the drug companies have fulfilled their full obligations to people with schizophrenia or their clinicians.","Arka Chattopadhyay, Stephen Frey, Ghiselle Green (2016).

444,"Background, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic liver diseases. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for health-care workers., Objectives, To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of hepatitis B vaccination in health-care workers., Search strategy, We searched the trial registers of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to February 2003., Selection criteria, Randomised trials comparing any dose, injection route, injection site, or schedule of hepatitis B plasma-derived vaccines (PDV) or recombinant vaccines (RV) versus placebo, no intervention, or another hepatitis B vaccine in health-care workers., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers extracted the data independently. The reviewers assessed the methodological quality of the trials regarding generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, and follow-up. The results were presented as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)., Main results, We identified 21 randomised trials, all with one or more methodological weaknesses. Four trials demonstrated that PDV versus placebo significantly decreased hepatitis B events at maximum follow-up (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.73). RV did not differ significantly from PDV in eliciting a protective hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) level in two trials. Both vaccines were well tolerated. Low-dose vaccine (1 or 2 [micro]g) by the intradermal route resulted in significantly more participants without protective anti-HBs level compared with high-dose (10 or 20 [micro]g) by the intramuscular route (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.76). The intradermal route caused significantly more local adverse events, while the intramuscular route caused significantly more systemic adverse events. The gluteal injection produced significantly more participants without protective anti-HBs level than the deltoid injection. The prevalence of anti-HBs seroconversion by rapid vaccination (0, 1, and 2 months) was significantly lower than that by standard vaccination (0, 1, and 6 months). Booster vaccinations with different RV doses (2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 [micro]g) produced similar prevalence of anti-HBs seroconversion in three trials assessing participants who did not respond to previous HBV vaccination., Authors' conclusions, PDV significantly prevents hepatitis B events. RV seems to be able to elicit similar protective anti-HBs levels. The intramuscular route with 20 [micro]g RV was significantly more effective compared with the intradermal route with 2 [micro]g RV as was the standard schedule compared with a rapid schedule and deltoid intramuscular injection compared with the gluteal intramuscular injection. It is unclear if booster vaccination of non-responders offers higher anti-HBs seroconversion and hepatitis B vaccine prevents the infection of hepatitis B mutants in health-care workers.","Wendong Chen, Christian Gluud (2009).

445,"Background, Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia., Objectives, To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate., Main results, Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure., Authors' conclusions, Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia.

449,"Background, Executive functions are the controlling mechanisms of the brain and include the processes of planning, initiation, organisation, inhibition, problem solving, self monitoring and error correction. They are essential for goal-oriented behaviour and responding to new and novel situations. A high number of people with acquired brain injury, including around 75% of stroke survivors, will experience executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction reduces capacity to regain independence in activities of daily living (ADL), particularly when alternative movement strategies are necessary to compensate for limb weakness. Improving executive function may lead to increased independence with ADL. There are various cognitive rehabilitation strategies for training executive function used within clinical practice and it is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these interventions., Objectives, To determine the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on executive dysfunction for adults with stroke or other non-progressive acquired brain injuries., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane LibraryAugust 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2012), EMBASE (1980 to August 2012), CINAHL (1982 to August 2012), PsycINFO (1806 to August 2012), AMED (1985 to August 2012) and 11 additional databases. We also searched reference lists and trials registers, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts., Selection criteria, We included randomised trials in adults after non-progressive acquired brain injury, where the intervention was specifically targeted at improving cognition including separable executive function data (restorative interventions), where the intervention was aimed at training participants in methods to compensate for lost executive function (compensative interventions) or where the intervention involved the training in the use of an adaptive technique for improving independence with ADL (adaptive interventions). The primary outcome was global executive function and the secondary outcomes were specific components of executive function, working memory, ADL, extended ADL, quality of life and participation in vocational activities. We included studies in which the comparison intervention was no treatment, a placebo intervention (i.e. a rehabilitation intervention that should not impact on executive function), standard care or another cognitive rehabilitation intervention., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook an assessment of methodological quality for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, method of dealing with missing data and other potential sources of bias., Main results, Nineteen studies (907 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review. We included 13 studies (770 participants) in meta-analyses (417 traumatic brain injury, 304 stroke, 49 other acquired brain injury) reducing to 660 participants once non-included intervention groups were removed from three and four group studies. We were unable to obtain data from the remaining six studies. Three studies (134 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation with sensorimotor therapy. None reported our primary outcome; data from one study was available relating to secondary outcomes including concept formation and ADL. Six studies (333 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation with no treatment or placebo. None reported our primary outcome; data from four studies demonstrated no statistically significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation on secondary outcomes. Ten studies (448 participants) compared two different cognitive rehabilitation approaches. Two studies (82 participants) reported the primary outcome; no statistically significant effect was found. Data from eight studies demonstrated no statistically significant effect on the secondary outcomes. We explored the effect of restorative interventions (10 stud","S. Y.

451,"Background, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical practice guideline on the treatment of depressive disorder recommended that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be the first-line option when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Preliminary evidence suggested that sertraline might be slightly superior in terms of effectiveness., Objectives, To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs and newer agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression., Search strategy, MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to July 2008. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to sertraline versus any other antidepressive agent., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved with another member of the team. A double-entry procedure was employed by two reviewers. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side-effects)., Main results, A total of 59 studies, mostly of low quality, were included in the review, involving multiple treatment comparisons between sertraline and other antidepressant agents. Evidence favouring sertraline over some other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression was found, either in terms of efficacy (fluoxetine) or acceptability/tolerability (amitriptyline, imipramine, paroxetine and mirtazapine). However, some differences favouring newer antidepressants in terms of efficacy (mirtazapine) and acceptability (bupropion) were also found. In terms of individual side effects, sertraline was generally associated with a higher rate of participants experiencing diarrhoea., Authors' conclusions, This systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressive agents both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, using 95% confidence intervals and a conservative approach, with a random effects analysis. However, the included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review.

It is important to clarify whether olanzapine could have a role in long-term prevention of manic and depressive relapses., Objectives, To assess the effects of olanzapine, as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment, in preventing manic, depressive and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar affective disorder., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (September 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (September 2006), MEDLINE (1966-December 2007), EMBASE (1980-2006), CINAHL (1982-2006), PsycINFO (1872-2006) and reference lists. We also contacted experts, trialists and pharmaceutical companies in the field., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing olanzapine with placebo or other active treatment in long-term treatment of bipolar disorder., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information., Main results, Five trials (1165 participants) were included in the review. There was no statistically significant difference between olanzapine and placebo (either alone or in combination with lithium or valproate) in terms of number of participants who experienced relapse into mood episode (random effects RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07, p = 0.09; 2 studies, n=460), however restricting the analysis to the trial that compared olanzapine monotherapy versus placebo, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of olanzapine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.69, p<0.00001). No statistically significant difference was found between olanzapine and other mood stabilisers (lithium or valproate) in preventing symptomatic relapse for any mood episode, however, olanzapine was more effective than lithium in preventing symptomatic manic relapse (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.89, p = 0.01; 1 study, n=361). Olanzapine either alone or as adjunctive treatment to mood stabilisers was associated with significantly greater weight gain than placebo. By contrast, olanzapine was associated with a lower rate of manic worsening, but with a higher rate of weight increase and depression than lithium., Authors' conclusions, Though based on a limited amount of information, there is evidence that olanzapine may prevent further mood episodes in patients who have responded to olanzapine during an index manic or mixed episode and who have not previously had a satisfactory response to lithium or valproate. However, notwithstanding these positive results, the current evidence is stronger for lithium as first line maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.","Andrea Cipriani, Jennifer M.

453,"Background, The main rationale for the use of lithium in the long-term treatment of unipolar affective disorder is its efficacy in treating bipolar affective disorder and resistant depression. However, there is considerable uncertainty about which pharmacological intervention is most effective in the long-term treatment of recurrent unipolar affective disorder., Objectives, To assess the effects of lithium versus antidepressants for the long-term treatment of recurrent affective disorder., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) on 2/9/2005. Reference lists of relevant papers and major textbooks of affective disorder were checked. Experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted regarding unpublished material., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing lithium against antidepressant medication for the long-term treatment of patients with a diagnosis of affective disorder., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials., Main results, Eight trials involving 475 people were included. Two of the studies included a mixed group of participants with either bipolar or unipolar disorder. Relapse was defined as admission to hospital and when all kinds of relapses were considered (both depressive and manic), there was a statistically significant difference in favour of lithium (relative risk (RR) fixed effect 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.82). The results did not exclude the point of no effect, when the random-effects model was used (RR random effects 0.40, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.18). There were no other statistically significant differences between lithium and antidepressants according to all other outcomes considered. Manic or depressive relapse was defined as prescription of non-study medication for mood disorder, manic or depressive relapse (as defined by the study authors), quality of life, social functioning, occupational functioning, overall drop-out rate, drop-out rate due to side-effects, troublesome side-effects, mortality due to all causes and specifically suicides., Authors' conclusions, There was adequate efficacy evidence for lithium or antidepressants preventing relapse in unipolar affective disorder, however their relative efficacy was unknown. When considering lithium or antidepressant long-term therapy, patients and clinicians should take into account the patient's clinical history, the side-effects and the individual's likely adherence to the recommended treatment regime.

455,"Background, LAAM and methadone are both opiate agonists and have been shown to reduce dependence on heroin when given continuously under supervised dosing conditions. LAAM has a long duration of action requiring dosing every two/three days compared to methadone which requires daily dosing. LAAM is not as widely available internationally as methadone, and may be withdrawn from the market following ten cases of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and an association with QT prolongation., Objectives, To compare the efficacy and acceptability of LAAM maintenance with methadone maintenance in the treatment of heroin dependence., Search strategy, We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 - August 2000), PsycINFO (1887 - August 2000), EMBASE (January 1985 - August 2000), and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2 2000). We hand searched NIDA monographs until August 2000 and reference lists of articles. The specialised register of trials of the Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol was searched until February 2003., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and controlled prospective studies comparing LAAM and methadone maintenance for the treatment of heroin dependence, outcomes of efficacy or acceptability were included., Data collection and analysis, Data on retention in treatment, heroin use, side-effects and mortality were collected by two reviewers independently. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus., Main results, Eighteen studies, (15 RCTs, 3 Controlled prospective studies) met the inclusion criteria for the review. Three were excluded from the meta-analysis due to lack of data on retention, heroin use or mortality. Cessation of allocated medication (11 studies, 1473 participants) was greater with LAAM than with methadone, (RR 1.36, 95%CI 1.07-1.73, p=0.001, NNT=7.7 (or 8)). Non-abstinence was less with LAAM (5 studies, 983 participants; RR 0.81, 95%CI 0.72-0.91, p=0.0003, NNT=9.1 (or 10)). In 10 studies (1441 participants) there were 6 deaths from a range of causes, 5 in participants assigned to LAAM (RR 2.28 (95%CI 0.59-8.9, p=0.2). other relevant outcomes, such as quality of life and criminal activity could not be analysed because of lack of information in the primary studies., Authors' conclusions, LAAM appears more effective than methadone at reducing heroin use. More LAAM patients than methadone ceased their allocated medication during the studies, but many transferred to methadone and so the significance of this is unclear. There was no difference in safety observed, although there was not enough evidence to comment on uncommon adverse events.","Nicolas C.

This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years); MEDLINE (1950 to date); EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched -trials.com, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. No date or language restrictions were applied to the search., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials in which exercise (defined according to American College of Sports Medicine criteria) was compared to standard treatment, no treatment or a placebo treatment, pharmacological treatment, psychological treatment or other active treatment in adults (aged 18 and over) with depression, as defined by trial authors. We included cluster trials and those that randomised individuals. We excluded trials of postnatal depression., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors extracted data on primary and secondary outcomes at the end of the trial and end of follow-up (if available). We calculated effect sizes for each trial using Hedges' g method and a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the overall pooled effect, using a random-effects model risk ratio for dichotomous data. Where trials used a number of different tools to assess depression, we included the main outcome measure only in the meta-analysis. Where trials provided several 'doses' of exercise, we used data from the biggest 'dose' of exercise, and performed sensitivity analyses using the lower 'dose'. We performed subgroup analyses to explore the influence of method of diagnosis of depression (diagnostic interview or cut-off point on scale), intensity of exercise and the number of sessions of exercise on effect sizes. Two authors performed the 'Risk of bias' assessments. Our sensitivity analyses explored the influence of study quality on outcome., Main results, Thirty-nine trials (2326 participants) fulfilled our inclusion criteria, of which 37 provided data for meta-analyses. There were multiple sources of bias in many of the trials; randomisation was adequately concealed in 14 studies, 15 used intention-to-treat analyses and 12 used blinded outcome assessors., Authors' conclusions, Exercise is moderately more effective than a control intervention for reducing symptoms of depression, but analysis of methodologically robust trials only shows a smaller effect in favour of exercise. When compared to psychological or pharmacological therapies, exercise appears to be no more effective, though this conclusion is based on a few small trials.","Gary M. Cooney, Kerry Dwan, Carolyn A.

457,"Background, In people who have had a stroke, upper limb paresis affects many activities of daily life. Reducing disability is therefore a major aim of rehabilitative interventions. Despite preserving or recovering movement ability after stroke, sometimes people do not fully realise this ability in their everyday activities. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is an approach to stroke rehabilitation that involves the forced use and massed practice of the affected arm by restraining the unaffected arm. This has been proposed as a useful tool for recovering abilities in everyday activities., Objectives, To assess the efficacy of CIMT, modified CIMT (mCIMT), or forced use (FU) for arm management in people with hemiparesis after stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched June 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2015), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2015), EMBASE (1980 to January 2015), CINAHL (1982 to January 2015), and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro; January 2015)., Selection criteria, Randomised control trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing CIMT, mCIMT or FU with other rehabilitative techniques, or none., Data collection and analysis, One author identified trials from the results of the electronic searches according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, three review authors independently assessed methodological quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. The primary outcome was disability., Main results, We included 42 studies involving 1453 participants. The trials included participants who had some residual motor power of the paretic arm, the potential for further motor recovery and with limited pain or spasticity, but tended to use the limb little, if at all. The majority of studies were underpowered (median number of included participants was 29) and we cannot rule out small-trial bias. Eleven trials (344 participants) assessed disability immediately after the intervention, indicating a non-significant standard mean difference (SMD) 0.24 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.05 to 0.52) favouring CIMT compared with conventional treatment. For the most frequently reported outcome, arm motor function (28 studies involving 858 participants), the SMD was 0.34 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.55) showing a significant effect (P value 0.004) in favour of CIMT. Three studies involving 125 participants explored disability after a few months of follow-up and found no significant difference, SMD -0.20 (95% CI -0.57 to 0.16) in favour of conventional treatment., Authors' conclusions, CIMT is a multi-faceted intervention where restriction of the less affected limb is accompanied by increased exercise tailored to the person's capacity. We found that CIMT was associated with limited improvements in motor impairment and motor function, but that these benefits did not convincingly reduce disability. This differs from the result of our previous meta-analysis where there was a suggestion that CIMT might be superior to traditional rehabilitation. Information about the long-term effects of CIMT is scarce. Further trials studying the relationship between participant characteristics and improved outcomes are required.","Davide Corbetta, Valeria Sirtori, Greta Castellini, Lorenzo Moja, Roberto Gatti (2017).

458,"Background, Millions of street-connected children and young people worldwide live or work in street environments. They are vulnerable to many risks, whether or not they remain connected to families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities., Objectives, , Search methods, We searched the following bibliographic databases, searched for the original review, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non-governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and Pre-MEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); PsycINFO; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Libraries; British Library for Development Studies (BLDS); Google and Google Scholar. We updated the search in April 2015 for the review update, using the same methods., Selection criteria, This review includes data from harm reduction or reintegration intervention studies that used a comparison group study design; all were randomised or quasi-randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions provided for street-connected children and young people, from birth to 24 years, in all contexts., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and other factors presented in the Discussion and Summary quality assessment (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)). We extracted data on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes, and grouped outcomes into psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. We conducted meta-analyses for outcomes where the outcome measures were sufficiently similar. We evaluated other outcomes narratively., Main results, We included 13 studies evaluating 19 interventions from high-income countries (HICs). At update stage (from our 2015 search), one previously included study was removed and three new studies added (since our 2012 search). We found no sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Study quality overall was low and measurements used by studies variable. Participants were classified as drop-in and shelter-based. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration and none reported on adverse effects.We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexually risky behaviours Interventions evaluated consisted of time-limited therapeutically based programmes that proved no more effective than standard shelter or drop-in services and other control interventions used for most outcomes in most studies. Favourable changes from baseline were reported for outcomes for most participants following therapy interventions and standard services. We noted considerable heterogeneity between studies and inconsistent reporting of equity data. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects., Authors' conclusions, Analysis revealed no consistently significant benefit for focused therapeutic interventions compared with standard services such as drop-in centres, case management and other comparable interventions for street-connected children and young people. Commonly available services, however, were not rigorously evaluated. Robust evaluation of interventions, including comparison with no intervention, would establish a more reliable evidence base to inform service implementation. More robust research is needed in LMICs to examine interventions for street-connected children","Esther Coren, Rosa Hossain, Jordi Pardo Pardo, Brittany Bakker (2016).

459,"Background, Depressive disorders often begin during childhood or adolescence. There is a growing body of evidence supporting effective treatments during the acute phase of a depressive disorder. However, little is known about treatments for preventing relapse or recurrence of depression once an individual has achieved remission or recovery from their symptoms., Objectives, To determine the efficacy of early interventions, including psychological and pharmacological interventions, to prevent relapse or recurrence of depressive disorders in children and adolescents., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) (to 1 June 2011). The CCDANCTR contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition we handsearched the references of all included studies and review articles., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials using a psychological or pharmacological intervention, with the aim of preventing relapse or recurrence from an episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymic disorder (DD) in children and adolescents were included. Participants were required to have been diagnosed with MDD or DD according to DSM or ICD criteria, using a standardised and validated assessment tool., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed all trials for inclusion in the review, extracted trial and outcome data, and assessed trial quality. Results for dichotomous outcomes are expressed as odds ratio and continuous measures as mean difference or standardised mean difference. We combined results using random-effects meta-analyses, with 95% confidence intervals. We contacted lead authors of included trials and requested additional data where possible., Main results, Nine trials with 882 participants were included in the review. In five trials the outcome assessors were blind to the participants' intervention condition and in the remainder of trials it was unclear. In the majority of trials, participants were either not blind to their intervention condition, or it was unclear whether they were or not. Allocation concealment was also unclear in the majority of trials. Although all trials treated participants in an outpatient setting, the designs implemented in trials was diverse, which limits the generalisability of the results. Three trials indicated participants treated with antidepressant medication had lower relapse-recurrence rates (40.9%) compared to those treated with placebo (66.6%) during a relapse prevention phase (odds ratio (OR) 0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.64, P = 0.02). One trial that compared a combination of psychological therapy and medication to medication alone favoured a combination approach over medication alone, however this result did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.15). The majority of trials that involved antidepressant medication reported adverse events including suicide-related behaviours. However, there were not enough data to show which treatment approach results in the most favourable adverse event profile., Authors' conclusions, Currently, there is little evidence to conclude which type of treatment approach is most effective in preventing relapse or recurrence of depressive episodes in children and adolescents. Limited trials found that antidepressant medication reduces the chance of relapse-recurrence in the future, however, there is considerable diversity in the design of trials, making it difficult to compare outcomes across studies. Some of the research involving psychological therapies is encouraging, however at present more trials with larger sample sizes need to be conducted in order to explore this treatment approach further.","Georgina R.

The trials had differing interventions, including 'usual care' comparators, providers, settings and outcome assessment. Although most trials appeared well conducted, poor reporting hindered assessment of their risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, Some outcomes may be amenable to psychosocial treatments; however, there is insufficient evidence to recommend practice changes. Further research on interventions described in this review is required, including attention to timing, duration, setting and administering discipline(s), as well as treatment across care settings.

462,"Background, Unemployment rates are high amongst people with severe mental illness, yet surveys show that most want to work. Vocational rehabilitation services exist to help mentally ill people find work. Traditionally, these services have offered a period of preparation (Pre-vocational Training), before trying to place clients in competitive (i.e. open) employment. More recently, some services have begun placing clients in competitive employment immediately whilst providing on-the-job support (Supported Employment). It is unclear which approach is most effective., Objectives, To assess the effects of Pre-vocational Training and Supported Employment (for people with severe mental illness) against each other and against standard care (in hospital or community). In addition, to assess the effects of: (a) special varieties of Pre-vocational Training (Clubhouse model) and Supported Employment (Individual Placement and Support model); and (b) techniques for enhancing either approach, for example payment or psychological intervention., Search strategy, Searches were undertaken of CINAHL (1982-1998), The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 1999), EMBASE (1980-1998), MEDLINE (1966-1998) and PsycLIT (1887-1998). Reference lists of eligible studies and reviews were inspected and researchers in the field were approached to identify unpublished studies., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of approaches to vocational rehabilitation for people with severe mental illness., Data collection and analysis, Included trials were reliably selected by a team of two raters. Data were extracted separately by two reviewers and cross-checked. Authors of trials were contacted for additional information. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data were calculated. A random effects model was used for heterogeneous dichotomous data. Continuous data were presented in tables (there were insufficient continuous data for formal meta-analysis). A sensitivity analysis was performed, excluding poorer quality trials., Main results, Eighteen randomised controlled trials of reasonable quality were identified. The main finding was that on the primary outcome (number in competitive employment) Supported Employment was significantly more effective than Pre-vocational Training; for example, at 18 months 34% of people in Supported Employment were employed versus 12% in Pre-vocational Training (RR random effects (unemployment) 0.76 95% CI 0.64 to 0.89, NNT 4.5). Clients in Supported Employment also earned more and worked more hours per month than those in Pre-vocational Training. There was no evidence that Pre-vocational Training was more effective in helping clients to obtain competitive employment than standard community care., Authors' conclusions, Supported employment is more effective than Pre-vocational Training in helping severely mentally ill people to obtain competitive employment. There is no clear evidence that Pre-vocational Training is effective.","Ruth Crowther, Max Marshall, Gary R. Bond, Peter Huxley (2010).

The collection of reliable data is essential for public health officials to plan intervention programmes to prevent occupational diseases. Little is known about the effects of interventions for increasing the reporting of occupational diseases., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of interventions aimed at increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Occupational Safety and Health Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, OSH UPDATE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), OpenSIGLE, and Health Evidence until January 2015., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs (cRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) of the effects of increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians. The primary outcome was the reporting of occupational diseases measured as the number of physicians reporting or as the rate of reporting occupational diseases., Data collection and analysis, Pairs of authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data.

We assessed the overall quality of evidence for each combination of intervention and outcome using the GRADE approach., Main results, We included seven RCTs and five CBA studies. Six studies evaluated the effectiveness of educational materials alone, one study evaluated educational meetings, four studies evaluated a combination of the two, and one study evaluated a multifaceted educational campaign for increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians. We judged all the included studies to have a high risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, We found 12 studies to include in this review. They provide evidence ranging from very low to moderate quality showing that educational materials, educational meetings, or a combination of the two do not considerably increase the reporting of occupational diseases.

464,"Background, Non-malignant dust-related respiratory diseases, such as asbestosis and silicosis, are similar to other chronic respiratory diseases and may be characterised by breathlessness, reduced exercise capacity and reduced health-related quality of life. Some non-malignant dust-related respiratory diseases are a global health issue and very few treatment options, including pharmacological, are available. Therefore, examining the role of exercise training is particularly important to determine whether exercise training is an effective treatment option in non-malignant dust-related respiratory diseases., Objectives, To assess the effects of exercise training for people with non-malignant dust-related respiratory diseases compared with control, placebo or another non-exercise intervention on exercise capacity, health-related quality of life and levels of physical activity., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro and AMED (all searched from inception until February 2015), national and international clinical trial registries, reference lists of relevant papers and we contacted experts in the field for identification of suitable studies., Selection criteria, We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared exercise training of at least four weeks duration with no exercise training, placebo or another non-exercise intervention., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We employed the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome and to interpret findings. We synthesized study results using a random-effects model based on the assessment of heterogeneity. We conducted subgroup analyses on participants with dust-related interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) and participants with asbestos related pleural disease (ARPD)., Main results, Two RCTs including a combined total of 40 participants (35 from one study and five from a second study) met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one participants were randomised to the exercise training group and 19 participants were randomised to the control group. The included studies evaluated the effects of exercise training compared to a control group of no exercise training in people with dust-related ILDs and ARPD. The exercise training programme in both studies was in an outpatient setting for an eight-week period. The risk of bias was low in both studies. There were no reported adverse events of exercise training. Following exercise training, six-minute walk distance (6MWD) increased with a mean difference (MD) of 53.81 metres (m) (95% CI 34.36 to 73.26 m). Improvements were also seen in the domains of health-related quality of life: Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnoea domain (MD 2.58, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.44); CRQ Fatigue domain (MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.89); CRQ Emotional Function domain (MD 2.61, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.49); and CRQ Mastery domain (MD 1.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.72). Improvements in exercise capacity and health-related quality of life were also evident six months following the intervention period: 6MWD (MD 52.68 m, 95% CI 27.43 to 77.93 m); CRQ Dyspnoea domain (MD 3.03, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.66); CRQ Emotional Function domain (MD 5.57, 95% CI 2.34 to 8.81); and CRQ Mastery domain (MD 2.66, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.23). Exercise training did not result in improvements in the Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnoea scale immediately following exercise training or six months following exercise training.

One study compared the effectiveness of a mnemonic strategy treatment group with a 'drill and practice' control, while the other compared the effectiveness of an imagery mnemonics programme with a 'pragmatic' memory rehabilitation control programme. Formal meta-analyses could not be performed due to a paucity of studies and lack of commonly-employed outcome measures. The results do not show any significant effect of memory rehabilitation on performance of objective memory tests, and no significant effects of treatment on subjective and observer-rated measures of memory., Authors' conclusions, There was no evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of memory rehabilitation on functional outcomes, and objective, subjective, and observer-rated memory measures.

471,"Background, A high incidence of functional decline (deterioration in physical or cognitive function) during hospitalisation of older adults is reported. The role of exercise in preventing these deconditioning effects is unclear., Objectives, To determine the effect of exercise interventions for acutely hospitalised older medical patients on functional status, adverse events and hospital outcomes., Search strategy, We searched MEDLINE (1966-Feb 2006), CINAHL (1982-Feb 2006), EMBASE (1988 to Feb 2006), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006), PEDro (1929- Feb 2006), Current Contents (1993- Feb 2006) and Sports Discus (1830-Feb 2006). The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society was hand searched. Additional studies were identified through reference and citation tracking, personal communications with a content expert and contacting authors of eligible trials. There was no language restriction., Selection criteria, Eligible studies were prospective randomised controlled trials (RCT) or prospective controlled clinical trials (CCT) comparing exercise for acutely hospitalised older medical patients to usual care or no treatment controls., Data collection and analysis, Two independent reviewers extracted data relating to patient and hospital outcomes and assessed the method quality of included studies. Data were pooled in meta-analysis using the relative risk (RR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) for dichotomous outcomes and the standardised mean difference (SMD) or the weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes., Main results, Of 3138 potentially relevant articles screened, 7 randomised controlled trials and 2 controlled clinical trials were included. The effect of exercise on functional outcome measures is unclear. No intervention effect was found on adverse events. Pooled analysis of multidisciplinary interventions that included exercise indicated a small significant increase in the proportion of patients discharged to home at hospital discharge (Relative Risk 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14 and Numbers Needed to Treat 16, 95% CI 11 to 43) and a small but important reduction in acute hospital length of stay (weighted mean difference, -1.08 days, 95% CI -1.93 to -0.22) and total hospital costs (weighted mean difference, -US$278.65, 95% CI -491.85 to -65.44) compared to usual care. Pooled analysis of exercise intervention trials found no effect on the proportion of patients discharged to home or acute hospital length of stay., Authors' conclusions, There is 'silver' level evidence () that multidisciplinary intervention that includes exercise may increase the proportion of patients discharged to home and reduce length and cost of hospital stay for acutely hospitalised older medical patients.","Natalie de Morton, Jennifer L.

472,"Background, Traumatic physical injury can result in many disabling sequelae including physical and mental health problems and impaired social functioning., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the prevention of physical, mental and social disability following traumatic physical injury., Search strategy, The search was not restricted by date, language or publication status. We searched the following electronic databases; Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Controlled Trials metaRegister (), AMED (Allied & Complementary Medicine), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), PubMed. We also screened the reference lists of all selected papers and contacted authors of relevant studies. The latest search for trials was in February 2008., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials that consider one or more defined psychosocial interventions for the prevention of physical disability, mental health problems or reduced social functioning as a result of traumatic physical injury. We excluded studies that included patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of search results, reviewed the full text of potentially relevant studies, independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data., Main results, We included five studies, involving 756 participants. Three studies assessed the effect of brief psychological therapies, one assessed the impact of a self-help booklet, and one the effect of collaborative care. The disparate nature of the trials covering different patient populations, interventions and outcomes meant that it was not possible to pool data meaningfully across studies. There was no evidence of a protective effect of brief psychological therapy or educational booklets on preventing disability. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms one month after injury in those who received a collaborative care intervention combined with a brief psycho-educational intervention, however this was not retained at follow up. Overall mental health status was the only disability outcome affected by any intervention. In three trials the psychosocial intervention had a detrimental effect on the mental health status of patients., Authors' conclusions, This review provides no convincing evidence of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the prevention of disability following traumatic physical injury. Taken together, our findings cannot be considered as supporting the provision of psychosocial interventions to prevent aspects of disability arising from physical injury. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of disparate trials with small to moderate sample sizes and are therefore necessarily cautious. More research, using larger sample sizes, and similar interventions and patient populations to enable pooling of results, is needed before these findings can be confirmed.","Mary De Silva, Malcolm MacLachlan, Declan Devane, Deirdre Desmond, Pamela Gallagher, Ulrich Schnyder, Muireann Brennan, Vikram Patel (2009).

473,"Background, Antipsychotic agents are often used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia, although the literature is sceptical about their long-term use for this indication. Their effectiveness is limited and there is concern about adverse effects, including higher mortality with long-term use. When behavioural strategies have failed and drug therapy is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw these drugs are recommended. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia are often reluctant to try to stop antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. Strategies to reduce antipsychotic use have been proposed, but a systematic review of interventions aimed at withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia has not yet been performed., Objectives, To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia in community or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on behaviour., Search methods, ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane LibraryMEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 23 November 2012. The search included the following terms: antipsychotic* or neuroleptic* or phenothiazines or butyrophenones or risperidone or olanzapine or haloperidol or prothipendyl or methotrimeprazine or clopenthixol or flupenthixol or clothiapine or metylperon or droperidol or pipamperone or benperidol or bromperidol or fluspirilene or pimozide or penfluridol or sulpiride or veralipride or levosulpiride or sultopride or aripiprazole or clozapine or quetiapine or thioridazine combined with terms such as discontinu* or withdraw* or cessat* or reduce* or reducing or reduct* or taper* or stop*., Selection criteria, Randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia., Data collection and analysis, Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their risk of bias and extracted data., Main results, We included nine trials with 606 randomised participants. Seven trials were conducted in nursing homes, one trial in an outpatient setting and one in both settings. In these trials, different types of antipsychotics prescribed at different doses were withdrawn. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low regarding blinding and outcome reporting and unclear for randomisation procedures and recruitment of participants., Authors' conclusions, Our findings suggest that many older people with Alzheimer's dementia and NPS can be withdrawn from chronic antipsychotic medication without detrimental effects on their behaviour. It remains uncertain whether withdrawal is beneficial for cognition or psychomotor status, but the results of this review suggest that discontinuation programmes could be incorporated into routine practice. However, two studies of people whose agitation or psychosis had previously responded well to antipsychotic treatment found an increased risk of relapse or shorter time to relapse after discontinuation. Two other studies suggest that people with more severe NPS at baseline could benefit from continuing their antipsychotic medication. In these people, withdrawal might not be recommended.","Tom Declercq, Mirko Petrovic, Majda Azermai, Robert Vander Stichele, I. M. An De Sutter, Mieke L. van Driel, Thierry Christiaens (2013).

474,"Background, Spasticity may affect stroke survivors by contributing to activity limitations, caregiver burden, pain and reduced quality of life (QoL). Spasticity management guidelines recommend multidisciplinary (MD) rehabilitation programmes following botulinum toxin (BoNT) treatment for post-stroke spasticity. However, the evidence base for the effectiveness of MD rehabilitation is unclear., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of MD rehabilitation, following BoNT and other focal intramuscular treatments such as phenol, in improving activity limitations and other outcomes in adults and children with post-stroke spasticity. To explore what settings, types and intensities of rehabilitation programmes are effective., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1948 to December 2011), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), CINAHL (1982 to January 2012), AMED (1985 to January 2012), LILACS (1982 to September 2012), PEDro, REHABDATA and OpenGrey (September 2012). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched trials registries and reference lists, handsearched journals and contacted authors., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared MD rehabilitation (delivered by two or more disciplines in conjunction with medical input) following BoNT and other focal intramuscular treatments for post-stroke spasticity with placebo, routinely available local services, or lower levels of intervention; or studies that compared MD rehabilitation in different settings, of different types, or at different levels of intensity. We excluded RCTs that assessed the effectiveness of unidisciplinary therapy (for example physiotherapy only) or a single modality (for example stretching, casting, electrical stimulation or splinting only). The primary outcomes were validated measures of activity level (active and passive function) according to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Secondary outcomes included measures of symptoms, impairments, participation, QoL, impact on caregivers and adverse events., Data collection and analysis, We independently selected the trials, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Due to the limited number of included studies, with clinical, methodological and statistical heterogeneity, quantitative meta-analysis was not possible. Therefore, GRADE provided qualitative synthesis of 'best evidence'., Main results, We included three RCTs involving 91 participants. All three studies scored 'low quality' on the methodological quality assessment, implying high risk of bias. All studies investigated various types and intensities of outpatient rehabilitation programmes following BoNT for upper limb spasticity in adults with chronic stroke. Rehabilitation programmes included: modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) compared with a neurodevelopmental therapy programme; task practice therapy with cyclic functional electrical stimulation (FES) compared with task practice therapy only; and occupational, manual therapy with dynamic elbow extension splinting compared with occupational therapy only. There was 'low quality' evidence for mCIMT improving upper limb motor function and spasticity in chronic stroke survivors with residual voluntary upper limb activity, up to six months, and 'very low quality' evidence for dynamic elbow splinting and occupational therapy reducing elbow range of movement at 14 weeks. Task practice therapy with cyclic FES did not improve upper limb function more than task practice therapy alone, only at 12 weeks. No studies addressed interventions in children and those with lower limb spasticity, or after other focal intramuscular treatments for spasticity., Authors' conclusions, At best there was 'low level' evidence for","Marina Demetrios, Fary Khan, Lynne TurnerStokes, Caroline Brand, Shane McSweeney (2013).

475,"Background, Sexual offending is a legal construct that overlaps, but is not entirely congruent with, clinical constructs of disorders of sexual preference. Sexual offending is both a social and a public health issue. Victim surveys illustrate high incidence and prevalence levels, and it is commonly accepted that there is considerable hidden sexual victimisation. There are significant levels of psychiatric morbidity in survivors of sexual offences., Objectives, To assess the effects of psychological interventions on those who have sexually offended or are at risk of offending., Search methods, In September 2010 we searched: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Biosis Previews, CINAHL, COPAC, Dissertation Abstracts, EMBASE, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), ISI Proceedings, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts Database, PsycINFO, OpenSIGLE, Social Care Online, Sociological Abstracts, UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database and ZETOC. We contacted numerous experts in the field., Selection criteria, Randomised trials comparing psychological intervention with standard care or another psychological therapy given to adults treated in institutional or community settings for sexual behaviours that have resulted in conviction or caution for sexual offences, or who are seeking treatment voluntarily for behaviours classified as illegal., Data collection and analysis, At least two authors, working independently, selected studies, extracted data and assessed the studies' risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information including details of methods and outcome data., Main results, We included ten studies involving data from 944 adults, all male., Authors' conclusions, The inescapable conclusion of this review is the need for further randomised controlled trials. While we recognise that randomisation is considered by some to be unethical or politically unacceptable (both of which are based on the faulty premise that the experimental treatment is superior to the control - this being the point of the trial to begin with), without such evidence, the area will fail to progress. Not only could this result in the continued use of ineffective (and potentially harmful) interventions, but it also means that society is lured into a false sense of security in the belief that once the individual has been treated, their risk of reoffending is reduced. Current available evidence does not support this belief. Future trials should concentrate on minimising risk of bias, maximising quality of reporting and including follow-up for a minimum of five years 'at risk' in the community.","Jane A.

476,"Background, Demographic data in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand suggest a rapid growth in the number of persons over the age of 65 years as the baby boomer generation passes retirement age. As older adults make up an increasing proportion of the population, they are an important consideration when designing future evidence-based traffic safety policies, particularly those that lead to restrictions or cessation of driving. Research has shown that cessation of driving among older drivers can lead to negative emotional consequences such as depression and loss of independence. Older adults who continue to drive tend to do so less frequently than other demographic groups and are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash, possibly due to what is termed the 'low mileage bias'. Available research suggests that older driver crash risk estimates based on traditional exposure measures are prone to bias. When annual driving distances are taken in to consideration, older drivers with low driving distances have an increased crash risk, while those with average or high driving distances tend to be safer drivers when compared to other age groups. In addition, older drivers with lower distance driving tend to drive in urban areas which, due to more complex and demanding traffic patterns, tend to be more accident-prone. Failure to control for actual annual driving distances and driving locations among older drivers is referred to as 'low mileage bias' in older driver mobility research., It is also important to note that older drivers are more vulnerable to serious injury and death in the event of a traffic crash due to changes in physiology associated with normal ageing. Vision, cognition, and motor functions or skills (e.g., strength, co-ordination, and flexibility) are three key domains required for safe driving. To drive safely, an individual needs to be able to see road signs, road side objects, traffic lights, roadway markings, other vulnerable road users, and other vehicles on the road, among many other cues-all while moving, and under varying light and weather conditions. It is equally important that drivers must have appropriate peripheral vision to monitor objects and movement to identify possible threats in the driving environment. It is, therefore, not surprising that there is agreement among researchers that vision plays a significant role in driving performance. Several age-related processes/conditions impair vision, thus it follows that vision testing of older drivers is an important road safety issue., The components of visual function essential for driving are acuity, static acuity, dynamic acuity, visual fields, visual attention, depth perception, and contrast sensitivity. These indices are typically not fully assessed by licensing agencies. Also, current vision screening regulations and cut-off values required to pass a licensing test vary from country to country. Although there is a clear need to develop evidence-based and validated tools for vision screening for driving, the effectiveness of existing vision screening tools remains unclear. This represents an important and highly warranted initiative to increase road safety worldwide., Objectives, To assess the effects of vision screening interventions for older drivers to prevent road traffic injuries and fatalities., Search methods, For the update of this review we searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP) and ISI Web of Science: (CPCI-S & SSCI). The searches were conducted up to 26 September 2013., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before and after studies comparing vision screening to non-screening of drivers aged 55 years and older, and which assessed the effect on road traffic crashes, injuries, fatalities and any involvement in traffic law violations., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened the referenc","Ediriweera Desapriya, Rahana Harjee, Jeffrey Brubacher, Herbert Chan, Sesath D.

477,"Background, Zotepine is a relatively new antipsychotic often used for the treatment of people with schizophrenia. It is claimed to be particularly effective for negative symptoms., Objectives, To determine the effects of zotepine compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and related psychoses., Search methods, For the 2006 update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials., Selection criteria, We included all randomised clinical trials comparing zotepine with other treatments for people with schizophrenia or other psychoses., Data collection and analysis, We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re-inspected these and assessed their quality. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated the relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). We inspected all data for heterogeneity., Main results, The review currently includes 11 studies with 966 participants. Most outcomes were short term (4-12 weeks). We found no data for outcomes such as relapse, time in hospital, satisfaction with care and day-to-day functioning. Compared with placebo, mental state ratings favoured zotepine (n=106, 1 RCT, RR No 20% decrease in BPRS 0.44 CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNT 3 CI 2 to 6) using the last observation carried forward method. For the comparison with typical drugs, limited data suggest that zotepine may be as effective as these older medications. Mental state measures of 'no clinically important improvement' favour zotepine when compared with other active drugs (n=356, 4 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 7 CI 4 to 22). About one third of people in both the zotepine and control groups left the studies before trial completion. Zotepine may result in less movement disorder adverse effects than typical antipsychotic drugs. Trials have not highlighted clear differences between zotepine and other atypical drugs., Authors' conclusions, Zotepine may be a valuable addition to the class of atypical antipsychotic drugs. However, more data from existing studies is urgently needed to increase confidence in the findings of this review. In addition to this, new data from well planned, conducted and reported long term pragmatic randomised trials are needed. Otherwise clinical use of zotepine will be based upon speculation of short explanatory trials for everyday practice.","Prasanna DeSilva, Mark Fenton, John Rathbone (2012).

478,"Background, Lifestyle interventions are often recommended as initial treatment for mild hypertension, but the efficacy of relaxation therapies is unclear., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of relaxation therapies on cardiovascular outcomes and blood pressure in people with elevated blood pressure., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review., Selection criteria, Inclusion criteria: RCTs of a parallel design comparing relaxation therapies with no active treatment, or sham therapy; follow-up >=8 weeks; participants over 18 years, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=85 mmHg); SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. Exclusion criteria: participants were pregnant; participants received antihypertensive medication which changed during the trial., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted., Main results, 29 RCTs, with eight weeks to five years follow-up, met our inclusion criteria; four were excluded from the primary meta-analysis because of inadequate outcome data. The remaining 25 trials assessed 1,198 participants, but adequate randomisation was confirmed in only seven trials and concealment of allocation in only one. Only one trial reported deaths, heart attacks and strokes (one of each). Meta-analysis indicated that relaxation resulted in small, statistically significant reductions in SBP (mean difference: -5.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.2 to -2.8, I2 =72%) and DBP (mean difference: -3.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.3 to -1.6, I2 =75%) compared to control. The substantial heterogeneity between trials was not explained by duration of follow-up, type of control, type of relaxation therapy or baseline blood pressure., Authors' conclusions, In view of the poor quality of included trials and unexplained variation between trials, the evidence in favour of causal association between relaxation and blood pressure reduction is weak. Some of the apparent benefit of relaxation was probably due to aspects of treatment unrelated to relaxation.","Heather O. Dickinson, Fiona R. Beyer, Gary A.

479,"Background, Intensive Case Management (ICM) is a community-based package of care aiming to provide long-term care for severely mentally ill people who do not require immediate admission. Intensive Case Management evolved from two original community models of care, Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and Case Management (CM), where ICM emphasises the importance of small caseload (fewer than 20) and high-intensity input., Objectives, To assess the effects of ICM as a means of caring for severely mentally ill people in the community in comparison with non-ICM (caseload greater than 20) and with standard community care. We did not distinguish between models of ICM. In addition, to assess whether the effect of ICM on hospitalisation (mean number of days per month in hospital) is influenced by the intervention's fidelity to the ACT model and by the rate of hospital use in the setting where the trial was conducted (baseline level of hospital use)., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (last update search 10 April 2015)., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, aged 18 to 65 years and treated in the community care setting, where ICM is compared to non-ICM or standard care., Data collection and analysis, At least two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random-effects model for analyses., Main results, The 2016 update included two more studies (n = 196) and more publications with additional data for four already included studies. The updated review therefore includes 7524 participants from 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found data relevant to two comparisons: ICM versus standard care, and ICM versus non-ICM. The majority of studies had a high risk of selective reporting. No studies provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state., Authors' conclusions, Based on very low- to moderate-quality evidence, ICM is effective in ameliorating many outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness. Compared to standard care, ICM may reduce hospitalisation and increase retention in care. It also globally improved social functioning, although ICM's effect on mental state and quality of life remains unclear. Intensive Case Management is at least valuable to people with severe mental illnesses in the subgroup of those with a high level of hospitalisation (about four days per month in past two years). Intensive Case Management models with high fidelity to the original team organisation of ACT model were more effective at reducing time in hospital.","Marina Dieterich, Claire B.

480,"Background, Alcohol consumption has been linked with injuries through motor vehicle crashes, falls, drowning, fires and burns, and violence. In the US, half of the estimated 100,000 deaths attributed to alcohol each year are due to intentional and unintentional injuries. The identification of effective interventions for the reduction of unintentional and intentional injuries due to problem drinking is, therefore, an important public health goal., Objectives, To assess the effect of interventions for problem drinking on subsequent injury risk., Search strategy, We searched 12 twelve computerized databases: MEDLINE (1966 to 2002), EMBASE (1982 to 2002), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2002, Issue 2), PsycINFO (1967 to 2002), CINAHL (1982 to10/96), ERIC (1966 to12/96), Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to11/96), IBSS (1961 to 2002), ISTP (1982 to 2002) and three specialized transportation databases (Transport 1988 to 2002/03). Bibliographies of relevant trials were searched and authors were contacted. Government agencies were also contacted for further information and grey literature. Most of the electronic and bibliographic database searches were last run in May 2002., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials of interventions among participants with problem drinking, which are intended to reduce alcohol consumption or to prevent injuries or their antecedents, and which measured injury-related outcomes., Data collection and analysis, Two authors extracted data on participants, interventions, follow-up, allocation concealment, and outcomes, and independently rated allocation concealment quality., Main results, Of 23 eligible trials identified, 22 had been completed and 17 provided results for relevant outcomes. Completed trials comparing interventions for problem drinking to no intervention reported reduced motor-vehicle crashes and related injuries, falls, suicide attempts, domestic violence, assaults and child abuse, alcohol-related injuries and injury emergency visits, hospitalizations and deaths. Reductions ranged from 27% to 65%. Because few trials were sufficiently large to assess effects on injuries, individual effect estimates were generally imprecise. We did not combine the results quantitatively because the interventions, patient populations, and outcomes were so diverse. The most commonly evaluated intervention was brief counseling in the clinical setting. This was studied in seven trials, in which injury-related deaths were reduced: relative risk (RR) 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 2.00. However, this reduction may have been due to chance. The majority of trials of brief counseling also showed beneficial effects on diverse non-fatal injury outcomes., Authors' conclusions, Interventions for problem drinking appear to reduce injuries and their antecedents (e.g. falls, motor vehicle crashes, suicide attempts). Because injuries account for much of the morbidity and mortality from problem drinking, larger studies are warranted to evaluate the effect of treating problem drinking on injuries.","Bella Tho DinhZarr, Cynthia W.

Index test characteristics, type of test or algorithm used for test interpretation within each 'group' of tests, expert versus generalist practitioner, diagnosis in person versus image-based diagnosis, the nature of and definition of criteria for test positivity, approaches to lesion preparation (e.g., use of keratolytics before exfoliative cytology or of oil for dermoscopy), iii. Reference standard characteristics, reference standard used, whether histology-reporting meets pathology-reporting guidelines, use of excisional versus diagnostic biopsy, whether two independent dermatopathologists reviewed histological diagnosis, iv. Study quality, consecutive or random sample of participants recruited, index test interpreted blinded to the reference standard result, index test interpreted blinded to the result of any other index test, presence of partial or differential verification bias (whereby only a sample of those subject to the index test are verified by the reference test or by the same reference test with selection dependent on the index test result), use of an adequate reference standard, overall risk of bias","Jac Dinnes, Yuen Kai Wong, Abha Gulati, Naomi Chuchu, Jo LeonardiBee, Susan E.

595,"Background, Despite drug and surgical therapies for Parkinson's disease, patients develop progressive disability. It has both motor and non-motor symptomatology, and their interaction with their environment can be very complex. The role of the occupational therapist is to support the patient and help them maintain their usual level of self-care, work and leisure activities for as long as possible. When it is no longer possible to maintain their usual activities, occupational therapists support individuals in changing and adapting their relationship with their physical and social environment to develop new valued activities and roles., Objectives, To compare the efficacy and effectiveness of occupational therapy with placebo or no interventions (control group) in patients with Parkinson's disease., Search strategy, Relevant trials were identified by electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966-April 2007), EMBASE (1974-2000), CINAHL (1982-April 2007), Psycinfo (1806-April 2007), Ovid OLDMEDLINE (1950-1965), ISI Web of Knowledge (1981-April 2007), National Library for Health (NLH) (April 2007), Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health (NMAP) (April 2007), Intute: Medicine (December 2005), Proquest Nursing Journals (PNJ, 1986 - April 2007); rehabilitation databases: AMED (1985-April 2007), MANTIS (1880-2000), REHABDATA (1956-2000), REHADAT (2000), GEROLIT (1979-2000); English language databases of foreign language research and third world publications: Pascal (1984-2000), LILACS (1982- April 2007), MedCarib (17th Century-April 2007), JICST-EPlus (1985-2000), AIM (1993-April 2007), IMEMR (1984-April 2007), grey literature databases: SIGLE (1980-2000), ISI-ISTP (1982-April 2007), DISSABS (1999-2000), Conference Papers Index (CPI, 1982-2000) and Aslib Index to Theses (AIT, 1716- April 2006), The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2, 2007), the CenterWatch Clinical Trials listing service (April 2007), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT, April 2007), Current controlled trials (CCT) (April 2007), ClinicalTrials.gov (April 2007), CRISP (1972-April 2007), PEDro (April 2007), NIDRR (April 2007) and NRR (April 2007) and the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews were examined., Selection criteria, Only randomised controlled trials (RCT) were included, however those trials that allowed quasi-random methods of allocation were allowed., Data collection and analysis, Data was abstracted independently by two authors and differences were settled by discussion., Main results, Two trials were identified with 84 patients in total. Although both trials reported a positive effect from occupational therapy, all of the improvements were small. The trials did not have adequate placebo treatments, used small numbers of patients and the method of randomisation and concealment of allocation was not specified in one trial. These methodological problems could potentially lead to bias from a number of sources reducing the strength of the studies further., Authors' conclusions, Considering the significant methodological flaws in the studies, the small number of patients examined, and the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of occupational therapy in Parkinson's disease. There is now a consensus as to UK current and best practice in occupational therapy when treating people with Parkinson's disease. We now require large well designed placebo-controlled RCTs to demonstrate occupational therapy's effectiveness in Parkinson's disease. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients, carers, occupational therapists and physicians should be chosen and the patients monitored for at least six months to determine the duration of benefit. The trials should be reported using CONSORT guidelines.","Lynn Dixon, Dawn C. Duncan, Paul Johnson, Liz Kirkby, Helen O'Connell, Hilary J. Taylor, Katherine Deane (2009).

596,"Background, Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of chronic disability. Worldwide, it is the leading cause of disability in the under 40s, resulting in severe disability in some 150 to 200 million people per annum. In addition to mood and behavioural problems, cognition-particularly memory, attention and executive function-are commonly impaired by TBI. Cognitive problems following TBI are one of the most important factors in determining people's subjective well-being and their quality of life. Drugs are widely used in an attempt to improve cognitive functions. Whilst cholinergic agents in TBI have been reviewed, there has not yet been a systematic review or meta-analysis of the effect on chronic cognitive problems of all centrally acting pharmacological agents., Objectives, To assess the effects of centrally acting pharmacological agents for treatment of chronic cognitive impairment subsequent to traumatic brain injury in adults., Search methods, We searched ALOIS-the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register-on 16 November 2013, 23 February 2013, 20 January 2014, and 30 December 2014 using the terms: traumatic OR TBI OR 'brain injury' OR 'brain injuries' OR TBIs OR 'axonal injury' OR 'axonal injuries'. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. Supplementary searches were also performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Cochrane LibraryCINAHL, LILACs, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal (ICTRP) and Web of Science with conference proceedings., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of any one centrally acting pharmacological agent that affects one or more of the main neurotransmitter systems in people with chronic traumatic brain injury; and there had to be a minimum of 12 months between the injury and entry into the trial., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors examined titles and abstracts of citations obtained from the search. Relevant articles were retrieved for further assessment. A bibliographic search of relevant papers was conducted. We extracted data using a standardised tool, which included data on the incidence of adverse effects. Where necessary we requested additional unpublished data from study authors. Risk of bias was assessed by a single author., Main results, Only four studies met the criteria for inclusion, with a total of 274 participants. Four pharmacological agents were investigated: modafinil (51 participants); (-)-OSU6162, a monoamine stabiliser (12 participants of which six had a TBI); atomoxetine (60 participants); and rivastigmine (157 participants). A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the small number and heterogeneity of the studies., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence to determine whether pharmacological treatment is effective in chronic cognitive impairment in TBI. Whilst there is a positive finding for rivastigmine on one primary measure, all other primary measures were not better than placebo. The positive findings for (-)-OSU6162 are interpreted cautiously as the study was small (n = 6). For modafinil and atomoxetine no positive effects were found. All four drugs appear to be relatively well tolerated, although evidence is sparse.","Dominic Dougall, Norman Poole, Niruj Agrawal (2015).

597,"Background, People with schizophrenia often experience symptoms which fail to fully respond to antipsychotic medication. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been proposed as a new treatment for people with schizophrenia, especially those who experience persistent auditory hallucinations., Objectives, To estimate the effects of TMS alone, compared with sham TMS or with 'standard management' and any other comparison interventions in reducing psychotic symptoms associated with schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2006, June 2008, April 2013). This register is compiled by methodical searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Dissertation abstracts, LILACS, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, RUSSMED, and Sociofile, and is supplemented with handsearching of relevant journals and numerous conference proceedings., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials recruiting at least five participants and comparing TMS with sham TMS or any other treatment for people with schizophrenia., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CI. We used a fixed-effect model. We assessed overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach., Main results, We included 41 studies with 1473 participants in the review. We found significant differences in favour of temporoparietal TMS compared to sham TMS for global state measured on the CGI scale (7 RCTs, n = 224, MD -0.5, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.23, very low-quality evidence) and positive symptoms measured on the PANSS scale (5 RCTs, n = 127, MD -6.09, 95% CI -10.95 to -1.22, very low-quality evidence). Participants experienced significantly more headaches in the temporoparietal TMS group (10 RCTs, n = 392, RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.50, very low-quality evidence). However, no more participants left the study early from the TMS group than from the sham group (very low-quality evidence). Cognitive state was assessed using 39 different measures, and all were equivocal (very low-quality evidence)., Authors' conclusions, Based on this review, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of TMS to treat symptoms of schizophrenia. Although some evidence suggests that TMS, and in particular temporoparietal TMS, may improve certain symptoms (such as auditory hallucinations and positive symptoms of schizophrenia) compared to sham TMS, the results were not robust enough to be unequivocal across the assessment measures used. There was insufficient evidence to suggest any added benefit with TMS used as an adjunctive therapy to antipsychotic medication.","Nadine Dougall, Nicola Maayan, Karla SoaresWeiser, Lisa M.

598,"Background, Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic reported to be effective without producing disabling extrapyramidal adverse effects associated with older, typical antipsychotic drugs., Objectives, To determine the clinical effects and safety of olanzapine compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophreniform psychoses., Search methods, We updated the first search [Biological Abstracts (1980-1999), The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 1999), EMBASE (1980-1999), MEDLINE (1966-1999), PsycLIT (1974-1999) and The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 2000)] in October 2004 using the Cochrane Schizophrenia's Group's register of trials. We also searched references of all included studies for further trials, and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors., Selection criteria, We included all randomised clinical trials comparing olanzapine with placebo or any antipsychotic treatment for people with schizophrenia or schizophreniform psychoses., Data collection and analysis, We independently extracted data and, for homogeneous dichotomous data, calculated the random effects relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the number needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data we calculated weighted mean differences., Main results, Fifty five trials are included (total n>10000 people with schizophrenia). Attrition from olanzapine versus placebo studies was >50% by six weeks, leaving interpretation of results problematic. Olanzapine appeared superior to placebo at six weeks for the outcome of 'no important clinical response' (any dose, 2 RCTs n=418, RR 0.88 CI 0.8 to 0.1, NNT 8 CI 5 to 27). Although dizziness and dry mouth were reported more frequently in the olanzapine-treated group, this did not reach statistical significance. The olanzapine group gained more weight., Authors' conclusions, The large proportion of participants leaving studies early in these trials makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on olanzapine's clinical effects. For people with schizophrenia it may offer antipsychotic efficacy with fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than typical drugs, but more weight gain. There is a need for further large, long-term randomised trials with more comprehensive data.","Lorna Duggan, Mark Fenton, John Rathbone, Roland Dardennes, Ahmed ElDosoky, Saroja Indran (2013).

599,"Background, Eclampsia, the occurrence of a seizure in association with pre-eclampsia, is a rare but serious complication of pregnancy. A number of different anticonvulsants have been used to control eclamptic fits and to prevent further seizures., Objectives, The objective of this review was to assess the effects of magnesium sulphate compared with lytic cocktail (usually chlorpromazine, promethazine and pethidine) when used for the care of women with eclampsia. Magnesium sulphate is compared with diazepam and with phenytoin in other Cochrane reviews., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (July 2010) and the Cochrane Central Register of Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2)., Selection criteria, Randomised trials comparing magnesium sulphate (intravenous or intramuscular administration) with lytic cocktail for women with a clinical diagnosis of eclampsia., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors (L Duley and D Chou) assessed trial quality and extracted data., Main results, We included three small trials (total 397 women) of average quality in the review. Magnesium sulphate was associated with fewer maternal deaths (risk ratio (RR) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.59; 3 trials, 397 women) and was better at preventing further seizures (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.12; 3 trials, 397 women) than lytic cocktail. Magnesium sulphate was also associated with less respiratory depression (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.91; 2 trials, 198 women), less coma (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.74; 1 trial, 108 women), and less pneumonia (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.67; 2 trials, 307 women). There was no clear difference in the RR for any death of the baby (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.38, random effects; 2 trials, 177 babies)., Authors' conclusions, Magnesium sulphate, rather than lytic cocktail, for women with eclampsia reduces the RR of maternal death, of further seizures and of serious maternal morbidity (respiratory depression, coma, pneumonia). Magnesium sulphate is the anticonvulsant of choice for women with eclampsia; the use of lytic cocktail should be abandoned.","Lelia Duley, Metin A. Gulmezoglu, Doris Chou (2011).

600,"Background, One person in every four will suffer from a diagnosable mental health condition during their life course. Such conditions can have a devastating impact on the lives of the individual, their family and society. Increasingly partnership models of mental health care have been advocated and enshrined in international healthcare policy. Shared decision making is one such partnership approach. Shared decision making is a form of patient-provider communication where both parties are acknowledged to bring expertise to the process and work in partnership to make a decision. This is advocated on the basis that patients have a right to self-determination and also in the expectation that it will increase treatment adherence., Objectives, To assess the effects of provider-, consumer- or carer-directed shared decision making interventions for people of all ages with mental health conditions, on a range of outcomes including: patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and health service outcomes., Search strategy, We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2008), EMBASE (1980 to November 2008), PsycINFO (1967 to November 2008), CINAHL (1982 to November 2008), British Nursing Index and Archive (1985 to November 2008) and SIGLE (1890 to September 2005 (database end date)). We also searched online trial registers and the bibliographies of relevant papers, and contacted authors of included studies., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (q-RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs); and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of interventions to increase shared decision making in people with mental health conditions (by DSM or ICD-10 criteria)., Data collection and analysis, Data on recruitment methods, eligibility criteria, sample characteristics, interventions, outcome measures, participant flow and outcome data from each study were extracted by one author and checked by another. Data are presented in a narrative synthesis., Main results, We included two separate German studies involving a total of 518 participants. One study was undertaken in the inpatient treatment of schizophrenia and the other in the treatment of people newly diagnosed with depression in primary care. Regarding the primary outcomes, one study reported statistically significant increases in patient satisfaction, the other study did not. There was no evidence of effect on clinical outcomes or hospital readmission rates in either study. Regarding secondary outcomes, there was an indication that interventions to increase shared decision making increased doctor facilitation of patient involvement in decision making, and did not increase consultation times. Nor did the interventions increase patient compliance with treatment plans. Neither study reported any harms of the intervention. Definite conclusions cannot be drawn, however, on the basis of these two studies., Authors' conclusions, No firm conclusions can be drawn at present about the effects of shared decision making interventions for people with mental health conditions. There is no evidence of harm, but there is an urgent need for further research in this area.","Edward Duncan, Catherine Best, Suzanne Hagen (2010).

601,"Background, Communication problems in health care may arise as a result of healthcare providers focusing on diseases and their management, rather than people, their lives and their health problems. Patient-centred approaches to care delivery in the patient encounter are increasingly advocated by consumers and clinicians and incorporated into training for healthcare providers. However, the impact of these interventions directly on clinical encounters and indirectly on patient satisfaction, healthcare behaviour and health status has not been adequately evaluated., Objectives, To assess the effects of interventions for healthcare providers that aim to promote patient-centred care (PCC) approaches in clinical consultations., Search methods, For this update, we searched: MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and CINAHL (EbscoHOST) from January 2000 to June 2010. The earlier version of this review searched MEDLINE (1966 to December 1999), EMBASE (1985 to December 1999), PsycLIT (1987 to December 1999), CINAHL (1982 to December 1999) and HEALTH STAR (1975 to December 1999). We searched the bibliographies of studies assessed for inclusion and contacted study authors to identify other relevant studies. Any study authors who were contacted for further information on their studies were also asked if they were aware of any other published or ongoing studies that would meet our inclusion criteria., Selection criteria, In the original review, study designs included randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series studies of interventions for healthcare providers that promote patient-centred care in clinical consultations. In the present update, we were able to limit the studies to randomized controlled trials, thus limiting the likelihood of sampling error. This is especially important because the providers who volunteer for studies of PCC methods are likely to be different from the general population of providers. Patient-centred care was defined as a philosophy of care that encourages: (a) shared control of the consultation, decisions about interventions or management of the health problems with the patient, and/or (b) a focus in the consultation on the patient as a whole person who has individual preferences situated within social contexts (in contrast to a focus in the consultation on a body part or disease). Within our definition, shared treatment decision-making was a sufficient indicator of PCC. The participants were healthcare providers, including those in training., Data collection and analysis, We classified interventions by whether they focused only on training providers or on training providers and patients, with and without condition-specific educational materials. We grouped outcome data from the studies to evaluate both direct effects on patient encounters (consultation process variables) and effects on patient outcomes (satisfaction, healthcare behaviour change, health status). We pooled results of RCTs using standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative risks (RR) applying a fixed-effect model., Main results, Forty-three randomized trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 29 are new in this update. In most of the studies, training interventions were directed at primary care physicians (general practitioners, internists, paediatricians or family doctors) or nurses practising in community or hospital outpatient settings. Some studies trained specialists. Patients were predominantly adults with general medical problems, though two studies included children with asthma. Descriptive and pooled analyses showed generally positive effects on consultation processes on a range of measures relating to clarifying patients' concerns and beliefs; communicating about treatment options; levels of empathy; and patients' perception of providers' attentiveness to them and their concerns as well as their diseases. A new finding for this update is that short-term training (less than 10 hours) is as successful as longer training., Authors'","Francesca Dwamena, Margaret HolmesRovner, Carolyn M.

602,"Background, Screening programmes can potentially identify people at high cardiovascular risk and reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. However, there is currently not enough evidence showing clear clinical or economic benefits of systematic screening-like programmes over the widely practised opportunistic risk assessment of CVD in primary care settings., Objectives, The primary objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness, costs and adverse effects of systematic risk assessment compared to opportunistic risk assessment for the primary prevention of CVD., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE on 30 January 2015, and Web of Science Core Collection and additional databases on the Cochrane Library on 4 December 2014. We also searched two clinical trial registers and checked reference lists of relevant articles. We applied no language restrictions., Selection criteria, We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effects of systematic risk assessment, defined as a screening-like programme involving a predetermined selection process of people, compared with opportunistic risk assessment which ranged from no risk assessment at all to incentivised case finding of CVD and related risk factors. Participants included healthy adults from the general population, including those who are at risk of CVD., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected studies. One review author extracted data and assessed them for risk of bias and a second checked them. We assessed evidence quality using the GRADE approach and present this in a 'Summary of findings' table., Main results, Nine completed RCTs met the inclusion criteria, of which four were cluster-randomised. We also identified five ongoing trials. The included studies had a high or unclear risk of bias, and the GRADE ratings of overall quality were low or very low. The length of follow-up varied from one year in four studies, three years in one study, five or six years in two studies, and ten years in two studies. Eight studies recruited participants from the general population, although there were differences in the age ranges targeted. One study recruited family members of cardiac patients (high risk assessment). There were considerable differences between the studies in the interventions received by the intervention and control groups. There was insufficient evidence to stratify by the types of risk assessment approaches., Authors' conclusions, The results are limited by the heterogeneity between trials in terms of participants recruited, interventions and duration of follow-up. Limited data suggest that systematic risk assessment for CVD has no statistically significant effects on clinical endpoints. There is limited evidence to suggest that CVD systematic risk assessment may have some favourable effects on cardiovascular risk factors. The completion of the five ongoing trials will add to the evidence base.","Mariana Dyakova, Saran Shantikumar, Jill L. Colquitt, Christian M.

603,"Background, Use of smokeless tobacco (ST) can lead to tobacco dependence and long-term use can lead to health problems including periodontal disease, cancer, and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease., Objectives, To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of ST use., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register in June 2015., Selection criteria, Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit with follow-up of at least six months., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We summarised outcomes as risk ratios (RRs). For subgroups of trials with similar types of intervention and without substantial statistical heterogeneity, we estimated pooled effects using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method., Main results, We identified 34 trials that met the inclusion criteria, of which nine were new for this update, representing over 16,000 participants. There was moderate quality evidence from two studies suggesting that varenicline increases ST abstinence rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.68, 507 participants). Pooled results from two trials of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment at six months or longer (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.44, 293 participants) but the confidence interval was wide. Neither nicotine patch (five trials, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.37, 1083 participants) nor nicotine gum (two trials, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43, 310 participants) increased abstinence. Pooling five studies of nicotine lozenges did increase tobacco abstinence (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.59, 1529 participants) but confidence in this estimate is low as the result is sensitive to the exclusion of three trials which did not use a placebo control., Authors' conclusions, Varenicline, nicotine lozenges and behavioural interventions may help ST users to quit. Confidence in results for nicotine lozenges is limited. Confidence in the size of effect from behavioural interventions is limited because the components of behavioural interventions that contribute to their impact are not clear.","Jon O.

604,"Background, This is the first update of the original Cochrane Review published in 2013. The conclusions of this review have not changed from the 2013 publication. People with chronic non-cancer pain who are prescribed and are taking opioids can have a history of long-term, high-dose opioid use without effective pain relief. In those without good pain relief, reduction of prescribed opioid dose may be the desired and shared goal of both patient and clinician. Simple, unsupervised reduction of opioid use is clinically challenging, and very difficult to achieve and maintain., Objectives, To investigate the effectiveness of different methods designed to achieve reduction or cessation of prescribed opioid use for the management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults compared to controls., Search methods, For this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in January 2017, as well as bibliographies and citation searches of included studies. We also searched one trial registry for ongoing trials., Selection criteria, Included studies had to be randomised controlled trials comparing opioid users receiving an intervention with a control group receiving treatment as usual, active control, or placebo. The aim of the study had to include a treatment goal of dose reduction or cessation of opioid medication., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We sought data relating to prescribed opioid use, adverse events of opioid reduction, pain, and psychological and physical function. We planned to assess the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach, however, due to the heterogeneity of studies, we were unable to combine outcomes in a meta-analysis and therefore we did not assess the evidence with GRADE., Main results, Three studies are new to this update, resulting in five included studies in total (278 participants). Participants were primarily women (mean age 49.63 years, SD = 11.74) with different chronic pain conditions. We judged the studies too heterogeneous to pool data in a meta-analysis, so we have summarised the results from each study qualitatively. The studies included acupuncture, mindfulness, and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions aimed at reducing opioid consumption, misuse of opioids, or maintenance of chronic pain management treatments. We found mixed results from the studies. Three of the five studies reported opioid consumption at post-treatment and follow-up. Two studies that delivered 'Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement' or 'Therapeutic Interactive Voice Response' found a significant difference between groups at post-treatment and follow-up in opioid consumption. The remaining study found reduction in opioid consumption in both treatment and control groups, and between-group differences were not significant. Three studies reported adverse events related to the study and two studies did not have study-related adverse events. We also found mixed findings for pain intensity and physical functioning. The interventions did not show between-group differences for psychological functioning across all studies. Overall, the risk of bias was mixed across studies. All studies included sample sizes of fewer than 100 and so we judged all studies as high risk of bias for that category., Authors' conclusions, There is no evidence for the efficacy or safety of methods for reducing prescribed opioid use in chronic pain. There is a small number of randomised controlled trials investigating opioid reduction, which means our conclusions are limited regarding the benefit of psychological, pharmacological, or other types of interventions for people with chronic pain trying to reduce their opioid consumption. The findings to date are mixed: there were reductions in opioid consumption after intervention, and often in control groups too.","Christopher Eccleston, Emma Fisher, Kyla H.

605,"Background, Neuropathic pain is thought to arise from damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Its prevalence is increasing in line with many chronic disorders such as diabetes. All treatments have limited effectiveness. Given the evidence regarding psychological treatment for distress and disability in people with various chronic pain conditions, we were interested to investigate whether psychological treatments have any effects for those with chronic neuropathic pain., Objectives, To assess the effects of psychological treatments on pain experience, disability, mood, and health-care use in adults with chronic neuropathic pain., Search methods, We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in any language in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, from database inception to March 2015., Selection criteria, Full publications of RCTs on psychological interventions for neuropathic pain. Trials had to have lasted at least three months, had at least 20 participants in each arm at the end of treatment, and compared a psychological intervention with any active or inactive intervention., Data collection and analysis, We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane., Main results, Two small studies (enrolling a total of 105 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One was a standard cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) programme for 61 people with pain from spinal cord injury, followed up for three months, and compared with a waiting list. The other was weekly group psychotherapy for 44 people with burning mouth syndrome, compared with a daily placebo tablet. The overall risk of bias was high in both trials., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy and safety of psychological interventions for chronic neuropathic pain. The two available studies show no benefit of treatment over either waiting list or placebo control groups.","Christopher Eccleston, Leslie Hearn, Amanda C. Williams (2017).

606,"Background, Splints/orthoses are often recommended to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to decrease pain, reduce swelling, and/or prevent deformity. These orthoses include resting hand splints, wrist supports, finger splints, and special shoes and shoe inserts., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of splints/orthoses in relieving pain, decreasing swelling, and/or preventing deformity, and to determine the impact of splints/orthoses on strength, mobility, and function in people with RA., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Field of Physical and Related Therapies Register, Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register to issue 4, 2001, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the PEDro data base, and Current Contents up to January 2002, using the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. Unpublished studies were sought by handsearching conference proceedings and contacting key experts., Selection criteria, All randomized control trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), case-control and cohort studies comparing the use of specific orthoses against placebo, another active intervention (including another type of orthoses), or regular treatment were selected according to an a priori protocol., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently selected the studies and extracted data. The methodological quality of the RCTs and CCTs was assessed using a validated scale., Main results, Twelve papers reporting on 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies dealt with the following: working wrist splints (5), resting hand and wrist splints (2), special shoes and insoles (3). There is evidence that wearing wrist splints during work statistically significantly decreases grip strength and does not affect pain, morning stiffness, pinch grip, or quality of life after up to six months of regular wear. We found no evidence that resting wrist and hand splints change pain, grip strength, Ritchie Index, or number of swollen joints. However, participants who wore these splints for two months reported that they preferred use to non-use, and padded resting splints to unpadded ones. The one study of special shoes provided evidence of significant benefits of wearing extra-depth shoes for two months, including less pain on walking and stair climbing, and more minutes of pain free walking time. Extra-depth shoes with semi-rigid insoles provided better pain relief than extra-depth shoes alone when worn over 12 weeks. Supporting insoles prevented progression of hallux valgus angle but did not affect pain or function., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of working wrist splints in decreasing pain or increasing function for people with RA. Potential adverse effects, such as decreased range of motion, do not seem to be an issue although some of these splints decrease grip strength and dexterity. Similarly, preliminary evidence suggests that resting hand and wrist splints do not seem to affect range of motion (ROM) or pain, although participants preferred wearing a resting splint to not wearing one. There is evidence that extra-depth shoes and molded insoles decrease pain during weight-bearing activities such as standing, walking, and stair-climbing. Supported insoles may be effective in preventing progression of hallux abductus angle but do not appear to have any impact on pain.","Mary Egan, Lucie Brosseau, Melanie Farmer, MarieAndree Ouimet, Shannon Rees, Peter Tugwell, George A.

607,"Background, Many patients experience depression, social isolation and anxiety post stroke. These are associated with a poorer outcome. Ameliorating these problems may improve patient wellbeing., Objectives, To evaluate the impact of a healthcare worker or volunteer whose multi-dimensional roles have been grouped under the title 'stroke liaison worker'., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (searched February 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 2009), EMBASE (1980 to 2009) and four other databases. We performed a cited reference search, searched conference proceedings and trials registers, checked reference lists and contacted authors and trial investigators., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials investigating the impact of a stroke liaison worker versus usual care., Data collection and analysis, We invited trialists to participate in a review of individual patient data. Primary outcomes for patients were subjective health status and extended activities of daily living. Primary outcomes for carers were subjective health status including measures of carer strain., Main results, We included 16 trials involving 4759 participants. Analysis did not show a significant overall difference for subjective health status (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11 to 0.04, P = 0.34) or extended activities of daily living (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.11, P = 0.22). There was no overall significant effect for the outcome of carer subjective health status (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.14, P = 0.37). Patients with mild to moderate disability (Barthel 15 to 19) had a significant reduction in dependence (odds ratio (OR) 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.87, P = 0.006). This would equate to 10 fewer dependent patients (95% CI 17 fewer to 4 fewer) for every 100 patients seen by the stroke liaison worker. Similar results were seen for the outcome of death or dependence for the subgroup with Barthel 15 to 19 (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.81, P = 0.002). This risk difference equates to 11 fewer dead or dependent patients (95% CI 17 fewer to 4 fewer) for every 100 patients seen by the stroke liaison worker., Authors' conclusions, There is no evidence for the effectiveness of this multifaceted intervention in improving outcomes for all groups of patients or carers. Patients with mild to moderate disability benefit from a reduction in death and disability. Patients and carers do report improved satisfaction with some aspects of service provision.","Graham Ellis, Jonathan Mant, Peter Langhorne, Martin Dennis, Simon Winner (2010).

611,"Background, Weight gain is common for people with schizophrenia and this has serious implications for health and well being., Objectives, To determine the effects of both pharmacological (excluding medication switching) and non pharmacological strategies for reducing or preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia., Search strategy, We searched key databases and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register (April 2006), reference sections within relevant papers, hand searched key journals, and contacted the first author of each relevant study and other experts to collect further information., Selection criteria, We included all clinical randomised controlled trials comparing any pharmacological or non pharmacological intervention for weight gain (diet and exercise counselling) with standard care or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses., Data collection and analysis, We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data from studies. As weight is a continuous outcome measurement, weighted mean differences (WMD) of the change from baseline were calculated. The primary outcome measure was weight loss., Main results, Twenty-three randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Five trials assessed a cognitive/behavioural intervention and eighteen assessed a pharmacological adjunct. In terms of prevention, two cognitive/behavioural trials showed significant treatment effect (mean weight change) at end of treatment (n=104, 2 RCTs, WMD -3.38 kg CI -4.2 to -2.0). Pharmacological adjunct treatments were significant with a modest prevention of weight gain (n=274, 6 RCTs, WMD - 1.16 kg CI -1.9 to -0.4). In terms of treatments for weight loss, we found significantly greater weight reduction in the cognitive behavioural intervention group (n=129, 3 RCTs, WMD -1.69 kg CI -2.8 to -0.6) compared with standard care., Authors' conclusions, Modest weight loss can be achieved with selective pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions. However, interpretation is limited by the small number of studies, small sample size, short study duration and by variability of the interventions themselves, their intensity and duration. Future studies adequately powered, with longer treatment duration and rigorous methodology will be needed in further evaluating the efficacy and safety of weight loss interventions for moderating weight gain. At this stage, there is insufficient evidence to support the general use of pharmacological interventions for weight management in people with schizophrenia.","Guy Faulkner, Tony Cohn, Gary Remington (2009).

612,"Background, Partner notification (PN) is the process whereby sexual partners of an index patient are informed of their exposure to a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the need to obtain treatment. For the person (index patient) with a curable STI, PN aims to eradicate infection and prevent re-infection. For sexual partners, PN aims to identify and treat undiagnosed STIs. At the level of sexual networks and populations, the aim of PN is to interrupt chains of STI transmission. For people with viral STI, PN aims to identify undiagnosed infections, which can facilitate access for their sexual partners to treatment and help prevent transmission., Objectives, To assess the effects of different PN strategies in people with STI, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection., Search methods, We searched electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE) without language restrictions. We scanned reference lists of potential studies and previous reviews and contacted experts in the field. We searched three trial registries. We conducted the most recent search on 31 August 2012., Selection criteria, Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing two or more PN strategies. Four main PN strategies were included: patient referral, expedited partner therapy, provider referral and contract referral. Patient referral means that the patient notifies their sexual partners, either with (enhanced patient referral) or without (simple patient referral) additional verbal or written support. In expedited partner therapy, the patient delivers medication or a prescription for medication to their partner(s) without the need for a medical examination of the partner. In provider referral, health service personnel notify the partners. In contract referral, the index patient is encouraged to notify partner, with the understanding that the partners will be contacted if they do not visit the health service by a certain date., Data collection and analysis, We analysed data according to paired partner referral strategies. We organised the comparisons first according to four main PN strategies (1. enhanced patient referral, 2. expedited partner therapy, 3. contract referral, 4. provider referral). We compared each main strategy with simple patient referral and then with each other, if trials were available. For continuous outcome measures, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We performed meta-analyses where appropriate. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome re-infection rate of the index patient by excluding studies with attrition of greater than 20%. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information., Main results, We included 26 trials (17,578 participants, 9015 women and 8563 men). Five trials were conducted in developing countries. Only two trials were conducted among HIV-positive patients. There was potential for selection bias, owing to the methods of allocation used and of performance bias, owing to the lack of blinding in most included studies. Seven trials had attrition of greater than 20%, increasing the risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, The evidence assessed in this review does not identify a single optimal strategy for PN for any particular STI. When combining trials of STI causing urethritis or cervicitis, expedited partner therapy was more successful than simple patient referral for preventing re-infection of the index patient but was not superior to enhanced patient referral. Expedited partner therapy interventions should include all components that were part of the trial intervention package. There was insufficient evidence to determine the most effective components of an enhanced patient referral strategy. There are too few trials to allow consistent conclusions about the relative effects of provider, contract o","Adel Ferreira, Taryn Young, Catherine Mathews, Moleen Zunza, Nicola Low (2013).

613,"Background, Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is characterised by distorted body image and deliberately maintained low body weight. The long term prognosis is often poor, with severe medical, developmental and psychosocial complications, high rates of relapse and mortality. Different variants of family therapy have been commonly used for intervention., Objectives, To evaluate the efficacy of family therapy compared with standard treatment and other treatments., Search strategy, The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neuroses Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) was searched until August 2008; MEDLINE, PsycInfo and EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched up to January 2008. A conference abstract book and included studies reference lists were searched. All lead authors of included studies were also contacted., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTS) of interventions described as 'family therapy' compared to any other intervention or other types of family therapy were eligible for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors selected the studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We used a random effects meta-analysis. Relative risk was used to summarise dichotomous outcomes and both the standardised mean difference and mean difference to summarise continuous measures., Main results, 13 trials were included, the majority investigating family based therapy, or variants. Reporting of trial conduct was generally inadequate. The full extent of the risk of bias is unclear., Authors' conclusions, There is some evidence to suggest that family therapy may be effective compared to treatment as usual in the short term. However, this is based on few trials that included only a small number of participants, all of which had issues regarding potential bias. There is insufficient evidence to be able to determine whether family therapy offers any advantage over other types of psychological interventions, or whether one type of family therapy is more effective than another. The field would benefit from a large, well-conducted trial.","Caroline A. Fisher, Sarah E. Hetrick, Nola Rushford (2010).

614,"Background, Many studies document a robust and consistent relationship between gang membership and elevated delinquency, with gang members disproportionately involved in crime compared to non-gang peers. Research also indicates that both delinquent youth and youth who join gangs often show a wide range of deficient or distorted social-cognitive processes compared to non-delinquent peers. Cognitive-behavioural interventions are designed to address cognitive deficits in order to reduce maladaptive or dysfunctional behaviour, and studies have documented their positive impact on a number of behavioural and psychological disorders among children and youth., Objectives, To determine the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural interventions for preventing youth gang involvement for children and young people (ages 7-16)., Search strategy, Electronic searches of Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, ASSIA, CINAHL, CJA, Dissertations Abstracts A, EMBASE, ERIC, IBSS, LILACs, LexisNexis Butterworths, NCJR Service Abstracts Database, PsycINFO, and Sociological Abstracts, to April 2007. Reviewers contacted relevant organisations, individuals, and list-servs and searched pertinent websites and reference lists., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials of interventions with a cognitive-behavioural intervention as the majority component, delivered to youth and children aged 7-16 not involved in a gang., Data collection and analysis, Searching yielded 2,284 unduplicated citations, 2,271 of which were excluded as irrelevant based on title and abstract. One was excluded following personal communication with investigators. One citation, of a large randomised prevention trial, awaits assessment; personal communication with study authors yielded unpublished reports addressing gang outcomes, but insufficient detail precluded determining inclusion status. Seven remaining reports were excluded as irrelevant because they were narrative reviews or descriptions of programs without evaluations, did not address a gang prevention programme, or did not address a gang prevention program that included a cognitive-behavioural intervention. The remaining four full-text reports excluded because of study design, leading to 0 included studies., Main results, No randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials were identified., Authors' conclusions, No evidence from randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials exists regarding the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural interventions for gang prevention. Four evaluations of Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) have been conducted, two of which were part of a US national evaluation, but all were excluded based on study design. Reviewers conclude there is an urgent need for rigorous primary evaluations of cognitive-behavioural interventions for gang prevention to develop this research field and guide future gang prevention programmes and policies.","Herrick Fisher, Frances Gardner, Paul Montgomery (2009).

615,"Background, Scabies, caused by Sarcoptes scabiei variety hominis or the human itch mite, is a common parasitic infection. While anyone can become infected, it causes significant morbidity in immunocompromised hosts and it spreads easily between human hosts where there is overcrowding or poor sanitation. The most common symptom reported is itch which is worse at night. As the symptoms are attributed to an allergic reaction to the mite, symptoms usually develop between four to six weeks after primary infection. Therefore, people may be infected for some time prior to developing symptoms. During this time, while asymptomatic, they may spread infection to others they are in close contact with. Consequently, it is usually recommended that when an index case is being treated, others who have been in close contact with the index case should also be provided with treatment., Objectives, To assess the effects of prophylactic interventions for contacts of people with scabies to prevent infestation in the contacts., Search methods, We searched electronic databases (Cochrane Occupational Safety and Health Review Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library)MEDLINE (Ovid), Pubmed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, OpenGrey and WHO ICTRP) up to November 2013., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster RCTs which compared prophylactic interventions which were given to contacts of index cases with scabies infestation. Interventions could be compared to each other, or to placebo or to no treatment. Both drug treatments and non-drug treatments were acceptable., Data collection and analysis, Two authors intended to extract dichotomous data (developed infection or did not develop infection) for the effects of interventions and report this as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. We intended to report any adverse outcomes similarly., Main results, We did not include any trials in this review. Out of 29 potentially-relevant studies, we excluded 16 RCTs as the data for the contacts were either not reported or were reported only in combination with the outcomes for the index cases. We excluded a further 11 studies as they were not RCTs. We also excluded one study as not all subjects were examined at baseline and follow-up, and another as it was a case study., Authors' conclusions, The effects of providing prophylactic treatments for contacts of people with scabies to prevent infestation are unknown. We need well-designed RCTs of the use of prophylactic measures to prevent the transmission of scabies conducted with people who had the opportunity for prolonged skin contact with an index case, such as family members, healthcare workers or residential care personnel, within the previous six weeks.","Deirdre FitzGerald, Rachel J.

616,"Background, Stroke is a worldwide problem and is a leading cause of adult disability, resulting in dependency in activities of daily living (ADL) for around half of stroke survivors. It is estimated that up to 25% of all care home residents in the USA and in the UK have had a stroke. Stroke survivors who reside in care homes are likely to be more physically and cognitively impaired and therefore more dependent than those able to remain in their own home. Overall, 75% of care home residents are classified as severely disabled, and those with stroke are likely to have high levels of immobility, incontinence and confusion, as well as additional co-morbidities. It is not known whether this clinically complex population could benefit from occupational therapy in the same way as community-dwelling stroke survivors. The care home population with stroke differs from the general stroke population living at home, and a review was needed to examine the benefits of occupational therapy provided to this specific group. This review therefore focused on occupational therapy interventions for ADL for stroke survivors residing in care homes., Objectives, To measure the effects of occupational therapy interventions (provided directly by an occupational therapist or under the supervision of an occupational therapist) targeted at improving, restoring and maintaining independence in ADL among stroke survivors residing in long-term institutional care, termed collectively as 'care homes'. As a secondary objective, we aimed to evaluate occupational therapy interventions for reducing complications such as depression and low mood., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, September 2012), MEDLINE (1948 to September 2012), EMBASE (1980 to September 2012), CINAHL (1982 to September 2012) and 10 additional bibliographic databases and six trials registers. We also handsearched seven journals, checked reference lists and obtained further information from individual trialists., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials investigating the impact of an occupational therapy intervention for care home residents with stroke versus standard care., Data collection and analysis, The lead review author performed all searches. Two review authors then independently assessed all titles and abstracts of studies and selected trials for inclusion, with a third review author resolving any discrepancies. The same two review authors independently extracted data from all included published sources to ensure reliability. Primary outcomes were performance in ADL at the end of scheduled follow-up and death or a poor outcome. Secondary outcomes aimed to reflect the domains targeted by an occupational therapy intervention., Main results, We included in the review one study involving 118 participants. We found one ongoing study that also met the inclusion criteria for the review, but the data were not yet available., Authors' conclusions, We found insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of occupational therapy interventions for improving, restoring or maintaining independence in ADL for stroke survivors residing in care homes. The effectiveness of occupational therapy for the population of stroke survivors residing in care homes remains unclear, and further research in this area is warranted.","Joanna C.

617,"Background, Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) continues to play a critical role in HIV prevention, care and treatment. In recent years, different modalities of VCT have been implemented, including clinic-, mobile- and home-based testing and counseling. This review assesses the effects of all VCT types on HIV-related risk behaviors in low- and middle-income countries., Objectives, The primary objective of this review is to systematically review the literature examining the efficacy of VCT in changing HIV-related risk behaviors in developing countries across various populations., Search methods, Five electronic databases - PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) - were searched using predetermined key words and phrases. Hand-searching was conducted in four key journals including AIDS, AIDS and Behavior, AIDS Education and Prevention, and AIDS Care; the tables of contents of these four journals during the included time period were individually screened for relevant articles. The reference lists of all articles included in the review were screened to identify any additional studies; this process was iterated until no additional articles were found., Selection criteria, To be included in the review, eligible studies had to meet the following inclusion criteria: 1) Take place in a low- or middle-income country as defined by the World Bank, 2) Published in a peer-reviewed journal between January 1, 1990 and July 6, 2010, 3) Involve client-initiated VCT, including pre-test counseling, HIV-testing, and post-test counseling, and 4) Use a pre/post or multi-arm design that compares individuals before and after receiving VCT or individuals who received VCT to those who did not, and 5) Report results pertaining to behavioral, psychological, biological, or social HIV-related outcomes., Data collection and analysis, All citations were initially screened and all relevant citations were independently screened by two reviewers to assess eligibility. For all included studies data were extracted by two team members working independently using a standardized form. Differences were resolved through consensus or discussion with the study coordinator when necessary. Study rigor was assessed using an eight point quality score and through the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Outcomes comparable across studies, including condom use and number of sex partners, were meta-analyzed using random effects models. With respect to both meta-analyses, data were included from multi-arm studies and from pre/post studies if adequate data were provided. Other outcomes, including HIV-incidence, STI incidence/prevalence, and positive and negative life events were synthesized qualitatively. For meta-analysis, all outcomes were converted to the standard metric of the odds ratio. If an outcome could not be converted to an odds ratio, the study was excluded from analysis., Main results, An initial search yielded 2808 citations. After excluding studies failing to meet the inclusion criteria, 19 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Of these studies, two presented duplicate data and were removed. The remaining 17 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 8 studies were meta-analyzed. Twelve studies offered clinic-based VCT, 3 were employment-based, 1 involved mobile VCT, and 1 provided home-based VCT. In meta-analysis, the odds of reporting increased number of sexual partners were reduced when comparing participants who received VCT to those who did not, unadjusted random effects pooled OR= 0.69 (95% CI: 0.53-0.90, p=0.007). When stratified by serostatus, these results only remained significant for those who tested HIV-positive. There was an insignificant increase in the odds of condom use/protected sex among participants who received VCT compared to those who did not, unadjusted random effects pooled OR=1.39 (95% CI: 0.97-1.99, p=0.076).

618,"Background, Complementary therapy has received great interest within the field of dementia treatment and the use of aromatherapy and essential oils is increasing. In a growing population where the majority of patients are treated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, the efficacy of treatment is short term and accompanied by negative side effects. Utilisation of complimentary therapies in dementia care settings presents as one of few options that are attractive to practitioners and families as patients often have reduced insight and ability to verbally communicate adverse reactions. Amongst the most distressing features of dementia are the behavioural and psychological symptoms. Addressing this facet has received particular interest in aromatherapy trials, with a shift in focus from reducing cognitive dysfunction to the reduction of behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia., Objectives, To assess the efficacy of aromatherapy as an intervention for people with dementia., Search methods, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, was searched on 26 November 2012 and 20 January 2013 using the terms: aromatherapy, lemon, lavender, rose, aroma, alternative therapies, complementary therapies, essential oils., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised controlled trials were considered. A minimum length of a trial and requirements for follow-up were not included, and participants in included studies had a diagnosis of dementia of any type and severity. The review considered all trials using fragrance from plants defined as aromatherapy as an intervention with people with dementia and all relevant outcomes were considered., Data collection and analysis, Titles and abstracts extracted by the searches were screened for their eligibility for potential inclusion in the review. For Burns 2011, continuous outcomes were estimated as the mean difference between groups and its 95% confidence interval using a fixed-effect model. For Ballard 2002, analysis of co-variance was used for all outcomes, with the nursing home being treated as a random effect., Main results, Seven studies with 428 participants were included in this review; only two of these had published usable results. Individual patient data were obtained from one trial (Ballard 2002) and additional analyses performed. The additional analyses conducted using individual patient data from Ballard 2002 revealed a statistically significant treatment effect in favour of the aromatherapy intervention on measures of agitation (n = 71, MD -11.1, 95% CI -19.9 to -2.2) and behavioural symptoms (n = 71, MD -15.8, 95% CI -24.4 to -7.2). Burns 2011, however, found no difference in agitation (n = 63, MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.36 to 1.36), behavioural symptoms (n = 63, MD 2.80, 95% CI -5.84 to 11.44), activities of daily living (n = 63, MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.79 to 0.79) and quality of life (n = 63, MD 19.00, 95% CI -23.12 to 61.12). Burns 2011 and Fu 2013 found no difference in adverse effects (n = 124, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.46) when aromatherapy was compared to placebo., Authors' conclusions, The benefits of aromatherapy for people with dementia are equivocal from the seven trials included in this review. It is important to note there were several methodological difficulties with the included studies. More well-designed, large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed before clear conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of aromatherapy for dementia. Additionally, several issues need to be addressed, such as whether different aromatherapy interventions are comparable and the possibility that outcomes may vary for different types of dementia.","Thorgrimsen Lene Forrester, Nicola Maayan, Martin Orrell, Aimee E.

620,"Background, Little is known about the effectiveness of strategies to enable people to achieve and maintain recommended levels of physical activity., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote physical activity in adults aged 16 years and older, not living in an institution., Search methods, We searched The Cochrane Library (issue 1 2005), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, BIDS ISI, SPORTDISCUS, SIGLE, SCISEARCH (from earliest dates available to December 2004). Reference lists of relevant articles were checked. No language restrictions were applied., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials that compared different interventions to encourage sedentary adults not living in an institution to become physically active. Studies required a minimum of six months follow up from the start of the intervention to the collection of final data and either used an intention-to-treat analysis or, failing that, had no more than 20% loss to follow up., Data collection and analysis, At least two reviewers independently assessed each study quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information where necessary. Standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous measures of self-reported physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness. For studies with dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated., Main results, The effect of interventions on self-reported physical activity (19 studies; 7598 participants) was positive and moderate (pooled SMD random effects model 0.28 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41) as was the effect of interventions (11 studies; 2195 participants) on cardio-respiratory fitness (pooled SMD random effects model 0.52 95% CI 0.14 to 0.90). There was significant heterogeneity in the reported effects as well as heterogeneity in characteristics of the interventions. The heterogeneity in reported effects was reduced in higher quality studies, when physical activity was self-directed with some professional guidance and when there was on-going professional support., Authors' conclusions, Our review suggests that physical activity interventions have a moderate effect on self-reported physical activity, on achieving a predetermined level of physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness. Due to the clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the studies, only limited conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of individual components of the interventions. Future studies should provide greater detail of the components of interventions.","Charles Foster, Melvyn Hillsdon, Margaret Thorogood, Asha Kaur, Thamindu Wedatilake (2013).

621,"Background, Remote and web 2.0 interventions for promoting physical activity (PA) are becoming increasingly popular but their ability to achieve long term changes are unknown., Objectives, To compare the effectiveness of remote and web 2.0 interventions for PA promotion in community dwelling adults (aged 16 years and above) with a control group exposed to placebo or no or minimal intervention., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and some other databases (from earliest dates available to October 2012). Reference lists of relevant articles were checked. No language restrictions were applied., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared remote and web 2.0 PA interventions for community dwelling adults with a placebo or no or minimal intervention control group. We included studies if the principal component of the intervention was delivered using remote or web 2.0 technologies (for example the internet, smart phones) or more traditional methods (for example telephone, mail-outs), or both. To assess behavioural change over time, the included studies had a minimum of 12 months follow-up from the start of the intervention to the final results. We excluded studies that had more than a 20% loss to follow-up if they did not apply an intention-to-treat analysis., Data collection and analysis, At least two authors independently assessed the quality of each study and extracted the data. Non-English language papers were reviewed with the assistance of an interpreter who was an epidemiologist. Study authors were contacted for additional information where necessary. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the continuous measures of self-reported PA and cardio-respiratory fitness. For studies with dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated., Main results, A total of 11 studies recruiting 5862 apparently healthy adults met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies took place in high-income countries. The effect of the interventions on cardiovascular fitness at one year (two studies; 444 participants) was positive and moderate with significant heterogeneity of the observed effects (SMD 0.40; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.76; high quality evidence). The effect of the interventions on self-reported PA at one year (nine studies; 4547 participants) was positive and moderate (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.28; moderate quality evidence) with heterogeneity (I(superscript 2) = 37%) in the observed effects. One study reported positive results at two years (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.32; moderate quality evidence). When studies were stratified by risk of bias, the studies at low risk of bias (eight studies; 3403 participants) had an increased effect (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.40; moderate quality evidence). The most effective interventions applied a tailored approach to the type of PA and used telephone contact to provide feedback and to support changes in PA levels. There was no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events (seven studies; 2892 participants). Risk of bias was assessed as low (eight studies; 3060 participants) or moderate (three studies; 2677 participants). There were no differences in effectiveness between studies using different types of professionals delivering the intervention (for example health professional, exercise specialist). There was no difference in pooled estimates between studies that generated the prescribed PA using an automated computer programme versus a human, nor between studies that used pedometers as part of their intervention compared to studies that did not., Authors' conclusions, We found consistent evidence to support the effectiveness of remote and web 2.0 interventions for promoting PA. These interventions have positive, moderate sized effects on increasing self-reported PA and measured cardio-respiratory fitness, at least at 12 months. The effectiveness of these interventions was supported by moderate and high quality studies. However, there continues to be a paucity of cost effectivenes","Charles Foster, Justin Richards, Margaret Thorogood, Melvyn Hillsdon (2013).

622,"Background, Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health issue because it causes chronic pain, reduces physical function and diminishes quality of life. Ageing of the population and increased global prevalence of obesity are anticipated to dramatically increase the prevalence of knee OA and its associated impairments. No cure for knee OA is known, but exercise therapy is among the dominant non-pharmacological interventions recommended by international guidelines., Objectives, To determine whether land-based therapeutic exercise is beneficial for people with knee OA in terms of reduced joint pain or improved physical function and quality of life., Search methods, Five electronic databases were searched, up until May 2013., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assigning individuals and comparing groups treated with some form of land-based therapeutic exercise (as opposed to exercise conducted in the water) with a non-exercise group or a non-treatment control group., Data collection and analysis, Three teams of two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for each study and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. We conducted analyses on continuous outcomes (pain, physical function and quality of life) immediately after treatment and on dichotomous outcomes (proportion of study withdrawals) at the end of the study; we also conducted analyses on the sustained effects of exercise on pain and function (two to six months, and longer than six months)., Main results, In total, we extracted data from 54 studies. Overall, 19 (20%) studies reported adequate random sequence generation and allocation concealment and adequately accounted for incomplete outcome data; we considered these studies to have an overall low risk of bias. Studies were largely free from selection bias, but research results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias, as only four of the RCTs reported blinding of participants to treatment allocation, and, although most RCTs reported blinded outcome assessment, pain, physical function and quality of life were participant self-reported., Authors' conclusions, High-quality evidence indicates that land-based therapeutic exercise provides short-term benefit that is sustained for at least two to six months after cessation of formal treatment in terms of reduced knee pain, and moderate-quality evidence shows improvement in physical function among people with knee OA. The magnitude of the treatment effect would be considered moderate (immediate) to small (two to six months) but comparable with estimates reported for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Confidence intervals around demonstrated pooled results for pain reduction and improvement in physical function do not exclude a minimal clinically important treatment effect. Since the participants in most trials were aware of their treatment, this may have contributed to their improvement. Despite the lack of blinding we did not downgrade the quality of evidence for risk of performance or detection bias. This reflects our belief that further research in this area is unlikely to change the findings of our review.","Marlene Fransen, Sara McConnell, Alison R.

623,"Background, The World Health Organization and the World Economic Forum have recommended further research to strengthen current knowledge of workplace health programmes, particularly on effectiveness and using simple instruments. A pedometer is one such simple instrument that can be incorporated in workplace interventions., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of pedometer interventions in the workplace for increasing physical activity and improving subsequent health outcomes., Search methods, Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (671 potential papers), MEDLINE (1001), Embase (965), CINAHL (1262), OSH UPDATE databases (75) and Web of Science (1154) from the earliest record to between 30th January and 6th February 2012 yielded 3248 unique records. Reference lists of articles yielded an additional 34 papers. Contact with individuals and organisations did not produce any further records., Selection criteria, We included individual and cluster-randomised controlled trials of workplace health promotion interventions with a pedometer component in employed adults. The primary outcome was physical activity and was part of the eligibility criteria. We considered subsequent health outcomes, including adverse effects, as secondary outcomes., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors undertook the screening of titles and abstracts and the full-text papers independently. Two review authors (RFP and MC) independently completed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We contacted authors to obtain additional data and clarification., Main results, We found four relevant studies providing data for 1809 employees, 60% of whom were allocated to the intervention group. All studies assessed outcomes immediately after the intervention had finished and the intervention duration varied between three to six months. All studies had usual treatment control conditions; however one study's usual treatment was an alternative physical activity programme while the other three had minimally active controls. In general, there was high risk of bias mainly due to lack of blinding, self reported outcome measurement, incomplete outcome data due to attrition, and most of the studies had not published protocols, which increases the likelihood of selective reporting., Authors' conclusions, There was limited and low quality data providing insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of pedometer interventions in the workplace for increasing physical activity and improving subsequent health outcomes.","L.

624,"Background, Repetitive task training (RTT) involves the active practice of task-specific motor activities and is a component of current therapy approaches in stroke rehabilitation., Objectives, Primary objective: To determine if RTT improves upper limb function/reach and lower limb function/balance in adults after stroke., Secondary objectives: 1) To determine the effect of RTT on secondary outcome measures including activities of daily living, global motor function, quality of life/health status and adverse events. 2) To determine the factors that could influence primary and secondary outcome measures, including the effect of 'dose' of task practice; type of task (whole therapy, mixed or single task); timing of the intervention and type of intervention., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (4 March 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5: 1 October 2006 to 24 June 2016); MEDLINE (1 October 2006 to 8 March 2016); Embase (1 October 2006 to 8 March 2016); CINAHL (2006 to 23 June 2016); AMED (2006 to 21 June 2016) and SPORTSDiscus (2006 to 21 June 2016)., Selection criteria, Randomised/quasi-randomised trials in adults after stroke, where the intervention was an active motor sequence performed repetitively within a single training session, aimed towards a clear functional goal., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We determined the quality of evidence within each study and outcome group using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria. We did not assess follow-up outcome data using GRADE. We contacted trial authors for additional information., Main results, We included 33 trials with 36 intervention-control pairs and 1853 participants. The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear due to poor reporting; the evidence has therefore been rated 'moderate' or 'low' when using the GRADE system., Authors' conclusions, There is low- to moderate-quality evidence that RTT improves upper and lower limb function; improvements were sustained up to six months post treatment. Further research should focus on the type and amount of training, including ways of measuring the number of repetitions actually performed by participants. The definition of RTT will need revisiting prior to further updates of this review in order to ensure it remains clinically meaningful and distinguishable from other interventions.","Beverley French, Lois H.

626,"Background, Although low-back pain is usually a self-limiting and benign disease that tends to improve spontaneously over time, a large variety of therapeutic interventions are available for its treatment., Objectives, To assess the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of non-specific low-back pain and dry-needling for myofascial pain syndrome in the low-back region., Search strategy, We updated the searches from 1996 to February 2003 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also searched the Chinese Cochrane Centre database of clinical trials and Japanese databases to February 2003., Selection criteria, Randomized trials of acupuncture (that involves needling) for adults with non-specific (sub)acute or chronic low-back pain, or dry-needling for myofascial pain syndrome in the low-back region., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed methodological quality (using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group) and extracted data. The trials were combined using meta-analyses methods or levels of evidence when the data reported did not allow statistical pooling., Main results, Thirty-five RCTs were included; 20 were published in English, seven in Japanese, five in Chinese and one each in Norwegian, Polish and German. There were only three trials of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. They did not justify firm conclusions, because of small sample sizes and low methodological quality of the studies. For chronic low-back pain there is evidence of pain relief and functional improvement for acupuncture, compared to no treatment or sham therapy. These effects were only observed immediately after the end of the sessions and at short-term follow-up. There is evidence that acupuncture, added to other conventional therapies, relieves pain and improves function better than the conventional therapies alone. However, effects are only small. Dry-needling appears to be a useful adjunct to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. No clear recommendations could be made about the most effective acupuncture technique., Authors' conclusions, The data do not allow firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. For chronic low-back pain, acupuncture is more effective for pain relief and functional improvement than no treatment or sham treatment immediately after treatment and in the short-term only. Acupuncture is not more effective than other conventional and 'alternative' treatments. The data suggest that acupuncture and dry-needling may be useful adjuncts to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. Because most of the studies were of lower methodological quality, there certainly is a further need for higher quality trials in this area.","Andrea D.

627,"Background, Early-onset child conduct problems are common and costly. A large number of studies and some previous reviews have focused on behavioural and cognitive-behavioural group-based parenting interventions, but methodological limitations are commonplace and evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these programmes has been unclear., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural group-based parenting programmes for improving child conduct problems, parental mental health and parenting skills., Search methods, We searched the following databases between 23 and 31 January 2011: CENTRAL (2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to current), EMBASE (1980 to current), CINAHL (1982 to current), PsycINFO (1872 to current), Social Science Citation Index (1956 to current), ASSIA (1987 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to current), Academic Search Premier (1970 to current), Econlit (1969 to current), PEDE (1980 to current), Dissertations and Theses Abstracts (1980 to present), NHS EED (searched 31 January 2011), HEED (searched 31 January 2011), DARE (searched 31 January 2011), HTA (searched 31 January 2011), mRCT (searched 29 January 2011). We searched the following parent training websites on 31 January 2011: Triple P Library, Incredible Years Library and Parent Management Training. We also searched the reference lists of studies and reviews., Selection criteria, We included studies if: (1) they involved randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural group-based parenting interventions for parents of children aged 3 to 12 years with conduct problems, and (2) incorporated an intervention group versus a waiting list, no treatment or standard treatment control group. We only included studies that used at least one standardised instrument to measure child conduct problems., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the trials and the methodological quality of health economic studies. Two authors also independently extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information., Main results, This review includes 13 trials (10 RCTs and three quasi-randomised trials), as well as two economic evaluations based on two of the trials. Overall, there were 1078 participants (646 in the intervention group; 432 in the control group). The results indicate that parent training produced a statistically significant reduction in child conduct problems, whether assessed by parents (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to -0.34) or independently assessed (SMD -0.44; 95% CI -0.77 to -0.11). The intervention led to statistically significant improvements in parental mental health (SMD -0.36; 95% CI -0.52 to -0.20) and positive parenting skills, based on both parent reports (SMD -0.53; 95% CI -0.90 to -0.16) and independent reports (SMD -0.47; 95% CI -0.65 to -0.29). Parent training also produced a statistically significant reduction in negative or harsh parenting practices according to both parent reports (SMD -0.77; 95% CI -0.96 to -0.59) and independent assessments (SMD -0.42; 95% CI -0.67 to -0.16). Moreover, the intervention demonstrated evidence of cost-effectiveness. When compared to a waiting list control group, there was a cost of approximately $2500 (GBP 1712; EUR 2217) per family to bring the average child with clinical levels of conduct problems into the non-clinical range. These costs of programme delivery are modest when compared with the long-term health, social, educational and legal costs associated with childhood conduct problems., Authors' conclusions, Behavioural and cognitive-behavioural group-based parenting interventions are effective and cost-effective for improving child conduct problems, parental mental health and parenting skills in the short term.

630,"Background, Depression is a recurrent illness with high rates of chronicity, treatment-resistance and significant economic impact. There is evidence in the literature that S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), a naturally occurring compound in the human body, has antidepressant efficacy. This product may be an important addition to the armamentarium of antidepressant agents., Objectives, To assess the effects of SAMe in comparison with placebo or antidepressants for the treatment of depression in adults., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialised Register (CCMDCTR Studies and Reference Register), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, international trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization trials portal (ICTRP). We checked reference lists, performed handsearching and contacted experts in the field. The CCMDCTR literature search was last updated on 5 February 2016., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing SAMe with placebo or antidepressants in adults with a diagnosis of major depression., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently performed extraction of data and assessment of risk of bias.

We accepted trials that used SAMe as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and we accepted both oral and parenteral administration. The review involved 934 adults, of both sexes, from inpatient and outpatient settings., Authors' conclusions, Given the absence of high quality evidence and the inability to draw firm conclusions based on that evidence, the use of SAMe for the treatment of depression in adults should be investigated further. Future trials should be in the form of large randomised controlled clinical trials of high methodological quality, with particular attention given to randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding and the handling of missing data.

Elevated cortisol secretion has been positively linked with symptom severity in people with psychosis. Antiglucocorticoid and related drugs that target the HPA axis may be useful for the treatment of individuals with psychosis., Objectives, 1. To determine the effects of antiglucocorticoid and related drugs for the treatment of psychosis, when used alone or in combination with antipsychotic medication., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (August 2009 and April 2014)., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antiglucocorticoid and related drugs compared to placebo (either as a sole treatment or as an adjunct to atypical antipsychotics, typical antipsychotics, antidepressants or other combination treatment) for people with a primary diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, or for individuals at high risk of developing a psychotic disorder., Data collection and analysis, Review authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs for continuous measures. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to create a 'Summary of findings' table., Main results, We included 11 studies that randomly assigned 509 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. No trials were conducted in patients at their first episode of psychotic illness and none included populations at high risk for developing psychosis. Our pre-stated outcomes of interest were mental state, global state, general functioning, adverse effects and quality of life., Authors' conclusions, Good evidence is insufficient to conclude whether antiglucocorticoid drugs provide effective treatment for psychosis. Some global state findings suggest a favourable effect for mifepristone, and a few overall adverse effect findings favour placebo. Additional large randomised controlled trials are needed to justify findings.","Belinda Garner, Lisa J. Phillips, Sarah Bendall, Sarah E. Hetrick (2016).

Further information is available at, Objectives, To establish the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib in the management of OA by systematic review of available evidence., Search strategy, We searched the following databases up to August 2004: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, National Research Register, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment Database. The bibliographies of retrieved papers and content experts were consulted for additional references., Selection criteria, All eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. No unpublished RCTs were included in this edition of the review., Data collection and analysis, Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers. A validated checklist was used to score the quality of the RCTs. Comparable trials were pooled using fixed effects model., Main results, Twenty-six RCTs were included. The comparators were placebo, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, nimesulide, nabumetone, paracetamol, celecoxib and Arthrotec. The evidence reviewed indicated that rofecoxib was more effective than placebo (patient global response RR 1.75 95% CI: 1.35, 2.26) but was associated with more adverse events (RR 1.32 95% CI 1.11, 1.56). There were no consistent differences in efficacy between rofecoxib and any of the active comparators at equivalent doses. Endoscopic studies indicated that compared to ibuprofen 800mg three times a day, rofecoxib caused fewer erosions and gastric ulcers at doses of 25mg and 50mg; the difference in duodenal ulcers was evident only at a dose of 25mg. Rofecoxib 50mg also caused more endoscopically observed ulcers greater than rofecoxib 25mg (RR 2.48 CI: 1.21, 5.11). Very few of the trials reported overall rates of GI adverse events although rofecoxib was found to cause fewer GI events than naproxen. Only one of the nine trials comparing rofecoxib to celecoxib reported on the overall rates of GI events and this was a comparison of the higher recommended dose of rofecoxib with the lower recommended dose of celecoxib. Similarly, the three trials in older hypertensive patients that examined the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib and celecoxib used non-comparable doses; the results of these studies indicated that rofecoxib caused more patients to have oedema and a clinically significant increase in systolic blood pressure. This difference between rofecoxib and celecoxib was not evident in studies conducted in more general populations., Authors' conclusions, Rofecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from global markets in October 2004 therefore there are no implications for practice concerning its use. There remains a number of questions over both the benefits and risks associated with Cox II selective agents and further work is ongoing.","Sarah E. Garner, Dogan Fidan, Ruth R.

Treatment studies have been published, but pressure to establish public policy requires an updated systematic review of cannabis-specific treatments for adults., Objectives, To evaluate the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder (compared with inactive control and/or alternative treatment) delivered to adults in an out-patient or community setting., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulaive Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and reference lists of articles. Searched literature included all articles published before July 2015., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled studies examining a psychosocial intervention for cannabis use disorder (without pharmacological intervention) in comparison with a minimal or inactive treatment control or alternative combinations of psychosocial interventions., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration., Main results, We included 23 randomised controlled trials involving 4045 participants. A total of 15 studies took place in the United States, two in Australia, two in Germany and one each in Switzerland, Canada, Brazil and Ireland. Investigators delivered treatments over approximately seven sessions (range, one to 14) for approximately 12 weeks (range, one to 56)., Authors' conclusions, Included studies were heterogeneous in many aspects, and important questions regarding the most effective duration, intensity and type of intervention were raised and partially resolved. Generalisability of findings was unclear, most notably because of the limited number of localities and homogeneous samples of treatment seekers. The rate of abstinence was low and unstable although comparable with treatments for other substance use. Psychosocial intervention was shown, in comparison with minimal treatment controls, to reduce frequency of use and severity of dependence in a fairly durable manner, at least in the short term. Among the included intervention types, an intensive intervention provided over more than four sessions based on the combination of MET and CBT with abstinence-based incentives was most consistently supported for treatment of cannabis use disorder.","Peter J.

636,"Background, Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic anxiety disorder associated with significant morbidity, social impairment and lower quality of life. Psychological treatments are a frequently used approach for OCD., Objectives, To perform a systematic review of randomised trials of psychological treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder in comparison with treatment as usual., Search strategy, We conducted an electronic search of CCDANCTR-Studies (31/10/2006), and other databases. We searched reference lists, and contacted experts in the field., Selection criteria, Published and unpublished randomised trials of psychological treatments versus treatment as usual for adults with a diagnosis of OCD, Data collection and analysis, Two review authors worked independently throughout the selection of trials and data extraction. Findings were compared and disagreements were discussed with a third review author. Full data extraction, using a standardised data extraction sheet, was performed on all studies included in the review. Results were synthesised using Review Manager software. For dichotomous data, odds ratios were calculated. For continuous data, effect sizes were obtained and the standardised mean difference, with 95% confidence intervals, was calculated. Fixed and random effects models were used to pool the data. Reasons for heterogeneity in studies were explored and sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding trials of lower quality., Main results, Eight studies (11 study comparisons) were identified, all of which compared cognitive and/or behavioural treatments versus treatment as usual control groups. Seven studies (ten comparisons) had usable data for meta-analyses. These studies demonstrated that patients receiving any variant of cognitive behavioural treatment exhibited significantly fewer symptoms post-treatment than those receiving treatment as usual (SMD -1.24, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.87, I[superscript digit two] test for heterogeneity 33.4%). Different types of cognitive and/or behavioural treatments showed similar differences in effect when compared with treatment as usual. The overall treatment effect appeared to be influenced by differences in baseline severity., Authors' conclusions, The findings of this review suggest that psychological treatments derived from cognitive behavioural models are an effective treatment for adult patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. Larger high quality randomised controlled trials involving longer follow up periods are needed, to further test cognitive behavioural treatments, and other psychological approaches, in comparison to each other and control conditions. Future trials should examine the predictors of response to each treatment, and also conduct cost-effectiveness evaluations.","Ileana Gava, Corrado Barbui, Eugenio Aguglia, Davide Carlino, Rachel Churchill, Maurizio De Vanna, Hugh McGuire (2009).

638,"Background, Interventions to improve driving ability after stroke, including driving simulation and retraining visual skills, have limited evaluation of their effectiveness to guide policy and practice., Objectives, To determine whether any intervention, with the specific aim of maximising driving skills, improves the driving performance of people after stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials register (August 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to October 2013), EMBASE (1980 to October 2013), and six additional databases. To identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings, searched trials and research registers, checked reference lists and contacted key researchers in the area., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials and cluster studies of rehabilitation interventions, with the specific aim of maximising driving skills or with an outcome of assessing driving skills in adults after stroke. The primary outcome of interest was the performance in an on-road assessment after training. Secondary outcomes included assessments of vision, cognition and driving behaviour., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials based on pre-defined inclusion criteria, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author moderated disagreements as required. The review authors contacted all investigators to obtain missing information., Main results, We included four trials involving 245 participants in the review. Study sample sizes were generally small, and interventions, controls and outcome measures varied, and thus it was inappropriate to pool studies. Included studies were at a low risk of bias for the majority of domains, with a high/unclear risk of bias identified in the areas of: performance (participants not blinded to allocation), and attrition (incomplete outcome data due to withdrawal) bias. Intervention approaches included the contextual approach of driving simulation and underlying skill development approach, including the retraining of speed of visual processing and visual motor skills. The studies were conducted with people who were relatively young and the timing after stroke was varied. Primary outcome: there was no clear evidence of improved on-road scores immediately after training in any of the four studies, or at six months (mean difference 15 points on the Test Ride for Investigating Practical Fitness to Drive - Belgian version, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 4.56 to 34.56, P value = 0.15, one study, 83 participants). Secondary outcomes: road sign recognition was better in people who underwent training compared with control (mean difference 1.69 points on the Road Sign Recognition Task of the Stroke Driver Screening Assessment, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.87, P value = 0.007, one study, 73 participants). Significant findings were in favour of a simulator-based driving rehabilitation programme (based on one study with 73 participants) but these results should be interpreted with caution as they were based on a single study. Adverse effects were not reported. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effects on vision, other measures of cognition, motor and functional activities, and driving behaviour with the intervention., Authors' conclusions, There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the use of rehabilitation to improve on-road driving skills after stroke. We found limited evidence that the use of a driving simulator may be beneficial in improving visuocognitive abilities, such as road sign recognition that are related to driving. Moreover, we were unable to find any RCTs that evaluated on-road driving lessons as an intervention. At present, it is unclear which impairments that influence driving ability after stroke are amenable to rehabilitation, and whether the contextual or remedial approaches, or a combination of both, are m","Stacey George, Maria Crotty, Isabelle Gelinas, Hannes Devos (2014).

640,"Background, There are many forms of rhinitis. Patients are diagnosed with non-allergic rhinitis when anatomic, infectious and allergic aetiologies have been excluded. The symptoms, including nasal congestion, blockage or obstruction, clear rhinorrhoea, sneezing and, less frequently, nasal itching, can range from mild to debilitating. It affects between 25% and 50% of patients with rhinitis. Several medications are widely used in the treatment of non-allergic rhinitis, including oral and topical nasal antihistamines, intranasal and (rarely) systemic corticosteroids, and anticholinergics. Capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, delivered intranasally, is considered a treatment option for non-allergic rhinitis., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of capsaicin in the management of non-allergic rhinitis compared with no therapy, placebo or other topical or systemic medications, or two or more of the above therapies in combination, or different capsaicin regimens., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 5); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 24 June 2015., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials in adult patients with non-allergic rhinitis comparing intranasal capsaicin with no therapy, placebo or other topical or systemic medications, or their combinations., Data collection and analysis, We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration., Main results, We included four studies (five publications) involving 302 participants with idiopathic non-allergic rhinitis. All the included studies described patients with moderately severe, idiopathic non-allergic rhinitis who were between the ages of 16 and 65. Studies had follow-up periods ranging from four to 38 weeks. The overall risk of bias in the studies was either high or unclear (two studies had overall high risk of bias, while two others had low to unclear risk of bias). Using the GRADE system we assessed the evidence as being of low to moderate quality. A meta-analysis was not possible, given lack of similarity of the reported outcomes., Authors' conclusions, Capsaicin may be an option in the treatment of idiopathic non-allergic rhinitis. It is given in the form of brief treatments, usually during the same day. It appears to have beneficial effects on overall nasal symptoms up to 36 weeks after treatment, based on a few, small studies (low-quality evidence). Well-conducted randomised controlled trials are required to further advance our understanding of the effectiveness of capsaicin in non-allergic rhinitis, especially in patients with non-allergic rhinitis of different types and severity, and using different methods of capsaicin application.","Artur Gevorgyan, Christine Segboer, Rob Gorissen, Cornelis M. van Drunen, Wytske Fokkens (2015).

641,"Background, Antisocial personality disorder (AsPD) is associated with a wide range of disturbance including persistent rule-breaking, criminality, substance use, unemployment, homelessness and relationship difficulties., Objectives, To evaluate the potential beneficial and adverse effects of psychological interventions for people with AsPD., Search strategy, Our search included CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA, BIOSIS and COPAC., Selection criteria, Prospective, controlled trials in which participants with AsPD were randomly allocated to a psychological intervention and a control condition (either treatment as usual, waiting list or no treatment)., Data collection and analysis, Three authors independently selected studies. Two authors independently extracted data. We calculated mean differences, with odds ratios for dichotomous data., Main results, Eleven studies involving 471 participants with AsPD met the inclusion criteria, although data were available from only five studies involving 276 participants with AsPD. Only two studies focused solely on an AsPD sample. Eleven different psychological interventions were examined. Only two studies reported on reconviction, and only one on aggression. Compared to the control condition, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) plus standard maintenance was superior for outpatients with cocaine dependence in one study, but CBT plus treatment as usual was not superior for male outpatients with recent verbal/physical violence in another. Contingency management plus standard maintenance was superior for drug misuse for outpatients with cocaine dependence in one study but not in another, possibly because of differences in the behavioural intervention. However, contingency management was superior in social functioning and counselling session attendance in the latter. A multi-component intervention utilising motivational interviewing principles, the 'Driving Whilst Intoxicated program', plus incarceration was superior to incarceration alone for imprisoned drink-driving offenders., Authors' conclusions, Results suggest that there is insufficient trial evidence to justify using any psychological intervention for adults with AsPD. Disappointingly few of the included studies addressed the primary outcomes defined in this review (aggression, reconviction, global functioning, social functioning, adverse effects). Three interventions (contingency management with standard maintenance; CBT with standard maintenance; 'Driving Whilst Intoxicated program' with incarceration) appeared effective, compared to the control condition, in terms of improvement in at least one outcome in at least one study. Each of these interventions had been originally developed for people with substance misuse problems. Significant improvements were mainly confined to outcomes related to substance misuse. No study reported significant change in any specific antisocial behaviour. Further research is urgently needed for this prevalent and costly condition.","Simon Gibbon, Conor Duggan, Jutta Stoffers, Nick Huband, Birgit A. Vollm, Michael Ferriter, Klaus Lieb (2010).

642,"Background, Printed educational materials are widely used passive dissemination strategies to improve the quality of clinical practice and patient outcomes. Traditionally they are presented in paper formats such as monographs, publication in peer-reviewed journals and clinical guidelines., Objectives, To assess the effect of printed educational materials on the practice of healthcare professionals and patient health outcomes., Search methods, For this update, search strategies were rewritten and substantially changed from those published in the original review in order to refocus the search from published material to printed material and to expand terminology describing printed materials. Given the significant changes, all databases were searched from start date to June 2011. We searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), HealthStar, CINAHL, ERIC, CAB Abstracts, Global Health, and the EPOC Register., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials, controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) analyses that evaluated the impact of printed educational materials (PEMs) on healthcare professionals' practice or patient outcomes, or both. We included three types of comparisons: (1) PEM versus no intervention, (2) PEM versus single intervention, (3) multifaceted intervention where PEM is included versus multifaceted intervention without PEM. There was no language restriction. Any objective measure of professional practice (e.g. number of tests ordered, prescriptions for a particular drug), or patient health outcomes (e.g. blood pressure) were included., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors undertook data extraction independently, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion among the review authors. For analyses, the included studies were grouped according to study design, type of outcome (professional practice or patient outcome, continuous or dichotomous) and type of comparison. For controlled trials, we reported the median effect size for each outcome within each study, the median effect size across outcomes for each study and the median of these effect sizes across studies. Where the data were available, we re-analysed the ITS studies and reported median differences in slope and in level for each outcome, across outcomes for each study, and then across studies. We categorised each PEM according to potential effects modifiers related to the source of the PEMs, the channel used for their delivery, their content, and their format., Main results, The review includes 45 studies: 14 RCTs and 31 ITS studies. Almost all the included studies (44/45) compared the effectiveness of PEM to no intervention. One single study compared paper-based PEM to the same document delivered on CD-ROM. Based on seven RCTs and 54 outcomes, the median absolute risk difference in categorical practice outcomes was 0.02 when PEMs were compared to no intervention (range from 0 to +0.11). Based on three RCTs and eight outcomes, the median improvement in standardised mean difference for continuous profession practice outcomes was 0.13 when PEMs were compared to no intervention (range from -0.16 to +0.36). Only two RCTs and two ITS studies reported patient outcomes. In addition, we re-analysed 54 outcomes from 25 ITS studies, using time series regression and observed statistically significant improvement in level or in slope in 27 outcomes. From the ITS studies, we calculated improvements in professional practice outcomes across studies after PEM dissemination (standardised median change in level = 1.69). From the data gathered, we could not comment on which PEM characteristic influenced their effectiveness., Authors' conclusions, The results of this review suggest that when used alone and compared to no intervention, PEMs may have a small beneficial effect on professional practice outcomes. There is insufficient information to reliably estimate the effect of PEMs on patient outcomes, and clinical significance of the o","Anik Giguere, France Legare, Jeremy Grimshaw, Stephane Turcotte, Michelle Fiander, Agnes Grudniewicz, Sun MakossoKallyth, Fredric M.

643,"Background, Bullying has been identified as one of the leading workplace stressors, with adverse consequences for the individual employee, groups of employees, and whole organisations. Employees who have been bullied have lower levels of job satisfaction, higher levels of anxiety and depression, and are more likely to leave their place of work. Organisations face increased risk of skill depletion and absenteeism, leading to loss of profit, potential legal fees, and tribunal cases. It is unclear to what extent these risks can be addressed through interventions to prevent bullying., Objectives, To explore the effectiveness of workplace interventions to prevent bullying in the workplace., Search methods, We searched: the Cochrane Work Group Trials Register (August 2014); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2016, issue 1); PUBMED (1946 to January 2016); EMBASE (1980 to January 2016); PsycINFO (1967 to January 2016); Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL Plus; 1937 to January 2016); International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS; 1951 to January 2016); Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA; 1987 to January 2016); ABI Global (earliest record to January 2016); Business Source Premier (BSP; earliest record to January 2016); OpenGrey (previously known as OpenSIGLE-System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe; 1980 to December 2014); and reference lists of articles., Selection criteria, Randomised and cluster-randomised controlled trials of employee-directed interventions, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time-series studies of interventions of any type, aimed at preventing bullying in the workplace, targeted at an individual employee, a group of employees, or an organisation., Data collection and analysis, Three authors independently screened and selected studies. We extracted data from included studies on victimisation, perpetration, and absenteeism associated with workplace bullying. We contacted study authors to gather additional data. We used the internal validity items from the Downs and Black quality assessment tool to evaluate included studies' risk of bias., Main results, Five studies met the inclusion criteria. They had altogether 4116 participants. They were underpinned by theory and measured behaviour change in relation to bullying and related absenteeism. The included studies measured the effectiveness of interventions on the number of cases of self-reported bullying either as perpetrator or victim or both. Some studies referred to bullying using common synonyms such as mobbing and incivility and antonyms such as civility., Authors' conclusions, There is very low quality evidence that organisational and individual interventions may prevent bullying behaviours in the workplace. We need large well-designed controlled trials of bullying prevention interventions operating on the levels of society/policy, organisation/employer, job/task and individual/job interface. Future studies should employ validated and reliable outcome measures of bullying and a minimum of 6 months follow-up.","Patricia A. Gillen, Marlene Sinclair, George W. Kernohan, Cecily M.

We used a rate ratio (RaR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare the rate of falls (e.g. falls per person year) between intervention and control groups. For risk of falling, we used a risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI based on the number of people falling (fallers) in each group. We pooled data where appropriate., Main results, We included 159 trials with 79,193 participants. Most trials compared a fall prevention intervention with no intervention or an intervention not expected to reduce falls. The most common interventions tested were exercise as a single intervention (59 trials) and multifactorial programmes (40 trials). Sixty-two per cent (99/159) of trials were at low risk of bias for sequence generation, 60% for attrition bias for falls (66/110), 73% for attrition bias for fallers (96/131), and only 38% (60/159) for allocation concealment., Authors' conclusions, Group and home-based exercise programmes, and home safety interventions reduce rate of falls and risk of falling.","Lesley D.

A wide range of psychological treatments are used to prevent negative outcomes associated with trauma in children and adolescents., Objectives, To assess the effects of psychological therapies in preventing PTSD and associated negative emotional, behavioural and mental health outcomes in children and adolescents who have undergone a traumatic event., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialised Register to 29 May 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. We did not restrict the searches by date, language or publication status., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials of psychological therapies compared with a control such as treatment as usual, waiting list or no treatment, pharmacological therapy or other treatments in children or adolescents who had undergone a traumatic event., Data collection and analysis, Two members of the review group independently extracted data. We calculated odds ratios for binary outcomes and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes using a random-effects model. We analysed data as short-term (up to and including one month after therapy), medium-term (one month to one year after therapy) and long-term (one year or longer)., Main results, Investigators included 6201 participants in the 51 included trials. Twenty studies included only children, two included only preschool children and ten only adolescents; all others included both children and adolescents. Participants were exposed to sexual abuse in 12 trials, to war or community violence in ten, to physical trauma and natural disaster in six each and to interpersonal violence in three; participants had suffered a life-threatening illness and had been physically abused or maltreated in one trial each. Participants in remaining trials were exposed to a range of traumas., Authors' conclusions, The meta-analyses in this review provide some evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in prevention of PTSD and reduction of symptoms in children and adolescents exposed to trauma for up to a month. However, our confidence in these findings is limited by the quality of the included studies and by substantial heterogeneity between studies. Much more evidence is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies for children exposed to trauma, particularly over the longer term. High-quality studies should be conducted to compare these therapies.","Donna Gillies, Licia Maiocchi, Abhishta P. Bhandari, Fiona Taylor, Carl Gray, Louise O'Brien (2016).

647,"Background, Discharge planning is a routine feature of health systems in many countries. The aim of discharge planning is to reduce hospital length of stay and unplanned readmission to hospital, and to improve the co-ordination of services following discharge from hospital.This is the third update of the original review., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of planning the discharge of individual patients moving from hospital., Search methods, We updated the review using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Social Science Citation Index (last searched in October 2015), and the US National Institutes of Health trial register (ClinicalTrials.gov)., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an individualised discharge plan with routine discharge care that was not tailored to individual participants. Participants were hospital inpatients., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently undertook data analysis and quality assessment using a pre-designed data extraction sheet. We grouped studies according to patient groups (elderly medical patients, patients recovering from surgery, and those with a mix of conditions) and by outcome. We performed our statistical analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle, calculating risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data using fixed-effect meta-analysis. When combining outcome data was not possible because of differences in the reporting of outcomes, we summarised the reported data in the text., Main results, We included 30 trials (11,964 participants), including six identified in this update. Twenty-one trials recruited older participants with a medical condition, five recruited participants with a mix of medical and surgical conditions, one recruited participants from a psychiatric hospital, one from both a psychiatric hospital and from a general hospital, and two trials recruited participants admitted to hospital following a fall. Hospital length of stay and readmissions to hospital were reduced for participants admitted to hospital with a medical diagnosis and who were allocated to discharge planning (length of stay MD - 0.73, 95% CI - 1.33 to - 0.12, 12 trials, moderate certainty evidence; readmission rates RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97, 15 trials, moderate certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether discharge planning reduces readmission rates for patients admitted to hospital following a fall (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.01, 2 trials, very low certainty evidence). For elderly patients with a medical condition, there was little or no difference between groups for mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.24, moderate certainty). There was also little evidence regarding mortality for participants recovering from surgery or who had a mix of medical and surgical conditions. Discharge planning may lead to increased satisfaction for patients and healthcare professionals (low certainty evidence, six trials). It is uncertain whether there is any difference in the cost of care when discharge planning is implemented with patients who have a medical condition (very low certainty evidence, five trials)., Authors' conclusions, A discharge plan tailored to the individual patient probably brings about a small reduction in hospital length of stay and reduces the risk of readmission to hospital at three months follow-up for older people with a medical condition. Discharge planning may lead to increased satisfaction with healthcare for patients and professionals. There is little evidence that discharge planning reduces costs to the health service.","C.

We also inspected references within relevant papers., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention where physical activity or exercise was considered to be the main or active ingredient with standard care or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses., Data collection and analysis, We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, quality assessed and data extracted. For binary outcomes we calculated a fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Where possible, the weighted number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), was also calculated. For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred to change data. We synthesised non-skewed data from valid scales using a weighted mean difference (WMD)., Main results, Three randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Trials assessed the effects of exercise on physical and mental health. Overall numbers leaving the trials were similar. Two trials compared exercise to standard care and both found exercise to significantly improve negative symptoms of mental state (Mental Health Inventory Depression:1RCT, n=10, MD 17.50 CI 6.70 to 28.30, PANSS negative: 1RCT, n=10, MD -8.50 CI -11.11 to -5.89). No absolute effects were found for positive symptoms of mental state. Physical health improved significantly in the exercise group compared to those in standard care (1RCT, n=13, MD 79.50 CI 33.82 to 125.18), but no effect on peoples' weight/BMI was apparent. One trial compared exercise with yoga and found that yoga had a better outcome for mental state (PANSS total: 1RCT, n=41, MD 14.95 CI 2.60 to 27.30). The same trial also found those in the yoga group had significantly better quality of life scores (WHOQOL Physical: 1RCT, n=41, MD -9.22 CI -18.86 to 0.42). Adverse effects (AIMS total scores) were, however, similar., Authors' conclusions, Results of this Cochrane review are similar to existing reviews that have examined the health benefits of exercise in this population. Although studies included in this review are small and used various measures of physical and mental health, results indicated that regular exercise programmes are possible in this population, and that they can have healthful effects on both the physical and mental health and well-being of individuals with schizophrenia. Larger randomised studies are required before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.","Paul Gorczynski, Guy Faulkner (2011).

Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all authors., Main results, Nine studies (eight randomised controlled trials) involving 1109 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review., Authors' conclusions, Heavy sedation compared to light sedation does not confer additional benefits in terms of less severe withdrawal or increased rates of commencement on naltrexone maintenance treatment. Given that the adverse events are potentially life-threatening, the value of antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia is not supported. The high cost of anaesthesia-based approaches, both in monetary terms and use of scarce intensive care resources, suggest that this form of treatment should not be pursued.","Linda Gowing, Robert Ali, Jason M.

Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha(subscript 2)-adrenergic agonists (clonidine or lofexidine), symptomatic medications or placebo, and different buprenorphine-based regimens., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane., Main results, We included 27 studies involving 3048 participants. The main comparators were clonidine or lofexidine (14 studies). Six studies compared buprenorphine versus methadone, and seven compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. We assessed 12 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one of seven domains of methodological quality. Six of these studies compared buprenorphine with clonidine or lofexidine and two with methadone; the other four studies compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction., Authors' conclusions, Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine or lofexidine for managing opioid withdrawal in terms of severity of withdrawal, duration of withdrawal treatment, and the likelihood of treatment completion.","Linda Gowing, Robert Ali, Jason M.

652,"Background, Public policy makers and benefit plan managers need to restrain rising pharmaceutical drug costs while preserving access and optimizing health benefits., Objectives, To determine the effects of a pharmaceutical policy restricting the reimbursement of selected medications on drug use, health care utilization, health outcomes and costs (expenditures)., Search methods, We searched the 14 major bibliographic databases and websites (to January 2009)., Selection criteria, Included were studies of pharmaceutical policies that restrict coverage and reimbursement of selected drugs or drug classes, often using additional patient specific information related to health status or need. We included randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series (ITS) analyses, repeated measures studies and controlled before-after studies set in large care systems or jurisdictions., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study limitations. Quantitative re-analysis of time series data was undertaken for studies with sufficient data., Main results, We included 29 ITS analyses (12 were controlled) investigating policies targeting 11 drug classes for restriction. Participants were most often senior citizens or low income adult populations, or both, in publically subsidized or administered pharmaceutical benefit plans. Impact of policies varied by drug class and whether restrictions were implemented or relaxed. When policies targeted gastric-acid suppressant and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug classes, decreased drug use and substantial savings on drugs occurred immediately and for up to two years afterwards, with no increase in the use of other health services (6 studies). Targeting second generation antipsychotic drugs increased treatment discontinuity and the use of other health services without reducing overall drug expenditures (2 studies). Relaxing restrictions for reimbursement of antihypertensives and statins increased appropriate use and decreased overall drug expenditures. Two studies which measured health outcomes directly were inconclusive., Authors' conclusions, Implementing restrictions to coverage and reimbursement of selected medications can decrease third-party drug spending without increasing the use of other health services (6 studies). Relaxing reimbursement rules for drugs used for secondary prevention can also remove barriers to access. Policy design, however, needs to be based on research quantifying the harm and benefit profiles of target and alternative drugs to avoid unwanted health system and health effects. Health impact evaluation should be conducted where drugs are not interchangeable. Impacts on health equity, relating to the fair and just distribution of health benefits in society (sustainable access to publically financed drug benefits for seniors and low income populations, for example), also require explicit measurement.","Carolyn J.

Using specific strengthening exercises as a part of routine practice for chronic neck pain, cervicogenic headache and radiculopathy may be beneficial. Research showed the use of strengthening and endurance exercises for the cervico-scapulothoracic and shoulder may be beneficial in reducing pain and improving function.

661,"Background, Infantile spasms (West's Syndrome) is a syndrome that includes a peculiar type of epileptic seizure-the spasms-and an electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormality often called hypsarrhythmia. Psychomotor retardation is frequently found at follow-up. Approximately two-thirds of affected infants will have a detectable underlying neurological abnormality, but still little is known about the pathophysiological basis for infantile spasms, and treatment remains problematic., Objectives, To compare the effects of single pharmaceutical therapies used to treat infantile spasms in terms of control of the spasms, resolution of the EEG, relapse rates, psychomotor development, subsequent epilepsy, side effects, and mortality., Search methods, To identify published data, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (October 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1980 to March 2003), and the reference lists of all retrieved articles., To identify unpublished data, we searched the ISRCTN Register (-trials.com), corresponded with colleagues and drug companies, and made requests at international conferences., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the administration of drug therapy to patients with infantile spasms., Data collection and analysis, Data collection from all relevant publications was independently undertaken by three review authors (before 2010) or by two review authors using a standard proforma. Analysis included assessment of study quality and a search for sources of heterogeneity., Main results, We found 16 small RCTs (fewer than 100 patients enrolled) and 2 larger RCTs (more than 100 patients enrolled). These 18 studies looked at a total of 916 patients treated with a total of 12 different pharmaceutical agents. Overall methodology of the studies was poor, in part because of ethical dilemmas such as giving placebo injections to children. Two studies showed that placebo was not as good as active treatment in resolving the spasms. The strongest evidence suggested that hormonal treatment (prednisolone or tetracosactide depot) leads to resolution of spasms faster and in more infants than does vigabatrin. Responses without subsequent relapse may be no different. The same study suggests that hormonal treatments might improve the long-term developmental outcome compared with vigabatrin in infants not found to have an underlying cause for their infantile spasms., Authors' conclusions, To date, few well-designed RCTs have considered the treatment of infantile spasms, and the numbers of patients enrolled have been small. In the majority, methodology has been poor, hence it is not clear which treatment is optimal in the treatment of this epilepsy syndrome. Hormonal treatment resolves spasms in more infants than vigabatrin, but this may or may not translate into better long-term outcomes. If prednisolone or vigabatrin is used, high dosage is recommended. Vigabatrin may be the treatment of choice in tuberous sclerosis. Resolution of the EEG features may be important, but this has not been proven. Further research using large studies with robust methodology is required.","Eleanor C. Hancock, John P.

662,"Background, Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem, particularly in older people with osteoporosis. There is considerable variation in the management, including rehabilitation, of these fractures. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2006., Objectives, To examine the effects of rehabilitation interventions in adults with conservatively or surgically treated distal radial fractures., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014; Issue 12), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, OTseeker and other databases, trial registers, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. We did not apply any language restrictions. The date of the last search was 12 January 2015., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs evaluating rehabilitation as part of the management of fractures of the distal radius sustained by adults. Rehabilitation interventions such as active and passive mobilisation exercises, and training for activities of daily living, could be used on their own or in combination, and be applied in various ways by various clinicians., Data collection and analysis, The review authors independently screened and selected trials, and reviewed eligible trials. We contacted study authors for additional information. We did not pool data., Main results, We included 26 trials, involving 1269 mainly female and older patients. With few exceptions, these studies did not include people with serious fracture or treatment-related complications, or older people with comorbidities and poor overall function that would have precluded trial participation or required more intensive treatment. Only four of the 23 comparisons covered by these 26 trials were evaluated by more than one trial. Participants of 15 trials were initially treated conservatively, involving plaster cast immobilisation. Initial treatment was surgery (external fixation or internal fixation) for all participants in five trials. Initial treatment was either surgery or plaster cast alone in six trials. Rehabilitation started during immobilisation in seven trials and after post-immobilisation in the other 19 trials. As well as being small, the majority of the included trials had methodological shortcomings and were at high risk of bias, usually related to lack of blinding, that could affect the validity of their findings. Based on GRADE criteria for assessment quality, we rated the evidence for each of the 23 comparisons as either low or very low quality; both ratings indicate considerable uncertainty in the findings., Authors' conclusions, The available evidence from RCTs is insufficient to establish the relative effectiveness of the various interventions used in the rehabilitation of adults with fractures of the distal radius. Further randomised trials are warranted. However, in order to optimise research effort and engender the large multicentre randomised trials that are required to inform practice, these should be preceded by research that aims to identify priority questions.","H.

664,"Background, Mental health problems are common in primary care and mental health workers (MHWs) are increasingly working in this setting delivering psychological therapy and psychosocial interventions to patients. In addition to treating patients directly, the introduction of on-site MHWs represents an organisational change that may lead to changes in the clinical behaviour of primary care providers (PCPs)., Objectives, To assess the effects of on-site MHWs delivering psychological therapy and psychosocial interventions in primary care on the clinical behaviour of primary care providers (PCPs)., Search methods, The following sources were searched in 1998: the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CounselLit, NPCRDC skill-mix in primary care bibliography, and reference lists of articles. Additional searches were conducted in February 2007 using the following sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library)., Selection criteria, Randomised trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series analyses of MHWs working alongside PCPs in primary care settings. The outcomes included objective measures of PCP behaviours such as consultation rates, prescribing, and referral., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality., Main results, Forty-two studies were included in the review. There was evidence that MHWs caused significant reductions in PCP consultations (standardised mean difference -0.17, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.05), psychotropic prescribing (relative risk 0.67, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.79), prescribing costs (standardised mean difference -0.22, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.07), and rates of mental health referral (relative risk 0.13, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.20) for the patients they were seeing. In controlled before and after studies, the addition of MHWs to a practice did not affect prescribing behaviour towards the wider practice population and there was no consistent pattern to the impact on referrals in the wider patient population., Authors' conclusions, This review provides some evidence that MHWs working in primary care to deliver psychological therapy and psychosocial interventions cause a significant reduction in PCP behaviours such as consultations, prescribing, and referrals to specialist care. However, the changes are modest in magnitude, inconsistent, do not generalise to the wider patient population, and their clinical or economic significance is unclear.","Elaine F. Harkness, Peter J.

665,"Background, Perphenazine is an old phenothiazine antipsychotic with a potency similar to haloperidol. It has been used for many years and is popular in the northern European countries and Japan., Objectives, To examine the clinical effects and safety of perphenazine for those with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses., Search methods, We updated our original search using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (September 2013), references of all included studies and contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of included studies in order to identify further trials., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials that compared perphenazine with other treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses. We excluded trials of depot formulations of perphenazine., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently inspected citations and, where possible, abstracts. We ordered papers, inspected and quality assessed them. We extracted data, again working independently. If loss to follow-up was greater than 50% we considered results as 'prone to bias'. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and for continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD), both with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed quality of data using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluationtool) and assessed risk of bias for included studies., Main results, Thirty-one studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with a total of 4662 participants (of which 4522 were receiving the drugs relevant to our comparison) and presented data that could be used for at least one comparison. The trial centres were located in Europe (especially Scandinavia), Japan and Northern America., Authors' conclusions, Although perphenazine has been used in randomised trials for more than 50 years, incomplete reporting and the variety of comparators used make it impossible to draw clear conclusions. All data for the main outcomes in this review were of very low quality evidence. At best we can say that perphenazine showed similar effects and adverse events as several of the other antipsychotic drugs. Since perphenazine is a relatively inexpensive and frequently used compound, further trials are justified to clarify the properties of this classical antipsychotic drug.","Benno Hartung, Stephanie Sampson, Stefan Leucht (2015).

666,"Background, Self-harm (SH; intentional self-poisoning or self-injury) is common, often repeated, and associated with suicide. This is an update of a broader Cochrane review first published in 1998, previously updated in 1999, and now split into three separate reviews. This review focuses on psychosocial interventions in adults who engage in self-harm., Objectives, To assess the effects of specific psychosocial treatments versus treatment as usual, enhanced usual care or other forms of psychological therapy, in adults following SH., Search methods, The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials coordinator searched the CCDAN Clinical Trials Register (to 29 April 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date)., Selection criteria, We included RCTs comparing psychosocial treatments with treatment as usual (TAU), enhanced usual care (EUC) or alternative treatments in adults with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services., Data collection and analysis, We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures., Main results, We included 55 trials, with a total of 17,699 participants. Eighteen trials investigated cognitive-behavioural-based psychotherapy (CBT-based psychotherapy; comprising cognitive-behavioural, problem-solving therapy or both). Nine investigated interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable personality disorder, comprising emotion-regulation group-based psychotherapy, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Four investigated case management, and 11 examined remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, telephone contact). Most other interventions were evaluated in only single small trials of moderate to very low quality., Authors' conclusions, CBT-based psychological therapy can result in fewer individuals repeating SH; however, the quality of this evidence, assessed using GRADE criteria, ranged between moderate and low. Dialectical behaviour therapy for people with multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder may lead to a reduction in frequency of SH, but this finding is based on low quality evidence. Case management and remote contact interventions did not appear to have any benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. Other therapeutic approaches were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to these interventions is inconclusive.","Keith Hawton, Katrina G.

667,"Background, Anorexia nervosa is a disorder with high morbidity and significant mortality. It is most common in young adult women, in whom the incidence may be increasing. The focus of treatment has moved to an outpatient setting, and a number of differing psychological therapies are presently used in treatment. This is an update of a Cochrane review which was last published in 2008., Objectives, To assess the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa in adults or older adolescents treated in an outpatient setting., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) (16 July 2014). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We screened reference lists of all included studies and sent letters to identified, notable researchers requesting information on unpublished or ongoing studies., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials of one or more individual outpatient psychological therapies for adults with anorexia nervosa, as defined by DSM-5 or similar international criteria., Data collection and analysis, We selected a range of outcome variables, including physical state, severity of eating disorder attitudes and beliefs, interpersonal function, and general psychiatric symptom severity. Continuous outcome data comparisons used the mean or standardised mean difference (MD or SMD), and binary outcome comparisons used the risk ratio (RR). Two review authors (PH and AC or ST) extracted data independently., Main results, We identified 10 trials from the search, with a total of 599 anorexia nervosa participants, and included them in the review. Seven had been identified in the previous versions of this review and we now include three new trials. We now deem one previously identified ongoing trial to be ineligible, and six ongoing trials are new for this update. Two of the 10 trials included children. Trials tested diverse psychological therapies and comparability was poor. Risks of bias were mostly evident through lack of blinded outcome assessments (in 60% of studies) and incomplete data reporting (attrition bias)., Authors' conclusions, There was a suggestion in one trial that focal psychodynamic therapy might be superior to TAU, but this is in the context of TAU performing poorly. An alternative control condition of dietary advice alone appeared to be unacceptable, but again this is based on just one trial. Owing to the risk of bias and limitations of studies, notably small sample sizes, we can draw no specific conclusions about the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa in adults or older adolescents. Larger RCTs of longer treatment duration and follow-up are needed.","Phillipa J. Hay, Angelica M. Claudino, Stephen Touyz, Ghada Abd Elbaky (2015).

668,"Background, Exercise therapy is widely used as an intervention in low-back pain., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise therapy in adult non-specific acute, subacute and chronic low-back pain versus no treatment and other conservative treatments., Search strategy, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL databases to October 2004; citation searches and bibliographic reviews of previous systematic reviews., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials evaluating exercise therapy for adult non-specific low-back pain and measuring pain, function, return-to-work/absenteeism, and/or global improvement outcomes., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data on study characteristics, quality, and outcomes at short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up., Main results, Sixty-one randomized controlled trials (6390 participants) met inclusion criteria: acute (11), subacute (6) and chronic (43) low-back pain (1 unclear). Evidence was found of effectiveness in chronic populations relative to comparisons at all follow-up periods; pooled mean improvement was 7.3 points (95% CI, 3.7 to 10.9) for pain (out of 100), 2.5 points (1.0 to 3.9) for function (out of 100) at earliest follow-up. In studies investigating patients (i.e. presenting to healthcare providers) mean improvement was 13.3 points (5.5 to 21.1) for pain, 6.9 (2.2 to 11.7) for function, representing significantly greater improvement over studies where participants included those recruited from a general population (e.g. with advertisements). There is some evidence of effectiveness of graded-activity exercise program in subacute low-back pain in occupational settings, though the evidence for other types of exercise therapy in other populations is inconsistent. There was evidence of equal effectiveness relative to comparisons in acute populations [pain: 0.03 points (95% CI, -1.3 to 1.4)]., Authors' conclusions, Exercise therapy appears to be slightly effective at decreasing pain and improving function in adults with chronic low-back pain, particularly in healthcare populations. In subacute low-back pain there is some evidence that a graded activity program improves absenteeism outcomes, though evidence for other types of exercise is unclear. In acute low-back pain, exercise therapy is as effective as either no treatment or other conservative treatments.","Jill Hayden, Maurits W. van Tulder, Antti Malmivaara, Bart W. Koes (2011).

669,"Background, In many countries, national, regional and local inter- and intra-agency collaborations have been introduced to improve health outcomes. Evidence is needed on the effectiveness of locally developed partnerships which target changes in health outcomes and behaviours., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of interagency collaboration between local health and local government agencies on health outcomes in any population or age group., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, AMED, ASSIA, CENTRAL, CINAHL, DoPHER, EMBASE, ERIC, HMIC, IBSS, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, OpenGrey, PsycINFO, Rehabdata, Social Care Online, Social Services Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, TRoPHI and Web of Science from 1966 through to January 2012. 'Snowballing' methods were used, including expert contact, citation tracking, website searching and reference list follow-up., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) where the study reported individual health outcomes arising from interagency collaboration between health and local government agencies compared to standard care. Studies were selected independently in duplicate, with no restriction on population subgroup or disease., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently conducted data extraction and assessed risk of bias for each study., Main results, Sixteen studies were identified (28,212 participants). Only two were considered to be at low risk of bias. Eleven studies contributed data to the meta-analyses but a narrative synthesis was undertaken for all 16 studies. Six studies examined mental health initiatives, of which one showed health benefit, four showed modest improvement in one or more of the outcomes measured but no clear overall health gain, and one showed no evidence of health gain. Four studies considered lifestyle improvements, of which one showed some limited short-term improvements, two failed to show health gains for the intervention population, and one showed more unhealthy lifestyle behaviours persisting in the intervention population. Three studies considered chronic disease management and all failed to demonstrate health gains. Three studies considered environmental improvements and adjustments, of which two showed some health improvements and one did not., Authors' conclusions, Collaboration between local health and local government is commonly considered best practice. However, the review did not identify any reliable evidence that interagency collaboration, compared to standard services, necessarily leads to health improvement. A few studies identified component benefits but these were not reflected in overall outcome scores and could have resulted from the use of significant additional resources. Although agencies appear enthusiastic about collaboration, difficulties in the primary studies and incomplete implementation of initiatives have prevented the development of a strong evidence base. If these weaknesses are addressed in future studies (for example by providing greater detail on the implementation of programmes; using more robust designs, integrated process evaluations to show how well the partners of the collaboration worked together, and measurement of health outcomes) it could provide a better understanding of what might work and why. It is possible that local collaborative partnerships delivering environmental Interventions may result in health gain but the evidence base for this is very limited.","Sara L. Hayes, Mala K.

670,"Background, This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Pharmacologic treatment for memory disorder in multiple sclerosis' (first published in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 10)., Objectives, To assess the absolute and comparative efficacy, tolerability and safety of pharmacological treatments for memory disorder in adults with MS., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Trials Register (24 July 2013), PsycINFO (January 1980 to 26 June 2013) and CBMdisc (1978 to 24 June 2013), and checked reference lists of identified articles, searched some relevant journals manually, registers of clinical trials and published abstracts of conference proceedings., Selection criteria, All double-blind, randomised controlled parallel trials on pharmacological treatment versus placebo or one or more pharmacological treatments in adults with MS who had at least mild memory impairment (at 0.5 standard deviations below age- and sex-based normative data on a validated memory scale). We placed no restrictions regarding dose, route of administration and frequency; however, we only included trials with an administration duration of 12 weeks or greater., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We discussed disagreements and resolved them by consensus among review authors. We contacted principal investigators of included studies for additional data or confirmation., Main results, We included seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 625 people mostly with relapsing-remitting, secondary-progressive and primary-progressive MS, evaluating the absolute efficacy of donepezil, ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine versus placebo in improving memory performance with diverse assessment scales. Overall, clinical and methodological heterogeneities existed across these studies. Moreover, most of them had methodological limitations on non-specific selections of targeted sample, non-matched variables at baseline or incomplete outcome data (high attrition bias). Only the two studies on donepezil had clinical and methodological homogeneity and relatively low risks for bias. One RCT evaluating estriol versus placebo is currently ongoing., Authors' conclusions, We found no convincing evidence to support the efficacy of pharmacological symptomatic treatment for MS-associated memory disorder because most of available RCTs had a limited quality. Whether pharmacological treatment is effective for memory disorder in patients with MS remains inconclusive. However, there is moderate-quality evidence that donepezil 10 mg daily was not effective in improving memory in MS patients with mild memory impairment, but had a good tolerability. Adverse events such as nausea, diarrhoea and abnormal dreams were not frequent but were associated with treatment. Ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine were safe and well tolerated and no serious adverse effects were reported. Future large-scale RCTs with higher methodological quality are needed.","Dian He, Yun Zhang, Shuai Dong, Dongfeng Wang, Xiangdong Gao, Hongyu Zhou (2013).

671,"Background, Morita therapy was founded in 1919 by Shoma Morita (1874-1938). The therapy involves a behavioural structured program to encourage an outward perspective on life and increased social functioning., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of Morita therapy for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register, the Chongqing VIP Database, and the Wanfang Database (July 2008) for all relevant references. The first author of each included study was also contacted., Selection criteria, We included all randomised clinical trials comparing Morita therapy with any other treatment., Data collection and analysis, We reliably selected studies and extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random-effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD)., Main results, We found 12 small, studies of medium-poor quality (total n=1123). The standard care versus Morita therapy comparison (total n=761 people) had very low attrition (<2%, 10 RCTs, RR 1.01 CI 0.4 to 2.8). Mental state did tend to improve with Morita therapy (n=76, 1 RCT, number of >25-30% decline in BPRS, RR 0.36 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 5 CI 4 to 25). For negative symptoms data were inconsistent, with data from four short-term trials favouring Morita therapy (n=323, WMD average endpoint SANS -12.94 CI -21.6 to -4.3), but heterogeneity was considerable (I(superscript 2) =97%). In medium-term studies, negative symptoms were favoured by Morita therapy (n=44, 1 RCT, RR >25% decline SANS 0.25 CI 0.1 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 2 to 8). Morita therapy plus standard treatment did significantly improve the activities of daily living compared with standard treatment alone (n=104, 1 RCT, WMD -4.1 average endpoint ADL CI -7.7 to -0.6). Compared with a rehabilitation programme Morita therapy did not promote attrition (n=302, 2 RCTs, RR leaving early 1.00 CI 0.5 to 2.1). In two very similar studies Morita therapy showed better effect on mental state with lower BPRS score (n=278, 2 RCTs, WMD average endpoint BPRS -6.95 CI -9.3 to -4.6, I(superscript 2) =0%), insight score (n=278, 2 RCTs, WMD average endpoint clinical judgement score -1.11 CI -1.3 to -0.9, I(superscript 2) = 0%) and social functioning (n=278, WMD average endpoint IPROS -18.14 CI -21.3 to -15.0, I(superscript 2) =0%)., Authors' conclusions, Morita therapy for schizophrenia remains an experimental intervention. New trials are justified and specific plans for the design of future studies are outlined.","Yanling He, Chunbo Li (2012).

672,"Background, Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system affecting an estimated 1.3 million people worldwide. It is characterised by a variety of disabling symptoms of which excessive fatigue is the most frequent. Fatigue is often reported as the most invalidating symptom in people with MS. Various mechanisms directly and indirectly related to the disease and physical inactivity have been proposed to contribute to the degree of fatigue. Exercise therapy can induce physiological and psychological changes that may counter these mechanisms and reduce fatigue in MS., Objectives, To determine the effectiveness and safety of exercise therapy compared to a no-exercise control condition or another intervention on fatigue, measured with self-reported questionnaires, of people with MS., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Trials Specialised Register, which, among other sources, contains trials from: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (from 1966 to October 2014), EMBASE (from 1974 to October 2014), CINAHL (from 1981 to October 2014), LILACS (from 1982 to October 2014), PEDro (from 1999 to October 2014), and Clinical trials registries (October 2014). Two review authors independently screened the reference lists of identified trials and related reviews., Selection criteria, We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of exercise therapy compared to no exercise therapy or other interventions for adults with MS that included subjective fatigue as an outcome. In these trials, fatigue should have been measured using questionnaires that primarily assessed fatigue or sub-scales of questionnaires that measured fatigue or sub-scales of questionnaires not primarily designed for the assessment of fatigue but explicitly used as such., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected the articles, extracted data, and determined methodological quality of the included trials. Methodological quality was determined by means of the Cochrane 'risk of bias' tool and the PEDro scale. The combined body of evidence was summarised using the GRADE approach. The results were aggregated using meta-analysis for those trials that provided sufficient data to do so., Main results, Forty-five trials, studying 69 exercise interventions, were eligible for this review, including 2250 people with MS. The prescribed exercise interventions were categorised as endurance training (23 interventions), muscle power training (nine interventions), task-oriented training (five interventions), mixed training (15 interventions), or 'other' (e.g. yoga; 17 interventions). Thirty-six included trials (1603 participants) provided sufficient data on the outcome of fatigue for meta-analysis. In general, exercise interventions were studied in mostly participants with the relapsing-remitting MS phenotype, and with an Expanded Disability Status Scale less than 6.0. Based on 26 trials that used a non-exercise control, we found a significant effect on fatigue in favour of exercise therapy (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.73 to -0.33; P value < 0.01). However, there was significant heterogeneity between trials (I(superscript 2) > 58%). The mean methodological quality, as well as the combined body of evidence, was moderate. When considering the different types of exercise therapy, we found a significant effect on fatigue in favour of exercise therapy compared to no exercise for endurance training (SMD(subscript fixed effect) -0.43, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.17; P value < 0.01), mixed training (SMD(subscript random effect) -0.73, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.23; P value < 0.01), and 'other' training (SMD(subscript fixed effect) -0.54, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.29; P value < 0.01). Across all studies, one fall was reported.

674,"Background, Epilepsy is a common neurological condition which affects between 0.5% and 1% of the population. Approximately 30% of people with epilepsy do not respond to treatment with currently available drugs. The majority of these people have partial epilepsy. Vigabatrin is an antiepileptic drug licensed for use in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. No major side effects associated with the use of vigabatrin were detected by initial randomised controlled trials of the drug. However, longer-term observational studies have subsequently identified that its use is associated with asymptomatic visual field constriction., Objectives, The objective of this review was to synthesise evidence from short-term, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of vigabatrin. We summarised the effects of vigabatrin on seizures and short-term side effects when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. A review of longer-term observational studies and estimates of proportions of patients developing visual field constrictions is currently being undertaken and results will be cited in this review in due course., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (12 October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1946 to October week 1, 2012) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted the manufacturers of vigabatrin (Hoechst Marion Roussel)., Selection criteria, We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fully published trials of vigabatrin in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat (ITT). Outcomes evaluated included 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, treatment withdrawal and side effects observable in the short term. Results are presented on the risk ratio (RR) scale with 95% or 99% confidence intervals (CI)., Main results, Eleven suitable trials that tested vigabatrin doses between 1000 mg and 6000 mg were identified and included in the analysis. There were 982 observations on 747 patients in the primary ITT analysis of treatment efficacy. Patients treated with vigabatrin were significantly more likely to obtain a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared with those treated with placebo (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.87 to 3.57). Those treated with vigabatrin were also significantly more likely to have treatment withdrawn (RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.88), and were more likely to experience a number of side effects, significantly so for fatigue or drowsiness. There was some evidence of small study effect bias, with smaller studies tending to report greater estimates of RR than larger studies. It is possible, therefore, that the actual RR of obtaining 50% reduction in seizure frequency is less than that obtained by a meta-analysis of fully published studies., Authors' conclusions, This review of randomised controlled trials showed that vigabatrin can reduce seizure frequency in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Short-term follow-up of patients showed that some side effects were associated with its use. Further analysis of longer-term observational studies is required to evaluate how likely patients are to develop visual field defects and whether such side effects are associated with dose and duration of drug use.","Karla Hemming, Melissa J.

676,"Background, PTSD is an anxiety disorder related to exposure to a severe psychological trauma. Symptoms include re-experiencing the event, avoidance and arousal as well as distress and impairment resulting from these symptoms., Objectives, To assess whether the combination of psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy provides a more efficacious treatment for PTSD than either of these interventions delivered separately., Search strategy, Searches were conducted on the trial registers kept by the CCDAN group (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) to June 2010. The reference sections of included studies and several conference abstracts were also scanned., Selection criteria, Patients of any age or gender, with chronic or recent onset PTSD arising from any type of event relevant to the diagnostic criteria were included. A combination of any psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy was included and compared to wait list, placebo, standard treatment or either intervention alone. The primary outcome was change in total PTSD symptom severity. Other outcomes included changes in functioning, depression and anxiety symptoms, suicide attempts, substance use, withdrawal and cost., Data collection and analysis, Two or three review authors independently selected trials, assessed their 'risk of bias' and extracted trial and outcome data. We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis. The relative risk was used to summarise dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference and standardised mean difference were used to summarise continuous measures., Main results, Four trials were eligible for inclusion, one of these trials (n =24) was on children and adolescents. All used an SSRI and prolonged exposure or a cognitive behavioural intervention. Two trials compared combination treatment with pharmacological treatment and two compared combination treatment with psychological treatment. Only two trials reported a total PTSD symptom score and these data could not be combined. There was no strong evidence to show if there were differences between the group receiving combined interventions compared to the group receiving psychological therapy (mean difference 2.44, 95% CI -2.87, 7.35 one study, n=65) or pharmacotherapy (mean difference -4.70, 95% CI -10.84 to 1.44; one study, n = 25). Trialists reported no significant differences between combination and single intervention groups in the other two studies. There were very little data reported for other outcomes, and in no case were significant differences reported., Authors' conclusions, There is not enough evidence available to support or refute the effectiveness of combined psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy compared to either of these interventions alone. Further large randomised controlled trials are urgently required.","Sarah E. Hetrick, Rosemary Purcell, Belinda Garner, Ruth Parslow (2010).

677,"Background, As international healthcare policy has moved away from treating people with severe mental illness in large inpatient psychiatric institutions, beds for people with acute psychiatric disorders are being established in specialised psychiatric units in general hospitals. In developing countries, however, limited resources mean that it is not always possible to provide discrete psychiatric units, either in general hospitals or in the community. An alternative model of admission, used in the Caribbean, is to treat the person with acute psychosis in a general hospital ward., Objectives, To compare the outcomes for people with acute psychosis who have been admitted to open medical wards with those admitted to conventional psychiatric units., Search methods, We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study-based register (April 2007). This register is compiled from searches of BIOSIS, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, Sociofile, and many conference proceedings., Selection criteria, We would have included all relevant randomised or quasi-randomised trials, allocating anyone thought to be suffering from an acute psychotic episode to either acute management on general medical wards, or acute management in a specialist psychiatric unit. The primary outcomes of interest were length of stay in hospital and relapse., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we would have calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based using a fixed effects model., Main results, We didnt identify any relevant randomised trials., Authors' conclusions, The Caribbean practice of treating people with severe mental illness on general medical wards has been influenced by socio-economic factors rather than evidence from randomised trials. This practice affords an opportunity for a well designed, well conducted and reported randomised trial, now impossible in many other settings.","Fred W.

The date of the most recent search was 12 March 2012., Selection criteria, Adults (18 years and over) complaining of tinnitus or adults with a primary complaint of cerebral insufficiency, where tinnitus forms part of the syndrome., Data collection and analysis, Both original authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. For the 2012 update two authors determined trial eligibility, extracted data, analysed data and updated the contents of the review., Main results, Four trials with a total of 1543 participants were included in the review; we assessed all the included studies as having a low risk of bias. Three trials (1143 participants) included patients with a primary complaint of tinnitus and one (400 participants) included patients with mild to moderate dementia, some of whom had tinnitus., Authors' conclusions, The limited evidence does not demonstrate that Ginkgo biloba is effective for tinnitus when this is the primary complaint.","Malcolm P.

Exclusion criteria included inability to stand for 10 seconds with feet together, medical conditions that precluded exercising, or enrollment in an exercise class., Intervention, Balance retraining exercise program (n = 352) or no exercise program (n = 354). The exercise program was offered in a community setting and comprised supervised weekly 1-hour group sessions, for about 2 years, to improve postural stability, muscle extensibility and joint flexibility, balance, reaction time, coordination, muscle strength, and internal sense of spatial orientation; women were also given individualized exercise plans to perform at home >= 1/week. The no-exercise group received a fall prevention information brochure., Outcomes, Primary outcome was a composite of moderate or serious injurious falls (excluding falls due to unavoidable major events). Secondary outcomes included fear of falling and health-related quality of life., Patient follow-up, 81% at 2 years (intention-to-treat analysis)., Main results:, 170 (48%) women in the exercise group and 189 (53%) in the no-exercise group had injurious falls during the study.

684,"Background, Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. In the current absence of a cure for tinnitus, clinical management typically focuses on reducing the effects of co-morbid symptoms such as distress or hearing loss. Hearing loss is commonly co-morbid with tinnitus and so logic implies that amplification of external sounds by hearing aids will reduce perception of the tinnitus sound and the distress associated with it., Objectives, To assess the effects of hearing aids specifically in terms of tinnitus benefit in patients with tinnitus and co-existing hearing loss., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 19 August 2013., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled trials recruiting adults with subjective tinnitus and some degree of hearing loss, where the intervention involves amplification with hearing aids and this is compared to interventions involving other medical devices, other forms of standard or complementary therapy, or combinations of therapies, no intervention or placebo interventions., Data collection and analysis, Three authors independently screened all selected abstracts. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed those potentially suitable studies for risk of bias. For studies meeting the inclusion criteria, we used the mean difference (MD) to compare hearing aids with other interventions and controls., Main results, One randomised controlled trial (91 participants) was included in this review. We judged the trial to have a low risk of bias for method of randomisation and outcome reporting, and an unclear risk of bias for other criteria. No non-randomised controlled trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. The included study measured change in tinnitus severity (primary measure of interest) using a tinnitus questionnaire measure, and change in tinnitus loudness (secondary measure of interest) on a visual analogue scale. Other secondary outcome measures of interest, namely change in the psychoacoustic characteristics of tinnitus, change in self reported anxiety, depression and quality of life, and change in neurophysiological measures, were not investigated in this study. The included study compared hearing aid use to sound generator use. The estimated effect on change in tinnitus loudness or severity as measured by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory score was compatible with benefits for both hearing aids or sound generators but no difference was found between the two alternative treatments (MD -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.92 to 6.12) (100-point scale); moderate quality evidence. No negative or adverse events were reported., Authors' conclusions, The current evidence base for hearing aid prescription for tinnitus is limited. To be useful, future studies should make appropriate use of blinding and be consistent in their use of outcome measures. Whilst hearing aids are sometimes prescribed as part of tinnitus management, there is currently no evidence to support or refute their use as a more routine intervention for tinnitus.","Derek J.

686,"Background, In primary care between 10% and 35% of all visits concern patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS are associated with high medical consumption, significant disabilities and psychiatric morbidity., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of consultation letters (CLs) to assist primary care physicians or occupational health physicians in the treatment of patients with MUPS and diagnostic subgroups., Search strategy, We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Controlled Trials Registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1966-2009), MEDLINE In Process (2009-08-17), EMBASE (1974-2009), PSYCINFO (1980-2009) and CINAHL (1982-2009). We screened the references lists of selected studies and consulted experts in the field to identify any additional, eligible RCTs., Selection criteria, RCTs of CLs for patients with MUPS being treated in primary care settings., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently screened the abstracts of the studies identified through the searches and independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved any disagreement by discussion with a third review author. We assessed heterogeneity and, where a number of studies reported the same outcomes, pooled results in a meta-analysis., Main results, We included six RCTs, with a total of 449 patients. In four studies (267 patients) the CL intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (in two studies the outcomes could be pooled: MD -352.55 US Dollars (95% CI -522.32 to -182.78)) and improved physical functioning (three studies, MD 5.71 (95% CI 4.11 to 7.31)). In two studies (182 patients) the intervention was a joint consultation with a psychiatrist in presence of the physician, and resulted in reduced severity of somatization symptoms, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning., Authors' conclusions, There is limited evidence that a CL is effective in terms of medical costs and improvement of physical functioning for patients with MUPS in primary care. The results are even less pronounced in patients with clinically less severe, but more meaningful, forms of MUPS and the results vary for other patient-related outcomes. All studies, except one, were performed in the United States and therefore the results can not be generalized directly to countries with other healthcare systems. Furthermore all studies were small and of only moderate quality. There is very limited evidence that a joint consultation with the patient by a psychiatrist in the presence of the physician, together with the provision of a CL, reduces severity of somatization symptoms and medical consumption.","Rob Hoedeman, Annette H.

687,"Background, Cognitive impairment is a frequent consequence of stroke and can impact on a person's ability to perform everyday activities. There are a number of different intervention strategies that occupational therapists may use when working with people who have cognitive impairment post-stroke., Objectives, To determine whether occupational therapy improves functional performance of basic activities of daily living (ADL) and specific cognitive abilities in people who have cognitive impairment following a stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched May 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2009), EMBASE (1980 to April 2009), CINAHL (1982 to April 2009), PsycINFO (1840 to April 2009), PsycBITE, OTseeker and Dissertation Abstracts (the latest three were searched up to April 2009). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, we also tracked relevant references through the cited reference search in Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), reviewed the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, handsearched relevant occupational therapy journals, and contacted key researchers in the area., Selection criteria, Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated an intervention focused on providing cognitive retraining to adults with clinically defined stroke and confirmed cognitive impairment. The intervention needed either to be provided by an occupational therapist or given under the supervision of an occupational therapist., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently examined the abstracts that might meet the inclusion criteria, assessed the quality and extracted data. We have presented results using mean differences., Main results, We included one trial with 33 participants in this review. We found no difference between groups for the two relevant outcomes that were measured: improvement in time judgement skills and improvement in basic ADLs on the Barthel Index., Authors' conclusions, The effectiveness of occupational therapy for cognitive impairment post-stroke remains unclear. The potential benefits of cognitive retraining delivered as part of occupational therapy on improving basic daily activity function or specific cognitive abilities, or both, of people who have had a stroke cannot be supported or refuted by the evidence included in this review. More research is required.","Tammy Hoffmann, Sally Bennett, ChiaLin Koh, Kryss T. McKenna (2010).

688,"Background, Pharmacological treatments for tobacco dependence, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), have been shown to be safe and effective interventions for smoking cessation. Higher levels of adherence to these medications increase the likelihood of sustained smoking cessation, but many smokers use them at a lower dose and for less time than is optimal. It is therefore important to determine the effectiveness of interventions designed specifically to increase medication adherence. Such interventions may include further educating individuals about the value of taking medications and providing additional support to overcome problems with maintaining adherence., Objectives, The primary objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of interventions to increase adherence to medications for smoking cessation, such as NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline and varenicline (and combination regimens). This was considered in comparison to a control group, typically representing standard care. Secondary objectives were to i) assess which intervention approaches are most effective; ii) determine the impact of interventions on potential precursors of adherence, such as understanding of the treatment and efficacy perceptions; and iii) evaluate key outcomes influenced by prior adherence, principally smoking cessation., Search methods, We searched the following databases using keywords and medical subject headings: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OVID SP) (1946 to July Week 3 2014), EMBASE (OVID SP) (1980 to Week 29 2014), and PsycINFO (OVID SP) (1806 to July Week 4 2014). The Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register was searched on 9th July 2014. We conducted forward and backward citation searches., Selection criteria, Randomised, cluster-randomised or quasi-randomised studies in which participants using active pharmacological treatment for smoking cessation are allocated to an intervention arm or a control arm. Eligible participants were adult (18+) smokers. Eligible interventions comprised any intervention that differed from standard care, and where the intervention content had a clear principal focus on increasing adherence to medications for tobacco dependence. Acceptable comparison groups were those that provided standard care, which depending on setting may comprise minimal support or varying degrees of behavioural support. Included studies used a measure of adherence behaviour that allowed some assessment of the degree of adherence., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors searched for studies and independently extracted data for included studies. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook guidance. For continuous outcome measures, we report effect sizes as standardised mean differences (SMDs). For dichotomous outcome measures, we report effect sizes as relative risks (RRs). We obtained pooled effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the fixed effects model., Main results, Our search strategy retrieved 3165 unique references and we identified 31 studies as potentially eligible for inclusion. Of these, 23 studies were excluded at full-text screening stage or identified as studies awaiting classification subject to further information. We included eight studies involving 3336 randomised participants. The interventions were all additional to standard behavioural support and typically provided further information on the rationale for, and emphasised the importance of, adherence to medication, and supported the development of strategies to overcome problems with maintaining adherence., Authors' conclusions, There is some evidence that interventions that devote special attention to improving adherence to smoking cessation medication through providing information and facilitating problem-solving can improve adherence, though the evidence for this is not strong and is limited in both quality and quantity. There is some evidence that such interventions improve the chances of achieving abstinence but again the e","Gareth J. Hollands, Mairtin S.

689,"Background, Dependence on car use has a number of broad health implications, including contributing to physical inactivity, road traffic injury, air pollution and social severance, as well as entrenching lifestyles that require environmentally unsustainable energy use. Travel plans are interventions that aim to reduce single-occupant car use and increase the use of alternatives such as walking, cycling and public transport, with a variety of behavioural and structural components. This review focuses on organisational travel plans for schools, tertiary institutes and workplaces. These plans are closely aligned in their aims and intervention design, having emerged from a shared theoretical base., Objectives, To assess the effects of organisational travel plans on health, either directly measured, or through changes in travel mode., Search strategy, We searched the following electronic databases; Transport (1988 to June 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2008), EMBASE (1947 to June 2008), CINAHL (1982 to June 2008), ERIC (1966 to June 2008), PSYCINFO (1806 to June 2008), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to June 2008), BUILD (1989 to 2002), Social Sciences Citation Index (1900 to June 2008), Science Citation Index (1900 to June 2008), Arts & Humanities Index (1975 to June 2008), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (to August 2008), CENTRAL (to August 2008), Cochrane Injuries Group Register (to December 2009), C2-RIPE (to July 2008), C2-SPECTR (to July 2008), ProQuest Dissertations & Theses (1861 to June 2008). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and Internet sources. We did not restrict the search by date, language or publication status., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials and controlled before-after studies of travel behaviour change programmes conducted in an organisational setting, where the measured outcome was change in travel mode or health. Both positive and negative health effects were included., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed eligibility, assessed trial quality and extracted data., Main results, Seventeen studies were included. Ten were conducted in a school setting, two in universities, and five in workplaces. One study directly measured health outcomes, and all included studies measured travel outcomes. Two cluster randomised controlled trials in the school setting showed either no change in travel mode or mixed results. A randomised controlled trial in the workplace setting, conducted in a pre-selected group who were already contemplating or preparing for active travel, found improved health-related quality of life on some sub scales, and increased walking. Two controlled before-after studies found that school travel interventions increased walking. Other studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. No included studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries, and no studies measured the social distribution of effects or adverse effects, such as injury., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence to determine whether organisational travel plans are effective for improving health or changing travel mode. Organisational travel plans should be considered as complex health promotion interventions, with considerable potential to influence community health outcomes depending on the environmental context in which they are introduced. Given the current lack of evidence, organisational travel plans should be implemented in the context of robustly-designed research studies, such as well-designed cluster randomised trials.","Jamie Hosking, Alexandra Macmillan, Jennie Connor, Chris Bullen, Shanthi Ameratunga (2010).

690,"Background, Traumatic upper limb injury is a leading cause of work-related disability. After return-to-work (RTW), many survivors of injuries are able to regain a quality of life (QoL) comparable with the normal population. Since RTW plays an important role in economic productivity and regaining health-related QoL, enhancing RTW in workers with traumatic limb injuries is the primary goal of rehabilitation. Vocational rehabilitation has been commonly employed in the field of occupational safety and health to increase the number of injured people returning to the labour market, prevent illness, increase well-being, and reduce disability., Objectives, To assess the effects of vocational rehabilitation programmes for enhancing RTW in workers with traumatic upper limb injuries., Search methods, This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2013. We updated our searches of the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 9), MEDLINE (to 30 August 2017), EMBASE (to 3 September 2017), CINAHL (to 6 September 2017), and PsycINFO (to 6 September 2017), and we handsearched the references lists of relevant review articles., Selection criteria, We aimed to include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vocational rehabilitation with an alternative (control) intervention such as standard rehabilitation, a limited form of the vocational rehabilitation intervention (such as advice on RTW, referral information, or liaison with employer), or waiting-list controls., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently inspected abstracts, and we obtained full papers when necessary. When the two authors disagreed about the inclusion of a study, we resolved disagreements by discussion. A third author arbitrated when necessary., Main results, Our updated search identified 466 citations. Based on assessments of their titles and abstracts, we decided to evaluate the full texts of five records; however, none met our inclusion criteria., Authors' conclusions, There is currently no high-quality evidence to support or refute the efficacy of vocational rehabilitation for enhancing RTW in workers with traumatic upper limb injuries. Since injured people in occupational settings frequently receive vocational rehabilitation with the aim of decreasing work disability, enhancing RTW, increasing productivity, and containing the welfare cost, further high-quality RCTs assessing the efficacy of vocational rehabilitation for workers with traumatic upper limb injury are needed to fill this gap in knowledge.","Wen-Hsuan Hou, Ching-Chi Chi, Heng-Lien Lo, Yun-Yun Chou, Ken N.

691,"Background, Work participation of patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) is important not only economically but also for physical and psychological health. There is no Cochrane Review to date on studies of non-pharmacological interventions specifically aimed at preventing job loss in people with IA., Objectives, To assess the effects of non-pharmacological interventions that aim to prevent job loss, work absenteeism or improve work functioning for employees with IA (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), other spondylarthritis (SpA) or IA associated with connective tissue diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE))., Search methods, We searched the following databases from inception up to 30 April 2014; The Cochrane Library (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, i.e. CENTRAL and DARE), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (Embase.com), CINAHL (EbSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and PsycINFO (ProQuest). We did not impose language restrictions in the search., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated interventions aimed at preventing job loss in adults of working age (18 to 65 years) diagnosed with IA, including RA, AS, PsA, SpA or other types of IA. Primary outcomes were job loss and sickness absenteeism and the secondary outcome was work functioning., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included RCTs., Main results, We included three RCTs with a total of 414 participants at risk of job loss. The majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS. The interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning in several ways: firstly by evaluating work changes or adaptations and secondly by providing any person-directed interventions including vocational counselling, advice or education. Interventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits (one trial) or any actions by an occupational physician (one trial). The duration or dose of the interventions varied from two 1.5-hour sessions (one RCT) over five months, two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months (one RCT), to six to eight individual or group sessions over six months (also one RCT). All participants were recruited through rheumatology clinics, both in or outside hospitals. Included trials investigated job loss (n = two RCTs; 382 participants), work absenteeism and work functioning (n = one RCT; 32 participants). Overall, we evaluated the two smaller trials as having a high risk of bias and the large trial as having a low risk of bias. Trials showed marked differences in how they performed on risk of bias items, particularly on performance bias., Authors' conclusions, This Cochrane review of three RCTs found very low quality evidence overall for job loss prevention interventions having an effect on job loss, work absenteeism and work functioning in workers with inflammatory arthritis. While this review highlights that further high quality RCTs are required, the results suggest that these strategies have potential to be effective.","Jan L. Hoving, Diane Lacaille, Donna M.

692,"Background, Even low levels of substance misuse by people with a severe mental illness can have detrimental effects., Objectives, To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for reduction in substance use in people with a serious mental illness compared with standard care., Search methods, For this update (2013), the Trials Search Co-ordinator of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (CSG) searched the CSG Trials Register (July 2012), which is based on regular searches of major medical and scientific databases. The principal authors conducted two further searches (8 October 2012 and 15 January 2013) of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. A separate search for trials of contingency management was completed as this was an additional intervention category for this update., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosocial interventions for substance misuse with standard care in people with serious mental illness., Data collection and analysis, We independently selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. For all meta-analyses we pooled data using a random-effects model. Using the GRADE approach, we identified seven patient-centred outcomes and assessed the quality of evidence for these within each comparison., Main results, We included 32 trials with a total of 3165 participants. Evaluation of long-term integrated care included four RCTs (n = 735). We found no significant differences on loss to treatment (n = 603, 3 RCTs, RR 1.09 CI 0.82 to 1.45, low quality of evidence), death by 3 years (n = 421, 2 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.39 to 3.57, low quality of evidence), alcohol use (not in remission at 36 months) (n = 143, 1 RCT, RR 1.15 CI 0.84 to 1.56,low quality of evidence), substance use (n = 85, 1 RCT, RR 0.89 CI 0.63 to 1.25, low quality of evidence), global assessment of functioning (n = 171, 1 RCT, MD 0.7 CI 2.07 to 3.47, low quality of evidence), or general life satisfaction (n = 372, 2 RCTs, MD 0.02 higher CI 0.28 to 0.32, moderate quality of evidence)., Authors' conclusions, We included 32 RCTs and found no compelling evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over another for people to remain in treatment or to reduce substance use or improve mental state in people with serious mental illnesses. Furthermore, methodological difficulties exist which hinder pooling and interpreting results. Further high quality trials are required which address these concerns and improve the evidence in this important area.","Glenn E.

693,"Background, A large proportion of patients with anxiety disorders fail to respond to first-line medication interventions, despite evidence of the effectiveness of these agents., Objectives, To assess the effects of medication versus placebo augmentation in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders who have failed to respond adequately to first-line drug therapies., Search strategy, The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis Group (CCDAN) specialised registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 3/8/2005, , MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2005) and PsycINFO (1966 to 2005, Part A). Unpublished trials were identified through the Controlled Trials database and the National Institute of Health's Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) service (1972 to 2005). Additional studies in any language were sought in reference lists of retrieved articles., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the medication augmentation of pharmacotherapy for treatment resistant anxiety disorders., Data collection and analysis, Two raters independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data, and assessed trial quality. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. Summary statistics were stratified by class of augmentation agent and anxiety disorder. Overall effect estimates were calculated using a random-effects model, heterogeneity was assessed and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were undertaken., Main results, Twenty eight short-term (average of seven weeks) randomised controlled trials (740 participants) were included in the review, 20 of which investigated augmentation of medication for treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Summary statistics for responder status from nine trials demonstrate overall superiority of a variety of medication agents to placebo (relative risk of non-response (RR) 3.16, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.23). Similarly, symptom severity was significantly reduced in the medication groups, relative to placebo (number of trials (N) = 14, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.87, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.36). There is no evidence of a difference between medication and placebo in total dropout rate, or in the number of dropouts due to adverse events., Authors' conclusions, Medication augmentation can be an effective and well-tolerated short-term treatment strategy for non-responders to first-line pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders. However, any conclusions must be tentative in view of methodological and clinical heterogeneity, and the fact that much of the relevant database is based on antipsychotic augmentation trials in OCD patients resistant to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). Additional data are needed to address several areas, including the efficacy of augmentation over the longer-term, and the value of medication augmentation in comparison to other strategies (eg switching medication, adding psychotherapy).","Jonathan C.

Trials have investigated the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for BDD., Objectives, To assess the efficacy of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy or a combination of both treatment modalities for body dysmorphic disorder., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Trial Register (December 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2007), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2007), and PsycINFO (1967 to December 2007). Ongoing and unpublished trials were located through searching the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, the CRISP and WHO ICTRP search portals (databases searched in December 2007), and through contacting key researchers and pharmaceutical companies. Additional studies were located through study reference lists., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of patients meeting DSM or ICD diagnostic criteria for BDD, in which the trials compare pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy or multi-modal treatment groups with active or non-active control groups. Short or long-term trials were eligible., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data, and assessed trial quality. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. Summary effect sizes for dichotomous and continuous outcomes were calculated using a random effects model and heterogeneity was assessed., Main results, Two pharmacotherapy and three psychotherapy trials were eligible for inclusion in the review, with data from four short-term RCTs (169 participants) available for analysis. Response data from a single placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine suggested overall superiority of medication relative to placebo (relative risk (RR) 3.07, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.72, n = 67). Symptom severity was also significantly reduced in the RCTs of fluoxetine and clomipramine (relative to desipramine), as well as in the two CBT trials (WMD -44.96, 95% CI -54.43 to -35.49, n = 73). A low relapse rate (4/22) was demonstrated in one trial of CBT., Authors' conclusions, Results from the small number of available RCTs suggest that SRIs and CBT may be useful in treating patients with BDD. The findings of these studies need to be replicated. In addition, future controlled studies in other samples, such as adolescents, and using other selective SRIs, as well as a range of psychological therapy approaches and modalities (alone and in combination), are essential in supplementing the sparse data currently available.","Jonathan C.

695,"Background, Anxiety disorders are a potentially disabling group of disorders that frequently co-occur with alcohol use disorders. Comorbid anxiety and alcohol use disorders are associated with poorer outcomes, and are difficult to treat with standard psychosocial interventions. In addition, improved understanding of the biological basis of the conditions has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medications for the treatment of people with both diagnoses., Objectives, To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders, specifically: to provide an estimate of the overall effects of medication in improving treatment response and reducing symptom severity in the treatment of anxiety disorders in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders; to determine whether specific medications are more effective and tolerable than other medications in the treatment of particular anxiety disorders; and to identify which factors (clinical, methodological) predict response to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders., Search methods, Review authors searched the specialized registers of The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDANCTR, to January 2014) and the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG, to March 2013) for eligible trials. These registers contain reports of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) from: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Review authors ran complementary searches on EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO and the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (ETOH) (to August 2013). We located unpublished trials through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RePORTER service and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to August 2013). We screened reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies., Selection criteria, All true RCTs of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety disorders with comorbid alcohol use disorders. Trials assessing drugs administered for the treatment of drinking behaviour, such as naltrexone, disulfiram and acomprosate were not eligible for inclusion in this systematic review., Data collection and analysis, A systematic review is a standardised evaluation of all research studies that address a particular clinical issue., Main results, We included five placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy RCTs (with 290 participants) in the review. Most of the trials provided little information on how randomization was performed or on whether both participants and study personnel were blinded to the intervention. Two of the three trials reporting superiority of medication compared with placebo on anxiety symptom outcomes were industry funded. We regarded one trial as being at high risk of bias due to selective reporting., Authors' conclusions, The evidence-base for the effectiveness of medication in treating anxiety disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorders is currently inconclusive. There was a small amount of evidence for the efficacy of medication, but this was limited and of very low quality. The majority of the data for the efficacy and tolerability of medication were for SSRIs; there were insufficient data to establish differences in treatment efficacy between medication classes or patient subgroups. There was a small amount of very low quality evidence that medication was well tolerated. There was no evidence that alcohol use was responsive to medication.","Jonathan C.

697,"Background, Many people with epilepsy report experiencing psychological difficulties such as anxiety, depression and neuropsychological deficits including memory problems. Research has shown that these difficulties are often present not only for people with chronic epilepsy but also for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Despite this, there are very few published interventions that detail means to help people with newly diagnosed epilepsy manage these problems., Objectives, To identify and assess possible psychological and neuropsychological interventions for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy., Search methods, We searched the following databases on 30 June 2015: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), SCOPUS, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)., Selection criteria, This review includes all randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort controlled studies, and prospective before and after studies which include psychological or neuropsychological interventions for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. We excluded studies that included people with epilepsy and any other psychological disorder or neurological condition. We excluded studies carried out which recruited only children., Data collection and analysis, We used the standard methodological procedure expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two authors independently completed data extraction and risk of bias analysis. The results of this were cross-checked and third author resolved any discrepancies. In the event of missing data, we contacted the study authors. Meta-analysis was not completed due to differences in the intervention and outcomes reported in the two studies., Main results, We included two randomised controlled trials assessing psychological interventions for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. One study assessed a cognitive behavioural intervention (CBI) in an adolescent population. This study was rated as low quality. One study assessed a specialist nurse intervention in an adult population. This study was rating as very low quality., Authors' conclusions, Meta-analysis was not possible as we identified only two studies and they utilised different interventions and outcome measures.","Cerian F.

698,"Background, Medication used for acute aggression in psychiatry must have rapid onset of effect low frequency of administration and low levels of adverse effects Zuclopenthixol acetate is said to have these properties., Objectives, To estimate the clinical effects of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of acute aggression or violence thought to be due to serious mental illnesses in comparison to other drugs used to treat similar conditions., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia's Group Trials Register (July 2011) We supplemented this by citation searching and personal contact with authors and relevant pharmaceutical companies., Selection criteria, All randomised clinical trials involving people thought to have serious mental illnesses comparing zuclopenthixol acetate with other drugs., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors extracted and cross-checked data independently We calculated fixed-effect relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data We analysed by intention-to-treat We used mean differences (MD) for continuous variables., Main results, We found no data for the primary outcome tranquillisation Compared with haloperidol zuclopenthixol acetate was no more sedating at two hours (n = 40 1 RCT RR 0.60 95% CI 0.27 to 1.34) People given zuclopenthixol acetate were not at reduced risk of being given supplementary antipsychotics (n = 134 3 RCTs RR 1.49 95% CI 0.97 to 2.30) although additional use of benzodiazepines was less (n = 50 1 RCT RR 0.03 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47) People given zuclopenthixol acetate had fewer injections over seven days compared with those allocated to haloperidol IM (n = 70 1 RCT RR 0.39 95% CI 0.18 to 0.84 NNT 4 CI 3 to 14) We found no data on more episodes of aggression or harm to self or others One trial (n = 148) reported no significant difference in adverse effects for people receiving zuclopenthixol acetate compared with those allocated haloperidol at one three and six days (RR 0.74 95% CI 0.43 to 1.27) Compared with haloperidol or clotiapine people allocated zuclopenthixol did not seem to be at more risk of a range of movement disorders (< 20%) Three studies found no difference in the proportion of people getting blurred vision/dry mouth (n = 192 2 RCTs RR at 24 hours 0.90 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70) Similarly dizziness was equally infrequent for those allocated zuclopenthixol acetate compared with haloperidol (n = 192 2 RCTs RR at 24 hours 1.15 95% CI 0.46 to 2.88) There was no difference between treatments for leaving the study before completion (n = 522 RR 0.85 95% CI 0.31 to 2.31) One study reported no difference in adverse effects and outcome scores when high dose (50-100 mg/injection) zuclopenthixol acetate was compared with low dose (25-50 mg/injection) zuclopenthixol acetate., Authors' conclusions, Recommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of psychiatric emergencies in preference to 'standard' treatment have to be viewed with caution Most of the small trials present important methodological flaws and findings are poorly reported This review did not find any suggestion that zuclopenthixol acetate is more or less effective in controlling aggressive acute psychosis or in preventing adverse effects than intramuscular haloperidol and neither seemed to have a rapid onset of action Use of zuclopenthixol acetate may result in less numerous coercive injections and low doses of the drug may be as effective as higher doses Well-conducted pragmatic randomised controlled trials are needed.","Kaushadh Jayakody, Carl Roger Gibson, Ajit Kumar, Shalmini Gunadasa (2013).

699,"Background, Amantadine hydrochloride (amantadine) and rimantadine hydrochloride (rimantadine) have antiviral properties, but they are not widely used due to a lack of knowledge of their potential value and concerns about possible adverse effects., Objectives, The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy, effectiveness and safety ('effects') of amantadine and rimantadine in healthy adults., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to April Week 4, 2008), EMBASE (1990 to April 2008) and reference lists of articles., Selection criteria, Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing amantadine and/or rimantadine with placebo, control medication or no intervention, or comparing doses or schedules of amantadine and/or rimantadine in healthy adults., Data collection and analysis, For prophylaxis (prevention) trials we analysed the numbers of participants with clinical influenza (influenza-like-illness or ILI) or with confirmed influenza A and adverse effects. Analysis for treatment trials was of the mean duration of fever, length of hospital stay and adverse effects., Main results, Amantadine prevented 25% of ILI cases (95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 36%), and 61% of influenza A cases (95% CI 35% to 76%). Amantadine reduced duration of fever by one day (95% CI 0.7 to 1.2). Rimantadine demonstrated comparable effectiveness, but there were fewer trials and the results for prophylaxis were not statistically significant. Both amantadine and rimantadine induced significant gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects. Adverse effects of the central nervous system and study withdrawals were significantly more common with amantadine than rimantadine. Neither drug affected the rate of viral shedding from the nose or the course of asymptomatic influenza., Authors' conclusions, Amantadine and rimantadine have comparable efficacy and effectiveness in relieving or treating symptoms of influenza A in healthy adults, although rimantadine induces fewer adverse effects than amantadine. The effectiveness of both drugs in interrupting transmission is probably low. Resistance of influenza viruses to amantadine is a serious worldwide problem as shown by recent virological surveillances. Both drugs have adverse gastrointestinal (stomach and gut) effects, but amantadine can also have serious effects on the nervous system. They should only be used in an emergency when all other measures fail.","Tom Jefferson, Vittorio Demicheli, Carlo Di Pietrantonj, Daniela Rivetti (2012).

700,"Background, Insomnia is a common sleep disorder in modern society. It causes reduced quality of life and is associated with impairments in physical and mental health. Listening to music is widely used as a sleep aid, but it remains unclear if it can actually improve insomnia in adults., Objectives, To assess the effects of listening to music on insomnia in adults and to assess the influence of specific variables that may moderate the effect., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, nine other databases and two trials registers in May 2015. In addition, we handsearched specific music therapy journals, reference lists of included studies, and contacted authors of published studies to identify additional studies eligible for inclusion, including any unpublished or ongoing trials., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the effects of listening to music with no treatment or treatment-as-usual on sleep improvement in adults with insomnia., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently screened abstracts, selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all studies eligible for inclusion. Data on pre-defined outcome measures were subjected to meta-analyses when consistently reported by at least two studies. We undertook meta-analyses using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. Heterogeneity across included studies was assessed using the I[superscript digit two] statistic., Main results, We included six studies comprising a total of 314 participants. The studies examined the effect of listening to pre-recorded music daily, for 25 to 60 minutes, for a period of three days to five weeks., Authors' conclusions, The findings of this review provide evidence that music may be effective for improving subjective sleep quality in adults with insomnia symptoms. The intervention is safe and easy to administer. More research is needed to establish the effect of listening to music on other aspects of sleep as well as the daytime consequences of insomnia.","Kira V.

703,"Background, Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is now a recommended treatment for people with schizophrenia. This approach helps to link the person's distress and problem behaviours to underlying patterns of thinking., Objectives, To review the effects of CBT for people with schizophrenia when compared with other psychological therapies., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2010) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected all references of the selected articles for further relevant trials, and, where appropriate, contacted authors., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT for people with schizophrenia-like illnesses., Data collection and analysis, Studies were reliably selected and assessed for methodological quality. Two review authors, working independently, extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data on an intention-to-treat basis and continuous data with 65% completion rate are presented. Where possible, for dichotomous outcomes, we estimated a risk ratio (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI) along with the number needed to treat/harm., Main results, Thirty one papers described 20 trials. Trials were often small and of limited quality. When CBT was compared with other psychosocial therapies, no difference was found for outcomes relevant to adverse effect/events (2 RCTs, n = 202, RR death 0.57 CI 0.12 to 2.60). Relapse was not reduced over any time period (5 RCTs, n = 406, RR long-term 1.03 CI 0.86 to 1.24) nor was rehospitalisation (6 RCTs, n = 670, RR in longer term 0.96 CI 0.81 to 1.14). Various global mental state measures failed to show difference (4 RCTs, n = 244, RR no important change in mental state 0.84 CI 0.64 to 1.09). More specific measures of mental state failed to show differential effects on positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia but there may be some longer term effect for affective symptoms (2 RCTs, n = 105, mean difference (MD) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) -6.21 CI -10.81 to -1.61). Few trials report on social functioning or quality of life. Findings do not convincingly favour either of the interventions (2 RCTs, n = 103, MD Social Functioning Scale(SFS) 1.32 CI -4.90 to 7.54; n = 37, MD EuroQOL -1.86 CI -19.20 to 15.48). For the outcome of leaving the study early, we found no significant advantage when CBT was compared with either non-active control therapies (5 RCTs, n = 495, RR 0.90 CI 0.68 to 1.19) or active therapies (6 RCTs, n = 339, RR 0.75 CI 0.40 to 1.43), Authors' conclusions, Trial-based evidence suggests no clear and convincing advantage for cognitive behavioural therapy over other - and sometime much less sophisticated - therapies for people with schizophrenia.","Christopher Jones, David Hacker, Irene Cormac, Alan Meaden, Claire B.

704,"Background, Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is a major health problem, accounting for approximately one-quarter of general practice (GP) consultations in the United Kingdom (UK). Exercise and physical activity is beneficial for the most common types of CMP, such as back and knee pain. However, poor adherence to exercise and physical activity may limit long-term effectiveness., Objectives, To assess the effects of interventions to improve adherence to exercise and physical activity for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain., Search strategy, We searched the trials registers of relevant Cochrane Review Groups. In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index and reference lists of articles to October 2007. We consulted experts for unpublished trials., Selection criteria, Randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating interventions that aimed to improve adherence to exercise and physical activity in adults with pain for three months and over in the axial skeleton or large peripheral joints., Data collection and analysis, Two of the four authors independently assessed the quality of each included trial and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing information., Main results, We included 42 trials with 8243 participants, mainly with osteoarthritis and spinal pain. Methods used for improving and measuring adherence in the included trials were inconsistent. Two of the 17 trials that compared different types of exercise showed positive effects, suggesting that the type of exercise is not an important factor in improving exercise adherence. Six trials studied different methods of delivering exercise, such as supervising exercise sessions, refresher sessions and audio or videotapes of the exercises to take home. Of these, five trials found interventions improved exercise adherence. Four trials evaluated specific interventions targeting exercise adherence; three of these showed a positive effect on exercise adherence. In eight trials studying self-management programmes, six improved adherence measures. One trial found graded activity was more effective than usual care for improving exercise adherence. Cognitive behavioural therapy was effective in a trial in people with whiplash-associated disorder, but not in trials of people with other CMP. In the trials that showed a positive effect on adherence, association between clinical outcomes and exercise adherence was conflicting., Authors' conclusions, Interventions such as supervised or individualised exercise therapy and self-management techniques may enhance exercise adherence. However, high-quality, randomised trials with long-term follow up that explicitly address adherence to exercises and physical activity are needed. A standard validated measure of exercise adherence should be used consistently in future studies.","Joanne L. Jordan, Melanie A. Holden, E. J. Elizabeth Mason, Nadine E. Foster (2010).

705,"Background, Flexible working conditions are increasingly popular in developed countries but the effects on employee health and wellbeing are largely unknown., Objectives, To evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of flexible working interventions on the physical, mental and general health and wellbeing of employees and their families., Search methods, Our searches (July 2009) covered 12 databases including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO; Social Science Citation Index; ASSIA; IBSS; Sociological Abstracts; and ABI/Inform. We also searched relevant websites, handsearched key journals, searched bibliographies and contacted study authors and key experts., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCT), interrupted time series and controlled before and after studies (CBA), which examined the effects of flexible working interventions on employee health and wellbeing. We excluded studies assessing outcomes for less than six months and extracted outcomes relating to physical, mental and general health/ill health measured using a validated instrument. We also extracted secondary outcomes (including sickness absence, health service usage, behavioural changes, accidents, work-life balance, quality of life, health and wellbeing of children, family members and co-workers) if reported alongside at least one primary outcome., Data collection and analysis, Two experienced review authors conducted data extraction and quality appraisal. We undertook a narrative synthesis as there was substantial heterogeneity between studies., Main results, Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Six CBA studies reported on interventions relating to temporal flexibility: self-scheduling of shift work (n = 4), flexitime (n = 1) and overtime (n = 1). The remaining four CBA studies evaluated a form of contractual flexibility: partial/gradual retirement (n = 2), involuntary part-time work (n = 1) and fixed-term contract (n = 1). The studies retrieved had a number of methodological limitations including short follow-up periods, risk of selection bias and reliance on largely self-reported outcome data., Authors' conclusions, The findings of this review tentatively suggest that flexible working interventions that increase worker control and choice (such as self-scheduling or gradual/partial retirement) are likely to have a positive effect on health outcomes. In contrast, interventions that were motivated or dictated by organisational interests, such as fixed-term contract and involuntary part-time employment, found equivocal or negative health effects. Given the partial and methodologically limited evidence base these findings should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, there is a clear need for well-designed intervention studies to delineate the impact of flexible working conditions on health, wellbeing and health inequalities.","Kerry Joyce, Roman Pabayo, Julia A.

706,"Background, Pharmacological treatments are the principal intervention for bipolar disorder. Alone, however, they are not sufficient to control symptoms and maintain psychosocial functioning. Adjunctive psychosocial interventions may help to improve the patient's condition and the course of the illness. Family interventions are deserving of special attention, since they may help to relieve the burden of care borne by relatives and caregivers, which in turn may facilitate the task of supporting the patient., Objectives, The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of family interventions in the treatment of bipolar disorder compared with no intervention and other forms of intervention., Search strategy, We searched the electronic databases CCDANRCT-Studies and CCDANCTR-References on 1/8/2007, CENTRAL (2006-3), MEDLINE (2006), EMBASE (2006) and LILACS (2006), and searched the reference lists of included studies. We also made personal contact with authors., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials. Participants were people with bipolar disorder and their relatives or caregivers; family psychosocial interventions of any type were considered; primary outcomes were changes in the status of symptoms and relapse rates., Data collection and analysis, Data were independently extracted by two review authors. Quality assessment of included studies was carried out. The findings were presented descriptively. Where there were sufficient studies, dichotomous data were combined using relative risk, and continuous data were combined using weighted mean difference, with their 95% CIs., Main results, Seven RCTs were included in the review, involving a total of 393 participants. All of the included studies assessed psychoeducational methods, and one study also assessed a type of systems psychotherapy. In all trials, participants continued to receive pharmacotherapy treatment. Due to the diversity of interventions, outcome measures and endpoints used across studies, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses for primary outcomes. Five studies compared a variety of family interventions, involving carers, families or spouses, against no intervention, with individual findings indicating no significant added effect for family interventions. Three studies compared one type or modality of family intervention against another family intervention, with inconsistent findings., Authors' conclusions, To date there is only a small and heterogeneous body of evidence on the effectiveness of family oriented approaches for bipolar disorder, and it is not yet possible to draw any definite conclusions to support their use as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder. Further well designed RCTs should be a research priority.","Luis Justo, Garcia Bernardo Soares, Helena Calil (2009).

707,"Background, Low back pain (LBP) is responsible for considerable personal suffering worldwide. Those with persistent disabling symptoms also contribute to substantial costs to society via healthcare expenditure and reduced work productivity. While there are many treatment options, none are universally endorsed. The idea that chronic LBP is a condition best understood with reference to an interaction of physical, psychological and social influences, the 'biopsychosocial model', has received increasing acceptance. This has led to the development of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) programs that target factors from the different domains, administered by healthcare professionals from different backgrounds., Objectives, To review the evidence on the effectiveness of MBR for patients with chronic LBP. The focus was on comparisons with usual care and with physical treatments measuring outcomes of pain, disability and work status, particularly in the long term., Search methods, We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases in January and March 2014 together with carrying out handsearches of the reference lists of included and related studies, forward citation tracking of included studies and screening of studies excluded in the previous version of this review., Selection criteria, All studies identified in the searches were screened independently by two review authors; disagreements regarding inclusion were resolved by consensus. The inclusion criteria were published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included adults with non-specific LBP of longer than 12 weeks duration; the index intervention targeted at least two of physical, psychological and social or work-related factors; and the index intervention was delivered by clinicians from at least two different professional backgrounds., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors extracted and checked information to describe the included studies, assessed risk of bias and performed the analyses. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to describe the methodological quality. The primary outcomes were pain, disability and work status, divided into the short, medium and long term. Secondary outcomes were psychological functioning (for example depression, anxiety, catastrophising), healthcare service utilisation, quality of life and adverse events. We categorised the control interventions as usual care, physical treatment, surgery, or wait list for surgery in separate meta-analyses. The first two comparisons formed our primary focus. We performed meta-analyses using random-effects models and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE method. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of the methodological quality, and subgroup analyses to investigate the influence of baseline symptom severity and intervention intensity., Main results, From 6168 studies identified in the searches, 41 RCTs with a total of 6858 participants were included. Methodological quality ratings ranged from 1 to 9 out 12, and 13 of the 41 included studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Pooled estimates from 16 RCTs provided moderate to low quality evidence that MBR is more effective than usual care in reducing pain and disability, with standardised mean differences (SMDs) in the long term of 0.21 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.37) and 0.23 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.4) respectively. The range across all time points equated to approximately 0.5 to 1.4 units on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale for pain and 1.4 to 2.5 points on the Roland Morris disability scale (0 to 24). There was moderate to low quality evidence of no difference on work outcomes (odds ratio (OR) at long term 1.04, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.47). Pooled estimates from 19 RCTs provided moderate to low quality evidence that MBR was more effective than physical treatment for pain and disability with SMDs in the long term of 0.51 (95% CI -0.01 to 1.04) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.19) respectively. Across all time points this translated to approximately 0.6 to 1.2 units on the pain scale and 1.2 to","Steven J. Kamper, Andreas T. Apeldoorn, Alessandro Chiarotto, J. E. M. Rob Smeets, W. J. G.

However, some trials have been criticised for being clinically unrepresentative and unable to inform clinical practice., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of brief intervention, delivered in general practice or based primary care, to reduce alcohol consumption. To assess whether outcomes differ between trials in research settings and those in routine clinical settings., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group specialised register (February 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2006), EMBASE (1980 to February 2006), CINAHL (1982 to February 2006), PsycINFO (1840 to February 2006), Science Citation Index (1970 to February 2006), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to February 2006), Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (1972 to 2003), reference lists of articles., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials, patients presenting to primary care not specifically for alcohol treatment; brief intervention of up to four sessions., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality. Random effects meta-analyses, sub-group, sensitivity analyses, and meta-regression were conducted., Main results, Meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (enrolling 7,619 participants) showed that participants receiving brief intervention had lower alcohol consumption than the control group after follow-up of one year or longer (mean difference: -38 grams/week, 95% CI: -54 to -23), although there was substantial heterogeneity between trials (I2 = 57%). Sub-group analysis (8 studies, 2,307 participants) confirmed the benefit of brief intervention in men (mean difference: -57 grams/week, 95% CI: -89 to -25, I2 = 56%), but not in women (mean difference: -10 grams/week, 95% CI: -48 to 29, I2 = 45%). Meta-regression showed little evidence of a greater reduction in alcohol consumption with longer treatment exposure or among trials which were less clinically representative. Extended intervention was associated with a non-significantly greater reduction in alcohol consumption than brief intervention (mean difference = -28, 95%CI: -62 to 6 grams/week, I2 = 0%), Authors' conclusions, Overall, brief interventions lowered alcohol consumption. When data were available by gender, the effect was clear in men at one year of follow up, but not in women. Longer duration of counselling probably has little additional effect. The lack of evidence of any difference in outcomes between efficacy and effectiveness trials suggests that the current literature is relevant to routine primary care. Future trials should focus on women and on delineating the most effective components of interventions.","F. S. Eileen Kaner, Heather O. Dickinson, Fiona R.

709,"Background, Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation programs for neck and shoulder pain require substantial staff and financial resources. Despite questionable scientific evidence of their effectiveness, they are widely used., Objectives, The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain among working age adults., Search strategy, The reviewed studies for this review were electronically identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycLIT, CENTRAL, Medic, the Science Citation Index, reference checking and consulting experts in the rehabilitation field. The original search was planned and performed for more broad area of musculoskeletal disorders. Trials on neck and shoulder pain were separated afterwards. The literature search was updated in November 2002 by electronically searching MEDLINE and EMBASE., Selection criteria, From all references identified in our original search, we selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs). Trials had to assess the effectiveness of biopsychosocial rehabilitation for working age adults suffering from neck and shoulder pain. The rehabilitation program was required to be multidisciplinary, i.e., it had to consist of a physician's consultation plus either a psychological, social or vocational intervention, or a combination of these., Data collection and analysis, Four authors blinded to journal and author selected the trials that met the specified inclusion criteria. Two experts in the field of rehabilitation evaluated the clinical relevance and applicability of the findings of the selected studies for actual clinical use. Two other authors blinded to journal and author extracted the data and assessed the main results and the methodological quality of the studies, using standardized forms. Finally, a qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the level of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation., Main results, After screening 1808 abstracts, and the references of 65 reviews, we found only two relevant studies that satisfied our criteria. No more studies were found for this update. One of the studies was considered to be a methodologically low quality RCT and the other one was a methodologically low quality CCT. The clinical relevance of included studies was satisfactory. There was limited scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain., Authors' conclusions, We conclude that there appears to be little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation compared with other rehabilitation facilities for neck and shoulder pain. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is a commonly used intervention for chronic neck and shoulder complaints, therefore we see an urgent need for high quality trials in this field.","Kaija A.

710,"Background, Cardiac rehabilitation is an important component of recovery from coronary events but uptake and adherence to such programs are below recommended levels. In 2010, our Cochrane review identified some evidence that interventions to increase uptake of cardiac rehabilitation can be effective but there was insufficient evidence to provide recommendations on intervention to increase adherence. In this review, we update the previously published Cochrane review., Objectives, To determine the effects, both harms and benefits, of interventions to increase patient uptake of, or adherence to, cardiac rehabilitation., Search methods, We performed an updated search in January 2013 to identify studies published after publication of the previous systematic review. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 12, 2012), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL EBSCO, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), and National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) databases (Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)) on The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2012). We also checked reference lists of identified systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for additional studies. We applied no language restrictions., Selection criteria, Adults with myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, heart failure, angina, or coronary heart disease eligible for cardiac rehabilitation and RCTs or quasi-randomized trials of interventions to increase uptake or adherence to cardiac rehabilitation or any of its component parts. We only included studies reporting a primary outcome., Data collection and analysis, At least three authors independently screened titles and abstracts of all identified references for eligibility and obtained full papers of potentially relevant trials. At least two authors checked the selection. Three authors assessed included studies for risk of bias., Main results, The updated search identified seven new studies (880 participants) of interventions to improve uptake of cardiac rehabilitation and one new study (260 participants) of interventions to increase adherence. When added to the previous version of this review, we included 18 studies (2505 participants), 10 studies (1338 participants) of interventions to improve uptake of cardiac rehabilitation and eight studies (1167 participants) of interventions to increase adherence. We assessed the majority of studies as having high or unclear risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible due to multiple sources of heterogeneity. Eight of 10 studies demonstrated increased uptake of cardiac rehabilitation. Successful interventions to improve uptake of cardiac rehabilitation included: structured nurse- or therapist-led contacts, early appointments after discharge, motivational letters, gender-specific programs, and intermediate phase programs for older patients. Three of eight studies demonstrated improvement in adherence to cardiac rehabilitation. Successful interventions included: self monitoring of activity, action planning, and tailored counselling by cardiac rehabilitation staff. Data were limited on mortality and morbidity but did not demonstrate a difference in cardiovascular events or mortality except for one study that noted an increased rate of revascularization in the intervention group. None of the studies found a difference in health-related quality of life and there was no evidence of adverse events. No studies reported on costs or healthcare utilization., Authors' conclusions, We found only weak evidence to suggest that interventions to increase the uptake of cardiac rehabilitation are effective. Practice recommendations for increasing adherence to cardiac rehabilitation cannot be made. Interventions targeting patient-identified barriers may increase the likelihood of success. Further high-quality research is still needed.","Kunal N. Karmali, Philippa Davies, Fiona Taylor, Andrew Beswick, Nicole Martin, Shah Ebrahim (2014).

711,"Background, Depression is a mood disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1% to 3% worldwide, representing the fourth leading cause of disease burden globally. The current standard treatments of psychological therapy and antidepressant medications are not effective for everyone, and psychotropic drugs may be associated with significant adverse effects. Cranial electrical stimulation (CES) treatment, in which a low intensity electrical current is administered through the use of a small, portable electrical device, has been reported to have efficacy in the treatment of depression with minimal adverse effects. This systematic review investigated the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of CES in treatment of acute depression compared to sham, or simulated, CES treatment., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness and safety of alternating current cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) compared with sham CES for acute depression., Search methods, We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis review group's specialized register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) to February 24, 2014 This register contains relevant randomized controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We examined reference lists of review papers and books on CES. We contacted authors, other experts in the field and CES manufacturing companies for knowledge of suitable published or unpublished trials., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials of CES versus sham CES for the acute treatment of depressive disorder in adults aged 18 to 75 years., Data collection and analysis, We planned to extract data from the original reports of included studies independently by two authors. The main outcomes to be assessed were:, Main results, No studies met the inclusion criteria for this review., Authors' conclusions, There are insufficient methodologically rigorous studies of CES in treatment of acute depression. There is a need for double-blind randomized controlled trials of CES in the treatment of acute depression.","Harish C. Kavirajan, Kristin Lueck, Kenneth Chuang (2014).

712,"Background, Routine outcome monitoring of common mental health disorders (CMHDs), using patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), has been promoted across primary care, psychological therapy and multidisciplinary mental health care settings, but is likely to be costly, given the high prevalence of CMHDs. There has been no systematic review of the use of PROMs in routine outcome monitoring of CMHDs across these three settings., Objectives, To assess the effects of routine measurement and feedback of the results of PROMs during the management of CMHDs in 1) improving the outcome of CMHDs; and 2) in changing the management of CMHDs., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis group specialised controlled trials register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References), the Oxford University PROMS Bibliography (2002-5), Ovid PsycINFO, Web of Science, The Cochrane Libraryand International trial registries, initially to 30 May 2014, and updated to 18 May 2015., Selection criteria, We selected cluster and individually randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including participants with CMHDs aged 18 years and over, in which the results of PROMs were fed back to treating clinicians, or both clinicians and patients. We excluded RCTs in child and adolescent treatment settings, and those in which more than 10% of participants had diagnoses of eating disorders, psychoses, substance use disorders, learning disorders or dementia., Data collection and analysis, At least two authors independently identified eligible trials, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We conducted meta-analysis across studies, pooling outcome measures which were sufficiently similar to each other to justify pooling., Main results, We included 17 studies involving 8787 participants: nine in multidisciplinary mental health care, six in psychological therapy settings, and two in primary care. Pooling of outcome data to provide a summary estimate of effect across studies was possible only for those studies using the compound Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45) or Outcome Rating System (ORS) PROMs, which were all conducted in multidisciplinary mental health care or psychological therapy settings, because both primary care studies identified used single symptom outcome measures, which were not directly comparable to the OQ-45 or ORS., Authors' conclusions, We found insufficient evidence to support the use of routine outcome monitoring using PROMs in the treatment of CMHDs, in terms of improving patient outcomes or in improving management. The findings are subject to considerable uncertainty however, due to the high risk of bias in the large majority of trials meeting the inclusion criteria, which means further research is very likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. More research of better quality is therefore required, particularly in primary care where most CMHDs are treated.","Tony Kendrick, Magdy ElGohary, Beth Stuart, Simon Gilbody, Rachel Churchill, Laura Aiken, Abhishek Bhattacharya, Amy Gimson, Anna L.

713,"Background, Sleepiness leads to a deterioration in performance and attention, and is associated with an increased risk of injury. Jet lag and shift work disorder are circadian rhythm sleep disorders which result in sleepiness and can elevate injury risk. They create a need for individuals to operate at times which are different to those dictated by their circadian rhythms. Consequently there is also a need for interventions to help ensure that these persons can do so safely. Caffeine has a potential role in promoting alertness during times of desired wakefulness in persons with jet lag or shift work disorder, however its effects on injury and error are unclear., Objectives, To assess the effects of caffeine for preventing injuries caused by impaired alertness in persons with jet lag or shift work disorder., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, TRANSPORT (to July 2008); and PubMed databases (to April 2010). We also searched the Internet and checked reference lists of relevant papers., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of caffeine on injury, error or cognitive performance in people with jet lag or shift work disorder., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently screened search results and assessed full texts for inclusion. Data were extracted and risk of bias was assessed. Estimates of treatment effect (odds ratio and standardised mean difference (SMD)) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and pooled using the fixed-effect model., Main results, Thirteen trials were included. None measured an injury outcome. Two trials measured error, and the remaining trials used neuropsychological tests to assess cognitive performance. The trials assessing the impact on errors found that caffeine significantly reduced the number of errors compared to placebo. The pooled effect estimates on performance by cognitive domain suggest that, when compared to placebo, caffeine improved concept formation and reasoning (SMD -0.41; 95% CI -1.04 to 0.23), memory (SMD -1.08; 95% CI -2.07 to -0.09), orientation and attention (SMD -0.55; 95% CI -0.83 to -0.27) and perception (SMD -0.77; 95% CI -1.73 to 0.20); although there was no beneficial effect on verbal functioning and language skills (SMD 0.18; 95% CI -0.50 to 0.87). One trial comparing the effects of caffeine with a nap found that there were significantly less errors made in the caffeine group. Other trials comparing caffeine with other active interventions (for example nap, bright light, modafinil) found no significant differences. There is a high risk of bias for the adequacy of allocation concealment and presence of selective outcome reporting amongst the trials., Authors' conclusions, Caffeine may be an effective intervention for improving performance in shift workers however, there are no trials from which we can assess its effect on injuries. The results largely originate from studies involving young participants under simulated conditions, and the extent to which the findings are generalisable to older workers and real world shift work is unclear. Based on the current evidence, there is no reason for healthy individuals who already use caffeine within recommended levels to improve their alertness to stop doing so. The assessment of the relative effects of caffeine to other potential countermeasures should be a focus of future research.","Katharine Ker, James Philip Edwards, Lambert M.

714,"Background, Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was introduced more than 30 years ago as a therapeutic adjunct to the pharmacological management of pain. However, despite widespread use, its effectiveness in chronic low-back pain (LBP) is still controversial., Objectives, To determine whether TENS is more effective than placebo for the management of chronic LBP., Search methods, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro and CINAHL were searched up to July 19, 2007., Selection criteria, Only randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) comparing TENS to placebo in patients with chronic LBP were included., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected the trials, assessed their methodological quality and extracted relevant data. If quantitative meta-analysis was not possible, a qualitative synthesis was performed, taking into consideration 5 levels of evidence as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group., Main results, Four high-quality RCTs (585 patients) met the selection criteria. Clinical heterogeneity prevented the use of meta-analysis. Therefore, a qualitative synthesis was completed. There was conflicting evidence about whether TENS was beneficial in reducing back pain intensity and consistent evidence in two trials (410 patients) that it did not improve back-specific functional status. There was moderate evidence that work status and the use of medical services did not change with treatment. Conflicting results were obtained from two studies regarding generic health status, with one study showing no improvement on the modified Sickness Impact Profile and another study showing significant improvements on several, but not all subsections of the SF-36 questionnaire. Multiple physical outcome measures lacked statistically significant improvement relative to placebo. In general, patients treated with acupuncture-like TENS responded similarly to those treated with conventional TENS. However, in two of the trials, an inadequate stimulation intensity was used for acupuncture-like TENS, given that muscle twitching was not induced. Optimal treatment schedules could not be reliably determined based on the available data. Adverse effects included minor skin irritation at the site of electrode placement., Authors' conclusions, At this time, the evidence from the small number of placebo-controlled trials does not support the use of TENS in the routine management of chronic LBP. Further research is encouraged.","Amole Khadilkar, Oluwafemi Daniel Odebiyi, Lucie Brosseau, George A. Wells (2013).

715,"Background, Antisocial personality disorder (AsPD) is associated with a wide range of disturbance including persistent rule-breaking, criminality, substance misuse, unemployment, homelessness and relationship difficulties., Objectives, To evaluate the potential beneficial and adverse effects of pharmacological interventions for people with AsPD., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to September 2009), EMBASE (1980 to 2009, week 37), CINAHL (1982 to September 2009), PsycINFO (1872 to September 2009) , ASSIA (1987 to September 2009) , BIOSIS (1985 to September 2009), COPAC (September 2009), National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts (1970 to July 2008), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to September 2009), ISI-Proceedings (1981 to September 2009), Science Citation Index (1981 to September 2009), Social Science Citation Index (1981 to September 2009), SIGLE (1980 to April 2006), Dissertation Abstracts (September 2009), ZETOC (September 2009) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (September 2009)., Selection criteria, Controlled trials in which participants with AsPD were randomly allocated to a pharmacological intervention and a placebo control condition. Two trials comparing one drug against another without a placebo control are reported separately., Data collection and analysis, Three review authors independently selected studies. Two review authors independently extracted data. We calculated mean differences, with odds ratios for dichotomous data., Main results, Eight studies met the inclusion criteria involving 394 participants with AsPD. Data were available from four studies involving 274 participants with AsPD. No study set out to recruit participants solely on the basis of having AsPD, and in only one study was the sample entirely of AsPD participants. Eight different drugs were examined in eight studies. Study quality was relatively poor. Inadequate reporting meant the data available were generally insufficient to allow any independent statistical analysis. The findings are limited to descriptive summaries based on analyses carried out and reported by the trial investigators. All the available data were derived from unreplicated single reports. Only three drugs (nortriptyline, bromocriptine, phenytoin) were effective compared to placebo in terms of improvement in at least one outcome. Nortriptyline was reported in one study as superior for men with alcohol dependency on mean number of drinking days and on alcohol dependence, but not for severity of alcohol misuse or on the patient's or clinician's rating of drinking. In the same study, both nortriptyline and bromocriptine were reported as superior to placebo on anxiety on one scale but not on another. In one study, phenytoin was reported as superior to placebo on the frequency and intensity of aggressive acts in male prisoners with impulsive (but not premeditated) aggression. In the remaining two studies, both amantadine and desipramine were not superior to placebo for adults with opioid and cocaine dependence, and desipramine was not superior to placebo for men with cocaine dependence., Authors' conclusions, The body of evidence summarised in this review is insufficient to allow any conclusion to be drawn about the use of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder.","Najat Khalifa, Conor Duggan, Jutta Stoffers, Nick Huband, Birgit A.

716,"Background, Telerehabilitation, an emerging method, extends rehabilitative care beyond the hospital, and facilitates multifaceted, often psychotherapeutic approaches to modern management of patients using telecommunication technology at home or in the community. Although a wide range of telerehabilitation interventions are trialed in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), evidence for their effectiveness is unclear., Objectives, To investigate the effectiveness and safety of telerehabilitation intervention in pwMS for improved patient outcomes. Specifically, this review addresses the following questions: does telerehabilitation achieve better outcomes compared with traditional face-to-face intervention; and what types of telerehabilitation interventions are effective, in which setting and influence which specific outcomes (impairment, activity limitation and participation)?, Search methods, We performed a literature search using the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Review Group Specialised Register( 9 July, 2014.) We handsearched the relevant journals and screened the reference lists of identified studies, and contacted authors for additional data., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that reported telerehabilitation intervention/s in pwMS and compared them with some form of control intervention (such as lower level or different types of intervention, minimal intervention, waiting-list controls or no treatment (or usual care); interventions given in different settings) in adults with MS., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. Three review authors assessed the methodological quality of studies using the GRADEpro software () for best-evidence synthesis. A meta-analysis was not possible due to marked methodological, clinical and statistical heterogeneity between included trials and between measurement tools used. Hence, we performed a best-evidence synthesis using a qualitative analysis., Main results, Nine RCTs, one with two reports, (N = 531 participants, 469 included in analyses) investigated a variety of telerehabilitation interventions in adults with MS. The mean age of participants varied from 41 to 52 years (mean 46.5 years) and mean years since diagnosis from 7.7 to 19.0 years (mean 12.3 years). The majority of the participants were women (proportion ranging from 56% to 87%, mean 74%) and with a relapsing-remitting course of MS. These interventions were complex, with more than one rehabilitation component and included physical activity, educational, behavioural and symptom management programmes., Authors' conclusions, There is currently limited evidence on the efficacy of telerehabilitation in improving functional activities, fatigue and quality of life in adults with MS. A range of telerehabilitation interventions might be an alternative method of delivering services in MS populations. There is insufficient evidence to support on what types of telerehabilitation interventions are effective, and in which setting. More robust trials are needed to build evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of these interventions.","Fary Khan, Bhasker Amatya, Jurg Kesselring, Mary Galea (2015).

Multidisciplinary rehabilitation aims to improve outcomes for women but the evidence base for its effectiveness is yet to be established., Objectives, To assess the effects of organised multidisciplinary rehabilitation during follow-up in women treated for breast cancer., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro and LILACS in December 2011., Selection criteria, Randomised and controlled clinical trials (RCTs, CCTs, respectively) that compared multidisciplinary rehabilitation with some form of control intervention (such as a lower level or different type of intervention, minimal intervention, waiting list controls or no treatment, interventions given in different settings)., Data collection and analysis, The type of data retrieved did not allow for quantitative synthesis and therefore a narrative synthesis was provided. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated by three authors using the risk of bias tool., Main results, Two RCTs, including 262 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Both trials scored poorly for methodological quality. There was 'low level' evidence that multidisciplinary rehabilitation produced short-term gains at the levels of impairment (that is range of shoulder movement), psychosocial adjustment and quality of life after breast cancer treatment (up to 12 months). No evidence was available for the longer-term functional outcomes for caregivers or the cost effectiveness of these programmes. It was not possible to suggest the most appropriate frequency and duration of therapy or choice of one type of intervention over another., Authors' conclusions, There was 'low level' evidence that multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve the outcomes of people with breast cancer in terms of functional ability, psychosocial adjustment and participation in social activities. There was no evidence available on functional gain at the level of activity. This review highlights the limitations of RCTs in rehabilitation settings and the need for high-quality trial-based research in this area.

718,"Background, Brain tumours can cause significant disability, which may be amenable to multidisciplinary rehabilitation. However, the evidence base for this is unclear. This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [2013, Issue 1, Art. No. CD009509] on 'Multidisciplinary rehabilitation after primary brain tumour treatment'., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in people after primary brain tumour treatment, especially the types of approaches that are effective (settings, intensity)., Search methods, For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library up to Issue 12 of 12, 2014), MEDLINE (1950 to January week 2, 2015), EMBASE (1980 to January week 2, 2015), PEDro (1985 to January week 2 2015), and LILACS (1982 to January week 2, 2015). We checked the bibliographies of papers we identified and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to seek published and unpublished trials., Selection criteria, Controlled clinical trials (randomised and non-randomised clinical trials) that compared multidisciplinary rehabilitation in primary brain tumour with either routinely available local services or lower levels of intervention, or studies that compared multidisciplinary rehabilitation in different settings or at different levels of intensity., Data collection and analysis, Three review authors independently assessed study quality, extracted data, and performed a 'best evidence' synthesis based on methodological quality., Main results, We did not identify any studies for inclusion in the previous version of this review. For this update, the literature search identified one low-quality controlled clinical trial involving 106 participants. The findings from this study suggest 'low-level' evidence to support high-intensity ambulatory (outpatient) multidisciplinary rehabilitation in reducing short- and long-term motor disability (continence, mobility and locomotion, cognition), when compared with standard outpatient care. We found improvement in some domains of disability (continence, communication) and psychosocial gains were maintained at six months follow-up. We found no evidence for improvement in overall participation (quality of life and societal relationship). No adverse events were reported as a result of multidisciplinary rehabilitation. We found no evidence for improvement in quality of life or cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation. It was also not possible to suggest best 'dose' of therapy., Authors' conclusions, Since the last version of this review, one new study has been identified for inclusion. The best evidence to date comes from this CCT, which provides low quality evidence that higher intensity ambulatory (outpatient) multidisciplinary rehabilitation reduces short- and long-term disability in people with brain tumour compared with standard outpatient care. Our conclusions are tentative at best, given gaps in current research in this area. Although the strength of evidence has increased with the identification of a new controlled clinical trial in this updated review, further research is needed into appropriate and robust study designs; outcome measurement; caregiver needs; evaluation of optimal settings; type, intensity, duration of therapy; and cost-effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in the brain tumour population.","Fary Khan, Bhasker Amatya, Louisa Ng, Kate Drummond, Mary Galea (2017).

We checked the bibliographies of papers identified and contacted their authors and known experts in the field seeking published and unpublished trials., Selection criteria, Randomised and controlled clinical trials that compared multidisciplinary care in Guillain-Barre syndrome with either routinely available local services or lower levels of intervention, or studies that compared multidisciplinary care in different settings or at different levels of intensity., Data collection and analysis, We performed a 'best evidence' synthesis based on methodological quality., Main results, No randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials were identified. We summarised the results of three observational studies in the Discussion section of this review., Authors' conclusions, In the absence of randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials, the 'best' evidence to date comes from three 'very low quality' observational studies. These provide some support for improved disability in the short term (less than 6 months) with high intensity inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation; and for improved quality of life, as measured by a reduction in handicap (participation). These conclusions are tentative and the gap in current research should not be interpreted as proof that multidisciplinary care is ineffective.

Although, the literature supports vocational rehabilitation (VR) approaches in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), the evidence for its effectiveness is yet to be established., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness of VR programs compared to alternative programs or care as usual on return to work, workability and employment in pwMS; to evaluate the cost effectiveness of these programs., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis Group's Trials Register (February 2011), PEDro (1990-2011), ISI Science Citation Index (1981-2011) the Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field trials Register and the National Health Service National Research Register., Selection criteria, Randomized and controlled clinical trials, including before - after controlled trials, that compare VR rehabilitation with alternative intervention such as standard or a lesser form of intervention or waitlist controls., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers selected trials and rated their methodological quality independently. A 'best evidence' synthesis was performed, based on methodological quality. Trials were grouped in terms of type and setting of VR programs., Main results, Two trials (one RCT and one CCT) (total 80 participants) met the review criteria. Both trials scored poorly on the methodological quality assessment. There was 'insufficient evidence' for VR programs for (a)'competitive employment', in altering rates of job retention, changes in employment, improvement in rates of re-entry into the labour force; (b) for altering 'work ability' by improving participants' confidence in the accommodation request process, or employability maturity or job seeking activity. No evidence could be assimilated for changes in proportions of persons in supported employment or on disability pensions, nor for cost-effectiveness., Authors' conclusions, There was inconclusive evidence to support VR for pwMS. However, the review highlights some of the challenges in providing VR for pwMS. Clinicians need to be aware of vocational issues, and to understand and manage barriers for maintaining employment. Proactive and timely VR programs should incorporate practical solutions to deal with work disability, workplace accommodation and educate employers, and the wider community. Liaison with policy makers is imperative for government initiatives that encourage work focused VR programs. Future research in VR should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials; on the development of appropriate and valid outcome measures; and on cost effectiveness of VR programs.","Fary Khan, Louisa Ng, Lynne TurnerStokes (2011).

721,"Background, Multidisciplinary (MD) rehabilitation is an important component of symptomatic and supportive treatment for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but evidence base for its effectiveness is yet to be established., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of organized MD rehabilitation in adults with MS. To explore rehabilitation approaches that are effective in different settings and the outcomes that are affected., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis Group's Trials Register (25 February 2011), PeDRO (1990 - 2011), the Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field trials Register, the National Health Service National Research Register (NRR) and relevant journals were handsearched. No language restrictions were applied., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT) that compared MD rehabilitation with routinely available local services or lower levels of intervention; or trials comparing interventions in different settings or at different levels of intensity., Data collection and analysis, Three reviewers selected trials and rated their methodological quality independently. A 'best evidence' synthesis based on methodological quality was performed. Trials were grouped in terms of setting and type of rehabilitation and duration of patient follow up., Main results, Ten trials (9 RCTs and 1 CCT) (954 participants and 73 caregivers) met the inclusion criteria. Eight RCTs scored well; while one RCT and one CCT scored poorly on the methodological quality assessment. Despite no change in the level of impairment, there was 'strong evidence' to support inpatient MD rehabilitation in producing short-term gains at the levels of activity (disability) and participation in patients with MS. There is 'moderate evidence' to support inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation programmes (compared with control wait-list groups) in improving disability; and bladder related activity and participation outcomes up to 12 months following MD rehabilitation intervention. For outpatient and home-based rehabilitation programmes there was 'limited evidence' for short-term improvements in symptoms and disability with high intensity programmes, which translated into improvement in participation and quality of life. For low intensity programmes conducted over a longer period there was 'strong evidence' for longer-term gains in quality of life; and also 'limited evidence' for benefits to carers. Although some studies reported potential for cost-savings, there is no convincing evidence regarding the long-term cost-effectiveness of these programmes. It was not possible to suggest best 'dose' of therapy or supremacy of one therapy over another. This review highlights the limitations of RCTs in rehabilitation settings and need for better designed randomized and multiple centre trials., Authors' conclusions, MD rehabilitation programmes do not change the level of impairment, but can improve the experience of people with MS in terms of activity and participation. Regular evaluation and assessment of these persons for rehabilitation is recommended. Further research into appropriate outcome measures, optimal intensity, frequency, cost and effectiveness of rehabilitation therapy over a longer time period is needed. Future research in rehabilitation should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials.","Fary Khan, Lynne TurnerStokes, Louisa Ng, Trevor Kilpatrick, Bhasker Amatya (2011).

722,"Background, Sexual offending is a serious social problem, a public health issue, and a major challenge for social policy. Victim surveys indicate high incidence and prevalence levels and it is accepted that there is a high proportion of hidden sexual victimisation. Surveys report high levels of psychiatric morbidity in survivors of sexual offences., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of pharmacological interventions on target sexual behaviour for people who have been convicted or are at risk of sexual offending., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 15 other databases in July 2014. We also searched two trials registers and requested details of unidentified, unpublished, or ongoing studies from investigators and other experts., Selection criteria, Prospective controlled trials of antilibidinal medications taken by individuals for the purpose of preventing sexual offences, where the comparator group received a placebo, no treatment, or 'standard care', including psychological treatment., Data collection and analysis, Pairs of authors, working independently, selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information, including details of methods and outcome data., Main results, We included seven studies with a total of 138 participants, with data available for 123. Sample sizes ranged from 9 to 37. Judgements for categories of risk of bias varied: concerns were greatest regarding allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, and incomplete outcome data (dropout rates in the five community-based studies ranged from 3% to 54% and results were usually analysed on a per protocol basis)., Authors' conclusions, We found only seven small trials (all published more than 20 years ago) that examined the effects of a limited number of drugs. Investigators reported issues around acceptance and adherence to treatment. We found no studies of the newer drugs currently in use, particularly SSRIs or GnRH analogues. Although there were some encouraging findings in this review, their limitations do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding pharmacological intervention as an effective intervention for reducing sexual offending.","Omer Khan, Michael Ferriter, Nick Huband, Melanie J.

723,"Background, People experiencing acute psychotic illnesses, especially those associated with agitated or violent behaviour, may require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation. Droperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic, has been used for this purpose in several countries., Objectives, To estimate the effects of droperidol, including its cost-effectiveness, when compared to placebo, other 'standard' or 'non-standard' treatments, or other forms of management of psychotic illness, in controlling acutely disturbed behaviour and reducing psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia-like illnesses., Search methods, We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (18 December 2015). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations and contacted authors of trials. We supplemented these electronic searches by handsearching reference lists and contacting both the pharmaceutical industry and relevant authors., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with useable data that compared droperidol to any other treatment for people acutely ill with suspected acute psychotic illnesses, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mixed affective disorders, the manic phase of bipolar disorder or a brief psychotic episode., Data collection and analysis, For included studies, we assessed quality, risk of bias and extracted data. We excluded data when more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE., Main results, We identified four relevant trials from the update search (previous version of this review included only two trials). When droperidol was compared with placebo, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes we found evidence of a clear difference (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31, high-quality evidence). There was a clear demonstration of reduced risk of needing additional medication after 60 minutes for the droperidol group (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.85, high-quality evidence). There was no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular arrhythmia (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31, moderate-quality evidence) and respiratory airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.52, low-quality evidence) than placebo. For 'being ready for discharge', there was no clear difference between groups (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48, high-quality evidence). There were no data for mental state and costs., Authors' conclusions, Previously, the use of droperidol was justified based on experience rather than evidence from well-conducted and reported randomised trials. However, this update found high-quality evidence with minimal risk of bias to support the use of droperidol for acute psychosis. Also, we found no evidence to suggest that droperidol should not be a treatment option for people acutely ill and disturbed because of serious mental illnesses.","Mariam A.

724,"Background, Psychotic disorders can lead some people to become agitated. Characterised by restlessness, excitability and irritability, this can result in verbal and physically aggressive behaviour - and both can be prolonged. Aggression within the psychiatric setting imposes a significant challenge to clinicians and risk to service users; it is a frequent cause for admission to inpatient facilities. If people continue to be aggressive it can lengthen hospitalisation. Haloperidol is used to treat people with long-term aggression., Objectives, To examine whether haloperidol alone, administered orally, intramuscularly or intravenously, is an effective treatment for long-term/persistent aggression in psychosis., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2011 and April 2015)., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) or double blind trials (implying randomisation) with useable data comparing haloperidol with another drug or placebo for people with psychosis and long-term/persistent aggression., Data collection and analysis, One review author (AK) extracted data. For dichotomous data, one review author (AK) calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a fixed-effect model. One review author (AK) assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE., Main results, We have no good-quality evidence of the absolute effectiveness of haloperidol for people with long-term aggression. One study randomising 110 chronically aggressive people to three different antipsychotic drugs met the inclusion criteria. When haloperidol was compared with olanzapine or clozapine, skewed data (n=83) at high risk of bias suggested some advantage in terms of scale scores of unclear clinical meaning for olanzapine/clozapine for 'total aggression'. Data were available for only one other outcome, leaving the study early. When compared with other antipsychotic drugs, people allocated to haloperidol were no more likely to leave the study (1 RCT, n=110, RR 1.37, CI 0.84 to 2.24, low-quality evidence). Although there were some data for the outcomes listed above, there were no data on most of the binary outcomes and none on service outcomes (use of hospital/police), satisfaction with treatment, acceptance of treatment, quality of life or economics., Authors' conclusions, Only one study could be included and most data were heavily skewed, almost impossible to interpret and oflow quality. There were also some limitations in the study design with unclear description of allocation concealment and high risk of bias for selective reporting, so no firm conclusions can be made. This review shows how trials in this group of people are possible - albeit difficult. Further relevant trials are needed to evaluate use of haloperidol in treatment of long-term/persistent aggression in people living with psychosis.","Abha Khushu, Melanie J. Powney (2016).

725,"Background, People who suffer from severe mental disorder experience high rates of unemployment. Supported employment is an approach to vocational rehabilitation that involves trying to place clients in competitive jobs without any extended preparation. The Individual placement and support (IPS) model is a carefully specified form of supported employment., Objectives, 1. To review the effectiveness of supported employment compared with other approaches to vocational rehabilitation or treatment as usual., 2. Secondary objectives were to establish how far:, (a) fidelity to the IPS model affects the effectiveness of supported employment,, (b) the effectiveness of supported employment can be augmented by the addition of other interventions., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, handsearches and conference proceedings., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, of working age (normally 16 to 70 years), where supported employment was compared with other vocational approaches or treatment as usual. Outcomes such as days in employment, job stability, global state, social functioning, mental state, quality of life, satisfaction and costs were sought., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors (YK and KK) independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% (CI). We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. A random-effects model was also employed where heterogeneity was present., Main results, A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were included in this review (total 2265 people). In terms of our primary outcome (employment: days in competitive employment, over one year follow-up), supported employment seems to significantly increase levels of any employment obtained during the course of studies (7 RCTs, n = 951, RR 3.24 CI 2.17 to 4.82, very low quality of evidence). Supported employment also seems to increase length of competitive employment when compared with other vocational approaches (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 70.63 CI 43.22 to 94.04, very low quality evidence). Supported employment also showed some advantages in other secondary outcomes. It appears to increase length (in days) of any form of paid employment (2 RCTs, n = 510, MD 84.94 CI 51.99 to 117.89, very low quality evidence) and job tenure (weeks) for competitive employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 9.86 CI 5.36 to 14.36, very low quality evidence) and any paid employment (3 RCTs, n = 735, MD 3.86 CI -2.94 to 22.17, very low quality evidence). Furthermore, one study indicated a decreased time to first competitive employment in the long term for people in supported employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD -161.60 CI -225.73 to -97.47, very low quality evidence). A large amount of data were considerably skewed, and therefore not included in meta-analysis, which makes any meaningful interpretation of the vast amount of data very difficult., Authors' conclusions, The limited available evidence suggests that supported employment is effective in improving a number of vocational outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness, though there appears to exist some overall risk of bias in terms of the quality of individual studies. All studies should report a standard set of vocational and non-vocational outcomes that are relevant to the consumers and policy-makers. Studies with longer follow-up should be conducted to answer or address the critical question about durability of effects.","Yoshihiro Kinoshita, Toshi A.

726,"Background, It is controversial whether compulsory community treatment (CCT) for people with severe mental illness (SMI) reduces health service use, or improves clinical outcome and social functioning., Objectives, To examine the effectiveness of compulsory community treatment (CCT) for people with severe mental illness (SMI)., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (2003, 2008, 2012, 8 November 2013, 3 June 2016). We obtained all references of identified studies and contacted authors where necessary., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of CCT compared with standard care for people with SMI (mainly schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders, bipolar disorder, or depression with psychotic features). Standard care could be voluntary treatment in the community or another pre-existing form of CCT such as supervised discharge., Data collection and analysis, Authors independently selected studies, assessed their quality and extracted data. We used Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. For binary outcomes, we calculated a fixed-effect risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and, where possible, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). For continuous outcomes, we calculated a fixed-effect mean difference (MD) and its 95% CI. We used the GRADE approach to create 'Summary of findings' tables for key outcomes and assessed the risk of bias of these findings., Main results, The review included three studies (n = 749). Two were based in the USA and one in England. The English study had the least bias, meeting three out of the seven criteria of Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. The two other studies met only one criterion, the majority being rated unclear., Authors' conclusions, These review data show CCT results in no clear difference in service use, social functioning or quality of life compared with voluntary care or brief supervised discharge. People receiving CCT were, however, less likely to be victims of violent or non-violent crime. It is unclear whether this benefit is due to the intensity of treatment or its compulsory nature. Short periods of conditional leave may be as effective (or non-effective) as formal compulsory treatment in the community. Evaluation of a wide range of outcomes should be considered when this legislation is introduced. However, conclusions are based on three relatively small trials, with high or unclear risk of blinding bias, and low- to moderate-quality evidence. In addition, clinical trials may not fully reflect the potential benefits of this complex intervention.","Steve R. Kisely, Leslie A. Campbell, Richard O'Reilly (2017).

727,"Background, Trifluoperazine is a long-established high potency typical antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses., Objectives, To determine absolute effects of trifluoperazine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses compared with placebo., Search methods, Searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials (July 2012), supplemented with handsearching, reference searching, personal communication and contact with industry. Two review authors undertook a search for economic studies using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Health Economic Database (CSzGHED) on the 9th April 2013., Selection criteria, All available clinical randomised trials involving people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses that compare trifluoperazine with placebo., Data collection and analysis, Studies for the effects of interventions were reliably selected by a review team and data were doubly independently extracted to reduce bias. We only used dichotomous data, using intention-to-treat analysis when possible. Data were estimated using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A 'Summary of findings' table was produced, where possible, for each primary outcome using GRADE. Economic studies were searched and reliably selected by review authors (VF and SS) to provide an economic summary of available data. Where no relevant economic studies were eligible for inclusion, the economic review team valued the already-included effectiveness outcome data to provide a rudimentary economic summary., Main results, This review included 10 studies with a total number of 686 participants featuring in 20 different outcomes of interest. Overall, there was significant clinical improvement in clinical global state at medium term amongst people receiving trifluoperazine (3 RCTs, n = 417, RR 4.61, CI 1.54 to 13.84, low quality evidence) and significantly fewer people receiving trifluoperazine left the studies early due to relapse or worsening at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 381, RR 0.34, CI 0.23 to 0.49, low quality evidence). However, results were equivocal for leaving the study early at medium term for any reason (2 RCTs, n = 391, RR 0.80, CI 0.17 to 3.81, very low quality evidence) and due to severe adverse effects (2 RCTs, n = 391, RR 1.54, CI 0.56 to 4.24, very low quality evidence). Equivocal data were also found for intensified symptoms at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 80, RR 1.05, CI 0.54 to 2.05, very low quality evidence) and rates of agitation or distress again at medium term (1 RCT, n = 52, RR 2.00, CI 0.19 to 20.72, very low quality evidence). Comparison between low and high-dose trifluoperazine with placebo from a single study provided equivocal evidence of effects. For economic outcomes, we valued outcomes in GBP terms and presented them in additional tables; there was an estimated saving of [pounds]3488.3 in favour of trifluoperazine. However, numerous assumptions were made and these savings need to be interpreted in light of those assumptions., Authors' conclusions, Our results agree with existing evidence that compared to placebo, trifluoperazine is an effective antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia. Furthermore, our review provides supportive evidence that trifluoperazine increases the risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Although the effect sizes against placebo are similar to those observed with other agents, they are based on data from many small, pre-CONSORT trials with generally either a low or very low GRADE evidence that has limited implication for clinical practice. Large, independent trials are needed that adhere to the CONSORT statement to compare trifluoperazine with placebo used in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses.","Kai Koch, Kamel Mansi, Euan Haynes, Clive E.

728,"Background, In many countries of the industrialised world second generation ('atypical') antipsychotics have become the first line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether, and if so how much, the effects of the various second generation antipsychotics differ is a matter of debate. In this review we examined how the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine differs from that of other second generation antipsychotics., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of olanzapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis., Search methods, 1. Electronic searching, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO., Selection criteria, We included all randomised trials that used at least single-blind (rater-blind) design, comparing oral olanzapine with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a random effects model., Main results, The review currently includes 50 studies and 9476 participants which provided data for six comparisons (olanzapine compared to amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone or ziprasidone). The overall attrition from the included studies was considerable (49.2%) leaving the interpretation of results problematic., Authors' conclusions, Olanzapine may be a somewhat more efficacious drug than some other second generation antipsychotic drugs. This small superiority in efficacy needs to be weighed against a larger weight gain and associated metabolic problems than most other second generation antipsychotic drugs, except clozapine. These conclusions are tentative due to the large number of people leaving the studies early which possibly limits the validity of the findings. Further large, well-designed trials are necessary to establish the relative effects of different second generation antipsychotic drugs.","Katja Komossa, Christine RummelKluge, Heike Hunger, Franziska Schmid, Sandra Schwarz, Lorna Duggan, Werner Kissling, Stefan Leucht (2013).

The question as to whether and if so how much the effects of the various SGAs differ is a matter of debate. In this review we examined how the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone differs from that of other SGAs., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of risperidone compared with other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis., Search methods, 1. Electronic searching, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO., Selection criteria, We included all randomised, blinded trials comparing oral risperidone with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random-effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random-effects model., Main results, The review currently includes 45 blinded RCTs with 7760 participants. The number of RCTs available for each comparison varied: four studies compared risperidone with amisulpride, two with aripiprazole, 11 with clozapine, 23 with olanzapine, eleven with quetiapine, two with sertindole, three with ziprasidone and none with zotepine. Attrition from these studies was high (46.9%), leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Furthermore, 60% were industry sponsored, which can be a source of bias., Authors' conclusions, Risperidone seems to produce somewhat more extrapyramidal side effects and clearly more prolactin increase than most other SGAs. It may also differ from other compounds in efficacy and in the occurrence of other adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic problems, cardiac effects, sedation and seizures. Nevertheless, the large proportion of participants leaving studies early and incomplete reporting of outcomes makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Further large trials, especially comparing risperidone with those other new drugs for which only a few RCTs are available, are needed.","Katja Komossa, Christine RummelKluge, Sandra Schwarz, Franziska Schmid, Heike Hunger, Werner Kissling, Stefan Leucht (2013).

731,"Background, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders experienced in childhood and can persist into adulthood. The disorder has early onset and is characterized by a combination of overactive, poorly modulated behavior with marked inattention. In the long term it can impair academic performance, vocational success and social-emotional development. Meditation is increasingly used for psychological conditions and could be used as a tool for attentional training in the ADHD population., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of meditation therapies as a treatment for ADHD., Search strategy, Our extensive search included: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, C2-SPECTR, dissertation abstracts, LILACS, Virtual Health Library (VHL) in BIREME, Complementary and Alternative Medicine specific databases, HSTAT, Informit, JST, Thai Psychiatric databases and ISI Proceedings, plus grey literature and trial registries from inception to January 2010., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of meditation therapy in children or adults diagnosed with ADHD., Data collection and analysis, Two authors extracted data independently using a pre-designed data extraction form. We contacted study authors for additional information required. We analyzed data using mean difference (MD) to calculate the treatment effect. The results are presented in tables, figures and narrative form., Main results, Four studies, including 83 participants, are included in this review. Two studies used mantra meditation while the other two used yoga compared with drugs, relaxation training, non-specific exercises and standard treatment control. Design limitations caused high risk of bias across the studies. Only one out of four studies provided data appropriate for analysis. For this study there was no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the drug therapy group on the teacher rating ADHD scale (MD -2.72, 95% CI -8.49 to 3.05, 15 patients). Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the standard therapy group on the teacher rating ADHD scale (MD -0.52, 95% CI -5.88 to 4.84, 17 patients). There was also no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the standard therapy group in the distraction test (MD -8.34, 95% CI -107.05 to 90.37, 17 patients)., Authors' conclusions, As a result of the limited number of included studies, the small sample sizes and the high risk of bias, we are unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of meditation therapy for ADHD. The adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.","Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit, Chetta Ngamjarus, Chartree Witoonchart, Nawanant Piyavhatkul (2010).

732,"Background, In people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) there is considerable variation in symptoms, limitations and well-being, which often complicates medical care. To improve quality of life (QoL) and exercise tolerance, while reducing the number of exacerbations, a multidisciplinary program including different elements of care is needed., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of integrated disease management (IDM) programs or interventions in people with COPD on health-related QoL, exercise tolerance and number of exacerbations., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL for potentially eligible studies (last searched 12 April 2012)., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials evaluating IDM programs for COPD compared with controls were included. Included interventions consisted of multidisciplinary (two or more health care providers) and multi-treatment (two or more components) IDM programs with a duration of at least three months., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data; if required, we contacted authors for additional data. We performed meta-analyses using random-effects modeling. We carried out sensitivity analysis for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, study design and intention-to-treat analysis., Main results, A total of 26 trials involving 2997 people were included, with a follow-up ranging from 3 to 24 months. Studies were conducted in 11 different countries. The mean age of the included participants was 68 years, 68% were male and the mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)% predicted value was 44.3% (range 28% to 66%). Participants were treated in all types of healthcare settings: primary (n = 8), secondary (n = 12), tertiary care (n = 1), and in both primary and secondary care (n = 5). Overall, the studies were of high to moderate methodological quality., Authors' conclusions, In these COPD participants, IDM not only improved disease-specific QoL and exercise capacity, but also reduced hospital admissions and hospital days per person.","Annemarije L.

733,"Background, Schizophrenia often presents in adolescence, but current treatment guidelines are based largely on studies of adults with psychosis. Over the past decade, the number of studies on treatment of adolescent-onset psychosis has increased. The current systematic review collates and critiques evidence obtained on the use of various atypical antipsychotic medications for adolescents with psychosis., Objectives, To investigate the effects of atypical antipsychotic medications in adolescents with psychosis. We reviewed in separate analyses various comparisons of atypical antipsychotic medications with placebo or a typical antipsychotic medication or another atypical antipsychotic medication or the same atypical antipsychotic medication but at a lower dose., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (October 2011), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies and contacted study authors and relevant pharmaceutical companies to ask for more information., Selection criteria, We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared atypical antipsychotic medication with placebo or another pharmacological intervention or with psychosocial interventions, standard psychiatric treatment or no intervention in children and young people aged 13 to 18 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, acute and transient psychoses or unspecified psychosis. We included studies published in English and in other languages that were available in standardised databases., Data collection and analysis, Review authors AK and SSD selected the studies, rated the quality of the studies and performed data extraction. For dichotomous data, we estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed-effect model. When possible, for binary data presented in the 'Summary of findings' table, we calculated illustrative comparative risks. We summated continuous data using the mean difference (MD). Risk of bias was assessed for included studies., Main results, We included 13 RCTs, with a total of 1112 participants. We found no data on service utilisation, economic outcomes, behaviour or cognitive response. Trials were classified into the following groups., Authors' conclusions, No convincing evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic medications are superior to typical medications for the treatment of adolescents with psychosis. However, atypical antipsychotic medications may be more acceptable to young people because fewer symptomatic adverse effects are seen in the short term. Little evidence is available to support the superiority of one atypical antipsychotic medication over another, but side effect profiles are different for different medications. Treatment with olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine is often associated with weight gain. Aripiprazole is not associated with increased prolactin or with dyslipidaemia. Adolescents may respond better to standard-dose as opposed to lower-dose risperidone, but for aripiprazole and ziprasidone, lower doses may be equally effective. Future trials should ensure uniform ways of reporting.","Ajit Kumar, Soumitra S. Datta, Stephen D. Wright, Vivek A. Furtado, Paul S. Russell (2013).

735,"Background, Cognitive impairment in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) could affect multiple facets of their daily functioning. Cognitive rehabilitation brings about clinically significant improvement in certain cognitive skills. However, it is uncertain if these improved cognitive skills lead to betterments in other key aspects of daily living. We evaluated whether cognitive rehabilitation for people with TBI improves return to work, independence in daily activities, community integration and quality of life., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on return to work, independence in daily activities, community integration (occupational outcomes) and quality of life in people with traumatic brain injury, and to determine which cognitive rehabilitation strategy better achieves these outcomes., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library; 2017, Issue 3), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and clinical trials registries up to 30 March 2017., Selection criteria, We identified all available randomized controlled trials of cognitive rehabilitation compared with any other non-pharmacological intervention for people with TBI. We included studies that reported at least one outcome related to : return to work, independence in activities of daily living (ADL), community integration and quality of life., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We evaluated heterogeneity among the included studies and performed meta-analysis only when we could include more than one study in a comparison. We used the online computer programme GRADEpro to assess the quality of evidence, and generate 'Summary of findings' tables., Main results, We included nine studies with 790 participants. Three trials (160 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation versus no treatment, four trials (144 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation versus conventional treatment, one trial (120 participants) compared hospital-based cognitive rehabilitation versus home programme and one trial (366 participants) compared one cognitive strategy versus another. Among the included studies, we judged three to be of low risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient good-quality evidence to support the role of cognitive rehabilitation when compared to no intervention or conventional rehabilitation in improving return to work, independence in ADL, community integration or quality of life in adults with TBI. There is moderate-quality evidence that cognitive rehabilitation provided as a home programme is similar to hospital-based cognitive rehabilitation in improving return to work status among active duty military personnel with moderate-to-severe TBI. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that one cognitive rehabilitation strategy (cognitive didactic) is no better than another (functional experiential) in achieving return to work in veterans or military personnel with TBI.","Suresh K.

736,"Background, Apathy is a deficiency in overt behavioural, emotional and cognitive components of goal-directed behaviour. It is a common occurrence after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with widespread impact. We have systematically reviewed studies examining the effectiveness of interventions for apathy in the TBI population., Objectives, To investigate the effectiveness of interventions for apathy in adults who have sustained a TBI. This was evaluated by changes in behavioural, cognitive and emotional measures of apathy., Search strategy, We searched the following databases up to January 2008: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, ACP Journal Club, MEDLINE (1950 to Jan 2008), EMBASE (1980 to Jan 2008), PsycINFO (1806 to Jan 2008), CINAHL (1982 Jan 2008), PsycBITE, AMED (1985 to Jan 2008), -trials.com, and Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register was searched to Jan 2009. Additionally, we examined key conference proceedings and reference lists of included trials to identify further studies meeting the inclusion criteria., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions specifically targeting apathy for people with TBI., Data collection and analysis, Two authors (ALB and RLT) independently assessed studies for inclusion. We rated the methodological quality of included studies and extracted data., Main results, We identified one trial that satisfied the inclusion criteria for this review. This trial (N = 21) showed that cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) decreased inertia, which is a component of apathy, while no changes were seen in the sham treatment or no treatment control groups. Given that no between-group analysis was reported, it was not possible to determine if the CES treatment group improved significantly more than the control group., Authors' conclusions, No evidence was provided to support the use of CES treatment for inertia, a component of apathy. Between-group statistical analyses were not conducted and it was therefore not possible to determine the efficacy of the treatment relative to no treatment or sham treatment. Results regarding the effectiveness of treatment can only be inferred, and this evidence is based on only one trial with a small sample size. More randomised controlled trials evaluating different ways of treating apathy would be valuable. Trials should have larger sample sizes and use rigorous research designs and statistical analyses appropriate for examining between-group differences.","Amanda LaneBrown, Robyn Tate (2009).

739,"Background, Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterised by persistent, medically unexplained fatigue, as well as symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, headaches and impaired concentration and short-term memory. CFS presents as a common, debilitating and serious health problem. Treatment may include physical interventions, such as exercise therapy, which was last reviewed in 2004., Objectives, The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy (ET) for patients with CFS as compared with any other intervention or control., Search methods, We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and SPORTDiscus up to May 2014 using a comprehensive list of free-text terms for CFS and exercise. We located unpublished or ongoing trials through the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to May 2014). We screened reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field for additional studies, Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials involving adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS who were able to participate in exercise therapy. Studies had to compare exercise therapy with passive control, psychological therapies, adaptive pacing therapy or pharmacological therapy., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessments and data extraction. We combined continuous measures of outcomes using mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs). We combined serious adverse reactions and drop-outs using risk ratios (RRs). We calculated an overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome., Main results, We have included eight randomised controlled studies and have reported data from 1518 participants in this review. Three studies diagnosed individuals with CFS using the 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); five used the Oxford criteria. Exercise therapy lasted from 12 to 26 weeks. Seven studies used variations of aerobic exercise therapy such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing provided at mixed levels in terms of intensity of the aerobic exercise from very low to quite rigorous, whilst one study used anaerobic exercise. Control groups consisted of passive control (eight studies; e.g. treatment as usual, relaxation, flexibility) or CBT (two studies), cognitive therapy (one study), supportive listening (one study), pacing (one study), pharmacological treatment (one study) and combination treatment (one study). Risk of bias varied across studies, but within each study, little variation was found in the risk of bias across our primary and secondary outcome measures., Authors' conclusions, Patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy, and no evidence suggests that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes. A positive effect with respect to sleep, physical function and self-perceived general health has been observed, but no conclusions for the outcomes of pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression, drop-out rate and health service resources were possible. The effectiveness of exercise therapy seems greater than that of pacing but similar to that of CBT. Randomised trials with low risk of bias are needed to investigate the type, duration and intensity of the most beneficial exercise intervention.","Lillebeth Larun, G.

740,"Background, While maternal, infant and under-five child mortality rates in developing countries have declined significantly in the past two to three decades, newborn mortality rates have reduced much more slowly. While it is recognised that almost half of the newborn deaths can be prevented by scaling up evidence-based available interventions (such as tetanus toxoid immunisation to mothers, clean and skilled care at delivery, newborn resuscitation, exclusive breastfeeding, clean umbilical cord care, and/or management of infections in newborns), many require facility-based and outreach services. It has also been stated that a significant proportion of these mortalities and morbidities could also be potentially addressed by developing community-based packaged interventions which should also be supplemented by developing and strengthening linkages with the local health systems. Some of the recent community-based studies of interventions targeting women of reproductive age have shown variable impacts on maternal outcomes and hence it is uncertain if these strategies have consistent benefit across the continuum of maternal and newborn care., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of community-based intervention packages in reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality; and improving neonatal outcomes., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2014), World Bank's JOLIS (25 May 2014), BLDS at IDS and IDEAS database of unpublished working papers (25 May 2014), Google and Google Scholar (25 May 2014)., Selection criteria, All prospective randomised, cluster-randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effectiveness of community-based intervention packages in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidities, and improving neonatal outcomes., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. Data were checked for accuracy., Main results, The review included 26 cluster-randomised/quasi-randomised trials, covering a wide range of interventional packages, including two subsets from three trials. Assessment of risk of bias in these studies suggests concerns regarding insufficient information on sequence generation and regarding failure to adequately address incomplete outcome data, particularly from randomised controlled trials. We incorporated data from these trials using generic inverse variance method in which logarithms of risk ratio (RR) estimates were used along with the standard error of the logarithms of RR estimates., Authors' conclusions, Our review offers encouraging evidence that community-based intervention packages reduce morbidity for women, mortality and morbidity for babies, and improves care-related outcomes particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It has highlighted the value of integrating maternal and newborn care in community settings through a range of interventions, which can be packaged effectively for delivery through a range of community health workers and health promotion groups. While the importance of skilled delivery and facility-based services for maternal and newborn care cannot be denied, there is sufficient evidence to scale up community-based care through packages which can be delivered by a range of community-based workers.","Zohra S.

741,"Background, A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. Activities of daily living (ADL) are daily home-based activities that people carry out to maintain health and well-being. ADLs include the ability to: eat and drink unassisted, move, go to the toilet, carry out personal hygiene tasks, dress unassisted, and groom. Stroke causes impairment-related functional limitations that may result in difficulties participating in ADLs independent of supervision, direction, or physical assistance., Objectives, To assess the effects of occupational therapy interventions on the functional ability of adults with stroke in the domain of activities of daily living, compared with no intervention or standard care/practice., Search methods, For this update, we searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 30 January 2017), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane LibraryJanuary 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to 5 January 2017), Embase (1974 to 5 January 2017), CINAHL (1937 to January 2017), PsycINFO (1806 to 2 November 2016), AMED (1985 to 1 November 2016), and Web of Science (1900 to 6 January 2017). We also searched grey literature and clinical trials registers., Selection criteria, We identified randomised controlled trials of an occupational therapy intervention (compared with no intervention or standard care/practice) where people with stroke practiced activities of daily living, or where performance in activities of daily living was the focus of the occupational therapy intervention., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data for prespecified outcomes. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants who had deteriorated or were dependent in personal activities of daily living and performance in activities of daily living at the end of follow-up., Main results, We included nine studies with 994 participants in this update. Occupational therapy targeted towards activities of daily living after stroke increased performance scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.31, P = 0.02; 7 studies; 749 participants; low-quality evidence) and reduced the risk of poor outcome (death, deterioration or dependency in personal activities of daily living) (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96; P = 0.03; 5 studies; 771 participants; low-quality evidence). We also found that those who received occupational therapy were more independent in extended activities of daily living (OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.37); P = 0.005; 5 studies; 665 participants; low-quality evidence). Occupational therapy did not influence mortality (OR: 1.02 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.61); P = 0.93; 8 studies; 950 participants), or reduce the combined odds of death and institutionalisation (OR 0.89 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.32); P = 0.55; 4 studies; 671 participants), or death and dependency (OR 0.89 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.23); P = 0.47; 4 trials; 659 participants). Occupational therapy did not improve mood or distress scores (OR 0.08 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.26); P = 0.35; 4 studies; 519 participants; low-quality evidence). There were insufficient data to determine the effects of occupational therapy on health-related quality of life. We found no studies of consenting carers prior to study participation and therefore there were no carer-related outcomes in our review. There were insufficient data to determine participants' and carers' satisfaction with services., Authors' conclusions, We found low-quality evidence that occupational therapy targeted towards activities of daily living after stroke can improve performance in activities of daily living and reduce the risk of deterioration in these abilities. Because the included studies had methodological flaws, this research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect of occupational therapy for adults with stroke.","Lynn A.

742,"Background, The symptoms and signs of schizophrenia have been firmly linked to high levels of dopamine in specific areas of the brain (limbic system). Antipsychotic drugs block the transmission of dopamine in the brain and reduce the acute symptoms of the disorder. This review examined whether antipsychotic drugs are also effective for relapse prevention., Objectives, To review the effects of maintaining antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia compared to withdrawing these agents., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Specialised Register (November 2008), with additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and clinicaltrials.gov (June 2011)., Selection criteria, We included all randomised trials comparing maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs and placebo for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random-effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) again based on a random-effects model., Main results, The review currently includes 65 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 6493 participants comparing antipsychotic medication with placebo. The trials were published from 1959 to 2011 and their size ranged between 14 and 420 participants. In many studies the methods of randomisation, allocation and blinding were poorly reported. Although this and other potential sources of bias limited the overall quality, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs for maintenance treatment in schizophrenia was clear. Antipsychotic drugs were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse at seven to 12 months (primary outcome; drug 27%, placebo 64%, 24 RCTs, n=2669, RR 0.40 CI 0.33 to 0.49, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB 3 CI 2 to 3). Hospitalisation was also reduced, however, the baseline risk was lower (drug 10%, placebo 26%, 16 RCTs, n=2090, RR 0.38 CI 0.27 to 0.55, NNT 5 CI 4 to 9). More participants in the placebo group than in the antipsychotic drug group left the studies early due to any reason (at 7-12 months: drug 38%, placebo 66%, 18 RCTs, n=2420, RR 0.55 CI 0.46 to 0.66, NNTB 4 CI 3 to 5) and due to inefficacy of treatment (at 7-12 months: drug 20%, placebo 50%, 18 RCTs, n=2420, RR 0.36 CI 0.28 to 0.45, NNTB 3 CI 2 to 4). Quality of life was better in drug-treated participants (3 RCTs, n=527, SMD -0.62 CI -1.15 to -0.09). Conversely, antipsychotic drugs as a group and irrespective of duration, were associated with more participants experiencing movement disorders (e.g. at least one movement disorder: drug 16%, placebo 9%, 22 RCTs, n=3411, RR 1.55 CI 1.25 to 1.93, NNTH 25 CI 13 to 100), sedation (drug 13%, placebo 9%, 10 RCTs, n=146, RR 1.50 CI 1.22 to 1.84, number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) not significant) and weight gain (drug 10%, placebo 6%, 10 RCTs, n=321, RR 2.07 CI 1.31 to 3.25, NNTH 20 CI 14 to 33). The results of the primary outcome were robust in a number of subgroup, meta-regression and sensitivity analyses, the main exception being that the drug-placebo difference in longer trials was smaller than in shorter trials., Authors' conclusions, The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of antipsychotic drugs compared to placebo in preventing relapse. This effect must be weighed against the side effects of antipsychotic drugs. Future studies should focus on outcomes of social participation and clarify the long-term morbidity and mortality associated with these drugs.","Stefan Leucht, Magdolna Tardy, Katja Komossa, Stephan Heres, Werner Kissling, John M.

743,"Background, People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are believed be at higher risk of problems with sexual function than age-matched peers. Problems with sexuality or sexual function associated with COPD may arise as a results of hormonal, physiological, or psychological problems, or as a result of changes in intimate relationships arising from the chronic nature of the condition., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for sexual dysfunction in people with COPD., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register on 8 July 2015 and conducted supplementary searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, four other databases, and two trials registers to July 2015, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We used no language or date restrictions., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effects of pharmacological, mechanical, psychological, or educational interventions to address problems with sexual well-being in people with COPD and their partners., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently reviewed search results against predetermined inclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information., Main results, We included two studies involving a total of 48 participants. One of these studies (an RCT) investigated the effect of a pharmacological intervention (testosterone therapy) compared to a placebo over a four-month period. The other study (a quasi-RCT) compared one month of long-term oxygen therapy to a single 24-hour dose of oxygen therapy over a one-month period. Both studies only included men with moderate to very severe COPD (mean FEV1% across both studies 41%; standard deviation (SD) 11.7%) who were under the age of 74 (mean age across both studies 65 years; SD 7.1). We found low-quality evidence that testosterone therapy for men with COPD results in improvements in erectile function, but no evidence of effect regarding overall satisfaction with sexual function. There is insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding the possibility of adverse events arising from testosterone therapy for COPD or the effect of oxygen therapy on erectile dysfunction. Neither study provided additional data on sexual function, other than erectile function., Authors' conclusions, There is currently insufficient evidence from clinical trials at present to inform the best way of providing interventions to improve sexual function and sexual satisfaction for people with COPD and their partners. Consequently, clinicians need to rely on clinical trials involving people without COPD and expert opinion in order to guide clinical practice in this area. Considerably more trials need to be conducted in this area of clinical practice.","M. M. William Levack, Betty Poot, Mark Weatherall, Justin Travers (2015).

We did not impose any language or date restrictions., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effects of goal setting or strategies to enhance goal pursuit in the context of adult rehabilitation for acquired disability., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently reviewed search results for inclusion.

Studies ranged widely regarding clinical context and participants' primary health conditions. The most common health conditions included musculoskeletal disorders, brain injury, chronic pain, mental health conditions, and cardiovascular disease., Authors' conclusions, There is some very low quality evidence that goal setting may improve some outcomes for adults receiving rehabilitation for acquired disability. The best of this evidence appears to favour positive effects for psychosocial outcomes (i.e. health-related quality of life, emotional status, and self-efficacy) rather than physical ones.

747,"Background, Shift work results in sleep-wake disturbances, which cause sleepiness during night shifts and reduce sleep length and quality in daytime sleep after the night shift. In its serious form it is also called shift work sleep disorder. Various pharmacological products are used to ameliorate symptoms of sleepiness or poor sleep length and quality., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of pharmacological interventions to reduce sleepiness or to improve alertness at work and decrease sleep disturbances whilst off work, or both, in workers undertaking shift work in their present job and to assess their cost-effectiveness., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and PsycINFO up to 20 September 2013 and ClinicalTrials.gov up to July 2013. We also screened reference lists of included trials and relevant reviews., Selection criteria, We included all eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross-over RCTs, of pharmacological products among workers who were engaged in shift work (including night shifts) in their present jobs and who may or may not have had sleep problems. Primary outcomes were sleep length and sleep quality while off work, alertness and sleepiness, or fatigue at work., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included trials. We performed meta-analyses where appropriate., Main results, We included 15 randomised placebo-controlled trials with 718 participants. Nine trials evaluated the effect of melatonin and two the effect of hypnotics for improving sleep problems. One trial assessed the effect of modafinil, two of armodafinil and one examined caffeine plus naps to decrease sleepiness or to increase alertness., Authors' conclusions, There is low quality evidence that melatonin improves sleep length after a night shift but not other sleep quality parameters. Both modafinil and armodafinil increase alertness and reduce sleepiness to some extent in employees who suffer from shift work sleep disorder but they are associated with adverse events. Caffeine plus naps reduces sleepiness during the night shift, but the quality of evidence is low. Based on one low quality trial, hypnotics did not improve sleep length and quality after a night shift.","Juha Liira, Jos H. Verbeek, Giovanni Costa, Tim R. Driscoll, Mikael Sallinen, Leena K.

748,"Background, In some countries extracts of the plant Hypericum perforatum L. (popularly called St. John's wort) are widely used for treating patients with depressive symptoms., Objectives, To investigate whether extracts of hypericum are more effective than placebo and as effective as standard antidepressants in the treatment of major depression; and whether they have fewer adverse effects than standard antidepressant drugs., Search methods, Trials were searched in computerised databases, by checking bibliographies of relevant articles, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers., Selection criteria, Trials were included if they: (1) were randomised and double-blind; (2) included patients with major depression; (3) compared extracts of St. John's wort with placebo or standard antidepressants; (4) included clinical outcomes assessing depressive symptoms., Data collection and analysis, At least two independent reviewers extracted information from study reports. The main outcome measure for assessing effectiveness was the responder rate ratio (the relative risk of having a response to treatment). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of patients dropping out due to adverse effects., Main results, A total of 29 trials (5489 patients) including 18 comparisons with placebo and 17 comparisons with synthetic standard antidepressants met the inclusion criteria. Results of placebo-controlled trials showed marked heterogeneity. In nine larger trials the combined response rate ratio (RR) for hypericum extracts compared with placebo was 1.28 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10 to 1.49) and from nine smaller trials was 1.87 (95% CI, 1.22 to 2.87). Results of trials comparing hypericum extracts and standard antidepressants were statistically homogeneous. Compared with tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), respectively, RRs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.15; 5 trials) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.11; 12 trials). Both in placebo-controlled trials and in comparisons with standard antidepressants, trials from German-speaking countries reported findings more favourable to hypericum. Patients given hypericum extracts dropped out of trials due to adverse effects less frequently than those given older antidepressants (odds ratio (OR) 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.46) or SSRIs (OR 0.53, 95% CI, 0.34-0.83)., Authors' conclusions, The available evidence suggests that the hypericum extracts tested in the included trials a) are superior to placebo in patients with major depression; b) are similarly effective as standard antidepressants; c) and have fewer side effects than standard antidepressants. The association of country of origin and precision with effects sizes complicates the interpretation.","Klaus Linde, Michael M. Berner, Levente Kriston (2009).

749,"Background, Informal carers of people with dementia can suffer from depressive symptoms, emotional distress and other physiological, social and financial consequences., Objectives, This review focuses on three main objectives:, Search methods, The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, The Cochrane LibraryMEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, Web of Science, DIMDI databases, Springer database, Science direct and trial registers were searched on 3 May 2011 and updated on 25 February 2013. A Forward Citation search was conducted for included studies in Web of Science and Google Scholar. We used the Related Articles service of PubMed for included studies, contacted experts and hand-searched abstracts of five congresses., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cross-over trials that compared telephone counselling for informal carers of people with dementia against no treatment, usual care or friendly calls for chatting were included evaluation of efficacy. Qualitative studies with qualitative methods of data collection and analysis were also included to address experiences with telephone counselling., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently screened articles for inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed the quantitative trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the qualitative studies with the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool. The authors conducted meta-analyses, but reported some results in narrative form due to clinical heterogeneity. The authors synthesised the qualitative data and integrated quantitative RCT data with the qualitative data., Main results, Nine RCTs and two qualitative studies were included. Six studies investigated telephone counselling without additional intervention, one study combined telephone counselling with video sessions, and two studies combined it with video sessions and a workbook. All quantitative studies had a high risk of bias in terms of blinding of participants and outcome assessment. Most studies provided no information about random sequence generation and allocation concealment. The quality of the qualitative studies ('thin descriptions') was assessed as moderate. Meta-analyses indicated a reduction of depressive symptoms for telephone counselling without additional intervention (three trials, 163 participants: standardised mean different (SMD) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.63, P value 0.04; moderate quality evidence). The estimated effects on other outcomes (burden, distress, anxiety, quality of life, self-efficacy, satisfaction and social support) were uncertain and differences could not be excluded (burden: four trials, 165 participants: SMD 0.45, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.90, P value 0.05; moderate quality evidence; support: two trials, 67 participants: SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.73, P value 0.32; low quality evidence). None of the quantitative studies included reported adverse effects or harm due to telephone counselling. Three analytical themes (barriers and facilitators for successful implementation of telephone counselling, counsellor's emotional attitude and content of telephone counselling) and 16 descriptive themes that present the carers' needs for telephone counselling were identified in the thematic synthesis. Integration of quantitative and qualitative data shows potential for improvement. For example, no RCT reported that the counsellor provided 24-hour availability or that there was debriefing of the counsellor. Also, the qualitative studies covered a limited range of ways of performing telephone counselling., Authors' conclusions, There is evidence that telephone counselling can reduce depressive symptoms for carers of people with dementia and that telephone counselling meets important needs of the carer. This result needs to be confirmed in future studies that evaluate efficacy through robust RCTs and the experience aspect through qualitative studies with rich data.","Sabine Lins, Daniela HayderBeichel, Gerta Rucker, Edith Motschall, Gerd Antes, Gabriele Meyer, Gero Langer (2014).

750,"Background, Multisystemic Therapy (MST) is an intensive, home-based intervention for families of youth with social, emotional, and behavioral problems. Masters-level therapists engage family members in identifying and changing individual, family, and environmental factors thought to contribute to problem behavior. Intervention may include efforts to improve communication, parenting skills, peer relations, school performance, and social networks. Most MST trials were conducted by program developers in the USA; results of one independent trial are available and others are in progress., Objectives, To provide unbiased estimates of the impacts of MST on restrictive out-of-home living arrangements, crime and delinquency, and other behavioral and psychosocial outcomes for youth and families., Search strategy, Electronic searches were made of bibliographic databases (including the Cochrane Library, C2-SPECTR, PsycINFO, Science Direct and Sociological Abstracts) as well as government and professional websites, from 1985 to January 2003. Reference lists of articles were examined, and experts were contacted., Selection criteria, Studies where youth (age 10-17) with social, emotional, and/or behavioral problems were randomised to licensed MST programs or other conditions (usual services or alternative treatments)., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently reviewed 266 titles and abstracts; 95 full-text reports were retrieved, and 35 unique studies were identified. Two reviewers independently read all study reports for inclusion. Eight studies were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and extracted data from these studies., Main results, The most rigorous (intent-to-treat) analysis found no significant differences between MST and usual services in restrictive out-of-home placements and arrests or convictions. Pooled results that include studies with data of varying quality tend to favor MST, but these relative effects are not significantly different from zero. The study sample size is small and effects are not consistent across studies; hence, it is not clear whether MST has clinically significant advantages over other services., Authors' conclusions, There is inconclusive evidence of the effectiveness of MST compared with other interventions with youth.There is no evidence that MST has harmful effects.","Julia H.

751,"Background, Muscle weakness in old age is associated with physical function decline. Progressive resistance strength training (PRT) exercises are designed to increase strength., Objectives, To assess the effects of PRT on older people and identify adverse events., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialized Register (to March 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 01, 2008), EMBASE (1980 to February 06 2007), CINAHL (1982 to July 01 2007) and two other electronic databases. We also searched reference lists of articles, reviewed conference abstracts and contacted authors., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials reporting physical outcomes of PRT for older people were included., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were pooled where appropriate., Main results, One hundred and twenty one trials with 6700 participants were included. In most trials, PRT was performed two to three times per week and at a high intensity. PRT resulted in a small but significant improvement in physical ability (33 trials, 2172 participants; SMD 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.22). Functional limitation measures also showed improvements: e.g. there was a modest improvement in gait speed (24 trials, 1179 participants, MD 0.08 m/s, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12); and a moderate to large effect for getting out of a chair (11 trials, 384 participants, SMD -0.94, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.38). PRT had a large positive effect on muscle strength (73 trials, 3059 participants, SMD 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00). Participants with osteoarthritis reported a reduction in pain following PRT(6 trials, 503 participants, SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.13). There was no evidence from 10 other trials (587 participants) that PRT had an effect on bodily pain. Adverse events were poorly recorded but adverse events related to musculoskeletal complaints, such as joint pain and muscle soreness, were reported in many of the studies that prospectively defined and monitored these events. Serious adverse events were rare, and no serious events were reported to be directly related to the exercise programme., Authors' conclusions, This review provides evidence that PRT is an effective intervention for improving physical functioning in older people, including improving strength and the performance of some simple and complex activities. However, some caution is needed with transferring these exercises for use with clinical populations because adverse events are not adequately reported.","Chiungju Liu, Nancy K. Latham (2009).

752,"Background, Traditional herbal therapies have been used for a long time to treat gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, and their effectiveness from clinical research evidence needs to be systematically reviewed., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicines in patients with irritable bowel syndrome., Search methods, We searched the following electronic databases till July 2004: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, LILACS, the Chinese Biomedical Database, combined with hand searches of Chinese journals and conference proceedings till end of 2003. No language restriction was used., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of herbal medicines compared with no treatment, placebo, pharmacological interventions were included., Data collection and analysis, Data were extracted independently by two authors. The methodological quality of trials was evaluated using the components of randomisation, allocation concealment, double blinding, and inclusion of randomised participants., Main results, Seventy-five randomised trials, involving 7957 participants with irritable bowel syndrome, met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was high, but the quality of remaining trials was generally low. Seventy-one different herbal medicines were tested in the included trials, in which herbal medicines were compared with placebo or conventional pharmacologic therapy. Herbal medicines were also combined with conventional therapy and compared to conventional therapy alone., Authors' conclusions, Some herbal medicines may improve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. However, positive findings from less rigorous trials should be interpreted with caution due to inadequate methodology, small sample sizes, and lack of confirming data. Some herbal medicines deserve further examination in high-quality trials.","Ping Jian Liu, Min Yang, Yunxia Liu, Ling Mao Wei, Sameline Grimsgaard (2011).

753,"Background, Horticultural therapy is defined as the process of utilising fruits, vegetables, flowers and plants facilitated by a trained therapist or healthcare provider, to achieve specific treatment goals or to simply improve a person's well-being. It can be used for therapy or rehabilitation programs for cognitive, physical, social, emotional, and recreational benefits, thus improving the person's body, mind and spirit. Between 5% to 15% of people with schizophrenia continue to experience symptoms in spite of medication, and may also develop undesirable adverse effects, horticultural therapy may be of value for these people., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses compared with standard care or other additional psychosocial interventions., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (Janurary 2013) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, and manually searching reference lists., Selection criteria, We included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing horticultural therapy plus standard care with standard care alone for people with schizophrenia., Data collection and analysis, We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data. For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD) and for binary outcomes we calculated risk ratio (RR), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach., Main results, We included one single blind study (total n = 24). The overall risk of bias in the study was considered to be unclear although the randomisation was adequate. It compared a package of horticultural therapy which consisted of one hour per day of horticultural activity plus standard care with standard care alone over two weeks (10 consecutive days) with no long-term follow-up. Only two people were lost to follow-up in the study, both in the horticultural therapy group (1 RCT n = 24,RR 5.00 95% CI 0.27 to 94.34, very low quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference in Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI-C) change scores between groups, however confidence intervals were wide (1 RCT n = 22, MD -0.90 95% CI -10.35 to 8.55, very low quality evidence). At the end of treatment, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21) change scores in horticultural therapy group were greater than that in the control group (1 RCT n = 22, MD -23.70 CI -35.37 to - 12.03, very low quality evidence). The only included study did not report on adverse effects of interventions., Authors' conclusions, Based on the current very low quality data, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on benefits or harms of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. This therapy remains unproven and more and larger randomised trials are needed to increase high quality evidence in this area.","Yan Liu, Li Bo, Stephanie Sampson, Samantha Roberts, Guoyou Zhang, Weiping Wu (2014).

754,"Background, Many survivors of stroke complain about attentional impairments, such as diminished concentration and mental slowness. However, the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for improving these impairments is uncertain., Objectives, To determine whether (1) people receiving attentional treatment show better outcomes in their attentional functions than those given no treatment or treatment as usual, and (2) people receiving attentional treatment techniques have a better functional recovery, in terms of independence in activities of daily living, mood and quality of life, than those given no treatment or treatment as usual., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (October 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library October 2012), MEDLINE (1948 to October 2012), EMBASE (1947 to October 2012), CINAHL (1981 to October 2012), PsycINFO (1806 to October 2012), PsycBITE and REHABDATA (searched October 2012) and ongoing trials registers. We screened reference lists and tracked citations using Scopus., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cognitive rehabilitation for impairments of attention for people with stroke. The primary outcome was measures of global attentional functions, and secondary outcomes were measures of attention domains, functional abilities, mood and quality of life., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed trial quality., Main results, We included six RCTs with 223 participants. All six RCTs compared cognitive rehabilitation with a usual care control. Meta-analyses demonstrated no statistically significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation for persisting effects on global measures of attention (two studies, 99 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.56; P value = 0.41), standardised attention assessments (two studies, 99 participants; P value >= 0.08) or functional outcomes (two studies, 99 participants; P value >= 0.15). In contrast, a statistically significant effect was found in favour of cognitive rehabilitation when compared with control for immediate effects on measures of divided attention (four studies, 165 participants; SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98; P value < 0.0001) but no significant effects on global attention (two studies, 53 participants; P value = 0.06), other attentional domains (six studies, 223 participants; P value >= 0.16) or functional outcomes (three studies, 109 participants; P value >= 0.21)., Authors' conclusions, The effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation remains unconfirmed. The results suggest there may be a short-term effect on attentional abilities, but future studies need to assess the persisting effects and measure attentional skills in daily life. Trials also need to have higher methodological quality and better reporting.","Tobias Loetscher, Nadina B. Lincoln (2013).

756,"Background, This is an update of the original Cochrane Review, last published in 2012 (Loy 2012). Children and youths with disruptive behaviour disorders may present to health services, where they may be treated with atypical antipsychotics. There is increasing usage of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of disruptive behaviour disorders., Objectives, To evaluate the effect and safety of atypical antipsychotics, compared to placebo, for treating disruptive behaviour disorders in children and youths. The aim was to evaluate each drug separately rather than the class effect, on the grounds that each atypical antipsychotic has different pharmacologic binding profile () and that this is clinically more useful., Search methods, In January 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of atypical antipsychotics versus placebo in children and youths aged up to and including 18 years, with a diagnosis of disruptive behaviour disorders, including comorbid ADHD. The primary outcomes were aggression, conduct problems and adverse events (i.e. weight gain/changes and metabolic parameters). The secondary outcomes were general functioning, noncompliance, other adverse events, social functioning, family functioning, parent satisfaction and school functioning., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors (JL and KS) independently collected, evaluated and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We performed meta-analyses for each of our primary outcomes, except for metabolic parameters, due to inadequate outcome data., Main results, We included 10 trials (spanning 2000 to 2014), involving a total of 896 children and youths aged five to 18 years. Bar two trials, all came from an outpatient setting. Eight trials assessed risperidone, one assessed quetiapine and one assessed ziprasidone. Nine trials assessed acute efficacy (over four to 10 weeks); one of which combined treatment with stimulant medication and parent training. One trial was a six-month maintenance trial assessing symptom recurrence., Authors' conclusions, There is some evidence that in the short term risperidone may reduce aggression and conduct problems in children and youths with disruptive behaviour disorders There is also evidence that this intervention is associated with significant weight gain.","Jik H.

758,"Background, Respiratory hazards are common in the workplace. Depending on the hazard and exposure, the health consequences may include: mild to life-threatening illnesses from infectious agents, acute effects ranging from respiratory irritation to chronic lung conditions, or even cancer from exposure to chemicals or toxins. Use of respiratory protective equipment (RPE) is an important preventive measure in many occupational settings. RPE only offers protection when worn properly, when removed safely and when it is either replaced or maintained regularly. The effectiveness of behavioural interventions either directed at employers or organisations or directed at individual workers to promote RPE use in workers remains an important unanswered question., Objectives, To assess the effects of any behavioural intervention either directed at organisations or at individual workers on observed or self-reported RPE use in workers when compared to no intervention or an alternative intervention., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Work Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 07), MEDLINE (1980 to 12 August 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 20 August 2016) and CINAHL (1980 to 12 August 2016)., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before and after (CBA) studies and interrupted time-series (ITS) comparing behavioural interventions versus no intervention or any other behavioural intervention to promote RPE use in workers., Data collection and analysis, Four authors independently selected relevant studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted investigators to clarify information. We pooled outcome data from included studies where the studies were sufficiently similar., Main results, We included 14 studies that evaluated the effect of training and education on RPE use, which involved 2052 participants. The included studies had been conducted with farm, healthcare, production line, office and coke oven workers as well as nursing students and people with mixed occupations. All included studies reported the effects of interventions as use of RPE, as correct use of RPE or as indirect measures of RPE use. We did not find any studies where the intervention was delivered and assessed at the whole organization level or in which the main focus was on positive or negative incentives. We rated the quality of the evidence for all comparisons as low to very low., Authors' conclusions, There is very low quality evidence that behavioural interventions, namely education and training, do not have a considerable effect on the frequency or correctness of RPE use in workers. There were no studies on incentives or organisation level interventions. The included studies had methodological limitations and we therefore need further large RCTs with clearer methodology in terms of randomised sequence generation, allocation concealment and assessor blinding, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of behavioural interventions for improving the use of RPE at both organisational and individual levels. In addition, further studies should consider some of the barriers to the successful use of RPE, such as experience of health risk, types of RPE and the employer's attitude to RPE use.","Yen Bao Luong Thanh, Malinee Laopaiboon, David Koh, Pornpun Sakunkoo, Hla Moe (2016).

Bipolar patients, male and female, of all ages were included., Data collection and analysis, Data extraction and methodological quality assessment were each performed independently by two reviewers. For analysis, relative risk was used for binary efficacy outcomes and the weighted mean difference or standardised mean difference used for continuously distributed outcomes., Main results, Ten trials compared valproate with other interventions in mania. None examined depression or mixed affective episodes. Data were extracted on 'failure to respond by the end of the study' (i.e.less than 50% reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale or SADS-S mania scale). Three trials (316 participants) compared valproate with placebo. Three trials (158 participants) compared valproate with lithium. Two trials (363 participants) compared valproate with olanzapine. One trial (36 participants) compared valproate with haloperidol. Two trials (59 patients) compared valproate with carbamazepine., Authors' conclusions, There is consistent, if limited, evidence that valproate is an efficacious treatment for acute mania. Valproate may be less efficacious than olanzapine. More, rigorously designed, trials over the full range of acute affective episodes are required.","Karine Macritchie, John Geddes, Jan Scott, D. R.

762,"Background, Folate deficiency can result in congenital neural tube defects and megaloblastic anaemia. Low folate levels may be due to insufficient dietary intake or inefficient absorption, but impaired metabolic utilization also occurs., Objectives, To examine the effects of folic acid supplementation, with or without vitamin B12, on elderly healthy or demented people, in preventing cognitive impairment or retarding its progress., Search strategy, Trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 10 October 2007 using the terms: folic acid, folate, vitamin B9, leucovorin, methyltetrahydrofolate, vitamin B12, cobalamin and cyanocobalamin. This Register contains references from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases. In addition MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and LILACS were searched (years 2003-2007) for additional trials of folate with or without vitamin B12 on healthy elderly people., Selection criteria, All double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials, in which supplements of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 were compared with placebo for elderly healthy people or people with any type of dementia or cognitive impairment., Data collection and analysis, The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality. One reviewer extracted and analysed the data. In comparing intervention with placebo, weighted mean differences and standardized mean difference or odds ratios were estimated., Main results, Eight randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. Four trials enrolled healthy older people, and four recruited participants with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia with or without diagnosed folate deficiency. Pooling the data was not possible owing to heterogeneity in sample selections, outcomes, trial duration, and dosage. Two studies involved a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12., Authors' conclusions, The small number of studies which have been done provide no consistent evidence either way that folic acid, with or without vitamin B12, has a beneficial effect on cognitive function of unselected healthy or cognitively impaired older people. In a preliminary study, folic acid was associated with improvement in the response of people with Alzheimer's disease to cholinesterase inhibitors. In another, long-term use appeared to improve the cognitive function of healthy older people with high homocysteine levels. More studies are needed on this important issue.","Reem Malouf, John Grimley Evans (2009).

763,"Background, Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, costly, and difficult to treat disorder that impairs health-related quality of life and work productivity. Evidence-based treatment guidelines have been unable to provide guidance on the effects of acupuncture for IBS because the only previous systematic review included only small, heterogeneous and methodologically unsound trials., Objectives, The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for treating IBS., Search methods, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and the Chinese databases Sino-Med, CNKI, and VIP were searched through November 2011., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, other active treatments, or no (specific) treatment, and RCTs that evaluated acupuncture as an adjuvant to another treatment, in adults with IBS were included., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We extracted data for the outcomes overall IBS symptom severity and health-related quality of life. For dichotomous data (e.g. the IBS Adequate Relief Question), we calculated a pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for substantial improvement in symptom severity after treatment. For continuous data (e.g. the IBS Severity Scoring System), we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI in post-treatment scores between groups., Main results, Seventeen RCTs (1806 participants) were included. Five RCTs compared acupuncture versus sham acupuncture. The risk of bias in these studies was low. We found no evidence of an improvement with acupuncture relative to sham (placebo) acupuncture for symptom severity (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.13; 4 RCTs; 281 patients) or quality of life (SMD = -0.03, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.22; 3 RCTs; 253 patients). Sensitivity analyses based on study quality did not change the results. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes in the sham controlled trials was moderate due to sparse data. The risk of bias in the four Chinese language comparative effectiveness trials that compared acupuncture with drug treatment was high due to lack of blinding. The risk of bias in the other studies that did not use a sham control was high due to lack of blinding or inadequate methods used for randomization and allocation concealment or both. Acupuncture was significantly more effective than pharmacological therapy and no specific treatment. Eighty-four per cent of patients in the acupuncture group had improvement in symptom severity compared to 63% of patients in the pharmacological treatment group (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.45; 5 studies, 449 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was low due to a high risk of bias (no blinding) and sparse data. Sixty-three per cent of patients in the acupuncture group had improvement in symptom severity compared to 34% of patients in the no specific therapy group (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.79; 2 studies, 181 patients). There was no statistically significant difference between acupuncture and Bifidobacterium (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.27; 2 studies; 181 patients) or between acupuncture and psychotherapy (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.26; 1 study; 100 patients). Acupuncture as an adjuvant to another Chinese medicine treatment was significantly better than the other treatment alone. Ninety-three per cent of patients in the adjuvant acupuncture group improved compared to 79% of patients who received Chinese medicine alone (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33; 4 studies; 466 patients). There was one adverse event (i.e. acupuncture syncope) associated with acupuncture in the 9 trials that reported this outcome, although relatively small sample sizes limit the usefulness of these safety data., Authors' conclusions, Sham-controlled RCTs have found no benefits of acupuncture relative to","Eric Manheimer, Ke Cheng, Susan L.

764,"Background, Low back pain (LBP) is associated with enormous personal and societal burdens, especially when it reaches the chronic stage of the disorder (pain for a duration of more than three months). Indeed, individuals who reach the chronic stage tend to show a more persistent course, and they account for the majority of social and economic costs. As a result, there is increasing emphasis on the importance of intervening at the early stages of LBP., Objectives, To examine the effectiveness of MBR for subacute LBP (pain for a duration of six to 12 weeks) among adults, with a focus on pain, back-specific disability, and work status., Search methods, We searched for relevant trials in any language by a computer-aided search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and two trials registers. Our search is current to 13 July 2016., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with subacute LBP. We included studies that investigated a MBR program compared to any type of control intervention. We defined MBR as an intervention that included a physical component (e.g. pharmacological, physical therapy) in combination with either a psychological, social, or occupational component (or any combination of these). We also required involvement of healthcare professionals from at least two different clinical backgrounds with appropriate training to deliver the component for which they were responsible., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In particular, the data extraction and 'risk of bias' assessment were conducted by two people, independently. We used the Cochrane tool to assess risk of bias and the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome., Main results, We included a total of nine RCTs (981 participants) in this review. Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in North America. Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 351. The mean age across trials ranged between 32.0 and 43.7 years., Authors' conclusions, On average, people with subacute LBP who receive MBR will do better than if they receive usual care, but it is not clear whether they do better than people who receive some other type of treatment. However, the available research provides mainly low to very low-quality evidence, thus additional high-quality trials are needed before we can describe the value of MBP for clinical practice.","Teresa J.

765,"Background, Inpatient treatment is an expensive way of caring for people with acute psychiatric disorders. It has been proposed that many of those currently treated as inpatients could be cared for in acute psychiatric day hospitals., Objectives, To assess the effects of day hospital versus inpatient care for people with acute psychiatric disorders., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2010) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We approached trialists to identify unpublished studies., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of day hospital versus inpatient care, for people with acute psychiatric disorders. Studies were ineligible if a majority of participants were under 18 or over 65, or had a primary diagnosis of substance abuse or organic brain disorder., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted and cross-checked data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. We calculated weighted or standardised means for continuous data. Day hospital trials tend to present similar outcomes in slightly different formats, making it difficult to synthesise data. We therefore sought individual patient data so that we could re-analyse outcomes in a common format., Main results, Ten trials (involving 2685 people) met the inclusion criteria. We obtained individual patient data for four trials (involving 646 people). We found no difference in the number lost to follow-up by one year between day hospital care and inpatient care (5 RCTs, n = 1694, RR 0.94 CI 0.82 to 1.08). There is moderate evidence that the duration of index admission is longer for patients in day hospital care than inpatient care (4 RCTs, n = 1582, WMD 27.47 CI 3.96 to 50.98). There is very low evidence that the duration of day patient care (adjusted days/month) is longer for patients in day hospital care than inpatient care (3 RCTs, n = 265, WMD 2.34 days/month CI 1.97 to 2.70). There is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for the being readmitted to in/day patient care after discharge (5 RCTs, n = 667, RR 0.91 CI 0.72 to 1.15). It is likely that there is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for being unemployed at the end of the study (1 RCT, n = 179, RR 0.88 CI 0.66 to 1.19), for quality of life (1 RCT, n = 1117, MD 0.01 CI -0.13 to 0.15) or for treatment satisfaction (1 RCT, n = 1117, MD 0.06 CI -0.18 to 0.30)., Authors' conclusions, Caring for people in acute day hospitals is as effective as inpatient care in treating acutely ill psychiatric patients. However, further data are still needed on the cost effectiveness of day hospitals.","Max Marshall, Ruth Crowther, Hurt William Sledge, John Rathbone, Karla SoaresWeiser (2011).

766,"Background, Proponents of early intervention have argued that outcomes might be improved if more therapeutic efforts were focused on the early stages of schizophrenia or on people with prodromal symptoms. Early intervention in schizophrenia has two elements that are distinct from standard care: early detection, and phase-specific treatment (phase-specific treatment is a psychological, social or physical treatment developed, or modified, specifically for use with people at an early stage of the illness)., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of: (a) early detection; (b) phase-specific treatments; and (c) specialised early intervention teams in the treatment of people with prodromal symptoms or first-episode psychosis., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2009), inspected reference lists of all identified trials and reviews and contacted experts in the field., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) designed to prevent progression to psychosis in people showing prodromal symptoms, or to improve outcome for people with first-episode psychosis. Eligible interventions, alone and in combination, included: early detection, phase-specific treatments, and care from specialised early intervention teams. We accepted cluster-randomised trials but excluded non-randomised trials., Data collection and analysis, We reliably selected studies, quality rated them and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we estimated relative risks (RR), with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and used intention-to-treat analysis (ITT)., Main results, Studies were diverse, mostly small, undertaken by pioneering researchers and with many methodological limitations (18 RCTs, total n=1808). Mostly, meta-analyses were inappropriate. For the six studies addressing prevention of psychosis for people with prodromal symptoms, olanzapine seemed of little benefit (n=60, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.58 CI 0.3 to 1.2), and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) equally so (n=60, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.50 CI 0.2 to 1.7). A risperidone plus CBT plus specialised team did have benefit over specialist team alone at six months (n=59, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.27 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 4 CI 2 to 20), but this was not seen by 12 months (n=59, 1 RCT, RR 0.54 CI 0.2 to 1.3). Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA) had advantage over placebo (n=76, 1 RCT, RR transition to psychosis 0.13 CI 0.02 to 1.0, NNT 6 CI 5 to 96). We know of no replications of this finding., Authors' conclusions, There is emerging, but as yet inconclusive evidence, to suggest that people in the prodrome of psychosis can be helped by some interventions. There is some support for specialised early intervention services, but further trials would be desirable, and there is a question of whether gains are maintained. There is some support for phase-specific treatment focused on employment and family therapy, but again, this needs replicating with larger and longer trials.","Max Marshall, John Rathbone (2011).

769,"Background, Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) arthroplasty with implants, which is the replacement of painful knuckle joints with artificial knuckle joints, has been performed for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since the 1960s. The surgery is done because RA can cause damage of the knuckle joints making them unable to straighten out (flexion deformity) and causing them to lean over toward the small finger (flexion or ulnar deviation deformity). For eight to 12 weeks following surgery, patients wear hand splints and perform exercises to maintain and increase motion in the healing hand. Post-operative therapy regimes share common aims of encouraging MCP flexion and extension without the recurrence of flexion or ulnar deviation deformity., Objectives, To compare the effectiveness of post-operative therapy regimes for increasing hand function after MCP arthroplasty in adults with rheumatoid arthritis., Search strategy, The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to August 2006), EMBASE (January 1993 to August 2006), CINAHL (January 1982 to August 2006), Digital Dissertations (January 1960 to August 2006), DARE (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3), Current Contents Connect (January 1998 to August 2006), and AMED (January 1985 to August 2006) were searched for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials using rheumatoid arthritis and hand as the search terms. The bibliographies of all trials identified by this strategy were also searched and primary authors were contacted for unpublished data and also clarification regarding study protocols., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were accepted if they evaluated the efficacy of a post-operative therapy regime for MCP arthroplasty., Data collection and analysis, No data analyses were performed as only one controlled clinical trial was found. The data from that study are described., Main results, Our search only identified one controlled clinical trial involving 22 participants. The majority of the evidence for various splinting and exercise regimes consisted of case series and case studies. Results from the one (poor quality) trial suggest that the use of continuous passive motion is not effective in increasing motion or strength after MCP arthroplasty., Authors' conclusions, Well-designed randomised controlled trials which compare the efficacy of different therapeutic splinting programmes following MCP arthroplasty are required. At this time, the results of one study (silver level evidence) suggest that continuous passive motion alone is not recommended for increasing motion or strength after MCP arthroplasty.","Nicola MassyWestropp, Renea V.

770,"Background, Pericyazine is a 3-cyano-10 (3-4'-hydroxypiperidinopropyl) phenothiazine. It is overall pharmacologically similar with chlorpromazine, though particularly sedating. Dopamine receptor subtype analysis has not been performed for pericyazine, but the drug appears to induce greater noradrenergic than dopaminergic blockade. Compared to chlorpromazine, pericyazine reportedly has more potent antiemetic, antiserotonin, and anticholinergic activity., Objectives, To evaluate the clinical effects and safety of pericyazine in comparison with placebo, typical and atypical antipsychotic agents and standard care for people with schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2013) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised controlled trials focusing on pericyazine for schizophrenia and other types of schizophrenia-like psychoses (schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders). We excluded quasi-randomised trials., Data collection and analysis, Data were extracted independently from included papers by at least two review authors. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data were calculated. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to judge quality of evidence., Main results, We could only include five studies conducted between 1965 and 1980. Most of the included studies did not report details of randomisation, allocation concealment, details of blinding and we could not assess the impact of attrition due to poor reporting., Authors' conclusions, On the basis of very low quality evidence we are unable to determine the effects of pericyazine in comparison with typical or atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, there is some evidence that pericyazine may be associated with a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than other antipsychotics, and again this was judged to be very low quality evidence. Large, robust studies are still needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.","Hosam E. Matar, Qutayba Muhammad Almerie, Samer Makhoul, Jun Xia, Pamela Humphreys (2014).

771,"Background, Nausea, retching and vomiting are very commonly experienced by women in early pregnancy. There are considerable physical, social and psychological effects on women who experience these symptoms. This is an update of a review of interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy last published in 2014., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness and safety of all interventions for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy, up to 20 weeks' gestation., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register (19 January 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials of any intervention for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy. We excluded trials of interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum, which are covered by another Cochrane review. We also excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials using a cross-over design., Data collection and analysis, Four review authors, in pairs, reviewed the eligibility of trials and independently evaluated the risk of bias and extracted the data for included trials., Main results, Forty-one trials involving 5449 women, met the inclusion criteria. These trials covered many interventions, including acupressure, acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger, chamomile, lemon oil, mint oil, vitamin B6 and several antiemetic drugs. There were no included studies of dietary and other lifestyle interventions. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of P6 acupressure, auricular (ear) acupressure and acustimulation of the P6 point was limited. Acupuncture (P6 or traditional) showed no significant benefit to women in pregnancy. The use of ginger products may be helpful to women, but the evidence of effectiveness was limited and not consistent, though three recent studies support ginger over placebo. There was only limited evidence from trials to support the use of pharmacological agents including vitamin B6, Doxylamine-pyridoxoine and other anti-emetic drugs to relieve mild or moderate nausea and vomiting. There was little information on maternal and fetal adverse outcomes and on psychological, social or economic outcomes., Authors' conclusions, Given the high prevalence of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, women and health professionals need clear guidance about effective and safe interventions, based on systematically reviewed evidence. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support any particular intervention. This is not the same as saying that the interventions studied are ineffective, but that there is insufficient strong evidence for any one intervention. The difficulties in interpreting and pooling the results of the studies included in this review highlight the need for specific, consistent and clearly justified outcomes and approaches to measurement in research studies.","Anne Matthews, David M.

773,"Background, Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problems. They are chronic and unremitting. Effective treatments are available, but access to services is limited. Media-delivered behavioural and cognitive behavioural interventions (self-help) aim to deliver treatment with less input from professionals compared with traditional therapies., Objectives, To assess the effects of media-delivered behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapies for anxiety disorders in adults., Search methods, Published and unpublished studies were considered without restriction by language or date. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR) was searched all years to 1 January 2013. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Complementary searches were carried out on Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 23 February 2013) and PsycINFO (1987 to February, Week 2, 2013), together with International trial registries (the trials portal of the World Health Organization () and ). Reference lists from previous meta-analyses and reports of randomised controlled trials were checked, and authors were contacted for unpublished data., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of media-delivered behavioural or cognitive behavioural therapy in adults with anxiety disorders (other than post-traumatic stress disorder) compared with no intervention (including attention/relaxation controls) or compared with face-to-face therapy., Data collection and analysis, Both review authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Study characteristics and outcomes were extracted in duplicate. Outcomes were combined using random-effects models, and tests for heterogeneity and for small study bias were conducted. We examined subgroup differences by type of disorder, type of intervention provided, type of media, and recruitment methods used., Main results, One hundred and one studies with 8403 participants were included; 92 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. These trials compared several types of media-delivered interventions (with varying levels of support) with no treatment and with face-to-face interventions. Inconsistency and risk of bias reduced our confidence in the overall results. For the primary outcome of symptoms of anxiety, moderate-quality evidence showed medium effects compared with no intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.80; 72 studies, 4537 participants), and low-quality evidence of small effects favoured face-to-face therapy (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.09; 24 studies, 1360 participants). The intervention was associated with greater response than was seen with no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.34, 95% CI 1.81 to 3.03; 21 studies, 1547 participants) and was not significantly inferior to face-to-face therapy in these studies (RR 0.78, 95 % CI 0.56 to 1.09; 10 studies, 575 participants), but the latter comparison included versions of therapies that were not as comprehensive as those provided in routine clinical practice. Evidence suggested benefit for secondary outcome measures (depression, mental-health related disability, quality of life and dropout), but this evidence was of low to moderate quality. Evidence regarding harm was lacking., Authors' conclusions, Self-help may be useful for people who are not able or are not willing to use other services for people with anxiety disorders; for people who can access it, face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy is probably clinically superior. Economic analyses were beyond the scope of this review.","Evan MayoWilson, Paul Montgomery (2013).

774,"Background, Researchers have consistently found that people with schizophrenia score more poorly than others on a wide array of cognitive tasks and that these deficits persist even when the illness is in remission. The perceived impact of cognitive impairment on day-to-day functioning has led to the development of cognitive rehabilitation techniques intended to remedy these impairments, and thus improve the functioning of people with schizophrenia., Objectives, To determine whether the use of cognitive rehabilitation techniques is associated with improvement in people with schizophrenia and related conditions., Search strategy, Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982-1997), the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of trials (2000), EMBASE (1980-1997), LILACS (1982-1997), MEDLINE (1966-1997), PsycLIT (1974-1997) and SCISEARCH (1997) were undertaken. References of all identified studies were handsearched and the first author of each included trial was contacted., Selection criteria, The reviewers included randomised trials investigating the impact of cognitive rehabilitation on people with schizophrenia, or related conditions, compared to a placebo intervention, another intervention or standard treatment. This version of the review does not include comparisons of different types of cognitive rehabilitation., Data collection and analysis, Relevant studies were identified and data extracted reliably by two reviewers working independently. In studies which did not specify the reasons for participants dropping out, we assumed that those who had dropped out had experienced no change in the outcome measures. Where possible, Peto odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) were calculated with their 95% confidence intervals (CI)., Main results, Three small studies met the inclusion criteria. Two compared cognitive rehabilitation to a placebo intervention (total n=84), and the other to occupational therapy (n=33). Although cognitive rehabilitation was as acceptable as placebo and occupational therapy, with low attrition in both groups, no effects were demonstrated on measures of mental state, social behaviour, or cognitive functioning. An effect, in favour of cognitive rehabilitation, on a measure of self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, MD 6.3 CI 1.07-11.53 ) is worthy of replication in any future trials., Authors' conclusions, Data are inconclusive and provide no evidence for or against cognitive rehabilitation as a treatment for schizophrenia.","John McGrath, Robyn L.

Antipsychotic drugs does reduce these symptoms, but at least half of people given these drugs do not comply with the treatment regimen prescribed., Objectives, To assess the effects of compliance therapy on antipsychotic medication adherence for people with schizophrenia., Search strategy, Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2005)., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials of 'compliance therapy' for people with schizophrenia or related severe mental disorders., Data collection and analysis, We independently extracted data and, for dichotomous data, calculated the relative risk (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention to treat basis. We present continuous data using the weighted mean difference statistic., Main results, We included one trial with relevant and available data (n=56, duration 2 years) comparing compliance therapy with non-specific counseling. The primary outcome 'non-compliance with treatment' showed no significant difference between compliance therapy and non-specific counseling (n=56, RR 1.23 CI 0.74 to 2.05). The compliance therapy did not substantially effect attitudes to treatment (n=50, WMD DAI score -2.10 CI -6.11 to 1.91). Very few people (~10%) left the study by one year (n=56, RR 0.5 CI 0.1 to 2.51).

At both one and two years the average number of days in hospital was non-significantly reduced for those allocated to the compliance therapy., Authors' conclusions, There is no clear evidence to suggest that compliance therapy is beneficial for people with schizophrenia and related syndromes but more randomised studies are justified and needed in order for this intervention to be fully examined.","Andrew McIntosh, Louise Conlon, Stephen Lawrie, Andrew C.

It is also unclear what the best method is to allow people with schizophrenia to alter their cannabis intake., Objectives, To assess the effects of specific psychological treatments for cannabis reduction in people with schizophrenia., To assess the effects of antipsychotics for cannabis reduction in people with schizophrenia., To assess the effects of cannabinoids (cannabis related chemical compounds derived from cannabis or manufactured) for symptom reduction in people with schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, 12 August 2013, which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PUBMED and PsycINFO., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials involving cannabinoids and schizophrenia/schizophrenia-like illnesses, which assessed:, Data collection and analysis, We independently inspected citations, selected papers and then re-inspected the studies if there were discrepancies, and extracted data. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and for continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a fixed-effect model. We excluded data if loss to follow-up was greater than 50%. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence., Main results, We identified eight randomised trials, involving 530 participants, which met our selection criteria., Authors' conclusions, Results are limited and inconclusive due to the small number and size of randomised controlled trials available and quality of data reporting within these trials. More research is needed to a) explore the effects of adjunct psychological therapy that is specifically about cannabis and psychosis as currently there is no evidence for any novel intervention being better than standard treatment,for those that use cannabis and have schizophrenia b) decide the most effective drug treatment in treating those that use cannabis and have schizophrenia, and c) assess the effectiveness of cannabidiol in treating schizophrenia. Currently evidence is insufficient to show cannabidiol has an antipsychotic effect.","Benjamin C. McLoughlin, Jonathan A.

777,"Background, A token economy is a behavioural therapy technique in which the desired change is achieved by means of tokens administered for the performance of predefined behaviours according to a program. Though token economy programmes were widespread in the 1970s they became largely restricted to wards where long-stay patients from institutions are prepared for transfer into the community and were particularly aimed at changing negative symptoms of schizophrenia - poor motivation, poor attention and social withdrawal., Objectives, To review the effects of token economies for people with schizophrenia, or other serious or chronic mental illnesses, compared with standard care., Search strategy, Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1985-1999), CINAHL (1982-1998), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (February 1999), EMBASE (1980-1999) and PsycLIT (1987-1998) were supplemented with reference searches, personal contact with trial authors and hand searches., Selection criteria, Randomised studies comparing a token economy regime (one in which change is achieved by means of use of non-monetary, non-consumable tokens) to standard care for those with schizophrenia or any other similar chronic or serious mental illness., Data collection and analysis, Studies were reliably selected, quality rated and data extracted. For dichotomous data relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was estimated. Where possible, the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was also calculated. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Normal continuous data were summated using the weighted mean difference (WMD). Scale data were presented only for those tools that had attained pre-specified levels of quality., Main results, Only three randomised controlled trials could be included in the analyses (total n=110). There were no usable data on target or non-target behaviour. One small study favoured the token economy approach for the outcome 'change in mental state' on the SANS-CV with improvement in negative symptoms at three months (n=40, WMD -12.7, CI -21.44 to -3.96)., Authors' conclusions, The token economy approach may have effects on negative symptoms but it is unclear if these results are reproducible, clinically meaningful and are maintained beyond the treatment programme. Token economy remains worthy of careful evaluation in well designed, conducted and reported randomised trials.","Tom McMonagle, Alec Sultana (2009).

778,"Background, Brief interventions involve a time-limited intervention focusing on changing behaviour. They are often motivational in nature using counselling skills to encourage a reduction in alcohol consumption., Objectives, To determine whether brief interventions reduce alcohol consumption and improve outcomes for heavy alcohol users admitted to general hospital inpatient units., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Register of Trials (March 2011) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library March 2011), MEDLINE January 1966-March 2011, CINAHL 1982-March 2011, EMBASE 1980-March 2011 and to April 2011 and performed some relevant handsearching., Selection criteria, All prospective randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were eligible for inclusion. Participants were adults and adolescents (16 years or older) admitted to general inpatient hospital care for any reason other than specifically for alcohol treatment and received brief interventions (of up to 3 sessions) compared to no or usual care., Data collection and analysis, Three reviewers independently selected the studies and extracted data. Where appropriate random effects meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed., Main results, Forteen studies involving 4041 mainly male participants were included. Our results demonstrate that patients receiving brief interventions have a greater reduction in alcohol consumption compared to those in control groups at six month, MD -69.43 (95% CI -128.14 to -10.72) and nine months follow up, MD -182.88 (95% CI -360.00 to -5.76) but this is not maintained at one year. Self reports of reduction of alcohol consumption at 1 year were found in favour of brief interventions, SMD -0.26 (95% CI -0.50 to -0.03). In addition there were significantly fewer deaths in the groups receiving brief interventions than in control groups at 6 months, RR 0.42 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.94) and one year follow up, RR 0.60 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.91). Furthermore screening, asking participants about their drinking patterns, may also have a positive impact on alcohol consumption levels and changes in drinking behaviour., Authors' conclusions, The main results of this review indicate that there are benefits to delivering brief interventions to heavy alcohol users admitted to general hospital wards in terms of reduction in alcohol consumption and death rates. However, these findings are based on studies involving mainly male participants. Further research is required determine the optimal content and treatment exposure of brief interventions within general hospital settings and whether they are likely to be more successful in patients with certain characteristics.","Jean McQueen, Tracey E.

779,"Background, Depression is a debilitating condition affecting more than 350 million people worldwide () with a limited number of evidence-based treatments. Drug treatments may be inappropriate due to side effects and cost, and not everyone can use talking therapies.There is a need for evidence-based treatments that can be applied across cultures and with people who find it difficult to verbally articulate thoughts and feelings. Dance movement therapy (DMT) is used with people from a range of cultural and intellectual backgrounds, but effectiveness remains unclear., Objectives, To examine the effects of DMT for depression with or without standard care, compared to no treatment or standard care alone, psychological therapies, drug treatment, or other physical interventions. Also, to compare the effectiveness of different DMT approaches., Search methods, The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) and CINAHL were searched (to 2 Oct 2014) together with the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and . The review authors also searched the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Dissertation Abstracts (to August 2013), handsearched bibliographies, contacted professional associations, educational programmes and dance therapy experts worldwide., Selection criteria, Inclusion criteria were: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying outcomes for people of any age with depression as defined by the trialist, with at least one group being DMT. DMT was defined as: participatory dance movement with clear psychotherapeutic intent, facilitated by an individual with a level of training that could be reasonably expected within the country in which the trial was conducted. For example, in the USA this would either be a trainee, or qualified and credentialed by the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA). In the UK, the therapist would either be in training with, or accredited by, the Association for Dance Movement Psychotherapy (ADMP, UK). Similar professional bodies exist in Europe, but in some countries (e.g. China) where the profession is in development, a lower level of qualification would mirror the situation some decades previously in the USA or UK. Hence, the review authors accepted a relevant professional qualification (e.g. nursing or psychodynamic therapies) plus a clear description of the treatment that would indicate its adherence to published guidelines including and ., Data collection and analysis, Study methodological quality was evaluated and data were extracted independently by the first two review authors using a data extraction form, the third author acting as an arbitrator., Main results, Three studies totalling 147 participants (107 adults and 40 adolescents) met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-four participants took part in DMT treatment, while 73 comprised the control groups. Two studies included male and female adults with depression. One of these studies included outpatient participants; the other study was conducted with inpatients at an urban hospital. The third study reported findings with female adolescents in a middle-school setting. All included studies collected continuous data using two different depression measures: the clinician-completed Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D); and the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) (self-rating scale)., Authors' conclusions, The low-quality evidence from three small trials with 147 participants does not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of DMT for depression. Larger trials of high methodological quality are needed to assess DMT for depression, with economic analyses and acceptability measures and for all age groups.","Bonnie Meekums, Vicky Karkou, Andrea E.

780,"Background, Intensive care unit (ICU) acquired or generalised weakness due to critical illness myopathy (CIM) and polyneuropathy (CIP) are major causes of chronically impaired motor function that can affect activities of daily living and quality of life. Physical rehabilitation of those affected might help to improve activities of daily living., Objectives, Our primary objective was to assess the effects of physical rehabilitation therapies and interventions for people with CIP and CIM in improving activities of daily living such as walking, bathing, dressing and eating. Secondary objectives were to assess effects on muscle strength and quality of life, and to assess adverse effects of physical rehabilitation., Search methods, On 16 July 2014 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register and on 14 July 2014 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL Plus. In July 2014, we searched the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro, ) and three trials registries for ongoing trials and further data about included studies. There were no language restrictions. We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings and screened reference lists to identify further trials., Selection criteria, We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and randomised controlled cross-over trials of any rehabilitation intervention in people with acquired weakness syndrome due to CIP/CIM., Data collection and analysis, We would have extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and classified the quality of evidence for outcomes in duplicate, according to the standard procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. Outcome data collection would have been for activities of daily living (for example, mobility, walking, transfers and self care). Secondary outcomes included muscle strength, quality of life and adverse events., Main results, The search strategy retrieved 3587 references. After examination of titles and abstracts, we retrieved the full text of 24 potentially relevant studies. None of these studies met the inclusion criteria of our review. No data were suitable to be included in a meta-analysis., Authors' conclusions, There are no published RCTs or quasi-RCTs that examine whether physical rehabilitation interventions improve activities of daily living for people with CIP and CIM. Large RCTs, which are feasible, need to be conducted to explore the role of physical rehabilitation interventions for people with CIP and CIM.","Jan Mehrholz, Marcus Pohl, Joachim Kugler, Jane Burridge, Simone Muckel, Bernhard Elsner (2015).

781,"Background, Tinnitus is the perception of sound, in the ear or in the head, in the absence of any external acoustic stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive means of inducing electrical currents in the brain, and has received increasing attention in recent years for the treatment of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including tinnitus., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness and safety of rTMS versus placebo in patients with tinnitus., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 24 May 2011., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of rTMS versus sham rTMS., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors reviewed the titles, abstracts and keywords of all records retrieved. Three review authors independently collected and extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the trials., Main results, Five trials comprising of 233 participants met our inclusion criteria. Each study described the use of a different rTMS device that delivered different waveforms at different frequencies. All five trials were relatively small studies but generally they demonstrated a low risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, There is very limited support for the use of low-frequency rTMS for the treatment of patients with tinnitus. When considering the impact of tinnitus on patients' quality of life, support is from a single study with a low risk of bias based on a single outcome measure at a single point in time. When considering the impact on tinnitus loudness, this is based on the analysis of pooled data with a large confidence interval.","Zhaoli Meng, Shixi Liu, Yun Zheng, John S. Phillips (2011).

782,"Background, Given the significant impact epilepsy can have on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals with epilepsy and their families, there is great clinical interest in evidence-based psychological treatments, aimed at enhancing psychological well-being in people with epilepsy. A review of the current evidence was needed to assess the effects of psychological treatments for people with epilepsy on HRQoL outcomes, in order to inform future therapeutic recommendations and research designs., Objectives, To assess the effects of psychological treatments for people with epilepsy on HRQoL outcomes., Search methods, We searched the following databases on 20 September 2016, without language restrictions: Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE PsycINFO, . We screened the references from included studies and relevant reviews, and contacted researchers in the field for unpublished studies., Selection criteria, We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs for this review. HRQoL was the main outcome measure. For the operational definition of 'psychological treatments', we included a broad range of treatments that used psychological or behavioral techniques designed to improve HRQoL, seizure frequency and severity, and psychiatric comorbidities for adults and children with epilepsy, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) or an active control group., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration., Main results, We included 24 completed RCTs, with a total of 2439 participants. Eleven studies investigated psychological interventions, such as cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness-based interventions. The remaining studies were classified as educational interventions (N = 7), self-management interventions (N = 3), adherence interventions (N = 1), and mixed interventions (N = 2). Two studies investigated interventions for children and adolescents, and five studies investigated interventions for adolescents and adults. Based on satisfactory clinical and methodological homogeneity, we pooled data from six adult studies, two studies on adolescents and adults, and one on adolescents and young adults (468 participants) for HRQoL, measured with the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31). We found significant mean changes for the QOLIE-31 total score and six subscales (emotional well-being, energy and fatigue, overall QoL, seizure worry, medication effects, and cognitive functioning). The mean changes of the QOLIE-31 total score (mean improvement of 5.68 points (95% CI 3.11 to 8.24; P < 0.0001), and three subscales, emotional well-being (mean improvement of 7.03 points (95% CI 2.51 to 11.54; P = 0.002); energy and Fatigue (mean improvement of 6.90 points (95% CI 3.49 to 10.31; P < 0.0001); and overall QoL (mean improvement of 6.47 points (95% CI 2.68 to 10.25; P = 0.0008) exceeded the threshold of minimally important change (MIC), indicating a clinically meaningful post-intervention improvement of QoL. We downgraded the quality of the evidence provided by the meta-analysis because of serious risk of bias in some of the included studies. Consequentially, these results provided evidence of moderate quality that psychological treatments for adults with epilepsy may enhance overall QoL in people with epilepsy., Authors' conclusions, Implications for practice: Psychological interventions and self-management interventions improved QoL, and emotional well-being, and reduced fatigue in adults and adolescents with epilepsy. Adjunctive use of psychological treatments for adults and adolescents with epilepsy may provide additional benefits to QoL in those who incorporate patient-centered management.","Rosa Michaelis, Venus Tang, Janelle L.

Nevertheless, no reviews have been published that systematically assess the effectiveness of pharmacological maintenance treatment in adolescents., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of any maintenance treatment alone or in combination with psychosocial intervention compared to no intervention, other pharmacological intervention or psychosocial interventions for retaining adolescents in treatment, reducing the use of substances and improving health and social status., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Trials Register (January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014, Issue 1), PubMed (January 1966 to January 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2014), CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2014), Web of Science (1991 to January 2014) and reference lists of articles., Selection criteria, Randomised and controlled clinical trials of any maintenance pharmacological interventions either alone or associated with psychosocial intervention compared with no intervention, placebo, other pharmacological intervention, pharmacological detoxification or psychosocial intervention in adolescents (13 to 18 years)., Data collection and analysis, We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration., Main results, We included two trials involving 189 participants. One study, with 35 participants, compared methadone with levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) for maintenance treatment lasting 16 weeks, after which patients were detoxified. The other study, with 154 participants, compared maintenance treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone and detoxification with buprenorphine. We did not perform meta-analysis because the two studies assessed different comparisons., Authors' conclusions, It is difficult to draft conclusions on the basis of only two trials. One of the possible reasons for the lack of evidence could be the difficulty of conducting trials with young people for practical and ethical reasons.","Silvia Minozzi, Laura Amato, Cristina Bellisario, Marina Davoli (2014).

786,"Background, Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem that is characterised by recidivism and a host of medical and psychosocial complications. Although effective pharmacotherapy is available for alcohol and heroin dependence, none is currently available for cocaine dependence, despite two decades of clinical trials primarily involving antidepressant, anticonvulsivant and dopaminergic medications. Extensive consideration has been given to optimal pharmacological approaches to the treatment of individuals with cocaine dependence, and both dopamine antagonists and agonists have been considered. Anticonvulsants have been candidates for use in the treatment of addiction based on the hypothesis that seizure kindling-like mechanisms contribute to addiction., Objectives, To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants for individuals with cocaine dependence., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Trials Register (June 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2014), EMBASE (1988 to June 2014), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to June 2014), Web of Science (1991 to June 2014) and the reference lists of eligible articles., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that focus on the use of anticonvulsant medications to treat individuals with cocaine dependence., Data collection and analysis, We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration., Main results, We included a total of 20 studies with 2068 participants. We studied the anticonvulsant drugs carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, tiagabine, topiramate and vigabatrin. All studies compared anticonvulsants versus placebo. Only one study had one arm by which the anticonvulsant was compared with the antidepressant desipramine. Upon comparison of anticonvulsant versus placebo, we found no significant differences for any of the efficacy and safety measures. Dropouts: risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05, 17 studies, 20 arms, 1695 participants, moderate quality of evidence. Use of cocaine: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.02, nine studies, 11 arms, 867 participants, moderate quality of evidence; side effects: RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.90, eight studies, 775 participants; craving: standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.09, seven studies, eight arms, 428 participants, low quality of evidence., Authors' conclusions, Although caution is needed when results from a limited number of small clinical trials are assessed, no current evidence supports the clinical use of anticonvulsant medications in the treatment of patients with cocaine dependence. Although the findings of new trials will improve the quality of study results, especially in relation to specific medications, anticonvulsants as a category cannot be considered first-, second- or third-line treatment for cocaine dependence.","Silvia Minozzi, Michela Cinquini, Laura Amato, Marina Davoli, Michael F.

787,"Background, There is uncertainty as to whether and what extent occupational safety and health regulation and legislation enforcement activities, such as inspections, are effective and efficient to improve workers' health and safety. We use the term regulation to refer both to regulation and legislation., Objectives, To assess the effects of occupational safety and health regulation enforcement tools for preventing occupational diseases and injuries., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (embase.com), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), OSH update, HeinOnline, Westlaw International, EconLit and Scopus from the inception of each database until January 2013. We also checked reference lists of included articles and contacted study authors to identify additional published, unpublished and ongoing studies., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs), interrupted time series (ITS) and econometric panel studies of firms or workplaces evaluating inspections, warnings or orders, citations or fines, prosecution or firm closure by governmental representatives and if the outcomes were injuries, diseases or exposures., Data collection and analysis, Pairs of authors independently extracted data on the main characteristics, the risk of bias and the effects of the interventions. We expressed intervention effects as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD). We recalculated other effect measures into RRs or MDs. We combined the results of similar studies in a meta-analysis., Main results, We located 23 studies: two RCTs with 1414 workplaces, two CBAs with 9903 workplaces, one ITS with six outcome measurements, 12 panel studies and six qualitative studies with 310 participants. Studies evaluated the effects of inspections in general and the effects of their consequences, such as penalties. Studies on the effects of prosecution, warnings or closure were not available or were of such quality that we could not include their results. The effect was measured on injury rates, on exposure to physical workload and on compliance with regulation, with a follow-up varying from one to four years. All studies had serious limitations and therefore the quality of the evidence was low to very low. The injury rates in the control groups varied across studies from 1 to 23 injuries per 100 person-years and compliance rates varied from 40% to 75% being compliant., Authors' conclusions, There is evidence that inspections decrease injuries in the long term but not in the short term. The magnitude of the effect is uncertain. There are no studies that used chemical or physical exposures as outcome. Specific, focused inspections could have larger effects than inspections in general. The effect of fines and penalties is uncertain. The quality of the evidence is low to very low and therefore these conclusions are tentative and can be easily changed by better future studies. There is an urgent need for better designed evaluations, such as pragmatic randomised trials, to establish the effects of existing and novel enforcement methods, especially on exposure and disorders.","Christina Mischke, Jos H.

Children with DCD have difficulties in performing the essential motor tasks required for self-care, academic, social and recreational activities., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of task-oriented interventions on movement performance, psychosocial functions, activity, and participation for children with DCD and to examine differential intervention effects as a factor of age, sex, severity of DCD, intervention intensity, and type of intervention., Search methods, In March 2017, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, 13 other databases, and five trials registers. We also searched reference lists, and contacted members of the mailing list of the International Conference on DCD to identify additional studies., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the task-oriented intervention with either an inactive control intervention or an active control intervention in children and adolescents aged four to 18 years with a diagnosis of DCD., Data collection and analysis, All review authors participated in study selection, data extraction, and assessments of risk of bias and quality, and two review authors independently performed all tasks. Specifically, two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts to eliminate irrelevant studies, extracted data from the included studies, assessed risk of bias, and rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. In cases of ambiguity or information missing from the paper, one review author contacted trial authors., Main results, This review included 15 studies (eight RCTs and seven quasi-RCTs)., Authors' conclusions, We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. The conclusions drawn from previous reviews, which unanimously reported beneficial effects of intervention, are inconsistent with our conclusions.

791,"Background, Functional analysis (FA) for the management of challenging behaviour is a promising behavioural intervention that involves exploring the meaning or purpose of an individual's behaviour. It extends the 'ABC' approach of behavioural analysis, to overcome the restriction of having to derive a single explanatory hypothesis for the person's behaviour. It is seen as a first line alternative to traditional pharmacological management for agitation and aggression. FA typically requires the therapist to develop and evaluate hypotheses-driven strategies that aid family and staff caregivers to reduce or resolve a person's distress and its associated behavioural manifestations., Objectives, To assess the effects of functional analysis-based interventions for people with dementia (and their caregivers) living in their own home or in other settings., Search methods, We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 3 March 2011 using the terms: FA, behaviour (intervention, management, modification), BPSD, psychosocial and Dementia., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with reported behavioural outcomes that could be associated with functional analysis for the management of challenging behaviour in dementia., Data collection and analysis, Four reviewers selected trials for inclusion. Two reviewers worked independently to extract data and assess trial quality, including bias. Meta-analyses for reported incidence, frequency, severity of care recipient challenging behaviour and mood (primary outcomes) and caregiver reaction, burden and mood were performed. Details of adverse effects were noted., Main results, Eighteen trials are included in the review. The majority were in family care settings. For fourteen studies, FA was just one aspect of a broad multi-component programme of care. Assessing the effect of FA was compromised by ill-defined protocols for the duration of component parts of these programmes (i.e. frequency of the intervention or actual time spent). Therefore, establishing the real effect of the FA component was not possible., Authors' conclusions, The delivery of FA has been incorporated within wide ranging multi-component programmes and study designs have varied according to setting - i.e. family care, care homes and hospital, with surprisingly few studies located in care homes. Our findings suggest potential beneficial effects of multi-component interventions, which utilise FA. Whilst functional analysis for challenging behaviour in dementia care shows promise, it is too early to draw conclusions about its efficacy.","Esme D.

792,"Background, Bipolar disorder is a complex psychiatric disorder and is amongst the top thirty causes of worldwide disability. Mood stabilisers are the primary pharmacological intervention, both in the treatment of acute episodes and in prophylaxis. There is, however, mounting evidence that dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in psychiatric conditions, particularly those involving disturbances of mood., Objectives, To review the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids as either a monotherapy or an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder., Search strategy, Electronic searches of the following databases were performed: CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 12/2/2008, Supplementary searches were carried out on Biological Abstracts, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, CCDAN Register, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. The search strategy also included cited reference searching, personal contact with all authors of studies initially included and contact with the omega-3 producing pharmaceutical companies., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised controlled trials were included in the review. Studies involving males and females of all ages with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder qualified for inclusion. Studies using any type or dose of omega-3 fatty acid treatment as monotherapy or in addition to standard pharmacotherapy were eligible. The primary outcome was symptom severity; and secondary outcomes were adverse effects, dropout and satisfaction with treatment., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently inspected the citations identified from the search. Potentially relevant abstracts were identified and full papers ordered and reassessed for inclusion and methodological quality. All relevant data were extracted. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was used for continuous outcome data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI)., Main results, Five studies met inclusion criteria for the review, however, methodological quality was highly variable. Only one study, involving 75 participants, provided data for analysis, and showed a benefit of active treatment over control for depression symptom levels (WMD -3.93, 95% CI -7.00 to -0.86)and Clinical Global Impression scores (WMD -0.75, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.17) but not for mania (WMD -2.81, 95% CI -7.68 to 1.90). No serious adverse effects were reported in the five studies. The pattern of dropout was highly variable between studies., Authors' conclusions, Results from one study showed positive effects of omega-3 as an adjunctive treatment for depressive but not manic symptoms in bipolar disorder. These findings must be regarded with caution owing to the limited data available. There is an acute need for well-designed and executed randomised controlled trials in this field.","Paul Montgomery, Alexandra J. Richardson (2009).

793,"Background, Although research on non-surgical treatments for neck pain (NP) is progressing, there remains uncertainty about the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for this population. Addressing cognitive and behavioural factors might reduce the clinical burden and the costs of NP in society., Objectives, To assess the effects of CBT among individuals with subacute and chronic NP. Specifically, the following comparisons were investigated: (1) cognitive-behavioural therapy versus placebo, no treatment, or waiting list controls; (2) cognitive-behavioural therapy versus other types of interventions; (3) cognitive-behavioural therapy in addition to another intervention (e.g. physiotherapy) versus the other intervention alone., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and PubMed, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to November 2014. Reference lists and citations of identified trials and relevant systematic reviews were screened., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials that assessed the use of CBT in adults with subacute and chronic NP., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each study and extracted the data. If sufficient homogeneity existed among studies in the pre-defined comparisons, a meta-analysis was performed. We determined the quality of the evidence for each comparison with the GRADE approach., Main results, We included 10 randomised trials (836 participants) in this review. Four trials (40%) had low risk of bias, the remaining 60% of trials had a high risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, With regard to chronic neck pain, CBT was found to be statistically significantly more effective for short-term pain reduction only when compared to no treatment, but these effects could not be considered clinically meaningful. When comparing both CBT to other types of interventions and CBT in addition to another intervention to the other intervention alone, no differences were found. For patients with subacute NP, CBT was significantly better than other types of interventions at reducing pain at short-term follow-up, while no difference was found for disability and kinesiophobia. Further research is recommended to investigate the long-term benefits and risks of CBT including for the different subgroups of subjects with NP.","Marco Monticone, Christine Cedraschi, Emilia Ambrosini, Barbara Rocca, Roberta Fiorentini, Maddalena Restelli, Silvia Gianola, Simona Ferrante, Gustavo Zanoli, Lorenzo Moja (2016).

796,"Background, Recurrence rates for bipolar disorder are high despite effective treatments with mood stabiliser drugs. Self-help treatments and psychological treatments that teach patients to recognise and manage early warning symptoms and signs (EWS) of impending manic or depressive episodes are popular with patients. The main aim of such interventions is to intervene early and prevent bipolar episodes, thereby increasing the time to the next recurrence and preventing hospitalisation., Objectives, To compare the effectiveness of an EWS intervention plus treatment as usual (TAU ) versus TAU (involving and not involving a psychological therapy) on time to manic, depressive and all bipolar episodes (the primary outcome), hospitalisation, functioning, depressive and manic symptoms., Search methods, Relevant studies identified by searching Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References - searched on 20/10/2005), supplemented with hand searching the journal Bipolar Disorders, searching the UK National Research Register, checking reference lists of included studies and contacting authors., Selection criteria, Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Participants were adults with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder based on standardised psychiatric criteria., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently rated trials for inclusion. Data were extracted from included trials by reviewers using a data extraction sheet. Authors of all the included studies were contacted for any additional information required. Time to recurrence data was summarised as log hazard ratios, dichotomous data as relative risk and continuous data as weighted mean difference, using random effects models to calculate effect size only when there was heterogeneity in the data., Main results, Eleven RCTs were identified, but only six provided primary outcome data. All six RCTs were of high quality. Time to first recurrence of any type (RE, hazards ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.82), time to manic/hypomanic episode, time to depressive episode, and percentage of people hospitalised and functioning favoured the intervention group. Neither depressive nor hypomanic symptoms differed between intervention and control groups., Authors' conclusions, This review shows a beneficial effect of EWS in time to recurrence, percentage of people hospitalised and functioning in people with bipolar disorder. However, the absence of data on the primary outcome measure in so many included studies is a source of concern and a potential source of bias. Mental health services should consider routinely providing EWS interventions to adults with bipolar disorder, as they appear to reduce hospitalisation and therefore may be cost-effective.","Richard Morriss, Amir Mohammad Faizal, Ashley P.

797,"Background, Schizophrenia has a lifetime prevalence of less than one per cent. Studies have indicated that early symptoms that are idiosyncratic to the person with schizophrenia (early warning signs) often precede acute psychotic relapse. Early warning signs interventions propose that learning to detect and manage early warning signs of impending relapse might prevent or delay acute psychotic relapse., Objectives, To compare the effectiveness of early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual involving and not involving a psychological therapy on time to relapse, hospitalisation, functioning, negative and positive symptomatology., Search methods, Search databases included the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2007 and May 2012) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were reviewed for inclusion. We inspected the UK National Research Registe and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information., Selection criteria, We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual to treatment as usual for people with schizophrenia or other non-affective psychosis, Data collection and analysis, We assessed included studies for quality and extracted data. If more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up, the study was excluded. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), for continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MD) with standard errors estimated, and for time to event outcomes we calculated Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs) and associated 95 % CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and assessed overall study quality using the GRADE approach., Main results, Thirty-two RCTs and two cluster-RCTs that randomised 3554 people satisfied criteria for inclusion. Only one study examined the effects of early warning signs interventions without additional psychological interventions, and many of the outcomes for this review were not reported or poorly-reported. Significantly fewer people relapsed with early warning signs interventions than with usual care (23% versus 43%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79; 15 RCTs, 1502 participants; very low quality evidence). Time to relapse did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs, 550 participants; very low quality evidence). Risk of re-hospitalisation was significantly lower with early warning signs interventions compared to usual care (19% versus 39%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.66; 15 RCTS, 1457 participants; very low quality evidence). Time to re-hospitalisation did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs; 1149 participants; very low quality evidence). Participants' satisfaction with care and economic costs were inconclusive because of a lack of evidence., Authors' conclusions, This review indicates that early warning signs interventions may have a positive effect on the proportions of people re-hospitalised and on rates of relapse, but not on time to recurrence. However, the overall quality of the evidence was very low, indicating that we do not know if early warning signs interventions will have similar effects outside trials and that it is very likely that further research will alter these estimates. Moreover, the early warning signs interventions were used along side other psychological interventions, and we do not know if they would be effective on their own. They may be cost-effective due to reduced hospitalisation and relapse rates, but before mental health services consider routinely providing psychological interventions involving the early recognition and prompt management of early warning signs to adults with schizophrenia, further research is required to provide evidence of high or moderate quality regarding the efficacy of early warning signs interventions added to usual care without additional psychological inte","Richard Morriss, Indira Vinjamuri, Amir Mohammad Faizal, Catherine A.

800,"Background, A particularly difficult challenge for community treatment of people with serious mental illnesses is the delivery of an acceptable level of care during the acute phases of severe mental illness. Crisis-intervention models of care were developed as a possible solution., Objectives, To review the effects of crisis-intervention models for anyone with serious mental illness experiencing an acute episode compared to the standard care they would normally receive. If possible, to compare the effects of mobile crisis teams visiting patients' homes with crisis units based in home-like residential houses., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials. There is no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. This search was undertaken in 1998 and then updated 2003, 2006, 2010 and September 29, 2014., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials of crisis-intervention models versus standard care for people with severe mental illnesses that met our inclusion criteria., Data collection and analysis, We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table., Main results, The update search September 2014 found no further new studies for inclusion, the number of studies included in this review remains eight with a total of 1144 participants. Our main outcomes of interest are hospital use, global state, mental state, quality of life, participant satisfaction and family burden. With the exception of mental state, it was not possible to pool data for these outcomes., Authors' conclusions, Care based on crisis-intervention principles, with or without an ongoing homecare package, appears to be a viable and acceptable way of treating people with serious mental illnesses. However only eight small studies with unclear blinding, reporting and attrition bias could be included and evidence for the main outcomes of interest is low to moderate quality. If this approach is to be widely implemented it would seem that more evaluative studies are still needed.","Suzanne M. Murphy, Claire B. Irving, Clive E. Adams, Muhammad Waqar (2015).

801,"Background, Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) are computer-based, usually web-based, information packages for patients that combine health information with at least one of social support, decision support, or behaviour change support. These are innovations in health care and their effects on health are uncertain., Objectives, To assess the effects of IHCAs for people with chronic disease., Search strategy, We designed a four-part search strategy. First, we searched electronic bibliographic databases for published work; second, we searched the grey literature; and third, we searched for ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in the appropriate databases. Finally, researchers of included studies were contacted, and reference lists from relevant primary and review articles were followed up. As IHCAs require relatively new technology, the search time period commenced at 1990, where possible, and ran until 31 December 2003., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of IHCAs for adults and children with chronic disease., Data collection and analysis, One review author screened abstracts for relevance. Two review authors screened all candidate studies to determine eligibility, apply quality criteria, and extract data from included studies. Authors of included RCTs were contacted for missing data. Results of RCTs were pooled using random-effects model with standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes; heterogeneity was assessed using the I(superscript 2) statistic., Main results, We identified 24 RCTs involving 3739 participants which were included in the review., Authors' conclusions, IHCAs appear to have largely positive effects on users, in that users tend to become more knowledgeable, feel better socially supported, and may have improved behavioural and clinical outcomes compared to non-users. There is a need for more high quality studies with large sample sizes to confirm these preliminary findings, to determine the best type and best way to deliver IHCAs, and to establish how IHCAs have their effects for different groups of people with chronic illness.","Elizabeth Murray, Joanne Burns, Sharon See Tai, Rosalind Lai, Irwin Nazareth (2009).

803,"Background, Cognitive behavioural therapy for people with schizophrenia is a psychotherapeutic approach that establishes links between thoughts, emotions and behaviours and challenges dysfunctional thoughts. There is some evidence to suggest that cognitive behavioural therapy for people with psychosis (CBTp) might be an effective treatment for people with schizophrenia. There are however, limitations in its provision due to available resource and training issues. One way to tackle this issue might be to offer a brief version of CBTp., Objectives, To review the effects of brief CBTp (6 to 10 regular sessions given in less than 4 months and using a manual) for people with schizophrenia compared with standard CBTp (12 to 20 regular sessions given in 4 to 6 months and using a manual)., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (August 21, 2013 and August 26, 2015) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of Clinical Trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. We inspected all references of the selected articles for further relevant trials. We also contacted experts in the field regarding brief CBTp studies., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials involving adults with schizophrenia or related disorders, comparing brief cognitive behavioural therapy for people with psychosis versus standard CBTp., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened and assessed studies for inclusion using pre-specified inclusion criteria., Main results, We found only seven studies which used a brief version of CBTp, but no study compared brief CBTp with CBTp of standard duration. No studies could be included., Authors' conclusions, Currently there is no literature available to compare brief with standard CBTp for people with schizophrenia. We cannot, therefore, conclude whether brief CBTp is as effective, less effective or even more effective than standard courses of the same therapy. This lack of evidence for brief CBTp has serious implications for research and practice. Well planned, conducted and reported randomised trials are indicated.","Farooq Naeem, Saeed Farooq, David Kingdon (2015).

804,"Background, The teaching profession is an occupation with a high prevalence of work-related stress. This may lead to sustained physical and mental health problems in teachers. It can also negatively affect the health, wellbeing and educational attainment of children, and impose a financial burden on the public budget in terms of teacher turnover and sickness absence. Most evaluated interventions for the wellbeing of teachers are directed at the individual level, and so do not tackle the causes of stress in the workplace. Organisational-level interventions are a potential avenue in this regard., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness of organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work-related stress in teachers., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, AEI, BEI, BiblioMap, DARE, DER, ERIC, IBSS, SSCI, Sociological Abstracts, a number of specialist occupational health databases, and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources from the inception of each database until January 2015., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, and controlled before-and-after studies of organisational-level interventions for the wellbeing of teachers., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane., Main results, Four studies met the inclusion criteria. They were three cluster-randomised controlled trials and one with a stepped-wedge design., Authors' conclusions, We found low-quality evidence that organisational interventions lead to improvements in teacher wellbeing and retention rates. We need further evaluation of the effects of organisational interventions for teacher wellbeing. These studies should follow a complex-interventions framework, use a cluster-randomised design and have large sample sizes.","Ali Naghieh, Paul Montgomery, Christopher P.

805,"Background, Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first-line treatment in primary and secondary care settings. Milnacipran, a dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care., Objectives, To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran in comparison with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), heterocyclics, SSRIs and other newer antidepressive agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression., Search strategy, The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis review group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were electronically searched in August 2008. References of relevant trials and other reviews were also checked. Trial databases of the drug-approving agencies and ongoing clinical trial registers for all published and unpublished trials were hand-searched in 2007. All relevant authors were contacted for supplemental data. No language restriction was applied., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing milnacipran with any other active antidepressive agents (including non-conventional agents such as herbal products like hypericum) as monotherapy in the acute phase of major depression were selected., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently checked eligibility, assessed methodological quality and extracted data from the eligible trials using a standardised data extraction form. The number of participants who responded to treatment or those who achieved remission were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, combining data from the included trials., Main results, A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (n=2277) were included in the meta-analysis.Despite the size of this sample, the pooled 95% confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressive agents. However, compared with TCAs, patients taking milnacipran were associated with fewer dropouts due to adverse events (OR 0.55; 95%CI 0.35 to 0.85). There was also some weak evidence to suggest that patients taking milnacipran experienced fewer adverse events of sleepiness/ drowsiness, dry mouth or constipation compared with TCAs., Authors' conclusions, Currently, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether milnacipran is superior, inferior or the same as other antidepressive agents in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of major depression. However, there is some evidence in favour of milnacipran over TCAs in terms of dropouts due to adverse events (acceptability) and the rates of experiencing adverse events (tolerability). Information about other clinically meaningful outcomes such as cost-effectiveness and social functioning, including the ability to return to work, is lacking. Further study is needed to answer whether milnacipran would be the better choice of antidepressant for acute major depression.","Atsuo Nakagawa, Norio Watanabe, Ichiro M.

806,"Background, Both inhaled steroids (ICS) and long-acting beta(subscript 2)-agonists (LABA) are used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This updated review compared compound LABA plus ICS therapy (LABA/ICS) with the LABA component drug given alone., Objectives, To assess the efficacy of ICS and LABA in a single inhaler with mono-component LABA alone in adults with COPD., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. The date of the most recent search was November 2011., Selection criteria, We included randomised, double-blind controlled trials. We included trials comparing compound ICS and LABA preparations with their component LABA preparations in people with COPD., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed study risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcomes were exacerbations, mortality and pneumonia, while secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life (measured by validated scales), lung function, withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, withdrawals due to adverse events and side-effects. Dichotomous data were analysed as random-effects model odds ratios or rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous data as mean differences and 95% CIs. We rated the quality of evidence for exacerbations, mortality and pneumonia according to recommendations made by the GRADE working group., Main results, Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomising 11,794 people with severe COPD. We looked at any LABA plus ICS inhaler (LABA/ICS) versus the same LABA component alone, and then we looked at the 10 studies which assessed fluticasone plus salmeterol (FPS) and the four studies assessing budesonide plus formoterol (BDF) separately. The studies were well-designed with low risk of bias for randomisation and blinding but they had high rates of attrition, which reduced our confidence in the results for outcomes other than mortality., Authors' conclusions, Concerns over the analysis and availability of data from the studies bring into question the superiority of ICS/LABA over LABA alone in preventing exacerbations. The effects on hospitalisations were inconsistent and require further exploration. There was moderate quality evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with ICS/LABA. There was moderate quality evidence that treatments had similar effects on mortality. Quality of life, symptoms score, rescue medication use and FEV(subscript 1) improved more on ICS/LABA than on LABA, but the average differences were probably not clinically significant for these outcomes. To an individual patient the increased risk of pneumonia needs to be balanced against the possible reduction in exacerbations.","Javier Luis Nannini, Toby J. Lasserson, Phillippa Poole (2013).

807,"Background, Multidisciplinary care (MDC) is increasingly thought to be an important means of symptomatic and supportive management for motor neuron disease (MND) but the evidence base for its effectiveness is unclear. This is the first update of a review first published in 2009., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of MDC in adults with MND, especially the types of approaches that are effective (settings, intensity) and the outcomes that are affected., Search methods, We searched The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (5 July 2011), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 3, searched 20 July 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2011), EMBASE (1980 to June 2011), CINAHL Plus (1937 to June 2011), AMED (1985 to June 2011) and LILACS (1982 to June 2011)., Selection criteria, Randomised and controlled clinical trials that compared MDC in MND with either routinely available local services or lower levels of intervention; or studies that compared MDC in different settings or at different levels of intensity., Data collection and analysis, We performed a 'best evidence' synthesis based on methodological quality. We grouped studies in terms of setting and intensity (high or low) of therapy., Main results, No randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials were identified for the original review or this update. We summarised the results of five observational studies (including one with two reports) in the Discussion section of this review., Authors' conclusions, In the absence of randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials, the 'best' evidence to date is based on three 'low' and two 'very low quality' observational studies. These suggest 'very low quality evidence' for an advantage for mental health domains (only) of quality of life without increasing healthcare costs, and 'low level quality' evidence for reduced hospitalisation for MDC in low-intensity outpatient settings; and 'very low quality' evidence for improved disability in high-intensity settings. The evidence for survival is conflicting. These conclusions are tentative and the gap in current research should not be interpreted as proof that MDC is ineffective. Further research is needed into appropriate study designs; outcome measurement; caregiver needs; and the evaluation of optimal settings, type, intensity or frequency and cost-effectiveness of MDC in the MND population. Future research should focus on observational designs to assess care and outcomes in 'real-life' settings. The interface between neurology, rehabilitation and palliative care should be explored to provide long-term support for MND.","Louisa Ng, Fary Khan (2011).

We used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence., Main results, We included 23 studies with 26 study arms, involving 5996 participants with either a major depressive disorder or a high level of depressive symptoms. We judged 14 studies to have a high risk of bias and nine to have a low risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, We found moderate quality evidence that adding a work-directed intervention to a clinical intervention reduced the number of days on sick leave compared to a clinical intervention alone. We also found moderate quality evidence that enhancing primary or occupational care with cognitive behavioural therapy reduced sick leave compared to the usual care. A structured telephone outreach and care management program that included medication reduced sickness absence compared to usual care. However, enhancing primary care with a quality improvement program did not have a considerable effect on sickness absence.

811,"Background, In the 1940s reserpine, refined from a plant extract that had been used for centuries, began to be used as a treatment for people with mental disorders and was one of the very first antipsychotic drugs. Its irreversible pharmacological potency and adverse effects meant that it has been withdrawn in the UK and its role has been superceded by 'newer' compounds. The effects of reserpine are of historical interest although there are some reports of it still being used in highly specialist situations in psychiatry. Chlorpromazine is also an old drug but it is still used for treatment of people with schizophrenia., Objectives, To investigate the effects of two old medications (reserpine and chlorpromazine) for people with schizophrenia. Reserpine is now rarely used while chlorpromazine remains on the essential list of drugs of the World Health Organization (WHO)., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (24 March 2016)., Selection criteria, We included randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus reserpine for schizophrenia that presented useable data., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE., Main results, The review currently includes nine studies with an average 60 participants per study. All of these studies are now over 60 years old, conducted between 1955 and 1962. When chlorpromazine was compared with reserpine for people with schizophrenia, improvement in global state was better at short term for those receiving chlorpromazine (n = 781, 6 RCTs, RR 'not improved' 0.75 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92, low-quality evidence). Short-term improvement in paranoid distortion was measured using the Multidimensional Scale for Rating Psychiatric Patients (MSRPP). Data showed no clear difference between treatment groups (n = 19, 1 RCT, RR 1.33 95% CI 0.62 to 2.89, very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in functioning: occupational adjustment, medium term (n = 40, 1 RCT, RR 0.83 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47, moderate-quality evidence) and general behaviour (n = 98, 1 RCT, RR 0.79 CI 0.41 to 1.53, moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events were poorly reported. For 'toxic reaction' there was, again, no obvious difference between the two compounds (n = 210, 3 RCTs, RR 1.68 95% CI 0.43 to 6.54, moderate-quality evidence), and this also applied to leaving the study early (n = 229, 4 RCTs, RR 1.16 95% CI 0.94 to 1.42, moderate-quality evidence)., Authors' conclusions, Judged by standards of today, the evidence is largely of limited quality. However, some of these 1950s studies are remarkable in their foresight and clarity. Reserpine did have some effect on global state - but chlorpromazine did seem to perform better. Important issues regarding adverse effects were not really addressed by these trials. Chlorpromazine remains on the WHO list of essential drugs. Reserpine is now almost obsolete, although, probably as a result of evidence other than that reported in the pioneering trials used in this review.","Selin Nur, Clive E. Adams (2016).

812,"Background, Paliperidone palmitate, a long-acting, intramuscular formulation of paliperidone, is now available for clinical use. Paliperidone is an active metabolite of risperidone and it is also available in an oral formulation for daily use., Objectives, To compare the effects of paliperidone palmitate with any other treatment for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (November 2009) and inspected references of identified studies for further trials. We contacted the manufacturers of paliperidone palmitate, the Food and Drug Administration, and authors of relevant trials for additional material., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs)., Data collection and analysis, We independently selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Where possible and appropriate, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) with the number needed to benefit/harm statistic (NNB/H). We calculated mean differences (MD) for continuous data., Main results, Five studies with 2215 participants compared paliperidone palmitate with placebo. Fewer people left studies early if they were randomised to paliperidone palmitate (n = 2183, 5 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.70 to 0.84, NNTB 9 CI 7 to 14) and those receiving any dose of paliperidone palmitate were significantly less likely to show no improvement in global state (n = 1696, 4 RCTs, RR 0.79 CI 0.74 to 0.85, NNTB 7 CI 5 to 9). People randomised to paliperidone palmitate were less likely to experience a recurrence of psychosis (n = 312, 1 RCT, RR 0.28 CI 0.17 to 0.48, NNTB 5 CI 4 to 6) than those allocated to placebo in a single trial specifically designed to study recurrence. In the other studies where recurrence was recorded only as an adverse event, we found that people who received paliperidone palmitate were also less likely to experience a recurrence of psychotic symptoms (n = 1837, 4 RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.44 to 0.68, NNTB 10 CI 8 to 14). Paliperidone palmitate was associated with fewer reports of agitation or aggression (n = 2180, 5 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.46 to 0.91, NNTB 39 CI 25 to 150) and of using anxiolytic medications (n = 2170, 5 RCTs, RR 0.89 CI 0.83 to 0.96, NNTB 16 CI 11 to 44). A consistent, significant elevation in serum prolactin (ng/mL) was found for both men and women receiving paliperidone palmitate, but the data were too heterogenous to sum. We found no evidence of sexual dysfunction in these short-term trials. People receiving paliperidone palmitate had a significantly greater increase in weight (n = 2052, 5 RCTs, MD 1.34 CI 0.97 to 1.70) in comparison with people who received placebo., Authors' conclusions, In short-term studies, paliperidone palmitate is an antipsychotic drug that is more efficacious than placebo. We found its adverse effects to be similar to those of its related compounds, paliperidone and risperidone, with extrapyramidal movement disorders, weight gain, and tachycardia all more common with paliperidone palmitate than placebo. While no difference was found in the incidence of reported adverse sexual outcomes, paliperidone palmitate is associated with substantial increases in serum prolactin. When flexibly dosed with a mean doses of approximately 70 to 110 mg every four weeks, paliperidone palmitate appears comparable in efficacy and tolerability to risperidone long-acting injection flexibly dosed with mean doses of approximately 35 mg every two weeks.","Abraham M.

813,"Background, Paliperidone, an active metabolite of risperidone, is now available in an oral formulation for daily use; an intramuscular formulation for monthly administration is expected to follow shortly. Oral paliperidone is available commercially only in an extended release formulation that was used in all of the clinical trials we examined in this review., Objectives, To compare effects of oral paliperidone with any other treatment for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (November 2008) and inspected references of identified studies for further trials. We contacted the manufacturers of paliperidone, the Food and Drug Administration, and authors of relevant trials for additional material., Selection criteria, We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs)., Data collection and analysis, We independently selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Where possible and appropriate, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) with the number needed to treat (NNT). We calculated Weighted Mean Differences (WMD) for continuous data., Main results, Eight studies with 2567 participants compared paliperidone with placebo. Fewer people left studies early if they were randomised to paliperidone (n=1926, 7 RCTs, RR 0.68 CI 0.61 to 0.75, NNT 7 CI 6 to 10) and those receiving any dose of paliperidone were significantly more likely to have an improvement in global state (n=1420, 4 RCTs, RR 0.69 CI 0.63 to 0.75, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6). People randomised to paliperidone were less likely to experience a recurrence of psychosis (n=1918, 7 RCTs, RR 0.47 CI 0.34 to 0.66, NNT 17 CI 14 to 26) than those allocated to placebo. Paliperidone was associated with a greater incidence of tachycardia than placebo (n=1638, 5 RCTs, RR 1.88 CI 1.28 to 2.76, NNH 21 CI 11 to 90) and a consistent, significant elevation in serum prolactin (ng/mL) for both men (n=413, 4 RCTs, WMD 27.68 CI 23.66 to 31.69) and women (n=252, 4 RCTs, WMD 87.39 CI 74.27 to 100.51). People receiving paliperidone were more likely to experience extrapyramidal disorders (n=1680, 6 RCTs, RR 2.27 CI 1.31 to 3.95, NNH 28 CI 12 to 111) and weight gain (n=769, 4 RCTs, WMD 1.07 CI 0.65 to 1.49, I-squared 78%) compared with those allocated to placebo., Authors' conclusions, In short-term studies, oral paliperidone is an antipsychotic drug that is more efficacious than placebo. We found its adverse effects to be similar to those of its parent compound, risperidone, with movement disorders, weight gain and tachycardia all more common with paliperidone than placebo. While no difference was found in the incidence of reported adverse sexual outcomes, paliperidone is associated with substantial increases in serum prolactin. When used at doses of 6 mg per day or higher, oral paliperidone appears comparable in efficacy to olanzapine 10 mg/day. A single study of six days duration found neither an advantage nor disadvantage of paliperidone compared to risperidone. When dosed flexibly with other psychotropics available, it appears to be comparable in efficacy to flexible doses of quetiapine with other psychotropics available.","Abraham M. Nussbaum, T. S.

814,"Background, There is currently no strong consensus regarding the optimal management of complex regional pain syndrome although a multitude of interventions have been described and are commonly used., Objectives, To summarise the evidence from Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews of the effectiveness of any therapeutic intervention used to reduce pain, disability or both in adults with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)., Methods, We identified Cochrane reviews and non-Cochrane reviews through a systematic search of the following databases: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and PEDro. We included non-Cochrane systematic reviews where they contained evidence not covered by identified Cochrane reviews. The methodological quality of reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR tool., Main results, We included six Cochrane reviews and 13 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. Cochrane reviews demonstrated better methodological quality than non-Cochrane reviews. Trials were typically small and the quality variable., Authors' conclusions, There is a critical lack of high quality evidence for the effectiveness of most therapies for CRPS.

We pooled studies that were similar., Main results, We found 8 RCTs with 11,164 participants but one study did not provide enough data. Studies compared VCT to no VCT and education to no intervention and to alternative education., Authors' conclusions, Workplace interventions to prevent HIV are feasible. There is moderate quality evidence that VCT offered at the work site increases the uptake of testing. Even though this did no lower HIV-incidence, there was a decrease in self-reported sexual transmitted diseases and a decrease in risky sexual behaviour. There is low quality evidence that educational interventions decrease sexually transmitted diseases, unprotected sex and sex with commercial sex workers but not sex with multiple partners and the use of alcohol before sex.","Olumuyiwa Ojo, Jos H.

817,"Background, Fluvoxamine, one of the oldest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is prescribed to patients with major depression in many countries. Several studies have previously reviewed the efficacy and tolerability of fluvoxamine for the treatment of major depression. However, these reviews are now outdated., Objectives, Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability and side effect profile of fluvoxamine for major depression in comparison with other anti-depressive agents, including tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs, SNRIs, other newer agents and other conventional psychotropic drugs., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register. Trial databases and ongoing trial registers in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia, were handsearched for randomised controlled trials. We checked reference lists of the articles included in the review, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of affective disorder for published reports and citations of unpublished research. The date of last search was 31 August 2008., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials, published in any language, that compared fluvoxamine with any other active antidepressants in the acute phase treatment of major depression., Data collection and analysis, Two independent review authors inspected citations and abstracts, obtained papers, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We analysed dichotomous data using odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data using the standardised mean difference (SMD). A random effects model was used to combine studies., Main results, A total of 54 randomised controlled trials (n = 5122) were included. No strong evidence was found to indicate that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to other antidepressants regarding response, remission and tolerability. However, differing side effect profiles were evident, especially with regard to gastrointestinal side effects of fluvoxamine when compared to other antidepressants. For example, fluvoxamine was generally associated with a higher incidence of vomiting/nausea (versus imipramine, OR 2.23, CI 1.59 to 3.14; versus clomipramine, OR 2.13, CI 1.06 to 4.27; versus amitriptyline, OR 2.86, CI 1.31 to 2.63)., Authors' conclusions, We found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to any other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of depression. However, differing side effect profiles were evident. Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations, including these differences in side effect profiles.","Ichiro M.

818,"Background, Several rehabilitation programmes are available for individuals after lumbar disc surgery., Objectives, To determine whether active rehabilitation after lumbar disc surgery is more effective than no treatment, and to describe which type of active rehabilitation is most effective. This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 4) and MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro and PsycINFO to May 2013., Selection criteria, We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs)., Data collection and analysis, Pairs of review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias. Meta-analyses were performed if studies were clinically homogeneous. The GRADE approach was used to determine the overall quality of evidence., Main results, In this update, we identified eight new studies, thereby including a total of 22 trials (2503 participants), 10 of which had a low risk of bias. Most rehabilitation programmes were assessed in only one study. Both men and women were included, and overall mean age was 41.4 years. All participants had received standard discectomy, microdiscectomy and in one study standard laminectomy and (micro)discectomy. Mean duration of the rehabilitation intervention was 12 weeks; eight studies assessed six to eight-week exercise programmes, and eight studies assessed 12 to 13-week exercise programmes. Programmes were provided in primary and secondary care facilities and were started immediately after surgery (n = 4) or four to six weeks (n = 16) or one year after surgery (n = 2). In general, the overall quality of the evidence is low to very low. Rehabilitation programmes that started immediately after surgery were not more effective than their control interventions, which included exercise. Low- to very low-quality evidence suggests that there were no differences between specific rehabilitation programmes (multidisciplinary care, behavioural graded activity, strength and stretching) that started four to six weeks postsurgery and their comparators, which included some form of exercise. Low-quality evidence shows that physiotherapy from four to six weeks postsurgery onward led to better function than no treatment or education only, and that multidisciplinary rehabilitation co-ordinated by medical advisors led to faster return to work than usual care. Statistical pooling was performed only for three comparisons in which the rehabilitation programmes started four to six weeks postsurgery: exercise programmes versus no treatment, high- versus low-intensity exercise programmes and supervised versus home exercise programmes. Very low-quality evidence (five RCTs, N = 272) shows that exercises are more effective than no treatment for pain at short-term follow-up (standard mean difference (SMD) -0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.55 to -0.24), and low-quality evidence (four RCTs, N = 252) suggests that exercises are more effective for functional status on short-term follow-up (SMD -0.67; 95% CI -1.22 to -0.12) and that no difference in functional status was noted on long-term follow-up (three RCTs, N = 226; SMD -0.22; 95% CI -0.49 to 0.04). None of these studies reported that exercise increased the reoperation rate. Very low-quality evidence (two RCTs, N = 103) shows that high-intensity exercise programmes are more effective than low-intensity exercise programmes for pain in the short term (weighted mean difference (WMD) -10.67; 95% CI -17.04 to -4.30), and low-quality evidence (two RCTs, N = 103) shows that they are more effective for functional status in the short term (SMD -0.77; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.36). Very low-quality evidence (four RCTs, N = 154) suggests no significant differences between supervised and home exercise programmes for short-term pain relief (SMD -0.76; 95% CI -2.04 to 0.53) or functional status (four RCTs, N = 154; SMD -0.36; 95% CI -0.88 to 0.15)., Authors' conclusions, Considerable variation was noted in the content, duration and intensity of the rehabilitation programmes included in this review","Teddy Oosterhuis, O.

819,"Background, Experiencing anxiety and depression is very common in people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Psychological interventions have been suggested as a potential treatment for these populations. Current research suggests that people with dementia and MCI have limited opportunities for psychological treatments aimed at improving their well-being. A systematic review of the evidence on their effectiveness is likely to be useful in terms of improving outcomes for patients and for future recommendations for practice., Objectives, The main objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions in reducing anxiety and depression in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI)., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register and additional sources for both published and unpublished data., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a psychological intervention with usual care or a placebo intervention (social contact control) in people with dementia or MCI., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors worked independently to select trials, extract data and assess studies for risk of bias, using a data extraction form. We contacted authors when further information was not available from the published articles., Main results, Six RCTs involving 439 participants with dementia were included in the review, but no studies of participants with MCI were identified. The studies included people with dementia living in the community or in nursing home care and were carried out in several countries. Only one of the studies was classified as low risk of bias. Five studies were at unclear or high risk of bias due to uncertainties around randomisation, blinding and selective reporting of results. The studies used the different psychological approaches of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy and counselling. Two studies were of multimodal interventions including a specific psychological therapy. The comparison groups received either usual care, attention-control educational programs, diagnostic feedback or services slightly above usual care., Authors' conclusions, We found evidence that psychological interventions added to usual care can reduce symptoms of depression and clinician-rated anxiety for people with dementia. We conclude that psychological interventions have the potential to improve patient well-being. Further high quality studies are needed to investigate which treatments are most effective and to evaluate the effect of psychological interventions in people with MCI.","Vasiliki Orgeta, Afifa Qazi, Aimee E.

820,"Background, A significant number of patients who suffer with anxiety and related disorders (that is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder (SAnD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD), specific phobia (SPh) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) fail to respond optimally to first-line treatment with medication or cognitive and behavioural therapies. The addition of d-cycloserine (DCS) to cognitive and behavioural therapies may improve treatment response by impacting the glutamatergic system. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of adding DCS to cognitive and behavioural therapies by synthesising data from relevant randomised controlled trials and following the guidelines recommended by Cochrane., Objectives, To assess the effect of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared to placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety and related disorders. Additionally, to assess the efficacy and tolerability of DCS across different anxiety and related disorders., Search methods, This review fully incorporates studies identified from a search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 12 March 2015. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date), the World Health Organization's trials portal () and Reference lists from previous meta-analyses and reports of RCTs were also checked. No restrictions were placed on language, setting, date or publication status., Selection criteria, All RCTs of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies versus placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for anxiety and related disorders were included., Data collection and analysis, Two authors (RO and TA) independently assessed RCTs for eligibility and inclusion, extracted outcomes and risk of bias data and entered these into a customised extraction form. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. In addition, data entry and analysis were performed by two review authors (KSW and HB)., Main results, Twenty-one published RCTs, with 788 participants in outpatient settings, were included in the review. Sixteen studies had an age range of 18 to 75 years, while four investigated paediatric populations aged 8 to 17 years and one included children, adolescents and adults. The 21 RCTs investigated OCD (number of RCTs (N) = 6), PTSD (N = 5), SAnD (N = 5), SPh (N = 3) and PD (N = 2). Most information from the studies was rated as having either low risk or unclear risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, This review found no evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for treating anxiety and related disorders in children, adolescents and adults. These findings are based on low quality evidence from heterogenous studies with small sample sizes and incomplete data for clinical response, which precludes us from drawing conclusions on the use of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies at this stage. Given there is some promising preliminary data from individual studies, further research is necessary to assess DCS compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies, and determine mechanisms of action as well as magnitude of effect in anxiety and related disorders.","Rasmita Ori, Taryn Amos, Hanna Bergman, Karla SoaresWeiser, Jonathan C.

821,"Background, People experiencing psychosis may become aggressive. Antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole in intramuscular form, can be used in such situations., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of intramuscular aripiprazole in the treatment of psychosis-induced aggression or agitation (rapid tranquillisation)., Search methods, On 11 December 2014 and 11 April 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-based Register of Trials which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that randomised people with psychosis-induced aggression or agitation to receive either intramuscular aripiprazole or another intramuscular intervention., Data collection and analysis, We independently inspected citations and, where possible, abstracts, ordered papers and re-inspected and quality assessed these. We included studies that met our selection criteria. At least two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We chose a fixed-effect model. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create 'Summary of findings' tables., Main results, Searching found 63 records referring to 21 possible trials. We could only include three studies, all completed over the last decade, with 885 participants, of which 707 were included for quantitative analyses in this systematic review. Due to limited comparisons, small size of trials and a paucity of investigated and reported 'pragmatic' outcomes, evidence was mostly graded as low or very low quality. No trials reported useful data for one of our primary outcomes of tranquil or asleep by 30 minutes. Economic outcomes were also not reported in the trials., Authors' conclusions, The available evidence is of poor quality but there is some evidence aripiprazole is effective compared to placebo and haloperidol, but not when compared to olanzapine. However, considering that evidence comes from only three studies, caution is required in generalising these results to real-world practice. This review firmly highlights the need for more high-quality trials on intramuscular aripiprazole in the management of people with acute aggression or agitation.","Edoardo G.

822,"Background, Interventions to change behaviour among sex workers and their clients have been identified as a strategy to reduce HIV transmission. However, there has been no systematic review that has examined and summarized their effects., Objectives, To identify and evaluate the effects of the studies performed on behavioural interventions to reduce the transmission of HIV infection among sex workers and their clients in high-income countries., Search methods, Electronic searches were undertaken using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and other databases between January 1980 and July 2010. Experts in the field were contacted to locate any other studies., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials or specified quasi-experimental designs with comparison groups that examined the effects of behavioural interventions aimed at reducing the risk of HIV or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) transmission among sex workers in high-income countries. We reviewed studies for outcome relevance and methodological rigor., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to potential studies, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion. Studies were assessed for completeness of reporting and extracted data., Main results, A total of four studies were included, comprising two randomised controlled trials and two quasi-experimental pretest-posttest trials with control groups involving 1795 participants. No trials reported HIV prevalence/incidence as outcomes., Authors' conclusions, There is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials for the effectiveness of behavioural interventions to reduce the transmission of HIV infection among sex workers and their clients in high-income countries. Further randomised controlled trials are very likely to have important impacts on our confidence in the estimates of the effects, and are likely to change the estimates for effective interventions with outcomes of HIV incidence or prevalence and a variety of different settings among sex workers and their clients in high-income countries.

823,"Background, Child and adolescent obesity is increasingly prevalent, and can be associated with significant short- and long-term health consequences., Objectives, To assess the efficacy of lifestyle, drug and surgical interventions for treating obesity in childhood., Search strategy, We searched CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library Issue 2 2008, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, DARE and NHS EED. Searches were undertaken from 1985 to May 2008. References were checked. No language restrictions were applied., Selection criteria, We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lifestyle (i.e. dietary, physical activity and/or behavioural therapy), drug and surgical interventions for treating obesity in children (mean age under 18 years) with or without the support of family members, with a minimum of six months follow up (three months for actual drug therapy). Interventions that specifically dealt with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic cause of obesity were excluded., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data following the Cochrane Handbook. Where necessary authors were contacted for additional information., Main results, We included 64 RCTs (5230 participants). Lifestyle interventions focused on physical activity and sedentary behaviour in 12 studies, diet in 6 studies, and 36 concentrated on behaviorally orientated treatment programs. Three types of drug interventions (metformin, orlistat and sibutramine) were found in 10 studies. No surgical intervention was eligible for inclusion. The studies included varied greatly in intervention design, outcome measurements and methodological quality., Authors' conclusions, While there is limited quality data to recommend one treatment program to be favoured over another, this review shows that combined behavioural lifestyle interventions compared to standard care or self-help can produce a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in overweight in children and adolescents. In obese adolescents, consideration should be given to the use of either orlistat or sibutramine, as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions, although this approach needs to be carefully weighed up against the potential for adverse effects. Furthermore, high quality research that considers psychosocial determinants for behaviour change, strategies to improve clinician-family interaction, and cost-effective programs for primary and community care is required.","Hiltje Oude Luttikhuis, Louise Baur, Hanneke Jansen, Vanessa A.

826,"Background, Therapeutic ultrasound may be offered to people experiencing mild to moderate symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The effectiveness and duration of benefit of this non-surgical intervention remain unclear., Objectives, To review the effects of therapeutic ultrasound compared with no treatment, placebo or another non-surgical intervention in people with CTS., Search methods, On 27 November 2012, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2012, Issue 11 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to November 2012), and AMED (January 1985 to November 2012)., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any regimen of therapeutic ultrasound with no treatment, a placebo or another non-surgical intervention in people with CTS., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We calculated risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for primary and secondary outcomes. We pooled results of clinically homogenous trials in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, where possible, to provide estimates of the effect., Main results, We included 11 studies including 414 participants in the review. Two trials compared therapeutic ultrasound with placebo, two compared one ultrasound regimen with another, two compared ultrasound with another non-surgical intervention, and six compared ultrasound as part of a multi-component intervention with another non-surgical intervention (for example, exercises and splint). The risk of bias was low in some studies and unclear or high in other studies, with only two reporting that the allocation sequence was concealed and six reporting that participants were blinded. Overall, there is insufficient evidence that one therapeutic ultrasound regimen is more efficacious than another. Only two studies reported the primary outcome of interest, short-term overall improvement (any measure in which patients indicate the intensity of their complaints compared with baseline, for example, global rating of improvement, satisfaction with treatment, within three months post-treatment). One low quality trial with 68 participants found that when compared with placebo, therapeutic ultrasound may increase the chance of experiencing short-term overall improvement at the end of seven weeks treatment (RR 2.36; 95% CI 1.40 to 3.98), although losses to follow-up and failure to adjust for the correlation between wrists in participants with bilateral CTS in this study suggest that this data should be interpreted with caution. Another low quality trial with 60 participants found that at three months post-treatment therapeutic ultrasound plus splint increased the chance of short-term overall improvement (patient satisfaction) when compared with splint alone (RR 3.02; 95% CI 1.36 to 6.72), but decreased the chance of short-term overall improvement when compared with low-level laser therapy plus splint (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.33), though participants were not blinded to treatment, it was unclear if the random allocation sequence was adequately concealed, and there was a potential unit of analysis error. Differences between groups receiving different frequencies and intensities of ultrasound, and between ultrasound as part of a multi-component intervention versus other non-surgical interventions, were generally small and not statistically significant for symptoms, function, and neurophysiologic parameters. No studies reported any adverse effects of therapeutic ultrasound, but this outcome was only measured in three studies. More adverse effects data are required before any firm conclusions on the safety of therapeutic ultrasound can be made., Authors' conclusions, There is only poor quality evidence from very limited data to suggest that therapeutic ultrasound may be more effective than placebo for either sh","Matthew J.

827,"Background, The current and projected crisis because of a shortage of health workers in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires that effective strategies for expanding the numbers of health workers are quickly identified in order to inform action by policymakers, educators, and health managers., Objectives, To assess the effect of changes in the pre-licensure education of health professionals on health-worker supply., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 3), EMBASE, Ovid (1980 to week 3, October 2007), MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 to week 3, October 2007), CINAHL (October 2007), LILACS (week 4, November 2007), ERIC (1966 to week 3, February 2008), and Sociological Abstracts (October 2007). We searched WHO (WHOLIS) (February 2008), World Bank, Google Scholar, and human resources on health-related websites to obtain grey literature. Key experts in human resources for health were contacted to identify unpublished studies. The reference lists of included studies were searched for additional articles., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time-series studies that measured increased numbers of health workers ultimately available for recruitment into the health workforce or improved patient to health professional ratios as their primary outcomes were considered. Although the focus of the review was on LMIC, we included studies regardless of where they were done., Data collection and analysis, Heterogeneity between the two included studies precluded meta-analysis; therefore, data were presented separately for each study., Main results, Two studies of the 7880 identified from searching the electronic databases met the inclusion criteria. Both studies were controlled before and after studies, of moderate to high risk of bias, that explored the effects of interventions to improve retention of minority groups in health professional training institutions. These studies reported that an intervention comprising of a package of student support activities including social, academic, and career guidance and mentorship resulted in an increase in the number of minority students who enrolled and graduated from health training institutions., Authors' conclusions, The evidence to estimate the likely effects of interventions in pre-licensure education to increase health-worker supply is generally insufficient or unavailable, particularly in LMICs. Promising innovations from a high-income country include providing financial support to health professional students or introducing mechanisms to identify and encourage potential students and offering support to 'at risk' students.

828,"Background, The sexual abuse of children and adolescents is a significant worldwide problem. It is associated with a wide variety of negative psychological, social and physical consequences for the victims. These effects can often be seen immediately following sexual abuse, but they may manifest later on and sometimes only in adult life. There are a number of different interventions aimed at helping children and adolescents who have been sexually abused, and psychoanalytic/psychodynamic psychotherapy has a long-established tradition of being used for such victims. In this review, we set out to find the evidence for its effectiveness specifically in children and adolescents who have been sexually abused., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of psychoanalytic/psychodynamic psychotherapy for children and adolescents who have been sexually abused., Search methods, We searched the following databases in May 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, Social Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science and Humanities, LILACS and WorldCat. We also searched three trials registers, checked the reference lists of relevant studies and contacted known experts., Selection criteria, Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing psychoanalytic/psychodynamic psychotherapy with treatment as usual or no treatment/waiting list control for children and adolescents up to age of 18 who had experienced sexual abuse at any time prior to the intervention., Data collection and analysis, The review authors (BP and WT) independently screened search results to identify studies that met eligibility criteria., Main results, No studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria for this review., Authors' conclusions, There are no randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare psychoanalytic/psychodynamic therapy with treatment as usual, no treatment or waiting list control for children and adolescents who have been sexually abused. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the effectiveness of psychoanalytic/psychodynamic psychotherapy for this population. This important gap emphasises the need for further research into the effectiveness of psychoanalytic/psychodynamic psychotherapy in this population. Such research should ideally be in the form of methodologically high-quality, large-scale randomised controlled trials. If these are not conducted, future systematic reviews on this subject may need to consider including other lower quality evidence in order to avoid overlooking important research.","Ben Parker, William Turner (2013).

833,"Background, By improving two social determinants of health (poverty and unemployment) in low- and middle-income families on or at risk of welfare, in-work tax credit for families (IWTC) interventions could impact health status and outcomes in adults., Objectives, To assess the effects of IWTCs on health outcomes in working-age adults (18 to 64 years)., Search methods, We searched 16 electronic academic databases, including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as six grey literature databases between July and September 2012 for records published between January 1980 and July 2012. We also searched key organisational websites, handsearched reference lists of included records and relevant journals, and contacted academic experts., Selection criteria, We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials and cohort, controlled before-and-after (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of IWTCs in working-age adults. Included primary outcomes were: self rated general health; mental health/psychological distress; mental illness; overweight/obesity; alcohol use and tobacco use., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information., Main results, Five studies (one CBA and four ITS) comprising a total of 5,677,383 participants (all women) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were synthesised narratively. The in-work tax credit intervention assessed in all included studies is the permanent Earned Income Tax Credit in the United States, established in 1975. This intervention distributed nearly USD 62 billion to over 27 million individuals in 2011, and its administration costs were less than one per cent of its total costs. All included studies carried a high risk of bias (especially from confounding and insufficient control for underlying time trends). Due to the small number of (observational) studies and their high risk of bias, we judged this body of evidence to have very low overall quality., Authors' conclusions, In summary, the small and methodologically limited existing body of evidence with a high risk of bias provides no evidence for an effect of in-work tax credit for families interventions on health status (except for mixed evidence for tobacco smoking) in adults.","Frank Pega, Kristie Carter, Tony Blakely, Patricia J.

834,"Background, Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs; provided without obligation) for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities (e.g. orphanhood, old age or HIV infection) are a type of social protection intervention that addresses a key social determinant of health (income) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The relative effectiveness of UCTs compared with conditional cash transfers (CCTs; provided so long as the recipient engages in prescribed behaviours such as using a health service or attending school) is unknown., Objectives, To assess the effects of UCTs for improving health services use and health outcomes in vulnerable children and adults in LMICs. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of UCTs on social determinants of health and healthcare expenditure and to compare to effects of UCTs versus CCTs., Search methods, We searched 17 electronic academic databases, including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE and Embase, in May 2017. We also searched six electronic grey literature databases and websites of key organisations, handsearched key journals and included records, and sought expert advice., Selection criteria, We included both parallel group and cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort and controlled before-and-after (CBAs) studies, and interrupted time series studies of UCT interventions in children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) in LMICs. Comparison groups received either no UCT or a smaller UCT. Our primary outcomes were any health services use or health outcome., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently screened potentially relevant records for inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We tried to obtain missing data from study authors if feasible. For cluster-RCTs, we generally calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes from crude frequency measures in approximately correct analyses. Meta-analyses applied the inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel method with random effects. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach., Main results, We included 21 studies (16 cluster-RCTs, 4 CBAs and 1 cohort study) involving 1,092,877 participants (36,068 children and 1,056,809 adults) and 31,865 households in Africa, the Americas and South-East Asia in our meta-analyses and narrative synthesis. The 17 types of UCTs we identified, including one basic universal income intervention, were pilot or established government programmes or research experiments. The cash value was equivalent to 1.3% to 53.9% of the annualised gross domestic product per capita. All studies compared a UCT with no UCT, and three studies also compared a UCT with a CCT. Most studies carried an overall high risk of bias (i.e. often selection and/or performance bias). Most studies were funded by national governments and/or international organisations., Authors' conclusions, This body of evidence suggests that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) may not impact a summary measure of health service use in children and adults in LMICs. However, UCTs probably or may improve some health outcomes (i.e. the likelihood of having had any illness, the likelihood of having been food secure, and the level of dietary diversity), one social determinant of health (i.e. the likelihood of attending school), and healthcare expenditure. The evidence on the relative effectiveness of UCTs and CCTs remains very uncertain.","Frank Pega, Yan Sze Liu, Stefan Walter, Roman Pabayo, Ruhi Saith, Stefan K. Lhachimi (2017).

836,"Background, Psychosocial interventions are widely used for the prevention of psychological disorders in law enforcement officers., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the prevention of psychological disorders in law enforcement officers., Search strategy, CCDANCTR-References was searched on 12/5/2008, electronic databases were searched, reference lists of review articles and included studies were checked, a specialist journal was handsearched, specialist books were checked and we contacted experts and trialists., Selection criteria, Randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials were eligible. The types of participants were people employed directly in law enforcement, including police officers and military police, regardless of gender, age and country of origin, and whether or not they had experienced some psychological trauma. All types of psychosocial intervention were eligible. The relevant outcome measures were psychological symptoms, adverse events and acceptability of interventions., Data collection and analysis, Data was entered into Review Manager 4.2 for analysis, but this review was converted to RevMan 5.0 for publication. Quality assessments were performed. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of studies. Summary effects were to be calculated using RevMan but no meta-analyses were possible. For individual studies, dichotomous outcome data are presented using relative risk, and continuous outcome data are presented using the weighted mean difference. These results are given with their 95% confidence intervals (CI)., Main results, Ten studies were included in the review but only five reported data that could be used. Three of the ten studies were related to exercise-based psychological interventions. Seven were related to psychological interventions. No meta-analyses were possible due to diversity of participants, interventions and outcomes. Two studies compared a psychosocial intervention versus another intervention. Three studies compared a psychosocial intervention to a control group. Only one primary prevention trial reported data for the primary outcomes and, although this study found a significant difference in depression in favour of the intervention at endpoint, this difference was no longer evident at 18 months. No studies of primary prevention comparing different interventions and reporting primary outcomes of interest were identified., Authors' conclusions, There is evidence only from individual small and low quality trials with minimal data suggesting that police officers benefit from psychosocial interventions, in terms of physical symptoms and psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, cynicism, anger, PTSD, marital problems and distress. No data on adverse effects were available. Meta-analyses of the available data were not possible. Further well-designed trials of psychosocial interventions are required.

837,"Background, Depression is a common mental disorder. It affects millions of people worldwide and is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be one of the leading causes of disability. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well-established treatment for severe depression. Intravenous anaesthetic medication is used to minimize subjective unpleasantness and adverse side effects of the induced tonic-clonic seizure. The influence of different anaesthetic medications on the successful reduction of depressive symptoms and adverse effects is unclear., Objectives, This review evaluated the effects of different regimens of intravenous sedatives and hypnotics on anti-depression efficacy, recovery and seizure duration in depressed adults undergoing ECT., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 12); MEDLINE via Ovid SP (from 1966 to 31 December 2012); and EMBASE via Ovid SP (from 1966 to 31 December 2012). We handsearched related journals and applied no language restrictions. We reran the search in Feburary 2017. Four potential new studies of interest were added to a list of 'Studies awaiting Classification' and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update., Selection criteria, We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cross-over trials evaluating the effects of different intravenous sedatives and hypnotics for ECT. We excluded studies and trials using placebo or inhalational anaesthetics and studies that used no anaesthetic., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When possible, data were pooled and risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), each with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were computed using the Cochrane Review Manager statistical package (RevMan)., Main results, We included in the review 18 RCTs (599 participants; published between 1994 and 2012). Most of the included trials were at high risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, Most of the included studies were at high risk of bias, and the quality of evidence was generally low. The studies were not designed to detect clinically relevant differences in depression scores. Anaesthetic agents should be chosen on the basis of adverse effect profile, emergence and how these medications affect seizure duration. If it is difficult to elicit an adequately long seizure, methohexital may be superior to propofol (low-quality evidence). If a patient is slow to recover from anaesthesia, propofol may allow a faster time to follow commands than thiopental (low-quality evidence). A factor of clinical concern that was not addressed by any study was adrenal suppression from etomidate. Optimal dosages of intravenous sedatives or hypnotics have not yet been determined.","Lihua Peng, Su Min, Ke Wei, Patrick ZiemannGimmel (2017).

To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for this disorder, and psychotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. In recent years, psychostimulants have been investigated as a possible replacement therapy., Objectives, To evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulant medications for amphetamine abuse or dependence. The influences of type of drug, type of dependence, comorbid disorders, clinical trial risk of bias and publication of data were also studied., Search methods, Relevant trials were searched in the following sources: PubMed (January 1966 to 6 June 2012), EMBASE (January 1988 to 6 June 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 5 of 12, May 2012), PsycINFO (January 1985 to 6 June 2012) and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group (June 2012).

Searches included non[FULLWIDTH HYPHEN-MINUS]English language literature., Selection criteria, All randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials investigating the efficacy or safety of psychostimulants for amphetamine dependence or abuse conducted in an outpatient setting., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration., Main results, Eleven studies were included in the review (791 participants). Studied psychostimulants included dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil. No significant differences were found between psychostimulants and placebo for any of the studied efficacy outcomes. Overall retention in studies was low (50.4%). Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use (mean difference (MD) -0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.85 to 0.33) or amphetamine craving (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.59) and did not increase sustained abstinence (relative risk (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49). The proportion of adverse events inducing dropout was similar for psychostimulants and placebo (risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04). The main findings did not change in any subgroup analysis., Authors' conclusions, Results of this review do not support the use of psychostimulant medications at the tested doses as a replacement therapy for amphetamine abuse or dependence. Future research could change this conclusion, as the numbers of included studies and participants are limited and information on relevant outcomes, such as efficacy according to the severity of dependence or craving, is still missing.","Clara PerezMana, Xavier Castells, Marta Torrens, Dolors Capella, Magi Farre (2013).

We contacted experts in the field for further information., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials designed to reduce, eliminate, or prevent relapse of drug use and criminal activity, or both in drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental illness. We also reported data on the cost and cost-effectiveness of interventions., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration., Main results, Eight trials with 2058 participants met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the trials was generally difficult to rate due to a lack of clear reporting. On most 'Risk of bias' items, we rated the majority of studies as unclear. Overall, we could not statistically combine the results due to the heterogenous nature of the different study interventions and comparison groups. A narrative summary of the findings identified that the interventions reported limited success with reducing self report drug use, but did have some impact on re-incarceration rates, but not re-arrest. In the single comparisons, we found moderate-quality evidence that therapeutic communities determine a reduction in re-incarceration but reported less success for outcomes of re-arrest, moderate quality of evidence and self report drug use. Three single studies evaluating case management via a mental health drug court (very low quality of evidence), motivational interviewing and cognitive skills (low and very low quality of evidence) and interpersonal psychotherapy (very low quality of evidence) did not report significant reductions in criminal activity and self report drug use respectively. Quality of evidence for these three types of interventions was low to very low. The trials reported some cost information, but it was not sufficient to be able to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the interventions., Authors' conclusions, Two of the five trials showed some promising results for the use of therapeutic communities and aftercare, but only in relation to reducing subsequent re-incarceration. Overall, the studies showed a high degree of variation, warranting a degree of caution in the interpretation of the magnitude of effect and direction of benefit for treatment outcomes.

Trial quality and risks of bias varied across each study. We rated the majority of studies as being at 'unclear' risk of bias due to a lack of descriptive information. We divided the studies into different categories for the purpose of meta-analyses: for any psychosocial treatments in comparison to treatment as usual we found low quality evidence that there were no significant differences in arrest rates, (two studies; 489 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.52) or drug use (one study; 77 participants; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.12), but we found moderate quality evidence that there was a significant reduction in reincarceration, (three studies; 630 participants; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64). Pharmacological intervention using buprenorphine in comparison to a placebo did not significantly reduce self reported drug use (one study; 36 participants; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.35). No cost or cost-effectiveness evidence was reported in the studies., Authors' conclusions, Three of the nine trials show a positive trend towards the use of any psychosocial treatment in comparison to treatment as usual showing an overall significant reduction in subsequent reincarceration, but not arrest rates or drug use. Pharmacological interventions in comparison to a placebo did not significantly reduce drug use and did not measure criminal activity. Four different treatment comparisons showed varying results and were not combined due to differences in the intervention and comparison groups. The studies overall showed a high degree of heterogeneity for types of comparisons and outcome measures assessed, which limited the possibility to pool the data. Descriptions of treatment modalities are required to identify the important elements for treatment success in drug-using female offenders. More trials are required to increase the precision of confidence with which we can draw conclusions about the effectiveness of treatments for female drug-using offenders.","Amanda E.

843,"Background, Tinnitus is the perception of sound without external acoustic stimuli. Patients with severe tinnitus may have physical and psychological complaints and their tinnitus can cause deterioration in their quality of life. At present no specific therapy for tinnitus has been found to be satisfactory in all patients. In recent decades, a number of reports have suggested that oral zinc supplementation may be effective in the management of tinnitus. Since zinc has a role in cochlear physiology and in the synapses of the auditory system, there is a plausible mechanism of action for this treatment., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral zinc supplementation in the management of patients with tinnitus., Search methods, The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 6); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 July 2016., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing zinc supplementation versus placebo in adults (18 years and over) with tinnitus., Data collection and analysis, We used the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Our primary outcome measures were improvement in tinnitus severity and disability, measured by a validated tinnitus-specific questionnaire, and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, change in socioeconomic impact associated with work, change in anxiety and depression disorders, change in psychoacoustic parameters, change in tinnitus loudness, change in overall severity of tinnitus and change in thresholds on pure tone audiometry. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics., Main results, We included three trials involving a total of 209 participants. The studies were at moderate to high risk of bias. All included studies had differences in participant selection criteria, length of follow-up and outcome measurement, precluding a meta-analysis. The participants were all adults over 18 years with subjective tinnitus, but one study conducted in 2013 (n = 109) included only elderly patients., Authors' conclusions, We found no evidence that the use of oral zinc supplementation improves symptoms in adults with tinnitus.","Osmar C.

844,"Background, Various rehabilitation treatments may be offered following carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) surgery. The effectiveness of these interventions remains unclear. This is the first update of a review first published in 2013., Objectives, To review the effectiveness and safety of rehabilitation interventions following CTS surgery compared with no treatment, placebo, or another intervention., Search methods, On 29 September 2015, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, AMED, LILACS, and PsycINFO. We also searched PEDro (3 December 2015) and clinical trials registers (3 December 2015)., Selection criteria, Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials that compared any postoperative rehabilitation intervention with either no intervention, placebo, or another postoperative rehabilitation intervention in individuals who had undergone CTS surgery., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for primary outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach according to standard Cochrane methodology., Main results, In this review we included 22 trials with a total of 1521 participants. Two of the trials were newly identified at this update. We studied different rehabilitation treatments including immobilisation using a wrist orthosis, dressings, exercise, controlled cold therapy, ice therapy, multi-modal hand rehabilitation, laser therapy, electrical modalities, scar desensitisation, and arnica. Three trials compared a rehabilitation treatment to a placebo, four compared rehabilitation to a no treatment control, three compared rehabilitation to standard care, and 15 compared various rehabilitation treatments to one another., Authors' conclusions, There is limited and, in general, low quality evidence for the benefit of the reviewed interventions. People who have undergone CTS surgery should be informed about the limited evidence of effectiveness of postoperative rehabilitation interventions. Until researchers provide results of more high-quality trials that assess the effectiveness and safety of various rehabilitation treatments, the decision to provide rehabilitation following CTS surgery should be based on the clinician's expertise, the patient's preferences and the context of the rehabilitation environment. It is important for researchers to identify patients who respond to a particular treatment and those who do not, and to undertake high-quality studies that evaluate the severity of iatrogenic symptoms from surgery, measure function and return-to-work rates, and control for confounding variables.","Susan Peters, Matthew J.

846,"Background, Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. Although an outright cure for tinnitus remains elusive, various management strategies have been developed to help to lessen the impact of the symptom. Following the publication of a neurophysiological model of tinnitus, Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) was developed. Using a combination of directive counselling and sound therapy in a strict framework, this is one of the most commonly used treatment modalities for tinnitus. Many studies refer to the use of TRT where in fact a modified version of this therapy is actually being implemented. It is therefore important to confirm the use of authentic TRT when reviewing any study that reports its use., Objectives, To assess the efficacy of TRT in the treatment of tinnitus., Search strategy, The search included the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE and reference lists of identified publications. The date of the most recent search was 26 August 2009., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of TRT versus no treatment, or other forms of treatment, in adult patients with tinnitus., Data collection and analysis, Both authors critically appraised the retrieved studies for risk of bias and extracted data independently. Where necessary, we contacted the original study authors for further information., Main results, Only one trial (123 participants) was included in the review. Several excluded trials did not follow the strict protocol for TRT, evaluating instead a modified form of TRT. The included trial showed TRT to be more effective than a tinnitus masking (TM) approach. In this study outcome data for tinnitus severity were presented using three instruments (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ), Tinnitus Severity Index (TSI)) for patients in three groups (participants' tinnitus being a 'moderate problem', big problem' or 'very big problem')., Authors' conclusions, A single, low-quality randomised controlled trial suggests that TRT is much more effective as a treatment for patients with tinnitus than tinnitus masking.","John S.

847,"Background, Bipolar disorder is a common recurrent illness with high levels of chronicity. Previous trials have suggested that the anticonvulsant topiramate may be efficacious in bipolar disorder. This is an update of a previous Cochrane review (last published 2006) on the role of topiramate in bipolar disorder., Objectives, To assess the effects of topiramate for acute mood episodes in bipolar disorder in adults compared to placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, and combination pharmacological treatment as measured by treatment of symptoms on specific rating scales for individual episodes., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register to 13 October 2015, which includes records from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) all years; MEDLINE 1950-; EMBASE 1974-; and PsycINFO 1967-., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing topiramate with placebo or with active agents in the treatment of acute mood episodes in adult male and female patients with bipolar disorder., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently performed data extraction and methodological quality assessment. For analysis, we used odds ratio (OR) for binary efficacy outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuously distributed outcomes., Main results, This review included six studies with a total of 1638 male and female participants, of all ethnic backgrounds in both inpatient and outpatient settings. In five studies, participants were experiencing a manic or mixed episode, and in the other study the participants met the criteria for a depressive phase. Topiramate was compared with placebo and alternative pharmacological treatment as both monotherapy and as adjunctive treatment., Authors' conclusions, It is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about the use of topiramate in clinical practice from this evidence. The only high-quality evidence found was that lithium is more efficacious than topiramate when used as monotherapy in the treatment of acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder, and we note that this evidence came from only two studies. Moderate-quality evidence showed that topiramate was no more or less efficacious than placebo as monotherapy when a 3-week endpoint was used, but the quality of the evidence for this outcome at a 12-week endpoint dropped to low. As we graded the quality of the evidence for the other findings as low and very low, it was not possible to draw any conclusions from the results.","Katie Pigott, Ilaria Galizia, Kamini Vasudev, Stuart Watson, John Geddes, Allan H.

848,"Background, In mental health services, the past several decades has seen a slow but steady trend towards employment of past or present consumers of the service to work alongside mental health professionals in providing services. However the effects of this employment on clients (service recipients) and services has remained unclear., Objectives, To assess the effects of employing current or past adult consumers of mental health services as providers of statutory mental health services., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1950 to March 2012), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1988 to March 2012), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to March 2012), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (1981 to March 2009), Current Contents (OvidSP) (1993 to March 2012), and reference lists of relevant articles., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of current or past consumers of mental health services employed as providers ('consumer-providers') in statutory mental health services, comparing either: 1) consumers versus professionals employed to do the same role within a mental health service, or 2) mental health services with and without consumer-providers as an adjunct to the service., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We contacted trialists for additional information. We conducted analyses using a random-effects model, pooling studies that measured the same outcome to provide a summary estimate of the effect across studies. We describe findings for each outcome in the text of the review with considerations of the potential impact of bias and the clinical importance of results, with input from a clinical expert., Main results, We included 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2796 people. The quality of these studies was moderate to low, with most of the studies at unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation and allocation concealment, and high risk of bias for blinded outcome assessment and selective outcome reporting., Authors' conclusions, Involving consumer-providers in mental health teams results in psychosocial, mental health symptom and service use outcomes for clients that were no better or worse than those achieved by professionals employed in similar roles, particularly for case management services.","Veronica Pitt, Dianne Lowe, Sophie Hill, Megan Prictor, Sarah E.

849,"Background, Various approaches to physical rehabilitation may be used after stroke, and considerable controversy and debate surround the effectiveness of relative approaches. Some physiotherapists base their treatments on a single approach; others use a mixture of components from several different approaches., Objectives, To determine whether physical rehabilitation approaches are effective in recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke, and to assess if any one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective than any other approach., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched December 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 12, 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2012), EMBASE (1980 to December 2012), AMED (1985 to December 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to December 2012). We searched reference lists and contacted experts and researchers who have an interest in stroke rehabilitation., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physical rehabilitation approaches aimed at promoting the recovery of function or mobility in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. Outcomes included measures of independence in activities of daily living (ADL), motor function, balance, gait velocity and length of stay. We included trials comparing physical rehabilitation approaches versus no treatment, usual care or attention control and those comparing different physical rehabilitation approaches., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently categorised identified trials according to the selection criteria, documented their methodological quality and extracted the data., Main results, We included a total of 96 studies (10,401 participants) in this review. More than half of the studies (50/96) were carried out in China. Generally the studies were heterogeneous, and many were poorly reported., Authors' conclusions, Physical rehabilitation, comprising a selection of components from different approaches, is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Evidence related to dose of physical therapy is limited by substantial heterogeneity and does not support robust conclusions. No one approach to physical rehabilitation is any more (or less) effective in promoting recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Therefore, evidence indicates that physical rehabilitation should not be limited to compartmentalised, named approaches, but rather should comprise clearly defined, well-described, evidenced-based physical treatments, regardless of historical or philosophical origin.","Alex Pollock, Gillian Baer, Pauline Campbell, Ling Pei Choo, Anne Forster, Jacqui Morris, Valerie M.

850,"Background, Eye movement disorders may affect over 70% of stroke patients. These eye movement disorders can result in difficulty maintaining the normal ocular position and difficulty moving the eyes appropriately. The resulting functional disabilities include a loss of depth perception, reduced hand-to-eye co-ordination, marked difficulties with near tasks and reading and reduced ability to scan the visual environment. They can also impact on the effectiveness of rehabilitation therapy. There are a wide variety of different treatment interventions proposed for eye movement disorders after stroke. However, in the past, there has been a lack of evidence specific to the impact of interventions on the functional outcome of patients with stroke., Objectives, To determine the effects of interventions for eye movement disorders on functional ability following stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2011), the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register (December 2009) and nine electronic bibliographic databases including CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to December 2009), EMBASE (1980 to December 2009), CINAHL (1982 to December 2009), AMED (1985 to December 2009), and PsycINFO (1967 to December 2009). We also searched reference lists and trials registers, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts., Selection criteria, Randomised trials in adults after stroke where the intervention was specifically targeted at improving the eye movement disorder or improving the ability of the participant to cope with the eye movement disorder. The primary outcome was functional ability in activities of daily living. Secondary outcomes included functional ability in extended activities of daily living, eye movement measures, balance, falls, depression or anxiety, discharge destination or residence after stroke, quality of life and social isolation, adverse events, and death., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook assessment of methodological quality for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessor, method of dealing with missing data, and other potential sources of bias., Main results, Two studies (28 participants but only five were people with stroke) met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Both studies investigated pharmacological interventions for disorders of eye movement in patients with stroke. It was not appropriate to pool data and we were not able to draw conclusions from these studies. We found no other randomised studies which investigated interventions for disorders of eye movement in patients with stroke., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions for patients with eye movement disorders after stroke. High quality research in the form of well-designed randomised trials are urgently required.","Alex Pollock, Christine Hazelton, Clair A.

851,"Background, The prevalence of eye problems increases with age and, consequently, so does the level of visual impairment. As the incidence of stroke also increases with age, a significant proportion of stroke patients will have age-related visual problems. It is possible that the effect of interventions for age-related visual problems may differ in the population of stroke patients compared to the wider population of older people. The interaction between the problems arising directly from stroke and those arising directly from age-related visual problems will be complex. Interventions for age-related visual problems may also be affected by the presence of other stroke-related co-morbidities. Consequently, the nature and outcome of interventions for age-related visual problems may be different in patients with stroke., Objectives, The aim of this review is to determine if interventions for age-related visual problems improve functional ability following stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (March 2011), the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register (December 2009) and nine electronic bibliographic databases including: the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to February 2011), EMBASE (1980 to February 2011), CINAHL (1982 to February 2011), AMED (1985 to February 2011) and PsycINFO (1967 to February 2011). We also searched reference lists and trials registers, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts., Selection criteria, Randomised trials in adults after stroke, where the intervention is specifically targeted at assessing, treating or correcting age-related visual problems, or improving the ability of the patient to cope with visual impairment. Primary outcome was functional ability in activities of daily living and secondary outcomes included functional ability in extended activities of daily living, visual acuity, visual field, visual function, balance, falls, depression and anxiety, discharge destination/residence after stroke, quality of life and social isolation, adverse events and death., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened abstracts and planned to extract data and appraise trials. We planned that assessment of methodological quality would be undertaken for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessor, method of dealing with missing data and other potential sources of bias., Main results, We considered 7357 titles, 460 abstracts and 85 full papers. We identified no studies for inclusion in this review., Authors' conclusions, There are no implications for practice arising from this review. Evidence relating to the management of patients (from the general population) with age-related visual problems is available from other Cochrane reviews and is likely to be the best evidence available for making treatment decisions about individual patients.

852,"Background, Visual field defects are estimated to affect 20% to 57% of people who have had a stroke. Visual field defects can affect functional ability in activities of daily living (commonly affecting mobility, reading and driving), quality of life, ability to participate in rehabilitation, and depression, anxiety and social isolation following stroke. There are many interventions for visual field defects, which are proposed to work by restoring the visual field (restitution); compensating for the visual field defect by changing behaviour or activity (compensation); substituting for the visual field defect by using a device or extraneous modification (substitution); or ensuring appropriate diagnosis, referral and treatment prescription through standardised assessment or screening, or both., Objectives, To determine the effects of interventions for people with visual field defects after stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2011), the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register (December 2009) and nine electronic bibliographic databases including CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to December 2009), EMBASE (1980 to December 2009), CINAHL (1982 to December 2009), AMED (1985 to December 2009), and PsycINFO (1967 to December 2009). We also searched reference lists and trials registers, handsearched journals and conference proceedings and contacted experts., Selection criteria, Randomised trials in adults after stroke, where the intervention was specifically targeted at improving the visual field defect or improving the ability of the participant to cope with the visual field loss. The primary outcome was functional ability in activities of daily living and secondary outcomes included functional ability in extended activities of daily living, reading ability, visual field measures, balance, falls, depression and anxiety, discharge destination or residence after stroke, quality of life and social isolation, visual scanning, adverse events and death., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook an assessment of methodological quality for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, method of dealing with missing data, and other potential sources of bias., Main results, Thirteen studies (344 randomised participants, 285 of whom were participants with stroke) met the inclusion criteria for this review. However, only six of these studies compared the effect of an intervention with a placebo, control or no treatment group and were included in comparisons within this review. Four studies compared the effect of scanning (compensatory) training with a control or placebo intervention. Meta-analysis demonstrated that scanning training is more effective than control or placebo at improving reading ability (three studies, 129 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 1.29) and visual scanning (three studies, 129 participants; SMD 1.14, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.00) but that scanning may not improve visual field outcomes (two studies, 110 participants; MD -0.73, 95% CI -3.18 to 1.72). There were insufficient data to enable generalised conclusions to be made about the effectiveness of scanning training relative to control or placebo for the primary outcome of activities of daily living (one study, 33 participants). Only one study (19 participants) compared the effect of a restitutive intervention with a control or placebo intervention and only one study (39 participants) compared the effect of a substitutive intervention with a control or placebo intervention., Authors' conclusions, There is limited evidence which supports the use of compensatory scanning training for patients with visual field defects (and possibly co-existing visual neglect) to improve scanning and reading outcomes.

855,"Background, Treating the 20-30% of people with schizophrenia whose symptoms are resistant to treatment can be problematic. Adding lamotrigine to ongoing antipsychotic treatment has shown to be of benefit in preliminary studies., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of adjuvant lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2006) and inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted relevant authors of trials for additional information., Selection criteria, We included all clinical randomised trials comparing lamotrigine with placebo or other antipsychotic augmentation strategies., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD)., Main results, We found five relevant trials (total n=537), but no usable data on service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment or economic outcomes. Overall, reporting of data was poor. Those data we were able to use suggested that equal proportions of people allocated lamotrigine or placebo had no global response (n=208, 1 RCT, RR 1.06 CI 0.73 to 1.54). There was no significant difference between groups in the proportions of people whose mental state did not improve (n=297, 3 RCT, RR 1.26 CI 0.81 to 1.97). There was, however, a significant reduction in the PANSS total scores (n=67, 2 RCT, WMD -16.88 CI -8.57 to -25.18, p=0.0001), positive symptom sub-scale scores (n=65, 2 RCTs, WMD -5.10 CI -8.86 to -1.34) and negative symptom sub-scale scores (n=67, 2 RCTs, WMD -5.25, CI -7.07 to -3.43). Most cognitive measures showed no differences (n=329, 2 RCTs, RR not attaining BACS composite score of 0.5 1.10 CI 0.59 to 2.04). The proportion of participants leaving studies was about 25% at 12 weeks (n=537, 5 RCTs, RR 0.96 CI 0.71 to 1.29). The lamotrigine group did experience the outcome of any adverse effects significantly more frequent than people allocated placebo (n=429, 2 RCTs, RR 1.19 CI 1.02 to 1.38, NNH 10 CI 5 to 90). Among the many effects listed, only nausea was found to be significantly more (9%) in the lamotrigine group compared with placebo (n=465, 3 RCTs, RR 2.26 CI 1.05 to 4.88)., Authors' conclusions, Evidence for use of lamotrigine as an adjuvant for people with schizophrenia is not robust and large well-designed, conducted and reported real-world randomised trials are needed to determine its place in everyday clinical practice.","Samson Titus Premkumar, Jamie Pick (2009).

856,"Background, People with dementia often wander, at times putting themselves at risk and presenting challenges to carers and institutional staff. Traditional interventions to prevent wandering include restraint, drugs and locked doors. Cognitively impaired people may respond to environmental stimuli (sounds, images, smells) in ways distinct from healthy people. This has led to trials of visual and other selective barriers (such as mirrors, camouflage, grids/stripes of tape) that may reduce wandering., Objectives, We assess the effect of subjective exit modifications on the wandering behaviour of cognitively impaired people. The second objective is to inform the direction and methods of future research., Search strategy, The trials were identified from a searches of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources on 9 March 2009 using the terms: exit*, wander*, camouflage, bars, stripe*, grid*, floor*, door*, barrier*, elopement, ambulat*, Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled trials provide the highest quality evidence, but interrupted time series are also considered as they may contribute useful information., Data collection and analysis, The criteria for inclusion or exclusion of studies are applied independently by two reviewers.

These include the number of exits or carer interventions, resource use, acceptability of the intervention and the effects on carer and wanderer (anxiety or distress). Heterogeneity of clinical area, of study design and of intervention was substantial., Main results, No RCTs or controlled trials were found. The other experimental studies that we identified were unsatisfactory. Most were vulnerable to bias, particularly performance bias; most did not classify patients according to type or severity of dementia; in all studies, outcomes were measured only in terms of wandering frequency rather than more broadly in terms of quality of life, resource use, anxiety and distress; no studies included patients with delirium; no studies were based in patients' homes., Authors' conclusions, There is no evidence that subjective barriers prevent wandering by cognitively impaired people.","James D.

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) may help to alleviate the symptoms of CFS., Objectives, To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of CBT for CFS, alone and in combination with other interventions, compared with usual care and other interventions., Search strategy, CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 28/3/2008. We conducted supplementary searches of other bibliographic databases. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials involving adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS, assigned to a CBT condition compared with usual care or another intervention, alone or in combination., Data collection and analysis, Data on patients, interventions and outcomes were extracted by two review authors independently, and risk of bias was assessed for each study. The primary outcome was reduction in fatigue severity, based on a continuous measure of symptom reduction, using the standardised mean difference (SMD), or a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI)., Main results, Fifteen studies (1043 CFS participants) were included in the review. When comparing CBT with usual care (six studies, 373 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post-treatment was highly significant in favour of CBT (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.19), with 40% of CBT participants (four studies, 371 participants) showing clinical response in contrast with 26% in usual care (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.76). Findings at follow-up were inconsistent. For CBT versus other psychological therapies, comprising relaxation, counselling and education/support (four studies, 313 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post-treatment favoured CBT (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.20). Findings at follow-up were heterogeneous and inconsistent. Only two studies compared CBT against other interventions and one study compared CBT in combination with other interventions against usual care., Authors' conclusions, CBT is effective in reducing the symptoms of fatigue at post-treatment compared with usual care, and may be more effective in reducing fatigue symptoms compared with other psychological therapies. The evidence base at follow-up is limited to a small group of studies with inconsistent findings. There is a lack of evidence on the comparative effectiveness of CBT alone or in combination with other treatments, and further studies are required to inform the development of effective treatment programmes for people with CFS.","Jonathan R.

Hormonal therapies are known to reduce these symptoms but are not recommended in women with a history of breast cancer due to their potential adverse effects. The efficacy of non-hormonal therapies is still uncertain., Objectives, To assess the efficacy of non-hormonal therapies in reducing hot flushes in women with a history of breast cancer., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, PsycINFO (August 2008) and WHO ICTRP Search Portal.

We included six studies on selective serotonin (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine (SNRI) reuptake inhibitors, two on clonidine, one on gabapentin, two each on relaxation therapy and homeopathy, and one each on vitamin E, magnetic devices and acupuncture. The risk of bias of most studies was rated as low or moderate. Data on continuous outcomes were presented inconsistently among studies, which precluded the possibility of pooling the results. Three pharmacological treatments (SSRIs and SNRIs, clonidine and gabapentin) reduced the number and severity of hot flushes. One study assessing vitamin E did not show any beneficial effect. One of two studies on relaxation therapy showed a significant benefit. None of the other non-pharmacological therapies had a significant benefit.

861,"Background, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of sciatica. A previous Cochrane review on the efficacy of NSAIDs summarised findings for acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) and sciatica. This is an update of the original review (2008) focusing on people suffering from sciatica., Objectives, To determine the efficacy of NSAIDs in pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported side effects in people with sciatica., Search methods, We performed electronic searches up to 24 June 2015 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and two trials registers. We searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews on the topics for additional trials., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (double-blind, single-blind, and open-label) that assessed the efficacy of NSAIDs in sciatica. We included all trials that compared NSAIDs to placebo, to other NSAIDs, or to other medication. Additional interventions were allowed if there was a clear contrast for the treatment with NSAIDs in the trial., Data collection and analysis, Three review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. Where feasible we calculated pooled results using Review Manager 5.3. We reported pain relief outcomes using mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI to report global improvement of treatment, adverse effects, and additional medication. We performed a meta-analysis if possible. We assessed level of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration., Main results, We included 10 trials reported in 9 publications (N = 1651). Only one trial out of 10 was assessed at low risk of bias. Five trials used the currently recommended daily dose for the drug, and two trials used lower daily doses available over the counter. Three trials investigated NSAIDs no longer approved for human use. The follow-up duration was short in all studies but one., Authors' conclusions, This updated systematic review including 10 trials evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs versus placebo or other drugs in people with sciatica reports low- to very low-level evidence using the GRADE criteria. The efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction was not significant. NSAIDs showed a better global improvement compared to placebo. These findings must be interpreted with caution, as the level of evidence according to the GRADE classification was very low for the outcome pain reduction and low for global improvement due to small study samples, inconsistent results, imprecision, and a high risk of bias in the included trials. While the trials included in the analysis were not powered to detect potential rare side effects, we found an increased risk for side effects in the short-term NSAIDs use. As NSAIDs are frequently prescribed, the risk-benefit ratio of prescribing the drug needs to be considered.","Eva RasmussenBarr, Ulrike Held, J. A. Wilhelmus Grooten, D. D. M. Pepijn Roelofs, Bart W.

862,"Background, Risperidone is the first new-generation antipsychotic drug made available in the market in its generic form., Objectives, To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost-effectiveness of risperidone compared with placebo for treating schizophrenia., Search methods, On 19th October 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We checked the references of all included studies and contacted industry and authors of included studies for relevant studies and data., Selection criteria, Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing oral risperidone with placebo treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened studies, assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), and the 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and the 95% CI. We created a 'Summary of findings table' using (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)., Main results, The review includes 15 studies (N = 2428). Risk of selection bias is unclear in most of the studies, especially concerning allocation concealment. Other areas of risk such as missing data and selective reporting also caused some concern, although not affected on the direction of effect of our primary outcome, as demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. Many of the included trials have industry sponsorship of involvement. Nonetheless, generally people in the risperidone group are more likely to achieve a significant clinical improvement in mental state (6 RCTs, N = 864, RR 0.64, CI 0.52 to 0.78, very low-quality evidence). The effect withstood, even when three studies with >50% attrition rate were removed from the analysis (3 RCTs, N = 589, RR 0.77, CI 0.67 to 0.88). Participants receiving placebo were less likely to have a clinically significant improvement on Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) than those receiving risperidone (4 RCTs, N = 594, RR 0.69, CI 0.57 to 0.83, very low-quality evidence). Overall, the risperidone group was 31% less likely to leave early compared to placebo group (12 RCTs, N = 2261, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.78, low-quality evidence), but Incidence of significant extrapyramidal side effect was more likely to occur in the risperidone group (7 RCTs, N = 1511, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.15, very low-quality evidence)., Authors' conclusions, Based on low quality evidence, risperidone appears to be benefitial in improving mental state compared with placebo, but it also causes more adverse events. Eight out of the 15 included trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The currently available evidence isvery low to low quality.","Ranganath D. Rattehalli, Sai Zhao, Guo Bao Li, Mahesh B.

863,"Background, Over 35 million people are estimated to be living with dementia in the world and the societal costs are very high. Case management is a widely used and strongly promoted complex intervention for organising and co-ordinating care at the level of the individual, with the aim of providing long-term care for people with dementia in the community as an alternative to early admission to a care home or hospital., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness of case management approaches to home support for people with dementia, from the perspective of the different people involved (patients, carers, and staff) compared with other forms of treatment, including 'treatment as usual', standard community treatment and other non-case management interventions., Search methods, We searched the following databases up to 31 December 2013: ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group,The Cochrane LibraryMEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Science Citation Index), Campbell Collaboration/SORO database and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We updated this search in March 2014 but results have not yet been incorporated., Selection criteria, We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of case management interventions for people with dementia living in the community and their carers. We screened interventions to ensure that they focused on planning and co-ordination of care., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures as required by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently extracted data and made 'Risk of bias' assessments using Cochrane criteria. For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups along with its confidence interval (95% CI). We applied a fixed- or random-effects model as appropriate. For binary or dichotomous data, we generated the corresponding odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. We assessed heterogeneity by the I[superscript digit two] statistic., Main results, We include 13 RCTs involving 9615 participants with dementia in the review. Case management interventions in studies varied. We found low to moderate overall risk of bias; 69% of studies were at high risk for performance bias., Authors' conclusions, There is some evidence that case management is beneficial at improving some outcomes at certain time points, both in the person with dementia and in their carer. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the interventions, outcomes measured and time points across the 13 included RCTs. There was some evidence from good-quality studies to suggest that admissions to care homes and overall healthcare costs are reduced in the medium term; however, the results at longer points of follow-up were uncertain. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could delay institutionalisation in care homes. There were uncertain results in patient depression, functional abilities and cognition. Further work should be undertaken to investigate what components of case management are associated with improvement in outcomes. Increased consistency in measures of outcome would support future meta-analysis.","Siobhan Reilly, Claudia Miranda-Castillo, Reem Malouf, Juanita Hoe, Sandeep Toot, David Challis, Martin Orrell (2015).

864,"Background, Collaborative care for severe mental illness (SMI) is a community-based intervention, which typically consists of a number of components. The intervention aims to improve the physical and/or mental health care of individuals with SMI., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care approaches in comparison with standard care for people with SMI who are living in the community. The primary outcome of interest was psychiatric admissions., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialised register in April 2011. The register is compiled from systematic searches of major databases, handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. We also contacted 51 experts in the field of SMI and collaborative care., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) described as collaborative care by the trialists comparing any form of collaborative care with 'standard care' for adults (18+ years) living in the community with a diagnosis of SMI, defined as schizophrenia or other types of schizophrenia-like psychosis (e.g. schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders), bipolar affective disorder or other types of psychosis., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors worked independently to extract and quality assess data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and we calculated mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs for continuous data. Risk of bias was assessed., Main results, We included one RCT (306 participants; US veterans with bipolar disorder I or II) in this review. We did not find any trials meeting our inclusion criteria that included people with schizophrenia. The trial provided data for one comparison: collaborative care versus standard care. All results are 'low or very low quality evidence'., Authors' conclusions, The review did not identify any studies relevant to care of people with schizophrenia and hence there is no evidence available to determine if collaborative care is effective for people suffering from schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders. There was however one trial at high risk of bias that suggests that collaborative care for US veterans with bipolar disorder may reduce psychiatric admissions at two years and improves quality of life (mental health component) at three years, however, on its own it is not sufficient for us to make any recommendations regarding its effectiveness. More large, well designed, conducted and reported trials are required before any clinical or policy making decisions can be made.","Siobhan Reilly, Claire Planner, Linda Gask, Mark Hann, Sarah Knowles, Benjamin Druss, Helen Lester (2013).

865,"Background, Dance therapy or dance movement therapy (DMT) is defined as 'the psychotherapeutic use of movement as a process which furthers the emotional, social, cognitive, and physical integration of the individual'. It may be of value for people with developmental, medical, social, physical or psychological impairments. Dance therapy can be practiced in mental health rehabilitation units, nursing homes, day care centres and incorporated into disease prevention and health promotion programmes., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of dance therapy for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses compared with standard care and other interventions., Search methods, We updated the original July 2007 search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group' register in July 2012. We also searched Chinese main medical databases., Selection criteria, We included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing dance therapy and related approaches with standard care or other psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia., Data collection and analysis, We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data. For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD); for binary outcomes we calculated a fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach., Main results, We included one single blind study (total n = 45) of reasonable quality. It compared dance therapy plus routine care with routine care alone. Most people tolerated the treatment package but nearly 40% were lost in both groups by four months (1 RCT n = 45, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.31 to 1.51, low quality evidence). The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) average endpoint total scores were similar in both groups (1 RCT n = 43, MD -0.50 95% CI -11.80 to 10.80, moderate quality evidence) as were the positive sub-scores (1 RCT n = 43, MD 2.50 CI -0.67 to 5.67, moderate quality evidence). At the end of treatment, significantly more people in the dance therapy group had a greater than 20% reduction in PANSS negative symptom score (1 RCT n = 45, RR 0.62 CI 0.39 to 0.97, moderate quality evidence), and overall, average negative endpoint scores were lower (1 RCT n = 43, MD -4.40 CI -8.15 to -0.65, moderate quality evidence). There was no difference in satisfaction score (average Client's Assessment of Treatment Scale (CAT) score, 1 RCT n = 42, MD 0.40 CI -0.78 to 1.58, moderate quality evidence) and quality of life data were also equivocal (average Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of life (MANSA) score, 1 RCT n = 39, MD 0.00 CI -0.48 to 0.48, moderate quality evidence)., Authors' conclusions, Based on predominantly moderate quality data, there is no evidence to support - or refute - the use of dance therapy in this group of people. This therapy remains unproven and those with schizophrenia, their carers, trialists and funders of research may wish to encourage future work to increase high quality evidence in this area.","Juanjuan Ren, Jun Xia (2013).

867,"Background, Pain management is a high priority for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Antidepressants are sometimes used as adjuvant agents to enhance pain relief, help with sleep and reduce depression. Such antidepressants include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs). However, the prescription of antidepressants in this population remains controversial because of conflicting scientific evidence., Objectives, The aim of this review was to determine the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in pain management in patients with RA., Search methods, We performed a computer assisted search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, 4th quarter); MEDLINE (1950 to November Week 1, 2010); EMBASE (2010 Week 44); and PsycINFO (1806 to November Week 2, 2010). We also searched the 2008-2009 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared an antidepressant therapy to another therapy (active or placebo, including non-pharmacological therapies) in adult patients with RA who had at least one clinically relevant outcome measure. Outcomes of interest were pain, adverse effects, function, sleep, depression and quality of life., Data collection and analysis, Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. We conducted meta-analyses to examine the efficacy of antidepressants on pain, depression and function, as well as their safety., Main results, We included eight RCTs (652 participants) in this review. All trials evaluated TCAs and two trials evaluated a SSRI as a comparator. Seven of the eight trials had high risk of bias. There was insufficient data for a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to be calculated for the primary outcome measure of pain. The qualitative analyses found no evidence of an effect of antidepressants on pain intensity or depression in the short-term (less than one week), and conflicting evidence of a medium- (one to six weeks) or long-term (more than six weeks) benefit. There were significantly more minor adverse events in patients receiving TCAs compared with those receiving a placebo (risk ratio (RR) 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 4.42), but there was no significant increase in withdrawals due to an adverse event (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.42)., Authors' conclusions, There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine prescription of antidepressants as analgesics in patients with RA as no reliable conclusions about their efficacy can be drawn from eight placebo RCTs. The use of these agents may be associated with adverse events which are generally mild and do not lead to cessation of treatment. More high quality trials are needed in this area.","Bethan L.

868,"Background, Face-to-face interventions for promoting physical activity (PA) are continuing to be popular but their ability to achieve long term changes are unknown., Objectives, To compare the effectiveness of face-to-face interventions for PA promotion in community dwelling adults (aged 16 years and above) with a control exposed to placebo or no or minimal intervention., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and some other databases (from earliest dates available to October 2012). Reference lists of relevant articles were checked. No language restrictions were applied., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared face-to-face PA interventions for community dwelling adults with a placebo or no or minimal intervention control group. We included studies if the principal component of the intervention was delivered using face-to-face methods. To assess behavioural change over time the included studies had a minimum of 12 months follow-up from the start of the intervention to the final results. We excluded studies that had more than a 20% loss to follow-up if they did not apply an intention-to-treat analysis., Data collection and analysis, At least two authors independently assessed the quality of each study and extracted data. Non-English language papers were reviewed with the assistance of an interpreter who was an epidemiologist. Study authors were contacted for additional information where necessary. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous measures of self-reported PA and cardio-respiratory fitness. For studies with dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated., Main results, A total of 10 studies recruiting 6292 apparently healthy adults met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies took place in high-income countries. The effect of interventions on self-reported PA at one year (eight studies; 6725 participants) was positive and moderate with significant heterogeneity (I[superscript digit two] = 74%) (SMD 0.19; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.31; moderate quality evidence) but not sustained in three studies at 24 months (4235 participants) (SMD 0.18; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.46). The effect of interventions on cardiovascular fitness at one year (two studies; 349 participants) was positive and moderate with no significant heterogeneity in the observed effects (SMD 0.50; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.71; moderate quality evidence). Three studies (3277 participants) reported a positive effect on increasing PA levels when assessed as a dichotomous measure at 12 months, but this was not statistically significant (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.88 to 2.61; high quality evidence). Although there were limited data, there was no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events (one study; 149 participants). Risk of bias was assessed as low (four studies; 4822 participants) or moderate (six studies; 1543 participants). Any conclusions drawn from this review require some caution given the significant heterogeneity in the observed effects. Despite this, there was some indication that the most effective interventions were those that offered both individual and group support for changing PA levels using a tailored approach. The long term impact, cost effectiveness and rates of adverse events for these interventions was not established because the majority of studies stopped after 12 months., Authors' conclusions, Although we found evidence to support the effectiveness of face-to-face interventions for promoting PA, at least at 12 months, the effectiveness of these interventions was not supported by high quality studies. Due to the clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the studies, only limited conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of individual components of the interventions. Future studies should provide greater detail of the components of interventions, and assess impact on quality of life, adverse events and economic data.","Justin Richards, Melvyn Hillsdon, Margaret Thorogood, Charles Foster (2013).

A selection of review articles (see references) were examined to identify further relevant publications. There was no language restriction., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCT's) evaluating patient education interventions that included an instructional component and a non-intervention control group; pre- and post-test results available separately for RA, either in the publication or from the studies' authors; and study results presented in full, end-of-study report., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers examined and screened search results. Dichotomous items were summarized as relative risk. Standardized mean difference and weighted mean difference were calculated for continuous data. Heterogeneity was assessed using chi square., Main results, Thirty-one studies with relevant data were included., We found significant effects of patient education at first follow-up for scores on disability, joint counts, patient global assessment, psychological status, and depression. A trend favouring patient education was found for scores on pain. Physician global assessment was not assessed in any of the included studies. The dimensions of anxiety and disease activity showed no significant effects. At final follow up no significant effects of patient education were found, although there was a trend favouring patient education for scores on disability., Authors' conclusions, Patient education as provided in the studies reviewed here had small short-term effects on disability, joint counts, patient global assessment, psychological status and depression.

870,"Background, Intimate partner abuse is common worldwide, damaging the short- and long-term physical, mental, and emotional health of survivors and children. Advocacy may contribute to reducing abuse, empowering women to improve their situation by providing informal counselling and support for safety planning and increasing access to different services.

We contacted authors for missing information needed to calculate statistics for the review and looked for adverse events., Main results, We included 13 trials involving 2141 participants aged 15 to 65 years, frequently having low socioeconomic status., Authors' conclusions, Results suggest some benefits from advocacy. However, most studies were underpowered. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity largely precluded pooling of trials.

Personal communication was undertaken with key experts in the field., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of any multiple session early psychological intervention or treatment (two or more sessions) designed to prevent symptoms of PTSD., Data collection and analysis, Data were entered using Review Manager software. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed individually by two review authors. Data were analysed for summary effects using Review Manager 4.2. Mean difference was used for meta-analysis of continuous outcomes and relative risk for dichotomous outcomes., Main results, Eleven studies with a total of 941 participants were found to have evaluated brief psychological interventions aimed at preventing PTSD in individuals exposed to a specific traumatic event, examining a heterogeneous range of interventions. Eight studies were entered into meta-analysis. There was no observable difference between treatment and control conditions on primary outcome measures for these interventions at initial outcome (k=5, n=479; RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17). There was a trend for increased self-report of PTSD symptoms at 3 to 6 month follow-up in those who received an intervention (k=4, n=292; SMD 0.23; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.46). Two studies compared a memory structuring intervention against supportive listening. There was no evidence supporting the efficacy of this intervention., Authors' conclusions, The results suggest that no psychological intervention can be recommended for routine use following traumatic events and that multiple session interventions, like single session interventions, may have an adverse effect on some individuals. The clear practice implication of this is that, at present, multiple session interventions aimed at all individuals exposed to traumatic events should not be used. Further, better designed studies that explore new approaches to early intervention are now required.","Neil P. Roberts, Neil J. Kitchiner, Justin Kenardy, Jonathan I. Bisson (2010).

872,"Background, The amelioration of psychological distress following traumatic events is a major concern. Systematic reviews suggest that interventions targeted at all of those exposed to such events are not effective at preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recently other forms of intervention have been developed with the aim of treating acute traumatic stress problems., Objectives, To perform a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of all psychological treatments and interventions commenced within three months of a traumatic event aimed at treating acute traumatic stress reactions. The review followed the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration., Search methods, Systematic searches were performed of of CCDAN Registers up to August 2008. Editions of key journals were searched by hand over a period of two years; personal communication was undertaken with key experts in the field; online discussion fora were searched., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of any psychological intervention or treatment designed to reduce acute traumatic stress symptoms, with the exception of single session interventions., Data collection and analysis, Data were entered and analysed for summary effects using Review Manager 5.0 software. Standardised mean differences were calculated for continuous variable outcome data. Relative risks were calculated for dichotomous outcome data. When statistical heterogeneity was present a random effects model was applied., Main results, Fifteen studies (two with long term follow-up studies) were identified examining a range of interventions., Authors' conclusions, There was evidence that individual TF-CBT was effective for individuals with acute traumatic stress symptoms compared to both waiting list and supportive counselling interventions. The quality of trials included was variable and sample sizes were often small. There was considerable clinical heterogeneity in the included studies and unexplained statistical heterogeneity observed in some comparisons. This suggests the need for caution in interpreting the results of this review. Additional high quality trials with longer follow up periods are required to further test TF-CBT and other forms of psychological intervention.","Neil P. Roberts, Neil J.

873,"Background, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental health disorder that may develop after exposure to traumatic events. Substance use disorder (SUD) is a behavioural disorder in which the use of one or more substances is associated with heightened levels of distress, clinically significant impairment of functioning, or both. PTSD and SUD frequently occur together. The comorbidity is widely recognised as being difficult to treat and is associated with poorer treatment completion and poorer outcomes than for either condition alone. Several psychological therapies have been developed to treat the comorbidity, however there is no consensus about which therapies are most effective., Objectives, To determine the efficacy of psychological therapies aimed at treating traumatic stress symptoms, substance misuse symptoms, or both in people with comorbid PTSD and SUD in comparison with control conditions (usual care, waiting-list conditions, and no treatment) and other psychological therapies., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) all years to 11 March 2015. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov, contacted experts, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of individual or group psychological therapies delivered to individuals with PTSD and comorbid substance use, compared with waiting-list conditions, usual care, or minimal intervention or to other psychological therapies., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane., Main results, We included 14 studies with 1506 participants, of which 13 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Most studies involved adult populations. Studies were conducted in a variety of settings. We performed four comparisons investigating the effects of psychological therapies with a trauma-focused component and non-trauma-focused interventions against treatment as usual/minimal intervention and other active psychological therapies. Comparisons were stratified for individual- or group-based therapies. All active interventions were based on cognitive behavioural therapy. Our main findings were as follows., Authors' conclusions, We assessed the evidence in this review as mostly low to very low quality. Evidence showed that individual trauma-focused psychological therapy delivered alongside SUD therapy did better than TAU/minimal intervention in reducing PTSD severity post-treatment and at long-term follow-up, but only reduced SUD at long-term follow-up. All effects were small, and follow-up periods were generally quite short. There was evidence that fewer participants receiving trauma-focused therapy completed treatment. There was very little evidence to support use of non-trauma-focused individual- or group-based integrated therapies. Individuals with more severe and complex presentations (e.g. serious mental illness, individuals with cognitive impairment, and suicidal individuals) were excluded from most studies in this review, and so the findings from this review are not generalisable to such individuals. Some studies suffered from significant methodological problems and some were underpowered, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Further research is needed in this area.","Neil P.

874,"Background, Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common problem, affecting up to 50% of the population in industrialised countries. It is a chronic condition which, if untreated, can progress to serious complications that in turn can interfere with working ability. Standing at work is a known risk factor for CVI, yet the true effect of non-pharmacological preventive strategies remains unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2012., Objectives, To assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological strategies and devices to prevent CVI in a standing worker population., Search methods, For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched September 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 8). We also handsearched reference lists of relevant studies., Selection criteria, Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials that recruited standing workers to evaluate non-pharmacological devices or strategies used to prevent CVI were eligible for inclusion. Trials had to report an objective measure of clinical features of CVI or complaints associated with this condition in order to be included., Data collection and analysis, Selection of the trials, quality assessment and data abstraction were completed independently by two review authors. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Only one trial was eligible for inclusion in the review so we did not perform meta-analyses., Main results, The primary outcomes of this review were clinical features of CVI and its associated symptoms. No new included studies were identified for this update. One prospective cross-over trial was included in this review. It measured the effect of no compression followed by two phases with different gradients of compression stockings on symptoms in 19 female flight attendants who were required to stand, almost continuously, for long periods of time. The included study provided some evidence that compression stockings improved symptoms of leg fatigue in standing workers. However, the strength of the evidence in this review is weak as it is based on only one very small trial which was at high risk of bias. The included study did not address any of the secondary outcomes including quality of life or economic impact of the interventions. Nor did the study report the length of time that the population were required to stand at work. Furthermore, no trials were found which measured the effectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions or strategies aimed at preventing CVI in standing workers., Authors' conclusions, Due to the extremely limited number of trials, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for preventing CVI in standing workers. Further large-scale studies examining all possible non-pharmacological interventions and outcomes are required.","Lindsay Robertson, Ern Su Yeoh, Dinanda N. Kolbach (2013).

875,"Background, The vast majority of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are adults of working age. Therefore unemployment and job loss resulting from HIV infection are major public health and economic concerns. Return to work (RTW) after diagnosis of HIV is a long and complex process, particularly if the individual has been absent from work for long periods. There have been various efforts to improve the RTW of persons living with HIV (HIV+), and many of these have been assessed formally in intervention studies., Objectives, To evaluate the effect of interventions aimed at sustaining and improving employment in HIV+ persons., Search methods, We conducted a comprehensive search from 1981 until December 2014 in the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, OSH UPDATE databases (CISDOC, HSELINE, NIOSHTIC, NIOSHTIC-2, RILOSH), and PsycINFO., Selection criteria, We considered for inclusion all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled before-after (CBA) studies assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological, vocational and psychological interventions with HIV+ working-aged (16 years or older) participants that had used RTW or other indices of employment as outcomes., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened all potential references for inclusion. We determined final selection of studies by consensus. We performed data extraction and management, as well as Risk of bias assessment, in duplicate. We measured the treatment effect using odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. We applied the GRADE approach to appraise the quality of the evidence., Main results, We found one RCT with 174 participants and five CBAs with 48,058 participants assessing the effectiveness of vocational training (n = 1) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n = 5). We found no studies assessing psychological interventions. The one RCT was conducted in the United States; the five CBA studies were conducted in South Africa, India, Kenya, and Uganda. We graded all six studies as having a high risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, We found very low-quality evidence showing that ART interventions may improve employment outcomes for HIV+ persons. For vocational interventions, the one included study produced no evidence of an intervention effect. We found no studies that assessed psychological interventions. We need more high-quality, preferably randomized studies to assess the effectiveness of RTW interventions for HIV+ persons.","Rachel Robinson, Emmanuel Okpo, Nomusa Mngoma (2015).

876,"Background, Transcranial magnetic stimulation can either excite or inhibit cortical areas of the brain, depending on whether the speed of the repetitive stimulation is applied at high or low frequencies. It has been used for physiological studies and it has also been proposed as a treatment for depression., Objectives, To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulationfor treating depression., Search strategy, An electronic search was performed including the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group trials register (last searched June 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE (1966-2001), EMBASE (1974-2001), PsycLIT (1980-2001), and bibliographies from reviewed articles. Unpublished data and grey literature were searched through personal communications with researchers., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials assessing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression., Data collection and analysis, All reviewers independently extracted the information and verified it by cross-checking. Disagreements were resolved through discussion., Continuous data: When similar studies were grouped, the overall standardised mean difference was calculated under a fixed effect model weighted by the inverse variance method with 95% confidence intervals. (In the presence of statistical heterogeneity, a random effects model was to be used.), Main results, Sixteen trials were included in the review and fourteen contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis. Most comparisons did not show differences between rTMS and other interventions. No difference was seen between rTMS and sham TMS using the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, except for one time period (after two weeks of treatment) for left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency; and also for right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and low frequency, both in favour of rTMS and both using the Hamilton scale. Comparison of rTMS (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency) with electroconvulsive therapy showed no difference except for psychotic patients after two weeks treatment, using the Hamilton scale, which indicated that electroconvulsive therapy was more effective than rTMS., Authors' conclusions, The information in this review suggests that there is no strong evidence for benefit from using transcranial magnetic stimulation to treat depression, although the small sample sizes do not exclude the possibility of benefit.","Luis Jose RodriguezMartin, Manuel Jose Barbanoj, T.

877,"Background, Previous Cochrane reviews have considered the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in both Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The clinical features of DLB and PDD have much in common and are distinguished primarily on the basis of whether or not parkinsonism precedes dementia by more than a year. Patients with both conditions have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Therefore, blocking its breakdown using cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to clinical improvement., Objectives, To assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease falling short of dementia (CIND-PD) (considered as separate phenomena and also grouped together as Lewy body disease)., Search methods, The trials were identified from a search of ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (on 30 August 2011) using the search terms Lewy, Parkinson, PDD, DLB, LBD. This register consists of records from major healthcare databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL) and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly., Selection criteria, Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in DLB, PDD and CIND-PD., Data collection and analysis, Data were extracted from published reports by one review author (MR). The data for each 'condition' (that is DLB, PDD or CIND-PD) were considered separately and, where possible, also pooled. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.0., Main results, Six trials met the inclusion criteria for this review, in which a total of 1236 participants were randomised. Four of the trials were of a parallel group design and two cross-over trials were included. Four of the trials included participants with a diagnosis of PDD (; ; ; ), of which Dubois 2007 remains unpublished (n = 550). included patients with cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease (both with and without dementia). Patients with DLB were included in only one of the trials ()., Authors' conclusions, The currently available evidence supports the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with PDD, with a positive impact on global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales. However, almost half of the trial data, which could potentially change this conclusion, have not been made public. The effect in DLB remains unclear. There is no current disaggregated evidence to support their use in CIND-PD.","Michal Rolinski, Chris Fox, Ian Maidment, Rupert McShane (2012).

878,"Background, Bisphosphonate drugs can be used to prevent and treat osteoporosis and to reduce symptoms and complications of metastatic bone disease; however, they are associated with a rare but serious adverse event: osteonecrosis of the maxillary and mandibular bones. This condition is called bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw or BRONJ. BRONJ is diagnosed when people who are taking, or have previously taken, bisphosphonates have exposed bone in the jaw area for more than eight weeks in the absence of radiation treatment. There is currently no 'gold standard' of treatment for BRONJ. The three broad categories of intervention are conservative approaches (e.g. mouth rinse, antibiotics), surgical interventions and adjuvant non-surgical strategies (e.g. hyperbaric oxygen therapy, platelet-rich plasma), which can be used in combination., Objectives, To determine the efficacy and safety of any intervention aimed at treating BRONJ., Search methods, We searched the following databases to 15 December 2015: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Trials Register (20 September 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE via Ovid, CancerLit via PubMed, CINAHL via EBSCO and AMED via Ovid. We scanned the references cited in retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field, the first authors of included papers, study sponsors, other bisphosphonates investigators and pharmaceutical companies. We searched for ongoing trials through contact with trialists and by searching the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register () and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also conducted a grey literature search to September 2015., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of any treatment for BRONJ with another treatment or placebo., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed the risk of bias in the included trials and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third review author., Main results, One small trial at high risk of bias met the inclusion criteria. The trial randomised 49 participants, most of whom had cancer. It compared standard care (defined as surgery, antibiotics and oral rinses at the discretion of the oral-maxillofacial surgeon) to standard care plus hyperbaric oxygen therapy (2 atmospheres twice a day for 40 treatments). The trial measured the percentage of participants who improved or healed at three, six, 12 and 18 months and last contact. It also measured mean weekly pain scores., Authors' conclusions, There is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide treatment of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). One small trial at high risk of bias evaluated hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) as an adjunct to 'standard' care and could not confirm or refute the effectiveness of HBO. There are two ongoing trials of teriparatide treatment for BRONJ. We found no randomised controlled trials of any other BRONJ treatments. High quality randomised controlled trials are needed. We provide recommendations for their focus and design.","Victoria Rollason, Alexandra Laverriere, C. I. Laura MacDonald, Tanya Walsh, Martin R. Tramer, Nicole B. VogtFerrier (2016).

880,"Background, Over approximately the last fifteen years, early psychological interventions, such as psychological 'debriefing', have been increasingly used following psychological trauma. Whilst this intervention has become popular and its use has spread to several settings, empirical evidence for its efficacy is noticeably lacking. This is the third update of a review of single session psychological 'debriefing', first having been undertaken in 1997., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of brief psychological debriefing for the management of psychological distress after trauma, and the prevention of post traumatic stress disorder., Search strategy, Electronic searching of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, PILOTS, Biosis, Pascal, Occ.Safety and Health,SOCIOFILE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, PSYNDEX, SIGLE, LILACS, CCTR, CINAHL, NRR, Hand search of Journal of Traumatic Stress. Contact with leading researchers., Selection criteria, The focus of RCTs was on persons recently (one month or less) exposed to a traumatic event. The intervention consisted of a single session only, and involved some form of emotional processing/ventilation, by encouraging recollection/reworking of the traumatic event, accompanied by normalisation of emotional reaction to the event., Data collection and analysis, 15 trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was variable, but the majority of trials scored poorly. Data from 6 trials could not be included the meta-analyses. These trials are summarised in the text., Main results, Single session individual debriefing did not prevent the onset of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) nor reduce psychological distress, compared to control. At one year, one trial reported a significantly increased risk of PTSD in those receiving debriefing (OR 2.51 (95% CI 1.24 to 5.09). Those receiving the intervention reported no reduction in PTSD severity at 1-4 months (SMD 0.11 (95%CI 0.10 to 0.32)), 6-13 months (SMD 0.26 (95%CI 0.01 to 0.50)), or 3 years (SMD 0.17 (95%CI -0.34 to 0.67)). There was also no evidence that debriefing reduced general psychological morbidity, depression or anxiety, or that it was superior to an educational intervention., Authors' conclusions, There is no evidence that single session individual psychological debriefing is a useful treatment for the prevention of post traumatic stress disorder after traumatic incidents. Compulsory debriefing of victims of trauma should cease. A more appropriate response could involve a 'screen and treat' model (NICE 2005).","Suzanna C.

885,"Background, Medication is the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses, but many people continue to experience symptoms in spite of medication (Johnstone 1998). In addition to medication, creative therapies, such as drama therapy may prove beneficial. Drama therapy is a form of treatment that encourages spontaneity and creativity. It can promote emotional expression, but does not necessarily require the participant to have insight into their condition or psychological-mindset., Objectives, To review the effects of drama therapy and related approaches as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia compared with standard care and other psychosocial interventions., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 2006), hand searched reference lists, hand searched Dramatherapy (the journal of the British Association of Dramatherapists) and Arts in Psychotherapy and contacted relevant authors., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials that compared drama therapy, psychodrama and related approaches with standard care or other psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia., Data collection and analysis, We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data from the studies. We excluded data where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up. For continuous outcomes we calculated a weighted mean difference and its 95% confidence interval. For binary outcomes we calculated a fixed effects risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI) and a number needed to treat (NNT)., Main results, The search identified 183 references but only five studies (total n=210) met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies were on inpatient populations and compared the intervention with standard inpatient care. One study had drama therapy as the intervention, one had role-playing, one had a social drama group and two used psychodrama. Two of the included studies were Chinese and it is difficult to know whether psychodrama and indeed inpatient psychiatric care in China is comparable with the drama interventions and inpatient care in the other included studies. There were no significant findings about the value of drama interventions for keeping inpatients engaged in treatment. Due to poor reporting very little data from the five studies could be used and there were no conclusive findings about the harms or benefits of drama therapy for inpatients with schizophrenia., Authors' conclusions, Randomised studies are possible in this field. The use of drama therapy for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses should continue to be under evaluation as its benefits, or harms, are unclear.","Rachel Ruddy, Kim DentBrown (2009).

886,"Background, It has been argued that individuals with fragile X syndrome could have low folate levels in their bodies and that supplementing their dietary intake might remediate the adverse developmental and behavioural effects of the condition., Objectives, To review the efficacy and safety of folic acid in the treatment of people with fragile X syndrome., Search strategy, We searched four databases in November 2010: CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool., Main results, We included five trials, which were published between 1986 and 1992. Overall, they included 67 patients, all male, with ages ranging from one to 54 years. Intellectual disability in participants varied from borderline to severe and some studies included patients with an additional diagnosis of autism or autistic behaviour. Four of the studies were placebo-controlled cross-over trials and one study was a parallel design. The duration of follow-up ranged from two months to 12 months and the period on folic acid or placebo ranged from two to eight months. Doses of folic acid ranged from 10 mg to 250 mg per day, 10 mg per day being the most common. Most of the younger patients involved were also taking part in special education programmes (usually involving language and occupational therapy)., Authors' conclusions, The quality of available evidence is low and not suitable for drawing conclusions about the effect of folic acid on fragile X syndrome patients. It consists of few studies with small samples of patients, all of them male, with little statistical power to detect anything other than huge effects.","JoseRamon Rueda, Javier Ballesteros, Virginia Guillen, MariaIsabel Tejada, Ivan Sola (2011).

887,"Background, People with fragile X syndrome (FXS) have an intellectual dysfunction that can range from very mild to severe. Symptoms can include speech and language delays and behavioural difficulties such as aggression or self injurious behaviours, emotional lability, and anxiety-related problems (for example obsessive-compulsive symptoms and perseverative behaviours). In some cases, affected people may have an additional diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or an autism spectrum disorder., Objectives, To review the efficacy and safety of L-acetylcarnitine in improving the psychological, intellectual, and social performance of people with FXS., Search methods, In May 2015 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and two other databases. We also searched three trials registers, four theses databases, and the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy of L-acetylcarnitine, at any dose, in people of any age diagnosed with FXS compared with placebo., Data collection and analysis, For each trial, two review authors independently extracted data on the children included and interventions compared, and assessed the risk of bias of the studies across the following domains: randomisation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors), incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential sources of bias., Main results, We found only two RCTs that compared oral L-acetylcarnitine (LAC) with oral placebo in children with FXS. The studies included a total of 83 participants, all of them male, who were treated and followed for one year. The age of participants at the start of treatment ranged from 6 to 13 years, with a mean age of 9 years. Neither study provided information on randomisation, allocation concealment procedures, or blinding of outcome assessment, and we received no responses from the authors we emailed for clarification. We therefore rated studies as being at unclear risk of bias on these domains. We judged both studies to be at low risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting, but to be at high risk of other bias, as at least one study was funded by a drug company, and in both studies people working for the company were part of the research team., Authors' conclusions, Low-quality evidence from two small trials showed that when compared to placebo, LAC may not improve intellectual functioning or hyperactive behaviour in children with FXS.","JoseRamon Rueda, Virginia Guillen, Javier Ballesteros, MariaIsabel Tejada, Ivan Sola (2015).

Despite advances in treatment, the outlook for the majority of patients remains grim and most face a pessimistic future accompanied by sometimes devastating effects on emotional and psychological health. Although chemotherapy is accepted as an effective treatment for advanced lung cancer, the high prevalence of treatment-related side effects as well the symptoms of disease progression highlight the need for high-quality palliative and supportive care to minimise symptom distress and to promote quality of life., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of non-invasive interventions delivered by healthcare professionals in improving symptoms, psychological functioning and quality of life in patients with lung cancer., Search methods, We ran a search in February 2011 to update the original completed review. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (accessed through PubMed), EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, British Nursing Index and Archive (accessed through Ovid) and reference lists of relevant articles; we also contacted authors., Selection criteria, Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of non-invasive interventions in improving well-being and quality of life in patients diagnosed with lung cancer., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment of relevant studies was performed by one author and checked by a second author., Main results, Fifteen trials were included, six of which were added in this update. Three trials of a nursing intervention to manage breathlessness showed benefit in terms of symptom experience, performance status and emotional functioning. Four trials assessed structured nursing programmes and found positive effects on delay in clinical deterioration, dependency and symptom distress, and improvements in emotional functioning and satisfaction with care., Authors' conclusions, Nurse follow-up programmes and interventions to manage breathlessness may produce beneficial effects. Counselling may help patients cope more effectively with emotional symptoms, but the evidence is not conclusive. Other psychotherapeutic, psychosocial and educational interventions can play some role in improving patients' quality of life. Exercise programmes and nutritional interventions have not shown relevant and lasting improvements of quality of life. Reflexology may have some beneficial effects in the short term.","JoseRamon Rueda, Ivan Sola, Antonio Pascual, Mireia Subirana Casacuberta (2011).

891,"Background, Healthcare workers can suffer from occupational stress as a result of lack of skills, organisational factors, and low social support at work. This may lead to distress, burnout and psychosomatic problems, and deterioration in quality of life and service provision., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness of work- and person-directed interventions compared to no intervention or alternative interventions in preventing stress at work in healthcare workers., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, NIOSHTIC-2 and Web of Science up to November 2013., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions aimed at preventing psychological stress in healthcare workers. For organisational interventions, interrupted time-series and controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies were also eligible., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We used Standardised Mean Differences (SMDs) where authors of trials used different scales to measure stress or burnout. We combined studies that were similar in meta-analyses. We used the GRADE system to rate the quality of the evidence., Main results, In this update, we added 39 studies, making a total of 58 studies (54 RCTs and four CBA studies), with 7188 participants. We categorised interventions as cognitive-behavioural training (CBT) (n = 14), mental and physical relaxation (n = 21), combined CBT and relaxation (n = 6) and organisational interventions (n = 20). Follow-up was less than one month in 24 studies, one to six in 22 studies and more than six months in 12 studies. We categorised outcomes as stress, anxiety or general health., Authors' conclusions, There is low-quality evidence that CBT and mental and physical relaxation reduce stress more than no intervention but not more than alternative interventions. There is also low-quality evidence that changing work schedules may lead to a reduction of stress. Other organisational interventions have no effect on stress levels. More randomised controlled trials are needed with at least 120 participants that compare the intervention to a placebo-like intervention. Organisational interventions need better focus on reduction of specific stressors.","Jani H. Ruotsalainen, Jos H. Verbeek, Albert Marine, Consol Serra (2015).

892,"Background, Many systematic reviews exist on interventions to improve safe and effective medicines use by consumers, but research is distributed across diseases, populations and settings. The scope and focus of such reviews also vary widely, creating challenges for decision-makers seeking to inform decisions by using the evidence on consumers' medicines use., Objectives, To assess the effects of interventions which target healthcare consumers to promote safe and effective medicines use, by synthesising review-level evidence., Methods, Search methods: We included systematic reviews published on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. We identified relevant reviews by handsearching databases from their start dates to March 2012., Main results, We included 75 systematic reviews of varied methodological quality. Reviews assessed interventions with diverse aims including support for behaviour change, risk minimisation and skills acquisition. No reviews aimed to promote systems-level consumer participation in medicines-related activities. Medicines adherence was the most frequently-reported outcome, but others such as knowledge, clinical and service-use outcomes were also reported.

893,"Background, Chlorpromazine is an aliphatic phenothiazine, which is one of the widely-used typical antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine is reliable for its efficacy and one of the most tested first generation antipsychotic drugs. It has been used as a 'gold standard' to compare the efficacy of older and newer antipsychotic drugs. Expensive new generation drugs are heavily marketed worldwide as a better treatment for schizophrenia, but this may not be the case and an unnecessary drain on very limited resources., Objectives, To compare the effects of chlorpromazine with atypical or second generation antipsychotic drugs, for the treatment of people with schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register up to 23 September 2013., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared chlorpromazine with any other atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating people with schizophrenia. Adults (as defined in each trial) diagnosed with schizophrenia, including schizophreniform, schizoaffective and delusional disorders were included in this review., Data collection and analysis, At least two review authors independently screened the articles identified in the literature search against the inclusion criteria and extracted data from included trials. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we determined the mean difference (MD) values and 95% CIs. We assessed the risk of bias in included studies and rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach., Main results, This review includes 71 studies comparing chlorpromazine to olanzapine, risperidone or quetiapine. None of the included trials reported any data on economic costs., Authors' conclusions, Most included trials included inpatients from hospitals in China. Therefore the results of this Cochrane review are more applicable to the Chinese population. Mostincluded trials were short term studies, therefore we cannot comment on the medium and long term use of chlorpromazine compared to atypical antipsychotics. Low qualityy evidence suggests chlorpromazine causes more extrapyramidal adverse effects. However, all studiesused varying dose ranges, and higher doses would be expected to be associated with more adverse events.","Kumar B. Saha, Li Bo, Sai Zhao, Jun Xia, Stephanie Sampson, Rashid U.

895,"Background, Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is characterized by serous detachment of the neural retina with dysfunction of the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The effects on the retina are usually self limited, although some people are left with irreversible vision loss due to progressive and permanent photoreceptor damage or RPE atrophy. There have been a variety of interventions used in CSC, including, but not limited to, laser treatment, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. However, it is not known whether these or other treatments offer significant advantages over observation or other interventions. At present there is no evidence-based consensus on the management of CSC. Due in large part to the propensity for CSC to resolve spontaneously or to follow a waxing and waning course, the most common initial approach to treatment is observation. It remains unclear whether this is the best approach with regard to safety and efficacy., Objectives, To compare the relative effectiveness of interventions for central serous chorioretinopathy., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to February 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2015), the ISRCTN registry (), ClinicalTrials.gov () and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 5 October 2015., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any intervention for CSC with any other intervention for CSC or control., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We pooled data from all studies using a fixed-effect model. For interventions applied to the eye (i.e. not systemic interventions), we synthesized direct and indirect evidence in a network meta-analysis model., Main results, We included 25 studies with 1098 participants (1098 eyes) and follow-up from 16 weeks to 12 years. Studies were conducted in Europe, North and South America, Middle East, and Asia. The trials were small (most trials enrolled fewer than 50 participants) and poorly reported; often it was unclear whether key aspects of the trial, such as allocation concealment, had been done. A substantial proportion of the trials were not masked., Authors' conclusions, CSC remains an enigmatic condition in large part due to a natural history of spontaneous improvement in a high proportion of people and also because no single treatment has provided overwhelming evidence of efficacy in published RCTs. While a number of interventions have been proposed as potentially efficacious, the quality of study design, execution of the study and the relatively small number of participants enrolled and followed to revealing endpoints limits the utility of existing data. It is not clear whether there is a clinically important benefit to treating acute CSC which often resolves spontaneously as part of its natural history. RCTs comparing individual treatments to the natural history would be valuable in identifying potential treatment groups for head-to-head comparison. Of the interventions studied to date, PDT or micropulse laser treatment appear the most promising for study in future trials.","Mahsa Salehi, Adam S. Wenick, Andrew Hua Law, Jennifer R.

896,"Background, Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic drug from the phenothiazine group of antipsychotics. It has been commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia, however, with the advent of atypical antipsychotic medications, use has declined over the years., Objectives, To measure the outcomes (both beneficial and harmful) of the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of oral fluphenazine versus atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Studies (25 April 2013). For the economic search, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Health Economic Database (CSzGHED) on 31 January 2014, Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fluphenazine (oral) with any other oral atypical antipsychotics., Data collection and analysis, Review authors worked independently to inspect citations and assess the quality of the studies and to extract data. For homogeneous dichotomous data we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), and calculated the mean differences (MDs) for continuous data. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to rate the quality of the evidence., Main results, Four studies randomising a total of 202 people with schizophrenia are included. Oral fluphenazine was compared with oral amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine., Authors' conclusions, Measures of clinical response and mental state do not highlight differences between fluphenazine and amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine. Largely measures of adverse effects are also unconvincing for substantive differences between fluphenazine and the newer drugs. All included trials carry a substantial risk of bias regarding reporting of adverse effects and this bias would have favoured the newer drugs. The four small short included studies do not provide much clear information about the relative merits or disadvantages of oral fluphenazine compared with newer atypical antipsychotics.","James R.

We also checked the references of all included studies, and contacted industry and authors of included studies., Selection criteria, Randomised clinical trials comparing depot risperidone with other treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE., Main results, Twelve studies, with a total of 5723 participants were randomised to the following comparison treatments:, Authors' conclusions, Depot risperidone may be more acceptable than placebo injection but it is hard to know if it is any more effective in controlling the symptoms of schizophrenia. The active drug, especially higher doses, may be associated with more movement disorders than placebo. People already stabilised on oral risperidone may continue to maintain benefit if treated with depot risperidone and avoid the need to take tablets, at least in the short term. In people who are happy to take oral medication the depot risperidone is approximately equal to oral risperidone. It is possible that the depot formulation, however, can bring a second-generation antipsychotic to people who do not reliably adhere to treatment. People with schizophrenia who have difficulty adhering to treatment, however, are unlikely to volunteer for a clinical trial. Such people may gain benefit from the depot risperidone with no increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects.","Stephanie Sampson, Prakash Hosalli, Vivek A. Furtado, John M. Davis (2016).

898,"Background, Antipsychotic medication is considered the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and is generally regarded as highly effective, especially in controlling positive symptoms. However, long-term antipsychotic exposure has been associated with a range of adverse effects, including extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPS), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia and death. Intermittent drug techniques refers to the 'use of medication only during periods of incipient relapse or symptom exacerbation rather than continuously'. The aim is to reduce the risk of typical adverse effects of antipsychotics by 'reducing long-term medication exposure for patients who are receiving maintenance treatment while limiting the risk of relapse', with a further goal of improving social functioning resulting from the reduction of antipsychotic-induced side effects, Objectives, To review the effects of different intermittent drug techniques compared with maintenance treatment in people with schizophrenia or related disorders., Search methods, We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2012) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching relevant intermittent drug treatment articles and manually searching reference lists., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent drug techniques with standard maintenance therapy for people with schizophrenia. Primary outcomes of interest were relapse and hospitalisation., Data collection and analysis, At least two review authors selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. For non-skewed continuous endpoint data extracted from valid scales, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups with a 95% CI. Where data displayed heterogeneity, these were analysed using a random-effects model. Skewed data are presented in tables. We assessed overall quality for clinically important outcomes using the GRADE approach., Main results, Of 241 records retrieved by the search, 17 trials conducted between 1961 and 2011, involving 2252 participants with follow-up from six weeks to two years, were included. Homogenous data demonstrated that instances of relapse were significantly higher in people receiving any intermittent drug treatment in the long term (n = 436, 7 RCTs, RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.54, moderate quality evidence). Intermittent treatment was shown to be more effective than placebo, however, and demonstrated that significantly less people receiving intermittent antipsychotics experienced full relapse by medium term (n = 290, 2 RCTs, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.58, very low quality evidence). Hospitalisation rates were higher for people receiving any intermittent drug treatment by long term (n = 626, 5 RCTs, RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.06, moderate quality evidence). Results demonstrated little difference in instances of tardive dyskinesia in groups with any intermittent drug technique versus maintenance therapy, with equivocal results (displaying slight heterogeneity) at long term (n = 165, 4 RCTs, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.30, low quality evidence)., Authors' conclusions, Results of this review support the existing evidence that intermittent antipsychotic treatment is not as effective as continuous, maintained antipsychotic therapy in preventing relapse in people with schizophrenia. More research is needed to assess any potential benefits or harm of intermittent treatment regarding adverse effects typically associated with maintained antipsychotic treatment, as well as any cost-effectiveness of this experimental treatment.","Stephanie Sampson, Mouhamad Mansour, Nicola Maayan, Karla SoaresWeiser, Clive E.

This is the second update of a Cochrane Review (originally titled 'Work conditioning, work hardening and functional restoration for workers with back and neck pain') first published in 2003, updated in 2010, and updated again in 2013., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy in reducing time lost from work and improving work status for workers with back pain. Further, to assess which aspects of physical conditioning are related to a faster return to work for workers with back pain., Search methods, We searched the following databases to March 2012: CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980), CINAHL (from 1982), PsycINFO (from 1967), and PEDro., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs that studied workers with work disability related to back pain and who were included in physical conditioning programmes., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration., Main results, We included 41 articles reporting on 25 RCTs with 4404 participants. Risk of bias was low in 16 studies., Authors' conclusions, The effectiveness of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy in reducing sick leave for workers with back pain, compared to usual care or exercise therapy, remains uncertain. For workers with acute back pain, physical conditioning may have no effect on sickness absence duration. There is conflicting evidence regarding the reduction of sickness absence duration with intense physical conditioning versus usual care for workers with subacute back pain. It may be that including workplace visits or execution of the intervention at the workplace is the component that renders a physical conditioning programme effective. For workers with chronic back pain physical conditioning has a small effect on reducing sick leave compared to care as usual after 12 months follow-up. To what extent physical conditioning as part of integrated care management may alter the effect on sick leave for workers with chronic back pain needs further research.","Frederieke G.

We conducted computer-aided searches of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (searched in June 2006), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2006) and also tracked references in bibliographies., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing various surgical techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors performed study selection, assessment of methodological quality and data extraction independently of each other., Main results, Thirty-three studies were included in the review of which 10 were newly identified in this update. The methodological quality of the trials ranged from fair to good; however, the use of allocation concealment was mentioned explicitly in only seven trials. Many studies failed to present the results in sufficient detail to enable statistical pooling. Pooling was also impeded by the vast variety of outcome measures that were applied in the various studies. None of the existing alternatives to standard open carpal tunnel release offered significantly better relief from symptoms in the short- or long-term. In three studies with a total of 294 participants, endoscopic carpal tunnel release resulted in earlier return to work or activities of daily living than open carpal tunnel release, with a weighted mean difference of -6 days (95% CI -9 to -3 days)., Authors' conclusions, There is no strong evidence supporting the need for replacement of standard open carpal tunnel release by existing alternative surgical procedures for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. The decision to apply endoscopic carpal tunnel release instead of open carpal tunnel release seems to be guided by the surgeon's and patient's preferences.","J. P. M.

903,"Background, Multidimensional rehabilitation programmes (MDRPs) have developed in response to the growing number of people living with and surviving cancer. MDRPs comprise a physical component and a psychosocial component. Studies of the effectiveness of these programmes have not been reviewed and synthesised., Objectives, To conduct a systematic review of studies examining the effectiveness of MDRPs in terms of maintaining or improving the physical and psychosocial well-being of adult cancer survivors., Search methods, We conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsychINFO up to February 2012., Selection criteria, Selection criteria focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of multidimensional interventions for adult cancer survivors. Interventions had to include a physical component and a psychosocial component and to have been carried out on two or more occasions following completion of primary cancer treatment. Outcomes had to be assessed using validated measures of physical health and psychosocial well-being. Non-English language papers were included., Data collection and analysis, Pairs of review authors independently selected trials, rated their methodological quality and extracted relevant data. Although meta-analyses of primary and secondary endpoints were planned there was a high level of study heterogeneity and only one common outcome measure (SF-36) could be statistically synthesised. In addition, we conducted a narrative analysis of interventions, particularly in terms of inspecting and identifying intervention components, grouping or categorising interventions and examining potential common links and outcomes., Main results, Twelve RCTs (comprising 1669 participants) met the eligibility criteria. We judged five studies to have a moderate risk of bias and assessed the remaining seven as having a high risk of bias. It was possible to include SF-36 physical health component scores from five studies in a meta-analysis. Participating in a MDRP was associated with an increase in SF-36 physical health component scores (mean difference (MD) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 4.31, P = 0.04). The findings from the narrative analysis suggested that MDRPs with a single domain or outcome focus appeared to be more successful than programmes with multiple aims. In addition, programmes that comprised participants with different types of cancer compared to cancer site-specific programmes were more likely to show positive improvements in physical outcomes. The most effective mode of service delivery appeared to be face-to-face contact supplemented with at least one follow-up telephone call. There was no evidence to indicate that MDRPs which lasted longer than six months improved outcomes beyond the level attained at six months. In addition, there was no evidence to suggest that services were more effective if they were delivered by a particular type of health professional., Authors' conclusions, There is some evidence to support the effectiveness of brief, focused MDRPs for cancer survivors. Rigorous and methodologically sound clinical trials that include an economic analysis are required.","David A. Scott, Moyra Mills, Amanda Black, Marie Cantwell, Anna Campbell, Chris R.

904,"Background, Many people with schizophrenia or similar severe mental disorders do not achieve a satisfactory treatment response with ordinary antipsychotic drug treatment. In these cases, various add-on medications are used, amongst them beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers)., Objectives, To evaluate the clinical effects of beta-blockers as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication in schizophrenia or similar severe mental disorders., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (October 2009) and references of all identified studies for further citations. Where necessary we also contacted authors of trials for further information., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials comparing beta-blockers with placebo as an adjunct to conventional antipsychotic medication for those with schizophrenia., Data collection and analysis, Data were extracted independently by at least two reviewers. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a fixed-effect model. If continuous data were included, we analysed these data using weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval, based on a fixed effect model., Main results, In this 2010 update four additional trials were identified, bringing the total number of included studies to nine (total n=282, eight trials were short term, under/or 12 weeks duration). Overall reporting of data was poor, resulting in much information being lost to this review. No data on mental state were possible to include. Data were reported in graphs with no variances. Adding beta-blockers to antipsychotic treatment seems generally acceptable (n=274, 8 RCTs, RR leaving study early at 12 weeks 1.62 CI 0.92 to 2.83). We found no difference in relapse rate between the two treatment groups (n=68, 2 RCTs, RR at 12 weeks 3.12 CI 0.34 to 28.36). There were few reported general adverse events (n=48, 1 RCT, RR at 12 weeks 5.42 CI 0.27 to 107.20). The most frequent specific adverse effect was hypotension or symptoms likely to be related to hypotension (n=274, 8 RCTs, RR at 12 weeks 1.63 CI 0.70 to 3.84)., Authors' conclusions, Existing evidence is limited and dated. Any possible benefit of adjunctive beta-blocker therapy is obscured by poor reporting within the studies. Important data on quality of life, satisfaction, healthy days, and cost are not available. Considering the number of people whose symptoms are only partially responsive to antipsychotic medication, well conducted and reported trials in this area could be justified.","Elena Shek, Sabyasachi Bardhan, Maxim V.

905,"Background, This review considers the use of day hospitals as an alternative to outpatient care. Two types of day hospital are covered by the review: 'day treatment programmes' and 'transitional' day hospitals. Day treatment programmes offer more intense treatment for people who have failed to respond to outpatient care. Transitional day hospitals offer time-limited care to people who have just been discharged from inpatient care., Objectives, To assess effects of day hospital care as an alternative to continuing outpatient care for people with schizophrenia and and other similar severe mental illness., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (May 2009) and references of all identified studies for further citations. If necessary, we also contacted authors of trials for further information., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing day hospital care with outpatient care for those with schizophrenia and other similar severe mental illness., Data collection and analysis, We extracted and cross-checked data independently. We analysed dichotomous data using fixed-effect relative risk (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI). If continuous data were included, we analysed this data using the random-effects weighted mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval., Main results, We identified four relevant trials all dating from before 1986 (total n=309 participants); all but one of which (n=37) evaluated day treatment centres. Across time less people allocated to day hospital care tend to be admitted to hospital (beyond one year: n=242, 2 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.56 to 0.89 day treatment centres) but data are heterogeneous (I(superscript 2) =74% P=0.05) and should not be taken into account. Data on time spent as an inpatient seem to support this finding but are poorly reported. We found no clear difference between day hospital and outpatient care for the outcome of 'lost to follow up' (at six months: n=147, 3 RCTs, RR 0.97 CI 0.48 to 1.95; at 12 months: n=117, 2 RCTs, RR 0.97 CI 0.48 to 1.95 day treatment centres / transitional day hospital). Scale derived findings on social functioning are equivocal (SAS: n=37, 1 RCT, MD 0.36 CI -0.07 to 0.79 transitional day hospital) but there was some suggestion from small studies that day hospital care may decrease the risk of unemployment (at 12 months: n=80, 1 RCT, RR 0.86 CI 0.69 to 1.06 day treatment centre). Different measures of mental state showed no convincing effect (Symptom Check List: n=30, 1 RCT, MD -90 0.31 CI -0.20 to 0.82 day treatment centre). Poorly reported economic data from decades ago suggested that day hospitals were more costly to establish and run than outpatient care but took no account of other costs such as inpatient stay., Authors' conclusions, Evidence is limited and dated. Day hospital care may help avoid inpatient care but data are lacking on missing on a raft of outcomes that are now considered important, such as quality of life, satisfaction, healthy days, and cost.","Elena Shek, Airton T.

906,"Background, Current policy in the UK and elsewhere places emphasis on the provision of mental health services in the least restrictive setting, whilst also recognising that some children will require inpatient care. As a result, there are a range of mental health services to manage young people with serious mental health problems who are at risk of being admitted to an inpatient unit in community or outpatient settings., Objectives, 1. To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and cost of mental health services that provide an alternative to inpatient care for children and young people., 2. To identify the range and prevalence of different models of service that seek to avoid inpatient care for children and young people., Search strategy, Our search included the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register (2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 2007), EMBASE (1982 to 2006), the British Nursing Index (1994 to 2006), RCN database (1985 to 1996), CINAHL (1982 to 2006) and PsycInfo (1972 to 2007)., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of mental health services providing specialist care, beyond the scope of generic outpatient provision, as an alternative to inpatient mental health care, for children or adolescents aged from five to 18 years who have a serious mental health condition requiring specialist services beyond the capacity of generic outpatient provision. The control group received mental health services in an inpatient or equivalent setting., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We grouped studies according to the intervention type but did not pool data because of differences in the interventions and measures of outcome. Where data were available we calculated confidence intervals (CIs) for differences between groups at follow up. We also calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs for each outcome in terms of mean change from baseline to follow up using the follow-up SDs. We calculated SMDs (taking into account the direction of change and the scoring of each instrument) so that negative SMDs indicate results that favour treatment and positive SMDs favour the control group., Main results, We included seven randomised controlled trials (recruiting a total of 799 participants) evaluating four distinct models of care: multi-systemic therapy (MST) at home, specialist outpatient service, intensive home treatment and intensive home-based crisis intervention ('Homebuilders' model for crisis intervention). Young people receiving home-based MST experienced some improved functioning in terms of externalising symptoms and they spent fewer days out of school and out-of-home placement. At short term follow up the control group had a greater improvement in terms of adaptability and cohesion; this was not sustained at four months follow up. There were small, significant patient improvements reported in both groups in the trial evaluating the intensive home-based crisis intervention using the 'Homebuilders' model. No differences at follow up were reported in the two trials evaluating intensive home treatment, or in the trials evaluating specialist outpatient services., Authors' conclusions, The quality of the evidence base currently provides very little guidance for the development of services. If randomised controlled trials are not feasible then consideration should be given to alternative study designs, such as prospective systems of audit conducted across several centres, as this has the potential to improve the current level of evidence. These studies should include baseline measurement at admission along with demographic data, and outcomes measured using a few standardised robust instruments.","Sasha Shepperd, Helen Doll, Simon Gowers, Anthony James, Mina Fazel, Ray Fitzpatrick, Jon Pollock (2009).

907,"Background, Admission avoidance hospital at home provides active treatment by healthcare professionals in the patient's home for a condition that otherwise would require acute hospital inpatient care, and always for a limited time period. This is the third update of the original review., Objectives, To determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with admission avoidance hospital at home compared with inpatient hospital care., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, two other databases, and two trials registers on 2 March 2016. We checked the reference lists of eligible articles. We sought unpublished studies by contacting providers and researchers who were known to be involved in the field., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials recruiting participants aged 18 years and over. Studies comparing admission avoidance hospital at home with acute hospital inpatient care., Data collection and analysis, We followed the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. We performed meta-analysis for trials that compared similar interventions and reported comparable outcomes with sufficient data, requested individual patient data from trialists, and relied on published data when this was not available. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for the most important outcomes., Main results, We included 16 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1814 participants; three trials recruited participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, two trials recruited participants recovering from a stroke, six trials recruited participants with an acute medical condition who were mainly elderly, and the remaining trials recruited participants with a mix of conditions. We assessed the majority of the included studies as at low risk of selection, detection, and attrition bias, and unclear for selective reporting and performance bias. Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little or no difference on mortality at six months' follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.99; P = 0.04; I(superscript 2) = 0%; 912 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), little or no difference on the likelihood of being transferred (or readmitted) to hospital (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; P = 0.84; I(superscript 2) = 28%; 834 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce the likelihood of living in residential care at six months' follow-up (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.57; P < 0.0001; I(superscript 2) = 78%; 727 participants; low-certainty evidence). Satisfaction with healthcare received may be improved with admission avoidance hospital at home (646 participants, low-certainty evidence); few studies reported the effect on caregivers. When the costs of informal care were excluded, admission avoidance hospital at home may be less expensive than admission to an acute hospital ward (287 participants, low-certainty evidence); there was variation in the reduction of hospital length of stay, estimates ranged from a mean difference of -8.09 days (95% CI -14.34 to -1.85) in a trial recruiting older people with varied health problems, to a mean increase of 15.90 days (95% CI 8.10 to 23.70) in a study that recruited patients recovering from a stroke., Authors' conclusions, Admission avoidance hospital at home, with the option of transfer to hospital, may provide an effective alternative to inpatient care for a select group of elderly patients requiring hospital admission. However, the evidence is limited by the small randomised controlled trials included in the review, which adds a degree of imprecision to the results for the main outcomes.","Sasha Shepperd, Steve Iliffe, Helen A.

909,"Background, Many people with severe mental illness (SMI) have siblings. Siblings are often both natural agents to promote service users' recovery and vulnerable to mental ill health due to the negative impact of psychosis within the family. Despite a wealth of research evidence supporting the effectiveness of psychoeducation for service users with SMI and their family members, in reducing relapse and promoting compliance with treatment, siblings remain relatively invisible in clinical service settings as well as in research studies. If psychoeducational interventions target siblings and improve siblings' knowledge, coping with caring and overall wellbeing, they could potentially provide a cost-effective option for supporting siblings with resulting benefits for service users' outcomes., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of psychoeducation compared with usual care or any other intervention in promoting wellbeing and reducing distress of siblings of people affected by SMI., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and screened the reference lists of relevant reports and reviews (12th November 2013). We contacted trial authors for unpublished and specific data on siblings' outcomes., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised controlled trials focusing on psychoeducational interventions targeting siblings of all ages (on their own or amongst other family members including service users) of individuals with SMI, using any means and formats of delivery, i.e. individual (family), groups, computer-based., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened the abstracts and extracted data and two other authors independently checked the screening and extraction process. We contacted authors of trials to ascertain siblings' participation in the trials and seek sibling-specific data in those studies where siblings' data were grouped together with other participants' (most commonly other family members'/carers') outcomes. We calculated the risk difference (RD), its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. We presented continuous data using the mean difference statistic (MD) and 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for the included study and rated quality of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)., Main results, We found 14 studies that included siblings amongst other family members in receipt of psychoeducational interventions. However, we were only able to include one small trial with relevant and available data (n = 9 siblings out of n = 84 family member/carer-participants) comparing psychoeducational intervention with standard care in a community care setting, over a duration of 21 months. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of psychoeducational interventions compared with standard care on 'siblings' quality of life' (n = 9, MD score 3.80 95% CI -0.26 to 7.86, low quality of evidence), coping with (family) burden (n = 9, MD -8.80 95% CI -15.22 to -2.34, low quality of evidence). No sibling left the study early by one year (n = 9, RD 0.00 CI -0.34 to 0.34, low quality of evidence). Low quality and insufficient evidence meant we were unable to determine the effects of psychoeducational interventions compared with standard care on service users' global mental state (n = 9, MD -0.60 CI -3.54 to 2.38, low quality of evidence), their frequency of re-hospitalisation (n = 9, MD -0.70 CI -2.46 to 1.06, low quality of evidence) or duration of inpatient stay (n = 9, MD -2.60 CI -6.34 to 1.14, low quality of evidence), whether their siblings received psychoeducation or not. No study data were available to address the other primary outcomes: 'siblings' psychosocial wellbeing', 'siblings' distress' and adverse effects., Authors' conclusions, Most studies evaluating psychoeducational interventions recruited siblings along with other family members. However, the proportion of siblings in these studies was low and outcomes for siblings were not reported independently from those of other type","Jacqueline Sin, Cheryl D. Jordan, Elizabeth A.

910,"Background, Increasing evidence indicates that individuals who develop severe mental illness (SMI) are also vulnerable to developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), due to increased risk of exposure to traumatic events and social adversity. The effectiveness of trauma-focused psychological interventions (TFPIs) for PTSD in the general population is well-established. TFPIs involve identifying and changing unhelpful beliefs about traumatic experiences, processing of traumatic memories, and developing new ways of responding to cues associated with trauma. Little is known about the potential feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of TFPIs for individuals who have a SMI and PTSD., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological interventions for PTSD symptoms or other symptoms of psychological distress arising from trauma in people with SMI., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Study-Based Register (up until March 10, 2016), screened reference lists of relevant reports and reviews, and contacted trial authors for unpublished and/or specific outcome data., Selection criteria, We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated TFPIs for people with SMI and PTSD, and reported useable data., Data collection and analysis, Three review authors (DS, MF, IN) independently screened the titles and abstracts of all references identified, and read short-listed full text papers. We assessed risk of bias in each case. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous data, on an intention-to-treat basis. We assessed quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and created 'Summary of findings' tables., Main results, Four trials involving a total of 300 adults with SMI and PTSD are included. These trials evaluated three active intervention therapies: trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), and brief psychoeducation for PTSD, all delivered via individual sessions. Our main outcomes of interest were PTSD symptoms, quality of life/well-being, symptoms of co-morbid psychosis, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, adverse events and health economic outcomes., Authors' conclusions, Very few trials have investigated TFPIs for individuals with SMI and PTSD. Results from trials of TF-CBT are limited and inconclusive regarding its effectiveness on PTSD, or on psychotic symptoms or other symptoms of psychological distress. Only one trial evaluated EMDR and provided limited preliminary evidence favouring EMDR compared to waiting list. Comparing TF-CBT head-to-head with EMDR and brief psychoeducation respectively, showed no clear effect for either therapy. Both TF-CBT and EMDR do not appear to cause more (or less) adverse effects, compared to waiting list or usual care; these findings however, are mostly based on low to very low-quality evidence. Further larger scale trials are now needed to provide high-quality evidence to confirm or refute these preliminary findings, and to establish which intervention modalities and techniques are associated with improved outcomes, especially in the long term.","Jacqueline Sin, Debbie Spain, Marie Furuta, Trevor Murrells, Ian Norman (2017).

912,"Background, Antipsychotic medication remains the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and has been in use for a long time. As evidenced by ongoing research and partial effectiveness of the antipsychotics on cognitive and negative symptoms, the search is on for drugs that may improve these domains of functioning for someone suffering from schizophrenia. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have long been in use for treating cognitive symptoms of dementia., Objectives, The aim of the review was to evaluate the clinical effects, safety and cost effectiveness of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for treating people with schizophrenia, Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2009), and inspected the references of all identified studies for further trials., Selection criteria, We included all clinical randomised trials comparing acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with antipsychotics or placebo either alone, or in combination, for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis based on a random-effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random-effects model., Main results, The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor plus antipsychotic showed benefit over antipsychotic and placebo in the following outcomes., Authors' conclusions, The results seem to favour the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in combination with antipsychotics on a few domains of mental state and cognition, but because of the various limitations in the studies as mentioned in the main text, the evidence is weak. This review highlights the need for large, independent, well designed, conducted and reported pragmatic randomised studies.","Jasvinder Singh, Kamalpreet Kour, Mahesh B. Jayaram (2012).

913,"Background, We performed a systematic review, a standard meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA), which updates the 2009 Cochrane Overview, 'Biologics for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)'. This review is focused on biologic monotherapy in people with RA in whom treatment with traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX) had failed (MTX/other DMARD-experienced)., Objectives, To assess the benefits and harms of biologic monotherapy (includes anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab) or non-TNF (abatacept, anakinra, rituximab, tocilizumab)) or tofacitinib monotherapy (oral small molecule) versus comparator (placebo or MTX/other DMARDs) in adults with RA who were MTX/other DMARD-experienced., Methods, We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 6, June), MEDLINE (via OVID 1946 to June 2015), and Embase (via OVID 1947 to June 2015). Article selection, data extraction and risk of bias and GRADE assessments were done in duplicate. We calculated direct estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using standard meta-analysis. We used a Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons (MTC) approach for NMA estimates with 95% credible intervals (CrI). We converted odds ratios (OR) to risk ratios (RR) for ease of understanding. We calculated absolute measures as risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB)., Main results, This update includes 40 new RCTs for a total of 46 RCTs, of which 41 studies with 14,049 participants provided data. The comparator was placebo in 16 RCTs (4,532 patients), MTX or other DMARD in 13 RCTs (5,602 patients), and another biologic in 12 RCTs (3,915 patients)., Authors' conclusions, Based mostly on RCTs of six to 12-month duration in people with RA who had previously experienced and failed treatment with MTX/other DMARDs, biologic monotherapy improved ACR50, function and RA remission rates compared to placebo or MTX/other DMARDs.","Jasvinder A.

914,"Background, Impairment of vision is associated with a loss of function in activities of daily living. Avoidance of physical activity and consequent reduced functional capacity is common in older people with visual impairment and an important risk factor for falls. Indeed, the rate of falls and fractures is higher in older people with visual impairment than age-matched visually normal older people. Depression and anxiety is common in older people with vision impairment and leads to further restriction of activity, reduced social contact and reduced quality of life. Possible mechanisms to reduce activity restriction and therefore improve mobility and activity include environmental and behavioural interventions delivered by a number of health professionals, including occupational therapists., Objectives, The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of environmental and behavioural interventions in reducing activity limitation and improving quality of life amongst visually impaired older people., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, (January 1950 to November 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2012), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (January 1937 to November 2012), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (January 1985 to November 2012), OT Seeker (inception to November 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (), ClinicalTrials.gov () and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 9 November 2012., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (Q-RCTs) that compared environmental interventions, behavioural interventions or both, versus control (placebo control or no intervention or usual care), and trials comparing different types of environmental or behavioural interventions, in older people (aged 60 and over) with irreversible visual impairment living independently or in residential settings. To be eligible for inclusion the primary aim of studies must be reducing physical activity limitation and must include a measure of physical activity. Secondary outcome measures included falls, fear of falling, quality of life., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently read abstracts retrieved by the search to identify eligibility and study quality. We contacted study authors for additional information., Main results, Our searches found no RCTs or Q-RCTs that met the eligibility criteria for this review., Authors' conclusions, We are unable to reach any conclusion about the effectiveness of environmental or behavioural interventions for reducing physical activity limitation in community-dwelling visually impaired older people, as no eligible studies were found. However a number of studies reviewed included only the secondary outcome measures of this review. Although behavioural interventions delivered by occupational therapists have been shown to reduce the rate of falls, we are unable to conclude if this is due to reduced activity restriction (increased mobility) or reduced activity (lessening exposure to risk). There are inconclusive and conflicting results from trials evaluating the effectiveness of behavioural and environmental interventions aimed at improving quality of life. Further research is necessary (such as ongoing Dutch and UK trials considering the effectiveness of orientation and mobility training on activity restriction, physical activity, falls, fear of falling and quality of life in older adults with low vision, and the effect of an occupational therapist delivering home safety modification, coping strategies and exercise with older people with low vision) before any conclusions can be reached.","Dawn A.

We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings and searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Trial register. We contacted experts to obtain unpublished data., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cross-over designs) that investigated the effect of any person-directed, non-pharmacological intervention on sleepiness on-shift or sleep length and sleep quality off-shift in shift workers who also work nights., Data collection and analysis, At least two authors screened titles and abstracts for relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors to obtain missing information. We conducted meta-analyses when pooling of studies was possible., Main results, We included 17 relevant trials (with 556 review-relevant participants) which we categorised into three types of interventions: (1) various exposures to bright light (n = 10); (2) various opportunities for napping (n = 4); and (3) other interventions, such as physical exercise or sleep education (n = 3). In most instances, the studies were too heterogeneous to pool. Most of the comparisons yielded low to very low quality evidence. Only one comparison provided moderate quality evidence. Overall, the included studies' results were inconclusive. We present the results regarding sleepiness below., Authors' conclusions, Given the methodological diversity of the included studies, in terms of interventions, settings, and assessment tools, their limited reporting and the very low to low quality of the evidence they present, it is not possible to determine whether shift workers' sleepiness can be reduced or if their sleep length or quality can be improved with these interventions.","Tracy E.

916,"Background, In national surveys, between 10% and 34% of women have reported being physically assaulted by an intimate male partner. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or programmes including elements of CBT are frequently used treatments for physically abusive men. Participants either enrol voluntarily or are obliged to participate by means of a court order. CBT not only seeks to change behaviour using established behavioural strategies, but also targets thinking patterns and beliefs., Objectives, To measure effectiveness of CBT and programmes including elements of CBT on men's physical abuse of their female partners., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2009), C2-SPECTR (2006), MEDLINE (1950 to 1 January 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2009 week 53), CINAHL (1982 to December 2009), PsycINFO (1806 to week 4, December 2009), ERIC (1966 to December 2009), Social Care Online, previously CareData (13 January 2010), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to December 2009), Criminal Justice Abstracts (2003), Bibliography of Nordic Criminology (13 January 2010), and SIGLE (2003). We also contacted field experts and the authors of included studies., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for men who have physically abused their female partner and included a measure of the impact on violence., Data collection and analysis, Two reviewers independently assessed references for possible inclusion, extracted data using an online data extraction form and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information., Main results, Six trials, all from the USA, involving 2343 participants, were included. A meta-analysis of four trials comparing CBT with a no-intervention control (1771 participants) reported that the relative risk of violence was 0.86 (favouring the intervention group) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.54 to 1.38. This is a small effect size, and the width of the CI suggests no clear evidence for an effect. One study (Wisconsin Study) compared CBT with process-psychodynamic group treatment and reported a relative risk of new violence of 1.07 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.68). Even though the process-psychodynamic treatment did marginally better than CBT, this result is equivocal. Finally, one small study (N = 64) compared a combined CBT treatment for substance abuse and domestic violence (SADV) with a Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) group. An analysis involving 58 participants investigated the effect on reduction in frequency of physical violence episodes. The effect size was 0.30 (favouring TSF) with 95% CI from -0.22 to 0.81., Authors' conclusions, There are still too few randomised controlled trials to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy for male perpetrators of domestic violence.","Geir Smedslund, Therese K.

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) evaluating the effectiveness of shared care interventions for people with chronic conditions in primary care and community settings. The intervention was compared with usual care in that setting., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies, evaluated study quality and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We conducted a meta-analysis of results when possible and carried out a narrative synthesis of the remainder of the results. We presented the results in a 'Summary of findings' table, using a tabular format to show effect sizes for all outcome types., Main results, We identified 42 studies of shared care interventions for chronic disease management (N = 18,859), 39 of which were RCTs, two CBAs and one an NRCT. Of these 42 studies, 41 examined complex multi-faceted interventions and lasted from six to 24 months. Overall, our confidence in results regarding the effectiveness of interventions ranged from moderate to high certainty. Results showed probably few or no differences in clinical outcomes overall with a tendency towards improved blood pressure management in the small number of studies on shared care for hypertension, chronic kidney disease and stroke (mean difference (MD) 3.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68 to 5.25)(based on moderate-certainty evidence). Mental health outcomes improved, particularly in response to depression treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.62; six studies, N = 1708) and recovery from depression (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.57 to 4.26; 10 studies, N = 4482) in studies examining the 'stepped care' design of shared care interventions (based on high-certainty evidence). Investigators noted modest effects on mean depression scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.29, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.20; six studies, N = 3250). Differences in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), processes of care and participation and default rates in shared care services were probably limited (based on moderate-certainty evidence). Studies probably showed little or no difference in hospital admissions, service utilisation and patient health behaviours (with evidence of moderate certainty)., Authors' conclusions, This review suggests that shared care improves depression outcomes and probably has mixed or limited effects on other outcomes. Methodological shortcomings, particularly inadequate length of follow-up, may account in part for these limited effects. Review findings support the growing evidence base for shared care in the management of depression, particularly stepped care models of shared care. Shared care interventions for other conditions should be developed within research settings, with account taken of the complexity of such interventions and awareness of the need to carry out longer studies to test effectiveness and sustainability over time.","Susan M.

918,"Background, Many people with chronic disease have more than one chronic condition, which is referred to as multimorbidity. The term comorbidity is also used but this is now taken to mean that there is a defined index condition with other linked conditions, for example diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is also used when there are combinations of defined conditions that commonly co-exist, for example diabetes and depression. While this is not a new phenomenon, there is greater recognition of its impact and the importance of improving outcomes for individuals affected. Research in the area to date has focused mainly on descriptive epidemiology and impact assessment. There has been limited exploration of the effectiveness of interventions to improve outcomes for people with multimorbidity., Objectives, To determine the effectiveness of health-service or patient-oriented interventions designed to improve outcomes in people with multimorbidity in primary care and community settings. Multimorbidity was defined as two or more chronic conditions in the same individual., Search methods, We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and seven other databases to 28 September 2015. We also searched grey literature and consulted experts in the field for completed or ongoing studies., Selection criteria, Two review authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised clinical trials (NRCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) evaluating interventions to improve outcomes for people with multimorbidity in primary care and community settings. Multimorbidity was defined as two or more chronic conditions in the same individual. This includes studies where participants can have combinations of any condition or have combinations of pre-specified common conditions (comorbidity), for example, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The comparison was usual care as delivered in that setting., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies, evaluated study quality, and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We conducted a meta-analysis of the results where possible and carried out a narrative synthesis for the remainder of the results. We present the results in a 'Summary of findings' table and tabular format to show effect sizes across all outcome types., Main results, We identified 18 RCTs examining a range of complex interventions for people with multimorbidity. Nine studies focused on defined comorbid conditions with an emphasis on depression, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The remaining studies focused on multimorbidity, generally in older people. In 12 studies, the predominant intervention element was a change to the organisation of care delivery, usually through case management or enhanced multidisciplinary team work. In six studies, the interventions were predominantly patient-oriented, for example, educational or self-management support-type interventions delivered directly to participants. Overall our confidence in the results regarding the effectiveness of interventions ranged from low to high certainty. There was little or no difference in clinical outcomes (based on moderate certainty evidence). Mental health outcomes improved (based on high certainty evidence) and there were modest reductions in mean depression scores for the comorbidity studies that targeted participants with depression (standardized mean difference (SMD) -2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.52 to -1.95). There was probably a small improvement in patient-reported outcomes (moderate certainty evidence) although two studies that specifically targeted functional difficulties in participants had positive effects on functional outcomes with one of these studies also reporting a reduction in mortality at four year follow-up (Int 6%, Con 13%, absolute difference 7%). The intervention may make little or no difference to health service use (low certainty evi","Susan M. Smith, Emma Wallace, Tom O'Dowd, Martin Fortin (2017).

919,"Background, Hip fracture is a major fall-related injury which causes significant problems for individuals, their family and carers. Over 40% of people with hip fracture have dementia or cognitive impairment, and their outcomes after surgery are poorer than those without dementia. It is not clear which care and rehabilitation interventions achieve the best outcomes for these people., Objectives, (a) To assess the effectiveness of models of care including enhanced rehabilitation strategies designed specifically for people with dementia following hip fracture surgery compared to usual care., Search methods, We searched ALOIS (), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, up to and including week 1 June 2014 using the terms hip OR fracture OR surgery OR operation OR femur OR femoral., Selection criteria, We include randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness for people with dementia of any model of enhanced care and rehabilitation following hip fracture surgery compared to usual care., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors working independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We synthesised data only if we considered studies sufficiently homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions and outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence for each outcome., Main results, We included five trials with a total of 316 participants. Four trials evaluated models of enhanced interdisciplinary rehabilitation and care, two of these for inpatients only and two for inpatients and at home after discharge. All were compared with usual rehabilitation and care in the trial settings. The fifth trial compared outcomes of geriatrician-led care in hospital to conventional care led by the orthopaedic team. All papers analysed subgroups of people with dementia/cognitive impairment from larger RCTs of older people following hip fracture. Trial follow-up periods ranged from acute hospital discharge to 24 months post-discharge., Authors' conclusions, There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about how effective the models of enhanced rehabilitation and care after hip fracture used in these trials are for people with dementia above active usual care. The current evidence base derives from a small number of studies with quality limitations. This should be addressed as a research priority to determine the optimal strategies to improve outcomes for this growing population of patients.","Toby O. Smith, Yasir A. Hameed, Jane L.

920,"Background, Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common orthopaedic operations performed worldwide. Painful osteoarthritis of the hip is the primary indication for THA. Following THA, people have conventionally been provided with equipment, such as raised toilet seats and chairs, and educated to avoid activities that could cause the hip joint to be in a position of flexion over 90 degrees, or adduction or rotation past the midline. These aspects of occupational therapy have been advocated to reduce the risks of prosthesis dislocation. However, the appropriateness of these recommendations has been questioned., Objectives, To assess the effects of provision of assistive devices, education on hip precautions, environmental modifications and training in activities of daily living (ADL) and extended ADL (EADL) for people undergoing THA., Search methods, We searched MEDLINE (1946 to April 2016), EMBASE (1947 to April 2016), the Cochrane Library including CENTRAL (Issue 4 of 12, 2016), Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Economic Evaluations Database (EED), CINAHL, PEDro and CIRRIE from inception to April 2016. In addition we checked Controlled Clinical Trials, Clinicaltrials.gov, the National Institutes of Health Trial Registry, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and the OpenGrey database from inception to April 2016., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of the provision of assistive devices, education on hip precautions, environmental modifications, or training in ADL and EADL for people undergoing THA. The main outcomes of interest were pain, function, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), global assessment of treatment success, reoperation rate, hip dislocation and adverse events., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures recognised by Cochrane. We conducted a systematic literature search using several databases and contacted corresponding authors, appraised the evidence using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, analysed the data using a narrative analysis approach (as it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in interventions), and interpreted all outcomes using the GRADE approach., Main results, We included three trials with a total of 492 participants who had received 530 THA. The evidence presented with a high risk of performance, detection and reporting bias., Authors' conclusions, Very low quality evidence is available from single trials, thus we are uncertain if hip precautions with or without the addition of equipment and functional restrictions are effective in preventing dislocation and improving outcomes after THA. There is also insufficient evidence to support or refute the adoption of a postoperative community rehabilitation programme consisting of functional reintegration and education compared to conventional rehabilitation strategies based on functional outcomes.","Toby O.

922,"Background, Obsessive compulsive disorder is a common and disabling disorder. A significant proportion of patients manifest a chronic course. Individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in this condition. Previous systematic reviews or meta-analyses summarising the evidence are methodologically problematic or limited in the scope of their analysis., Objectives, To examine the efficacy and adverse effects of serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus placebo for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in adults., Search strategy, CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 12/11/2007. Reference lists were checked. Experts in the field were contacted., Selection criteria, All RCTs and quasi-RCTs examining the efficacy of SSRIs compared with placebo for OCD in adults were eligible for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, Selection of studies and data extraction were carried out by two review authors independently, and quality assessment of studies was undertaken. Data analysis was conducted using Review Manager software. Summary measures were produced using the weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data and relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). SSRIs were examined as an overall group of drugs, and as individual drugs., Main results, Seventeen studies were included in the review, involving 3097 participants. Based on all 17 studies, SSRIs as a group were more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of OCD between 6 and 13 weeks post-treatment, measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) (WMD -3.21, 95% CI -3.84 to -2.57). The WMD for individual SSRI drugs were similar and not statistically different. Based on 13 studies (2697 participants), SSRIs were more effective than placebo in achieving clinical response at post-treatment (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.17). The pooled RR was shown to be similar between individual SSRI drugs. Although reported adverse effects data were more limited, with few exceptions, the overall and individual adverse effects for the different SSRIs were always worse than for placebo and, in the majority of cases, the difference was statistically significant. Nausea, headache and insomnia were always reported amongst the most common adverse effects in trials of each of the drugs., Authors' conclusions, SSRIs are more effective than placebo for OCD, at least in the short-term, although there are differences between the adverse effects of individual SSRI drugs. The longer term efficacy and tolerability of different SSRI drugs for OCD has yet to be established.","Mustafa G. Soomro, Douglas G. Altman, Sundararajan Rajagopal, Mark Oakley Browne (2009).

924,"Background, For persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the physical, personal, familial, social and vocational consequences are extensive. Occupational therapy (OT), with the aim to facilitate task performance and to decrease the consequences of rheumatoid arthritis for daily life activities, is considered to be a cornerstone in the management of rheumatoid arthritis. Till now the efficacy of occupational therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis on functional performance and social participation has not been systematically reviewed., Objectives, To determine whether OT interventions (classified as comprehensive therapy, training of motor function, training of skills, instruction on joint protection and energy conservation, counseling, instruction about assistive devices and provision of splints) for rheumatoid arthritis patients improve outcome on functional ability, social participation and/or health related quality of life., Search strategy, Relevant full length articles were identified by electronic searches in Medline, Cinahl, Embase, Amed, Scisearch and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal group Specialised Register. The reference list of identified studies and reviews were examined for additional references. Date of last search: December 2002., Selection criteria, Controlled (randomized and non-randomized) and other than controlled studies (OD) addressing OT for RA patients were eligible for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, The methodological quality of the included trials was independently assessed by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. A list proposed by Van Tulder et al. () was used to assess the methodological quality. For outcome measures, standardized mean differences were calculated. The results were analysed using a best evidence synthesis based on type of design, methodological quality and the significant findings of outcome and/or process measures., Main results, Thirty-eight out of 58 identified occupational therapy studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Six controlled studies had a high methodological quality. Given the methodological constraints of uncontrolled studies, nine of these studies were judged to be of sufficient methodological quality. The results of the best evidence synthesis shows that there is strong evidence for the efficacy of 'instruction on joint protection' (an absolute benefit of 17.5 to 22.5, relative benefit of 100%) and that limited evidence exists for comprehensive occupational therapy in improving functional ability (an absolute benefit of 8.7, relative benefit of 20%). Indicative findings for evidence that 'provision of splints' decreases pain are found (absolute benefit of 1.0, relative benefit of 19%)., Authors' conclusions, There is evidence that occupational therapy has a positive effect on functional ability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","E.

This is an update of a review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2006., Objectives, To assess the effects of psychological interventions for borderline personality disorder (BPD)., Search methods, We searched the following databases: CENTRAL 2010(3), MEDLINE (1950 to October 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010, week 39), ASSIA (1987 to November 2010), BIOSIS (1985 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), Dissertation Abstracts International (31 January 2011), National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts (15 October 2010), PsycINFO (1872 to October Week 1 2010), Science Citation Index (1970 to 10 October 2010), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 10 October 2010), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to October 2010), ZETOC (15 October 2010) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (15 October 2010). In addition, we searched Dissertation Abstracts International in January 2011 and ICTRP in August 2011., Selection criteria, Randomised studies with samples of patients with BPD comparing a specific psychotherapeutic intervention against a control intervention without any specific mode of action or against a comparative specific psychotherapeutic intervention. Outcomes included overall BPD severity, BPD symptoms (DSM-IV criteria), psychopathology associated with but not specific to BPD, attrition and adverse effects., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data., Main results, Twenty-eight studies involving a total of 1804 participants with BPD were included. Interventions were classified as comprehensive psychotherapies if they included individual psychotherapy as a substantial part of the treatment programme, or as non-comprehensive if they did not., Authors' conclusions, There are indications of beneficial effects for both comprehensive psychotherapies as well as non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions for BPD core pathology and associated general psychopathology. DBT has been studied most intensely, followed by MBT, TFP, SFT and STEPPS. However, none of the treatments has a very robust evidence base, and there are some concerns regarding the quality of individual studies. Overall, the findings support a substantial role for psychotherapy in the treatment of people with BPD but clearly indicate a need for replicatory studies.","Jutta M. Stoffers-Winterling, Birgit A.

926,"Background, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, they are hyperactive and impulsive., Objectives, To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD., Search methods, In February 2015 we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events, general behaviour and quality of life., Data collection and analysis, Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks. We used standard methodological procedures expected within Cochrane. Data from parallel-group trials and first period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses; separate analyses were undertaken using post-cross-over data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity and publication bias., Main results, The studies. We included 38 parallel-group trials (5111 participants randomised) and 147 cross-over trials (7134 participants randomised). Participants included individuals of both sexes, at a boys-to-girls ratio of 5:1, and participants' ages ranged from 3 to 18 years across most studies (in two studies ages ranged from 3 to 21 years). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. Most participants were from high-income countries., Authors' conclusions, The results of meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate may improve teacher-reported ADHD symptoms, teacher-reported general behaviour, and parent-reported quality of life among children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. However, the low quality of the underpinning evidence means that we cannot be certain of the magnitude of the effects. Within the short follow-up periods typical of the included trials, there is some evidence that methylphenidate is associated with increased risk of non-serious adverse events, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite, but no evidence that it increases risk of serious adverse events.","Jakob Ole Storebo, Erica Ramstad, B.

927,"Background, Children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently present with inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, which are the cardinal symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The effectiveness of methylphenidate, a commonly used ADHD treatment, is therefore of interest in these children., Objectives, To assess the effects of methylphenidate for symptoms of ADHD (inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity) and ASD (impairments in social interaction and communication, and repetitive, restricted or stereotypical behaviours) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years with ASD., Search methods, In November 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 11 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors and pharmaceutical companies., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of methylphenidate versus placebo on the core symptoms of ASD or ADHD-like symptoms, or both, in children aged 6 to 18 years who were diagnosed with ASD or pervasive developmental disorder. The primary outcome was clinical efficacy, defined as an improvement in ADHD-like symptoms (inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity) and in the core symptoms of ASD (impaired social interaction, impaired communication, and stereotypical behaviours), and overall ASD. Secondary outcomes examined were: rate of adverse events; caregiver well-being; need for institutionalisation, special schooling or therapy to achieve learning outcomes; and overall quality of life., Data collection and analysis, We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We combined outcome measures that used different psychometric scales, where clinically appropriate. We used a coefficient of 0.6 to calculate standard deviations and adjust for the studies' cross-over design. We considered a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.52 as the minimum clinically relevant inter-treatment difference. We applied the GRADE rating for strength of evidence for each outcome., Main results, The studies: we included four cross-over studies, with a total of 113 children aged 5 to 13 years, most of whom (83%) were boys. We included two studies with five-year-old children since we were unable to obtain the disaggregated data for those aged six years and above, and all other participants were in our target age range. All participants resided in the USA. The duration of treatment in the cross-over phase was one week for each dose of methylphenidate. Studies used a range of outcome scales, rated by parents, teachers or both; clinicians; or programme staff. We report parent-rated outcomes separately., Authors' conclusions, We found that short-term use of methylphenidate might improve symptoms of hyperactivity and possibly inattention in children with ASD who are tolerant of the medication, although the low quality of evidence means that we cannot be certain of the true magnitude of any effect. There was no evidence that methylphenidate has a negative impact on the core symptoms of ASD, or that it improves social interaction, stereotypical behaviours, or overall ASD. The evidence for adverse events is of very low quality because trials were short and excluded children intolerant of methylphenidate in the test-dose phase. Future RCTs should consider extending the duration of treatment and follow-up. The minimum clinically important difference also needs to be confirmed in children with ASD using outcome scales validated for this population.","Nancy Sturman, Laura Deckx, Mieke L. van Driel (2017).

Reference lists of relevant papers and major textbooks of affective disorders were checked. Experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted regarding unpublished material., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials that compared treatment with folic acid or 5'-methyltetrahydrofolic acid to an alternative treatment, whether another antidepressant medication or placebo, for patients with a diagnosis of depressive disorder (diagnosed according to explicit criteria)., Data collection and analysis, Data were independently extracted from the original reports by two reviewers. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager version 4.1., Main results, Three trials involving 247 people were included. Two studies involving 151 people assessed the use of folate in addition to other treatment, and found that adding folate reduced Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores on average by a further 2.65 points (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 4.93). Fewer patients treated with folate experienced a reduction in their HDRS score of less than 50% at ten weeks (relative risk (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.92) The number needed to treat with folate for one additional person to experience a 50% reduction on this scale was 5 (95% confidence interval 4 to 33). One study involving 96 people assessed the use of folate instead of the antidepressant trazodone and did not find a significant benefit from the use of folate. The trials identified did not find evidence of any problems with the acceptability or safety of folate., Authors' conclusions, The limited available evidence suggests folate may have a potential role as a supplement to other treatment for depression. It is currently unclear if this is the case both for people with normal folate levels, and for those with folate deficiency.","Matthew J. Taylor, Stuart M. Carney, John Geddes, Guy Goodwin (2009).

For both review stages (original and update), we searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Trial's register (May 2006 and January 2015); the Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 1); PubMed (1996 to January 2015); EMBASE (1996 to January 2015); and CINAHL (1982 to January 2015)., Selection criteria, We included randomized controlled trials comparing any psychosocial intervention vs. a control intervention that could include pharmacological treatment, such as methadone maintenance, a different psychosocial intervention, counselling, prenatal care, STD counselling and testing, transportation, or childcare., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We performed analyses based on three comparisons: any psychosocial intervention vs. control, contingency management (CM) interventions vs. control, and motivational interviewing based (MIB) interventions vs. control., Main results, In total, we included 14 studies with 1298 participants: nine studies (704 participants) compared CM vs. control, and five studies (594 participants) compared MIB interventions vs. control. We did not find any studies that assessed other types of psychosocial interventions. For the most part, it was unclear if included studies adequately controlled for biases within their studies as such information was not often reported. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies relating to participant selection, allocation concealment, personnel and outcome assessor blinding, and attrition., Authors' conclusions, The present evidence suggests that there is no difference in treatment outcomes to address drug use in pregnant women with use of psychosocial interventions, when taken in the presence of other comprehensive care options. However, few studies evaluated obstetrical or neonatal outcomes and rarely did so in a systematic way, making it difficult to assess the effect of psychosocial interventions on these clinically important outcomes. It is important to develop a better evidence base to evaluate psychosocial modalities of treatment in this important population.","Mishka Terplan, Shaalini Ramanadhan, Abigail Locke, Nyaradzo Longinaker, Steve Lui (2015).

932,"Background, Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves the induction of a seizure for therapeutic purposes by the administration of a variable frequency electrical stimulus shock via electrodes applied to the scalp. The effects of its use in people with schizophrenia are unclear., Objectives, To determine whether electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) results in clinically meaningful benefit with regard to global improvement, hospitalisation, changes in mental state, behaviour and functioning for people with schizophrenia, and to determine whether variations in the practical administration of ECT influences outcome., Search strategy, We undertook electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982-1996), EMBASE (1980-1996), MEDLINE (1966-2004), PsycLIT (1974-1996),SCISEARCH (1996) and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (July 2004). We also inspected the references of all identified studies and contacted relevant authors., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled clinical trials that compared ECT with placebo, 'sham ECT', non-pharmacological interventions and antipsychotics and different schedules and methods of administration of ECT for people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or chronic mental disorder., Data collection and analysis, Working independently, we selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Where possible and appropriate we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) with the number needed to treat (NNT). For continuous data Weighted Mean Differences (WMD) were calculated. We presented scale data for only those tools that had attained pre-specified levels of quality. We also undertook tests for heterogeneity and publication bias., Main results, This review includes 26 trials with 50 reports. When ECT is compared with placebo or sham ECT, more people improved in the real ECT group (n=392, 10 RCTs, RR 0.76 random CI 0.59 to 0.98, NNT 6 CI 4 to 12) and though data were heterogeneous (chi-square 17.49 df=9 P=0.04), its impact on variability of data was not substantial (I-squared 48.5%). There was a suggestion that ECT resulted in less relapses in the short term than sham ECT (n=47, 2 RCTs, RR fixed 0.26 CI 0.03 to 2.2), and a greater likelihood of being discharged from hospital (n=98, 1 RCT, RR fixed 0.59, CI 0.34 to 1.01). There is no evidence that this early advantage for ECT is maintained over the medium to long term. People treated with ECT did not drop out of treatment earlier than those treated with sham ECT (n=495, 14 RCTs, RR fixed 0.71 CI 0.33 to 1.52, I-squared 0%). Very limited data indicated that visual memory might decline after ECT compared with sham ECT (n=24, 1 RCT, WMD -14.0 CI -23 to -5); the results of verbal memory tests were equivocal., Authors' conclusions, The evidence in this review suggests that ECT, combined with treatment with antipsychotic drugs, may be considered an option for people with schizophrenia, particularly when rapid global improvement and reduction of symptoms is desired. This is also the case for those with schizophrenia who show limited response to medication alone. Even though this initial beneficial effect may not last beyond the short term, there is no clear evidence to refute its use for people with schizophrenia. The research base for the use of ECT in people with schizophrenia continues to expand, but even after more than five decades of clinical use, there remain many unanswered questions regarding its role in the management of people with schizophrenia.","Prathap Tharyan, Clive E.

933,"Background, The unpredictable, variable nature of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and the possibility of increasing disability, means that a diagnosis can have substantial psychological consequences., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions for people with MS., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane MS Group Specialised Register (December 2004), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004 ), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2004), PsychINFO (January 1887 to December 2004), CINAHL (January 1982 to December 2004) and 14 others. We searched reference lists of articles, wrote to corresponding authors of the 13 papers identified by June 2004, and searched for trials in progress using 3 research registers., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of interventions described as wholly or mostly based on psychological theory and practice, in people with MS. Primary outcome measures were disease specific and general quality of life, psychiatric symptoms, psychological functioning, disability, and cognitive outcomes. Secondary outcome measures were number of relapses, pain, fatigue, health care utilisation, changes in medication, and adherence to other therapies., Data collection and analysis, Pertinent studies were identified from abstracts by one author. Full papers were independently compared to selection criteria by four authors. Key details were extracted from relevant papers using a standard format, and studies scored on three dimensions of quality. The review is organised into four mini-reviews (MR) dependent on the intervention's target population; people with cognitive impairments (MR1), people with moderate to severe disability (MR2), people with MS (no other criteria) (MR3), and people with depression (MR4)., Main results, Overall 16 studies were identified and included. MR1: three trials (n=145). Some evidence of effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation on cognitive outcomes, although this was difficult to interpret because of the large number of outcome measures used. MR2: three trials (n=80). One small trial suggesting psychotherapy may help with depression. MR3: seven studies (n=688). Some evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy may help people adjust to, and cope with, having MS (three trials). The other trials were diverse in nature and some difficult to interpret because of multiple outcome measures. MR4: three trials (n=93). Two small studies of cognitive behavioural therapy showed significant improvements in depression., Authors' conclusions, The diversity of psychological interventions identified indicates the many ways in which they can potentially help people with MS. No definite conclusions can be made from this review. However there is reasonable evidence that cognitive behavioural approaches are beneficial in the treatment of depression, and in helping people adjust to, and cope with, having MS.","Peter W.

934,"Background, A systematic review found that 3% of working adults who had received influenza vaccine and 5% of those who were unvaccinated had laboratory-proven influenza per season; in healthcare workers (HCWs) these percentages were 5% and 8% respectively. Healthcare workers may transmit influenza to patients., Objectives, To identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs assessing the effects of vaccinating healthcare workers on the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia, death from pneumonia and admission to hospital for respiratory illness in those aged 60 years or older resident in long-term care institutions (LTCIs)., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to October week 3, 2015), EMBASE (1974 to October 2015) and Web of Science (2006 to October 2015), but Biological Abstracts only from 1969 to March 2013 and Science Citation Index-Expanded from 1974 to March 2013 due to lack of institutional access in 2015., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of influenza vaccination of healthcare workers caring for individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs and the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza and its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, or hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract infection) in individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Effects on dichotomous outcomes were measured as risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE., Main results, We identified four cluster-RCTs and one cohort study (n = 12,742) of influenza vaccination for HCWs caring for individuals >= 60 years in LTCIs. Four cluster RCTs (5896 residents) provided outcome data that addressed the objectives of our review. The studies were comparable in their study populations, intervention and outcome measures. The studies did not report adverse events. The principal sources of bias in the studies related to attrition, lack of blinding, contamination in the control groups and low rates of vaccination coverage in the intervention arms, leading us to downgrade the quality of evidence for all outcomes due to serious risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, Our review findings have not identified conclusive evidence of benefit of HCW vaccination programmes on specific outcomes of laboratory-proven influenza, its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract illness), or all cause mortality in people over the age of 60 who live in care institutions. This review did not find information on co-interventions with healthcare worker vaccination: hand-washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding admissions, antivirals and asking healthcare workers with influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) not to work. This review does not provide reasonable evidence to support the vaccination of healthcare workers to prevent influenza in those aged 60 years or older resident in LTCIs. High quality RCTs are required to avoid the risks of bias in methodology and conduct identified by this review and to test further these interventions in combination.","Roger E.

935,"Background, It has been shown that central nervous system dopamine can play a major role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia Brain glutamate is thought to mediate symptoms in schizophrenia due to the influence of glutamate neurons on the dopaminergic transmission in the brain It might be possible to decrease negative symptoms and the cognitive impairment of people with schizophrenia by treatment with glutamatergic drugs., Objectives, To determine the efficacy of glutamatergic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (May 2002 and October 2003) inspected references of all identified studies and contacted relevant authors., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials in which glutamatergic medication was administered to people with schizophrenia., Data collection and analysis, We reliably selected studies quality rated them and extracted data For dichotomous data we estimated relative risks (RR) with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) Where possible we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and used intention-to-treat analysis., Main results, We included eighteen short-term trials with 358 randomised participants The single studies were small with numbers of participants ranging between six and 51 All trials were short-term trials with a maximum duration of 12 weeks In all of these trials glycine D-serine D-cycloserine or ampakine CX516 was used to augment the effect of antipsychotic drugs D-cycloserine a partial agonist of NMDA receptors' glycine site seemed ineffective towards the symptoms of schizophrenia NMDA receptor co-agonists glycine and D-serine showed some effects in reducing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (n=132 SMD -0.66 CI -1.0 to -0.3 p=0.0004) but the magnitude of the effect was moderate Furthermore when responder rates rather than mean scores of negative symptoms were analysed the data were inconsistent: There was no difference in responder rates between glycine and the control in terms of more than 20% improvement of negative symptoms (n=62 RR 0.70 CI 0.3 to 1.71) and only a borderline significant superiority in terms of more than 50% improvement (n=62 RR 0.87 CI 0.8 to 1.00) There were also some effects in favour of glycine and/or D-serine in terms of overall and general symptoms but the results were again inconsistent and depended on the response definition applied Available rating scale data on positive symptoms and cognitive functioning did not indicate a statistically significant effect of glycine or D-serine., Authors' conclusions, In general all glutamatergic drugs appeared to be ineffective in further reducing positive symptoms of the disease when added to the existing antipsychotic treatment Glycine and D-serine may somewhat improve negative symptoms when added to regular antipsychotic medication but the results were not fully consistent and data are too few to allow any firm conclusions Many participants in the included trials were treatment-resistant which may have reduced treatment response Additional research on glutamatergic mechanisms of schizophrenia is needed.","Jari Tiihonen, Kristian Wahlbeck (2013).

936,"Background, This is the second update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2009. Millions of workers worldwide are exposed to noise levels that increase their risk of hearing disorders. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention interventions., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing occupational noise exposure or occupational hearing loss compared to no intervention or alternative interventions., Search methods, We searched the CENTRAL; PubMed; Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; and OSH UPDATE to 3 October 2016., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time-series (ITS) of non-clinical interventions under field conditions among workers to prevent or reduce noise exposure and hearing loss. We also collected uncontrolled case studies of engineering controls about the effect on noise exposure., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We categorised interventions as engineering controls, administrative controls, personal hearing protection devices, and hearing surveillance., Main results, We included 29 studies. One study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure in a 12-year time-series analysis but there were no controlled studies on engineering controls for noise exposure. Eleven studies with 3725 participants evaluated effects of personal hearing protection devices and 17 studies with 84,028 participants evaluated effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs)., Authors' conclusions, There is very low-quality evidence that implementation of stricter legislation can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Controlled studies of other engineering control interventions in the field have not been conducted. There is moderate-quality evidence that training of proper insertion of earplugs significantly reduces noise exposure at short-term follow-up but long-term follow-up is still needed.","Christina Tikka, Jos H.

938,"Background, It is estimated that up to 75% of cancer survivors may experience cognitive impairment as a result of cancer treatment and given the increasing size of the cancer survivor population, the number of affected people is set to rise considerably in coming years. There is a need, therefore, to identify effective, non-pharmacological interventions for maintaining cognitive function or ameliorating cognitive impairment among people with a previous cancer diagnosis., Objectives, To evaluate the cognitive effects, non-cognitive effects, duration and safety of non-pharmacological interventions among cancer patients targeted at maintaining cognitive function or ameliorating cognitive impairment as a result of cancer or receipt of systemic cancer treatment (i.e. chemotherapy or hormonal therapies in isolation or combination with other treatments)., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Centre Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PUBMED, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO databases. We also searched registries of ongoing trials and grey literature including theses, dissertations and conference proceedings. Searches were conducted for articles published from 1980 to 29 September 2015., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non-pharmacological interventions to improve cognitive impairment or to maintain cognitive functioning among survivors of adult-onset cancers who have completed systemic cancer therapy (in isolation or combination with other treatments) were eligible. Studies among individuals continuing to receive hormonal therapy were included. We excluded interventions targeted at cancer survivors with central nervous system (CNS) tumours or metastases, non-melanoma skin cancer or those who had received cranial radiation or, were from nursing or care home settings. Language restrictions were not applied., Data collection and analysis, Author pairs independently screened, selected, extracted data and rated the risk of bias of studies. We were unable to conduct planned meta-analyses due to heterogeneity in the type of interventions and outcomes, with the exception of compensatory strategy training interventions for which we pooled data for mental and physical well-being outcomes. We report a narrative synthesis of intervention effectiveness for other outcomes., Main results, Five RCTs describing six interventions (comprising a total of 235 participants) met the eligibility criteria for the review. Two trials of computer-assisted cognitive training interventions (n = 100), two of compensatory strategy training interventions (n = 95), one of meditation (n = 47) and one of physical activity intervention (n = 19) were identified. Each study focused on breast cancer survivors. All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Data for our primary outcome of interest, cognitive function were not amenable to being pooled statistically. Cognitive training demonstrated beneficial effects on objectively assessed cognitive function (including processing speed, executive functions, cognitive flexibility, language, delayed- and immediate- memory), subjectively reported cognitive function and mental well-being. Compensatory strategy training demonstrated improvements on objectively assessed delayed-, immediate- and verbal-memory, self-reported cognitive function and spiritual quality of life (QoL). The meta-analyses of two RCTs (95 participants) did not show a beneficial effect from compensatory strategy training on physical well-being immediately (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59 to 0.83; I(superscript 2)= 67%) or two months post-intervention (SMD - 0.21, 95% CI -0.89 to 0.47; I(superscript 2) = 63%) or on mental well-being two months post-intervention (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.34; I(superscript 2) = 67%). Lower mental well-being immediately post-intervention appeared to be observed in patients who received compensatory strategy training compared to wait-list controls (SMD -0.57, 95%","Charlene J.

939,"Background, Most people with schizophrenia have a cyclical pattern of illness characterised by remission and relapses. The illness can reduce the ability of self-care and functioning and can lead to the illness becoming disabling. Life skills programmes, emphasising the needs associated with independent functioning, are often a part of the rehabilitation process. These programmes have been developed to enhance independent living and quality of life for people with schizophrenia., Objectives, To review the effects of life skills programmes compared with standard care or other comparable therapies for people with chronic mental health problems., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2010). We supplemented this process with handsearching and scrutiny of references. We inspected references of all included studies for further trials., Selection criteria, We included all relevant randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials for life skills programmes versus other comparable therapies or standard care involving people with serious mental illnesses., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a random-effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random-effects model., Main results, We included seven randomised controlled trials with a total of 483 participants. These evaluated life skills programmes versus standard care, or support group. We found no significant difference in life skills performance between people given life skills training and standard care (1 RCT, n = 32, MD -1.10; 95% CI -7.82 to 5.62). Life skills training did not improve or worsen study retention (5 RCTs, n = 345, RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.40 to 3.36). We found no significant difference in PANSS positive, negative or total scores between life skills intervention and standard care. We found quality of life scores to be equivocal between participants given life skills training (1 RCT, n = 32, MD -0.02; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.03) and standard care. Life skills compared with support groups also did not reveal any significant differences in PANSS scores, quality of life, or social performance skills (1 RCT, n = 158, MD -0.90; 95% CI -3.39 to 1.59)., Authors' conclusions, Currently there is no good evidence to suggest life skills programmes are effective for people with chronic mental illnesses. More robust data are needed from studies that are adequately powered to determine whether life skills training is beneficial for people with chronic mental health problems.","Patraporn Tungpunkom, Nicola Maayan, Karla SoaresWeiser (2015).

941,"Background, Evidence from systematic reviews demonstrates that multi-disciplinary rehabilitation is effective in the stroke population, in which older adults predominate. However, the evidence base for the effectiveness of rehabilitation following acquired brain injury (ABI) in younger adults has not been established, perhaps because this scenario presents different methodological challenges in research., Objectives, To assess the effects of multi-disciplinary rehabilitation following ABI in adults 16 to 65 years of age., Search methods, We ran the most recent search on 14 September 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane LibraryOvid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase Classic+Embase (OvidSP), Web of Science (ISI WOS) databases, clinical trials registers, and we screened reference lists., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing multi-disciplinary rehabilitation versus routinely available local services or lower levels of intervention; or trials comparing an intervention in different settings, of different intensities or of different timing of onset. Controlled clinical trials were included, provided they met pre-defined methodological criteria., Data collection and analysis, Three review authors independently selected trials and rated their methodological quality. A fourth review author would have arbitrated if consensus could not be reached by discussion, but in fact, this did not occur. As in previous versions of this review, we used the method described by Van Tulder 1997 to rate the quality of trials and to perform a 'best evidence' synthesis by attributing levels of evidence on the basis of methodological quality. Risk of bias assessments were performed in parallel using standard Cochrane methodology. However, the Van Tulder system provided a more discriminative evaluation of rehabilitation trials, so we have continued to use it for our primary synthesis of evidence. We subdivided trials in terms of severity of brain injury, setting and type and timing of rehabilitation offered., Main results, We identified a total of 19 studies involving 3480 people. Twelve studies were of good methodological quality and seven were of lower quality, according to the van Tulder scoring system. Within the subgroup of predominantly mild brain injury, 'strong evidence' suggested that most individuals made a good recovery when appropriate information was provided, without the need for additional specific interventions. For moderate to severe injury, 'strong evidence' showed benefit from formal intervention, and 'limited evidence' indicated that commencing rehabilitation early after injury results in better outcomes. For participants with moderate to severe ABI already in rehabilitation, 'strong evidence' revealed that more intensive programmes are associated with earlier functional gains, and 'moderate evidence' suggested that continued outpatient therapy could help to sustain gains made in early post-acute rehabilitation. The context of multi-disciplinary rehabilitation appears to influence outcomes. 'Strong evidence' supports the use of a milieu-oriented model for patients with severe brain injury, in which comprehensive cognitive rehabilitation takes place in a therapeutic environment and involves a peer group of patients. 'Limited evidence' shows that specialist in-patient rehabilitation and specialist multi-disciplinary community rehabilitation may provide additional functional gains, but studies serve to highlight the particular practical and ethical restraints imposed on randomisation of severely affected individuals for whom no realistic alternatives to specialist intervention are available., Authors' conclusions, Problems following ABI vary. Consequently, different interventions and combinations of interventions are required to meet the needs of patients with different problems.

942,"Background, Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug, which is claimed to have superior efficacy and to cause fewer movement disorders. However, clozapine carries a significant risk of serious blood disorders. Newer atypical antipsychotics are safer alternatives that might share the benefits of clozapine. It is thus of interest to compare the effectiveness of newer atypical antipsychotics with the effectiveness of clozapine., Objectives, To evaluate the clinical effects of newer atypical antipsychotic drugs in comparison to clozapine for schizophrenia., Search methods, Publications in all languages were searched from the following databases: Biological Abstracts/BIOSIS (1980-1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (1998), The Cochrane Library CENTRAL Register (Issue 4, 1999), EMBASE (1980-1998), MEDLINE (1966-1999), LILACS/CD-ROM (1998), and PsycLIT/PsycINFO (1974-1999). Trials were also sought from recent conference proceedings and reference lists of included papers. Authors of recent trials and the manufacturers of clozapine, iloperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, remoxipride, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone and zotepine were contacted., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials comparing clozapine with newer atypical antipsychotic drugs were included by independent assessment by two reviewers., Data collection and analysis, Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogenous dichotomous data were calculated. A random effects model was used for heterogeneous dichotomous data. Where possible the number needed to treat (NNT) statistic with 95%CI were also calculated. Weighted or standardised means were calculated for continuous data. Due to the small number of included studies, sensitivity analyses or funnel plot statistics were not undertaken for this version of the review., Main results, The current review includes eight studies (22 papers), of which three studies are 4-6 weeks in duration and only one study is of more than 12 weeks' duration., Newer atypical drugs seemed to be broadly similar to clozapine using a clinical global index or trialists' definitions of improvement, but this result was obtained from a relatively small number of studies. Due to the small number of studies and patients, wide confidence intervals were seen when their effectiveness as measured by symptom rating scales was compared. Social functioning was better in patients on newer atypical medication (risperidone) than in those on clozapine, but this finding is based on a single underpowered trial and has to be interpreted with caution., Authors' conclusions, The equal effectiveness and tolerability of new atypical drugs in comparison with clozapine is not yet demonstrated. Lack of statistical power to determine the comparative efficacy and effectiveness of newer atypical drugs makes it difficult to judge whether newer drugs are more effective, less effective or equivalent. Trials of sufficient power, with longer duration, measuring clinically important outcomes, are needed to assess the true comparative clinical effectiveness, tolerability and cost effectiveness of newer drugs in relation to clozapine.","Arja Tuunainen, Kristian Wahlbeck (2012).

Identification of interventions which are effective in equipping general practitioners (GPs) with such necessary skills could translate to improved health outcomes for patients and reduced healthcare and societal costs., Objectives, To determine the effectiveness of professional interventions for GPs that aim to improve the management of musculoskeletal conditions in primary care., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2010, Issue 2; MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 - October 2013); EMBASE, Ovid (1980 - Ocotber 2013); CINAHL, EbscoHost (1980 - November 2013), and the EPOC Specialised Register. We conducted cited reference searches using ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar; and handsearched selected issues of Arthritis and Rheumatism and Primary Care-Clinics in Office Practice.

However, their use is controversial., Objectives, The aim of this review was to determine whether antidepressants are more effective than placebo for the treatment of non-specific low-back pain., Search strategy, Randomised controlled trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO (to November 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2008, Issue 4, and previous systematic reviews., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials that compared antidepressant medication and placebo for patients with non-specific low-back pain and used at least one clinically relevant outcome measure., Data collection and analysis, Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the effect of antidepressants on pain, depression and function, and the effect of antidepressant type on pain. To account for studies that could not be pooled, additional qualitative analyses were performed using the levels of evidence recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group., Main results, Ten trials that compared antidepressants with placebo were included in this review. The pooled analyses showed no difference in pain relief (six trials (one trial with two treatment arms and a second trial with 3 treatment arms); standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.25 to 0.17)) or depression (two trials; SMD 0.06 (95% CI -0.29 to 0.40)) between antidepressant and placebo treatments. The qualitative analyses found conflicting evidence on the effect of antidepressants on pain intensity in chronic low-back pain, and no clear evidence that antidepressants reduce depression in chronic low-back pain patients. Two pooled analyses showed no difference in pain relief between different types of antidepressants and placebo. Our findings were not altered by the sensitivity analyses, which varied the risk of bias allowed for inclusion in the meta-analyses to allow data from additional trials to be examined., Authors' conclusions, There is no clear evidence that antidepressants are more effective than placebo in the management of patients with chronic low-back pain. These findings do not imply that severely depressed patients with back pain should not be treated with antidepressants; furthermore, there is evidence for their use in other forms of chronic pain.","Donna M.

945,"Background, AIDS dementia complex is a common complication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that continues to exist despite the current use of potent antiretroviral therapy. It is a source of great morbidity and, when severe, is associated with limited survival., Objectives, To determine efficacy and safety of adjunctive therapies for AIDS dementia complex, Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane HIV/AIDS group trials Specialized Register (December 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (January 1980 to February 2007), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2007), AIDSearch (January 1980 to February 2007), PsycINFO (January 1980 to February 2007), PSYCHLIT (January 1980 to February 2007), LILACS (January 1980 to February 2007), conference proceedings, trial registers, theses databases, and reference lists of the articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials, either published or published, that compared one type of adjunctive therapy to no therapy or placebo in adults with AIDS dementia complex, Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed trials quality, extracted data and entered data into RevMan 4.2 software. Where possible intention-to-treat data were used and we contacted study authors for additional information. We collected neurocognitive performance, adverse effects, tolerability and all-cause mortality information from the trials., Main results, Ten trials involving 711 people were included. All the studies were phase 2 trials. Six studies used adequate methods for allocation of sequence generation and unclear in the remaining four trials. Allocation concealment was adequate in five trials and unclear in the remaining trials. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of types, dosages, routes and frequencies of administration of the adjunctive therapies. There were no significant differences between the treated and placebo groups on neuropsychological test scores, number of those that complete the assign dosage of experimental medication, adverse effects, and all-cause mortality., Authors' conclusions, This review confirms the absence of evidence that any of the adjunctive therapies improves cognitive performance or quality of life, or both for patients with ADC, though they were well tolerated and safe.","Olalekan A.

946,"Background, In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have grown exponentially over recent years. It is estimated that about 80% of CVD deaths occur in LMICs. People in LMICs are more exposed to cardiovascular risk factors such as tobacco, and often do not have access to effective and equitable healthcare services (including early detection services). Evidence from high-income countries indicates that multiple risk factor intervention programmes do not result in reductions in CVD events. Given the increasing incidence of CVDs and lower CVD health awareness in LMICs it is possible that such programmes may have beneficial effects., Objectives, To determine the effectiveness of multiple risk factor interventions (with or without pharmacological treatment) aimed at modifying major cardiovascular risk factors for the primary prevention of CVD in LMICs., Search methods, We searched (from inception to 27 June 2014) the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, HTA, DARE, EED), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and three other databases on 27 June 2014. We also searched two clinical trial registers and conducted reference checking to identify additional studies. We applied no language limits., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of health promotion interventions to achieve behaviour change (i.e. smoking cessation, dietary advice, increasing activity levels) with or without pharmacological treatments, which aim to alter more than one cardiovascular risk factor (i.e. diet, reduce blood pressure, smoking, total blood cholesterol or increase physical activity) of at least six months duration of follow-up conducted in LMICs., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data using mean differences (MDs), and presented all results with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease events., Main results, Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias. Some studies were at high risk of bias for random sequence generation (two trials), allocation concealment (two trials), blinding of outcome assessors (one trial) and incomplete outcome data (one trial). Duration and content of multiple risk factor interventions varied across the trials. Two trials recruited healthy participants and the other 11 trials recruited people with varying risks of CVD, such as participants with known hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Only one study reported CVD outcomes and multiple risk factor interventions did not reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.07, 232 participants, low-quality evidence); the result is imprecise (a wide confidence interval and small sample size) and makes it difficult to draw a reliable conclusion. None of the included trials reported all-cause mortality. The pooled effect indicated a reduction in systolic blood pressure (MD -6.72 mmHg, 95% CI -9.82 to -3.61, I[superscript digit two] = 91%, 4868 participants, low-quality evidence), diastolic blood pressure (MD -4.40 mmHg, 95% CI -6.47 to -2.34, I[superscript digit two] = 92%, 4701 participants, low-quality evidence), body mass index (MD -0.76 kg/m[superscript digit two], 95% CI -1.29 to -0.22, I[superscript digit two] = 80%, 2984 participants, low-quality evidence) and waist circumference (MD -3.31, 95% CI -4.77 to -1.86, I[superscript digit two] = 55%, 393 participants, moderate-quality evidence) in favour of multiple risk factor interventions, but there was substantial heterogeneity. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of these interventions on consumption of fruit or vegetables, smoking cessation, glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholester","Olalekan A.

948,"Background, Poor compliance with treatment often means that many people with schizophrenia or other severe mental illness relapse and may need frequent and repeated hospitalisation. Information and communication technology (ICT) is increasingly being used to deliver information, treatment or both for people with severe mental disorders., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of psychoeducational interventions using ICT as a means of educating and supporting people with schizophrenia or related psychosis., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (2008, 2009 and September 2010), inspected references of identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information., Selection criteria, All clinical randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICT as a psychoeducational and supportive tool with any other type of psychoeducation and supportive intervention or standard care., Data collection and analysis, We selected trials and extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed-effect risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions., Main results, We included six trials with a total of 1063 participants. We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes (patient compliance and global state) between psychoeducational interventions using ICT and standard care., Authors' conclusions, Using ICT to deliver psychoeducational interventions has no clear effects compared with standard care, other methods of delivering psychoeducation and support, or both. Researchers used a variety of methods of delivery and outcomes, and studies were few and underpowered. ICT remains a promising method of delivering psychoeducation; the equivocal findings of this review should not postpone high-quality research in this area.","Maritta Valimaki, Heli Hatonen, Mari Lahti, Lauri Kuosmanen, Clive E.

949,"Background, Virtual reality (VR) is computerised real-time technology, which can be used an alternative assessment and treatment tool in the mental health field. Virtual reality may take different forms to simulate real-life activities and support treatment., Objectives, To investigate the effects of virtual reality to support treatment compliance in people with serious mental illness., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (most recent, 17th September 2013) and relevant reference lists., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised studies comparing virtual reality with standard care for those with serious mental illnesses. We defined virtual reality as a computerised real-time technology using graphics, sound and other sensory input, which creates the interactive computer-mediated world as a therapeutic tool., Data collection and analysis, All review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For homogeneous dichotomous data the risk difference (RD) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach., Main results, We identified three short-term trials (total of 156 participants, duration five to 12 weeks). Outcomes were prone to at least a moderate risk of overestimating positive effects. We found that virtual reality had little effects regarding compliance (3 RCTs, n = 156, RD loss to follow-up 0.02 CI -0.08 to 0.12, low quality evidence), cognitive functioning (1 RCT, n = 27, MD average score on Cognistat 4.67 CI -1.76 to 11.10, low quality evidence), social skills (1 RCT, n = 64, MD average score on social problem solving SPSI-R (Social Problem Solving Inventory - Revised) -2.30 CI -8.13 to 3.53, low quality evidence), or acceptability of intervention (2 RCTs, n = 92, RD 0.05 CI -0.09 to 0.19, low quality evidence). There were no data reported on mental state, insight, behaviour, quality of life, costs, service utilisation, or adverse effects. Satisfaction with treatment - measured using an un-referenced scale - and reported as 'interest in training' was better for the virtual reality group (1 RCT, n = 64, MD 6.00 CI 1.39 to 10.61,low quality evidence)., Authors' conclusions, There is no clear good quality evidence for or against using virtual reality for treatment compliance among people with serious mental illness. If virtual reality is used, the experimental nature of the intervention should be clearly explained. High-quality studies should be undertaken in this area to explore any effects of this novel intervention and variations of approach.","Maritta Valimaki, Heli M. Hatonen, Mari E.

951,"Background, Many people with mental, neurological and substance-use disorders (MNS) do not receive health care. Non-specialist health workers (NSHWs) and other professionals with health roles (OPHRs) are a key strategy for closing the treatment gap., Objectives, To assess the effect of NSHWs and OPHRs delivering MNS interventions in primary and community health care in low- and middle-income countries., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register) (searched 21 June 2012); MEDLINE, OvidSP; MEDLINE In Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, OvidSP; EMBASE, OvidSP (searched 15 June 2012); CINAHL, EBSCOhost; PsycINFO, OvidSP (searched 18 and 19 June 2012); World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Library (searched 29 June 2012); LILACS; the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO); OpenGrey; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (searched 8 and 9 August 2012); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index (ISI Web of Knowledge) (searched 2 October 2012) and reference lists, without language or date restrictions. We contacted authors for additional studies., Selection criteria, Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted-time-series studies of NSHWs/OPHR-delivered interventions in primary/community health care in low- and middle-income countries, and intended to improve outcomes in people with MNS disorders and in their carers. We defined an NSHW as any professional health worker (e.g. doctors, nurses and social workers) or lay health worker without specialised training in MNS disorders. OPHRs included people outside the health sector (only teachers in this review)., Data collection and analysis, Review authors double screened, double data-extracted and assessed risk of bias using standard formats. We grouped studies with similar interventions together. Where feasible, we combined data to obtain an overall estimate of effect., Main results, The 38 included studies were from seven low- and 15 middle-income countries. Twenty-two studies used lay health workers, and most addressed depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The review shows that the use of NSHWs, compared with usual healthcare services: 1. may increase the number of adults who recover from depression or anxiety, or both, two to six months after treatment (prevalence of depression: risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.64; low-quality evidence); 2. may slightly reduce symptoms for mothers with perinatal depression (severity of depressive symptoms: standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.42, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.26; low-quality evidence); 3. may slightly reduce the symptoms of adults with PTSD (severity of PTSD symptoms: SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.05; low-quality evidence); 4. probably slightly improves the symptoms of people with dementia (severity of behavioural symptoms: SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.08; moderate-quality evidence); 5. probably improves/slightly improves the mental well-being, burden and distress of carers of people with dementia (carer burden: SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.15; moderate-quality evidence); 6. may decrease the amount of alcohol consumed by people with alcohol-use disorders (drinks/drinking day in last 7 to 30 days: mean difference -1.68, 95% CI -2.79 to -0.57); low-quality evidence)., Authors' conclusions, Overall, NSHWs and teachers have some promising benefits in improving people's outcomes for general and perinatal depression, PTSD and alcohol-use disorders, and patient- and carer-outcomes for dementia. However, this evidence is mostly low or very low quality, and for some issues no evidence is available. Therefore, we cannot make conclusions about which specific NSHW-led interventions are more effective.","Nadja van Ginneken, Prathap Tharyan, Simon Lewin, Girish N. Rao, S. M.

We only included studies where RTW or conversely sickness absence was reported as a continuous outcome., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the studies. We performed meta-analysis where possible, and we assessed the quality of evidence according to GRADE criteria. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane., Main results, We included 14 RCTs with 1897 workers. Eight studies included workers with musculoskeletal disorders, five workers with mental health problems, and one workers with cancer. We judged six studies to have low risk of bias for the outcome sickness absence., Authors' conclusions, We found moderate-quality evidence that workplace interventions reduce time to first RTW, high-quality evidence that workplace interventions reduce cumulative duration of sickness absence, very low-quality evidence that workplace interventions reduce time to lasting RTW, and moderate-quality evidence that workplace interventions increase recurrences of sick leave. Overall, the effectiveness of workplace interventions on work disability showed varying results.

For analysis, we planned to use risk ratio for binary efficacy outcomes and mean difference or standardised mean difference for continuously distributed outcomes., Main results, In this updated review we found no studies which fulfilled the Cochrane criteria for randomised controlled trials., Authors' conclusions, We found no randomised controlled trials of tiagabine in the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar disorder. However, there are reports that a number of patients suffered episodes of syncope or seizure. Further investigation of the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine in the treatment of acute affective episodes of bipolar disorder should await the clarification of the nature of the reported episodes of syncope and seizure-like activity and an examination of the level of risk involved.","Akshya Vasudev, Karine Macritchie, Sanjay K.

957,"Background, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurobiological condition, characterised by behavioral and cognitive symptoms such as inattention, impulsivity and/or excessive activity. The syndrome is commonly accompanied by psychiatric comorbidities and is associated with educational and occupational underachievement., Objectives, To assess the effects and safety of bupropion for the treatment of adults with ADHD., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and seven other databases in February 2017. We also searched three trials registers and three online theses portals. In addition, we checked references of included studies and contacted study authors to identify potentially relevant studies that were missed by our search., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects (including adverse effects) of bupropion compared to placebo in adults with ADHD., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors (WV, GB) independently screened records and extracted data using a data extraction sheet that we tested in a pilot study. We extracted all relevant data on study characteristics and results. We assessed risks of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used a fixed-effect model to pool the results across studies., Main results, We included six studies with a total of 438 participants. Five studies were conducted in the USA, and one in Iran. All studies evaluated a long-acting version of bupropion, with the dosage ranging from 150 mg up to 450 mg daily. Study intervention length varied from six to 10 weeks. Four studies explicitly excluded participants with psychiatric comorbidity and one study included only participants with opioid dependency. Four studies were funded by industry, but the impact of this on study results is unknown. Two studies were publicly funded and in one of these studies, the lead author was a consultant for several pharmaceutical companies and also received investigator-driven funding from two companies, however none of these companies manufacture bupropion. We judged none of the studies to be free of bias because for most risk of bias domains the study reports failed to provide sufficient details. Using the GRADE approach, we rated the overall quality of evidence as low. We downgraded the quality of the evidence because of serious risk of bias and serious imprecision due to small sample sizes., Authors' conclusions, The findings of this review, which compared bupropion to placebo for adult ADHD, indicate a possible benefit of bupropion. We found low-quality evidence that bupropion decreased the severity of ADHD symptoms and moderately increased the proportion of participants achieving a significant clinical improvement in ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, we found low-quality evidence that the tolerability of bupropion is similar to that of placebo. In the pharmacological treatment of adults with ADHD, extended- or sustained-release bupropion may be an alternative to stimulants. The low-quality evidence indicates uncertainty with respect to the pooled effect estimates. Further research is very likely to change these estimates. More research is needed to reach more definite conclusions as well as clarifying the optimal target population for this medicine. Treatment response remains to be reported in a DSM5-diagnosed population. There is also a lack of knowledge on long-term outcomes.","Wim Verbeeck, Geertruida E.

The intensity of training ranged from a single educational session to very extensive personal biofeedback., Authors' conclusions, There is moderate quality evidence that MMH advice and training with or without assistive devices does not prevent back pain or back pain-related disability when compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. There is no evidence available from RCTs for the effectiveness of MMH advice and training or MMH assistive devices for treating back pain. More high quality studies could further reduce the remaining uncertainty.","Jos H. Verbeek, KariPekka Martimo, Jaro Karppinen, Paul P. Kuijer, Eira ViikariJuntura, EsaPekka Takala (2011).

959,"Background, Carpal tunnel syndrome results from entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist. Common symptoms are tingling, numbness, and pain in the hand that may radiate to the forearm or shoulder. Most symptomatic cases are treated non-surgically., Objectives, The objective is to compare the efficacy of surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome with non-surgical treatment., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (January 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2008) and LILACS (January 1982 to January 2008). We checked bibliographies in papers and contacted authors for information about other published or unpublished studies., Selection criteria, We included all randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical and any non-surgical therapies., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials., Main results, In this update we found four randomised controlled trials involving 317 participants in total. Three of them including 295 participants, 148 allocated to surgery and 147 to non-surgical treatment reported information on our primary outcome (improvement at three months of follow-up). The pooled estimate favoured surgery (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.46). Two trials including 245 participants described outcome at six month follow-up, also favouring surgery (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.39)., Authors' conclusions, Surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome relieves symptoms significantly better than splinting. Further research is needed to discover whether this conclusion applies to people with mild symptoms and whether surgical treatment is better than steroid injection.","Renato J. Verdugo, Rodrigo A.

961,"Background, Stroke is a major cause of long-term disability in adults. Several systematic reviews have shown that a higher intensity of training can lead to better functional outcomes after stroke. Currently, the resources in inpatient settings are not always sufficient and innovative methods are necessary to meet these recommendations without increasing healthcare costs. A resource efficient method to augment intensity of training could be to involve caregivers in exercise training. A caregiver-mediated exercise programme has the potential to improve outcomes in terms of body function, activities, and participation in people with stroke. In addition, caregivers are more actively involved in the rehabilitation process, which may increase feelings of empowerment with reduced levels of caregiver burden and could facilitate the transition from rehabilitation facility (in hospital, rehabilitation centre, or nursing home) to home setting. As a consequence, length of stay might be reduced and early supported discharge could be enhanced., Objectives, To determine if caregiver-mediated exercises (CME) improve functional ability and health-related quality of life in people with stroke, and to determine the effect on caregiver burden., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (October 2015), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library, 2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2015), Embase (1980 to December 2015), CINAHL (1982 to December 2015), SPORTDiscus (1985 to December 2015), three additional databases (two in October 2015, one in December 2015), and six additional trial registers (October 2015). We also screened reference lists of relevant publications and contacted authors in the field., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing CME to usual care, no intervention, or another intervention as long as it was not caregiver-mediated, aimed at improving motor function in people who have had a stroke., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials. One review author extracted data, and assessed quality and risk of bias, and a second review author cross-checked these data and assessed quality. We determined the quality of the evidence using GRADE. The small number of included studies limited the pre-planned analyses., Main results, We included nine trials about CME, of which six trials with 333 patient-caregiver couples were included in the meta-analysis. The small number of studies, participants, and a variety of outcome measures rendered summarising and combining of data in meta-analysis difficult. In addition, in some studies, CME was the only intervention (CME-core), whereas in other studies, caregivers provided another, existing intervention, such as constraint-induced movement therapy. For trials in the latter category, it was difficult to separate the effects of CME from the effects of the other intervention., Authors' conclusions, There is very low- to moderate-quality evidence that CME may be a valuable intervention to augment the pallet of therapeutic options for stroke rehabilitation. Included studies were small, heterogeneous, and some trials had an unclear or high risk of bias. Future high-quality research should determine whether CME interventions are (cost-)effective.","D. M.

962,"Background, Hereditary ataxia syndromes can result in significant speech impairment, a symptom thought to be responsive to treatment. The type of speech impairment most commonly reported in hereditary ataxias is dysarthria. Dysarthria is a collective term referring to a group of movement disorders affecting the muscular control of speech. Dysarthria affects the ability of individuals to communicate and to participate in society. This in turn reduces quality of life. Given the harmful impact of speech disorder on a person's functioning, treatment of speech impairment in these conditions is important and evidence-based interventions are needed., Objectives, To assess the effects of interventions for speech disorder in adults and children with Friedreich ataxia and other hereditary ataxias., Search methods, On 14 October 2013, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts (LLBA), Dissertation Abstracts and trials registries. We checked all references in the identified trials to identify any additional published data., Selection criteria, We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared treatments for hereditary ataxias with no treatment, placebo or another treatment or combination of treatments, where investigators measured speech production., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. The review authors collected information on adverse effects from included studies. We did not conduct a meta-analysis as no two studies utilised the same assessment procedures within the same treatment., Main results, Fourteen clinical trials, involving 721 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Thirteen studies compared a pharmaceutical treatment with placebo (or a low dose of the intervention), in heterogenous groups of degenerative cerebellar ataxias. Three compounds were studied in two trials each: a levorotatory form of 5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5HT), idebenone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone tartrate (TRH-T); each of the other compounds (riluzole, varenicline, buspirone, betamethasone, coenzyme Q(subscript 10) with vitamin E, [alpha]-tocopheryl quinone and erythropoietin) were studied in one trial. The 14th trial, involving a mixed group of participants with spinocerebellar ataxia, compared the effectiveness of nonspecific physiotherapy and occupational therapy within an inpatient hospital setting to no treatment. No studies utilised traditional speech therapies. We defined the primary outcome measure in this review as the percentage change (improvement) in overall speech production immediately following completion of the intervention or later, measured by any validated speech assessment tool. None of the trials included speech as a primary outcome or examined speech using any validated speech assessment tool. Eleven studies reported speech outcomes derived from a subscale embedded within disease rating scales. The remaining three studies used alternative assessments to measure speech, including mean time to produce a standard sentence, a subjective rating of speech on a 14-point analogue scale, patient-reported assessment of the impact of dysarthria on activities of daily living and acoustic measures of syllable length. One study measured speech both subjectively as part of a disease rating scale and with further measures of speech timing. Three studies utilised the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and one used the Child Health Questionnaire as measures of general quality of life. A further study utilised the Functional Independence Measure to assess functional health., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient and low or very low quality evidence from either RCTs or observational studies to determin","Adam P.

963,"Background, This review is one of a series on drugs used to treat fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown aetiology characterised by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep problems and fatigue affecting approximately 2% of the general population. People often report high disability levels and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Drug therapy focuses on reducing key symptoms and disability, and improving HRQoL. Cannabis has been used for millennia to reduce pain and other somatic and psychological symptoms., Objectives, To assess the efficacy, tolerability and safety of cannabinoids for fibromyalgia symptoms in adults., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE to April 2016, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, three clinical trial registries, and contact with trial authors., Selection criteria, We selected randomised controlled trials of at least four weeks' duration of any formulation of cannabis products used for the treatment of adults with fibromyalgia., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted the data of all included studies and assessed risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence was derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for drop-outs; at least 200 participants in the comparison, eight to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design), second tier evidence from data that did not meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers (i.e. data from at least 200 participants) in the comparison, and third tier evidence from data involving small numbers of participants that were considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)., Main results, We included two studies with 72 participants. Overall, the two studies were at moderate risk of bias. The evidence was derived from group mean data and completer analysis (very low quality evidence overall). We rated the quality of all outcomes according to GRADE as very low due to indirectness, imprecision and potential reporting bias., Authors' conclusions, We found no convincing, unbiased, high quality evidence suggesting that nabilone is of value in treating people with fibromyalgia. The tolerability of nabilone was low in people with fibromyalgia.","Brian Walitt, Petra Klose, MaryAnn Fitzcharles, Tudor Phillips, Winfried Hauser (2016).

964,"Background, Sulpiride is a relatively old antipsychotic drug reputed to have a low incidence of adverse effects and an effect on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This relatively inexpensive antipsychotic drug has a similar neuropharmacological profile to several novel atypical drugs., Objectives, To evaluate the effects of sulpiride for schizophrenia and other similar serious mental illnesses in comparison with placebo., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (September 2008) and references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. We updated this search 7th November 2012., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sulpiride with placebo for people with schizophrenia and other types of schizophrenia-like psychoses. The primary outcome of interest was clinically significant response in global state., Data collection and analysis, We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re-inspected and quality-assessed these. IMO and JW extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data using a random-effects risk ratio (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. Where continuous data were included, we analysed these data using random-effects mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI., Main results, No new trials were included from the 2012 search. The review still includes two trials of short duration comparing sulpiride with placebo (total n = 113). No study reported our primary outcome of interest of 'global state: clinically significant response', nor our secondary outcomes of interest of 'quality of life', 'severe adverse effects', and 'safety assessments'. As regards mental state, there were no clear differences between groups for either positive or negative symptoms; measured positive symptoms using the Manchester scale were skewed and therefore not included in meta-analysis (n = 18, 1 RCT, very low quality evidence). Measured negative symptoms using the Manchester scale also demonstrated no clear difference (n = 18, 1 RCT, MD -3.0 CI -1.66 to 1.06, very low quality evidence). Few people left these studies by three months (n = 113, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.25 to 4.00). One subscore finding demonstrated a significant improvement in social behaviour using the Current Behaviour Schedule (CBS) when receiving placebo (n = 18, 1 RCT, MD -2.90 CI -5.60 to -0.20). There were no data for many important outcomes such as global outcomes, service use or adverse effects., Authors' conclusions, Sulpiride may be an effective antipsychotic drug but evidence of its superiority over placebo from randomised trials is very limited. Practice will have to use evidence from sources other than trials until better evidence is generated.","Jijun Wang, Stephanie Sampson (2014).

965,"Background, Rehabilitation for older people has acquired an increasingly important profile for both policy-makers and service providers within health and social care agencies. This has generated an increased interest in the use of alternative care environments including care home environments. Yet, there appears to be limited evidence on which to base decisions., Objectives, To compare the effects of care home environments (e.g. nursing home, residential care home and nursing facilities) versus hospital environments and own home environments in the rehabilitation of older people., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Specialised Register and Pending Folder, MEDLINE (1950 to March Week 3 2007), EMBASE (1980 to 2007 Week 13), CINAHL (1982 to March, Week 4, 2007), other databases and reference lists of relevant review articles were additionally reviewed. Date of most recent search: March 2007., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) that compared rehabilitation outcomes for persons 60 years or older who received rehabilitation whilst residing in a care home with those who received rehabilitation in hospital or own home environments., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data., Main results, In this update, 8365 references were retrieved. Of these, 339 abstracts were independently assessed by 2 review authors, and 56 studies and 5 review articles were subsequently obtained. Full text papers were independently assessed by two or three review authors and none of these met inclusion criteria., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence to compare the effects of care home environments versus hospital environments or own home environments on older persons rehabilitation outcomes. Although the authors acknowledge that absence of effect is not no effect. There are three main reasons; the first is that the description and specification of the environment is often not clear; secondly, the components of the rehabilitation system within the given environments are not adequately specified and; thirdly, when the components are clearly specified they demonstrate that the control and intervention sites are not comparable with respect to the methodological criteria specified by Cochrane EPOC group. The combined effect of these factors resulted in the comparability between intervention and control groups being very weak.","Derek Ward, Amy Drahota, Diane Gal, Martin Severs, Taraneh P.

966,"Background, Prevention of childhood obesity is an international public health priority given the significant impact of obesity on acute and chronic diseases, general health, development and well-being. The international evidence base for strategies that governments, communities and families can implement to prevent obesity, and promote health, has been accumulating but remains unclear., Objectives, This review primarily aims to update the previous Cochrane review of childhood obesity prevention research and determine the effectiveness of evaluated interventions intended to prevent obesity in children, assessed by change in Body Mass Index (BMI). Secondary aims were to examine the characteristics of the programs and strategies to answer the questions 'What works for whom, why and for what cost?', Search methods, The searches were re-run in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and CINAHL in March 2010 and searched relevant websites. Non-English language papers were included and experts were contacted., Selection criteria, The review includes data from childhood obesity prevention studies that used a controlled study design (with or without randomisation). Studies were included if they evaluated interventions, policies or programs in place for twelve weeks or more. If studies were randomised at a cluster level, 6 clusters were required., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data was extracted on intervention implementation, cost, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured adiposity, physical activity (PA)-related behaviours or diet-related behaviours. Adverse outcomes were recorded. A meta-analysis was conducted using available BMI or standardised BMI (zBMI) score data with subgroup analysis by age group (0-5, 6-12, 13-18 years, corresponding to stages of developmental and childhood settings)., Main results, This review includes 55 studies (an additional 36 studies found for this update). The majority of studies targeted children aged 6-12 years. The meta-analysis included 37 studies of 27,946 children and demonstrated that programmes were effective at reducing adiposity, although not all individual interventions were effective, and there was a high level of observed heterogeneity (I(superscript 2)=82%). Overall, children in the intervention group had a standardised mean difference in adiposity (measured as BMI or zBMI) of -0.15kg/m2 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.21 to -0.09). Intervention effects by age subgroups were -0.26kg/m2 (95% CI:-0.53 to 0.00) (0-5 years), -0.15kg/m2 (95% CI -0.23 to -0.08) (6-12 years), and -0.09kg/m2 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.03) (13-18 years). Heterogeneity was apparent in all three age groups and could not explained by randomisation status or the type, duration or setting of the intervention. Only eight studies reported on adverse effects and no evidence of adverse outcomes such as unhealthy dieting practices, increased prevalence of underweight or body image sensitivities was found. Interventions did not appear to increase health inequalities although this was examined in fewer studies., Authors' conclusions, We found strong evidence to support beneficial effects of child obesity prevention programmes on BMI, particularly for programmes targeted to children aged six to 12 years. However, given the unexplained heterogeneity and the likelihood of small study bias, these findings must be interpreted cautiously. A broad range of programme components were used in these studies and whilst it is not possible to distinguish which of these components contributed most to the beneficial effects observed, our synthesis indicates the following to be promising policies and strategies:","Elizabeth Waters, Andrea de SilvaSanigorski, Belinda J.

Various interventions are used to treat apraxia but evidence of their benefit has been lacking., Objectives, To determine which therapeutic interventions targeted at motor apraxia reduce disability., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched November 2006). In addition, we searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (1980 to November 2006), CINAHL (1982 to November 2006), PsycINFO (1974 to November 2006), the Research Index of the Occupational Therapy Journal (searched November 2006), REHABDATA (1956 to November 2006), the National Research Register (searched November 2006) and Current Controlled Trials Register (searched November 2006). We reviewed the reference lists of all articles that we identified as relevant. We made efforts to find both published and unpublished trials by writing to key authors and journals., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of therapeutic intervention for motor apraxia in stroke., Data collection and analysis, One review author searched the titles, abstracts and keywords. Four review authors extracted data and analysed trial quality. We contacted investigators for further details of trials if necessary., Main results, Three trials including a total of 132 participants were included in the review. There was evidence of a small and short-lived therapeutic effect in the two studies that reported change in activities of daily living (102 participants) but this was not considered clinically significant and did not persist at the longer-term follow up., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of specific therapeutic interventions for motor apraxia after stroke. Further research of higher quality is required. As we did not review whether patients with apraxia benefit from rehabilitation input in general, they should continue to receive general stroke rehabilitation services.","Carolyn West, Audrey Bowen, Anne Hesketh, Andy Vail (2009).

970,"Background, The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the number of obese or overweight individuals worldwide will increase to 1.5 billion by 2015. Chronic diseases associated with overweight or obesity include diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and stroke., Objectives, To assess the effects of interactive computer-based interventions for weight loss or weight maintenance in overweight or obese people., Search methods, We searched several electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and PsycINFO, through 25 May 2011. We also searched clinical trials registries to identify studies. We scanned reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews., Selection criteria, Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials that evaluated interactive computer-based weight loss or weight maintenance programs in adults with overweight or obesity. We excluded trials if the duration of the intervention was less than four weeks or the loss to follow-up was greater than 20% overall., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently extracted study data and assessed risk of bias. Where interventions, control conditions, outcomes and time frames were similar between studies, we combined study data using meta-analysis., Main results, We included 14 weight loss studies with a total of 2537 participants, and four weight maintenance studies with a total of 1603 participants. Treatment duration was between four weeks and 30 months. At six months, computer-based interventions led to greater weight loss than minimal interventions (mean difference (MD) -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.1 to -0.9; two trials) but less weight loss than in-person treatment (MD 2.1 kg; 95% CI 0.8 to 3.4; one trial). At six months, computer-based interventions were superior to a minimal control intervention in limiting weight regain (MD -0.7 kg; 95% CI -1.2 to -0.2; two trials), but not superior to infrequent in-person treatment (MD 0.5 kg; 95% -0.5 to 1.6; two trials). We did not observe consistent differences in dietary or physical activity behaviors between intervention and control groups in either weight loss or weight maintenance trials. Three weight loss studies estimated the costs of computer-based interventions compared to usual care, however two of the studies were 11 and 28 years old, and recent advances in technology render these estimates unlikely to be applicable to current or future interventions, while the third study was conducted in active duty military personnel, and it is unclear whether the costs are relevant to other settings. One weight loss study reported the cost-effectiveness ratio for a weekly in-person weight loss intervention relative to a computer-based intervention as USD 7177 (EUR 5678) per life year gained (80% CI USD 3055 to USD 60,291 (EUR 2417 to EUR 47,702)). It is unclear whether this could be extrapolated to other studies. No data were identified on adverse events, morbidity, complications or health-related quality of life., Authors' conclusions, Compared to no intervention or minimal interventions (pamphlets, usual care), interactive computer-based interventions are an effective intervention for weight loss and weight maintenance. Compared to in-person interventions, interactive computer-based interventions result in smaller weight losses and lower levels of weight maintenance. The amount of additional weight loss, however, is relatively small and of brief duration, making the clinical significance of these differences unclear.","Susan L. Wieland, Louise Falzon, Chris N.

972,"Background, Psychological treatments are designed to treat pain, distress and disability, and are in common practice. This review updates and extends the 2009 version of this systematic review., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies for chronic pain (excluding headache) in adults, compared with treatment as usual, waiting list control, or placebo control, for pain, disability, mood and catastrophic thinking., Search methods, We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological therapy by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Psychlit from the beginning of each abstracting service until September 2011. We identified additional studies from the reference lists of retrieved papers and from discussion with investigators., Selection criteria, Full publications of RCTs of psychological treatments compared with an active treatment, waiting list or treatment as usual. We excluded studies if the pain was primarily headache, or was associated with a malignant disease. We also excluded studies if the number of patients in any treatment arm was less than 20., Data collection and analysis, Forty-two studies met our criteria and 35 (4788 participants) provided data. Two authors rated all studies. We coded risk of bias as well as both the quality of the treatments and the methods using a scale designed for the purpose. We compared two main classes of treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy(CBT) and behaviour therapy) with two control conditions (treatment as usual; active control) at two assessment points (immediately following treatment and six months or more following treatment), giving eight comparisons. For each comparison, we assessed treatment effectiveness on four outcomes: pain, disability, mood and catastrophic thinking, giving a total of 32 possible analyses, of which there were data for 25., Main results, Overall there is an absence of evidence for behaviour therapy, except a small improvement in mood immediately following treatment when compared with an active control. CBT has small positive effects on disability and catastrophising, but not on pain or mood, when compared with active controls. CBT has small to moderate effects on pain, disability, mood and catastrophising immediately post-treatment when compared with treatment as usual/waiting list, but all except a small effect on mood had disappeared at follow-up. At present there are insufficient data on the quality or content of treatment to investigate their influence on outcome. The quality of the trial design has improved over time but the quality of treatments has not., Authors' conclusions, Benefits of CBT emerged almost entirely from comparisons with treatment as usual/waiting list, not with active controls. CBT but not behaviour therapy has weak effects in improving pain, but only immediately post-treatment and when compared with treatment as usual/waiting list. CBT but not behaviour therapy has small effects on disability associated with chronic pain, with some maintenance at six months. CBT is effective in altering mood and catastrophising outcomes, when compared with treatment as usual/waiting list, with some evidence that this is maintained at six months. Behaviour therapy has no effects on mood, but showed an effect on catastrophising immediately post-treatment. CBT is a useful approach to the management of chronic pain. There is no need for more general RCTs reporting group means: rather, different types of studies and analyses are needed to identify which components of CBT work for which type of patient on which outcome/s, and to try to understand why.","Amanda C.

This systematic review is an update of an earlier review of pharmacotherapy of SAnD., Objectives, To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in adults and identify which factors (methodological or clinical) predict response to treatment., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR-Studies and CCMDCTR-References) to 17 August 2015. The CCMDCTR contains reports of relevant RCTs from MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and CENTRAL (all years). We scanned the reference lists of articles for additional studies. We updated the search in August 2017 and placed additional studies in Awaiting Classification, these will be incorporated in the next version of the review, as appropriate., Selection criteria, We restricted studies to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy versus placebo in the treatment of SAnD in adults., Data collection and analysis, Two authors (TW and JI) assessed trials for eligibility and inclusion for this review update. We extracted descriptive, methodological and outcome information from each trial, contacting investigators for missing information where necessary. We calculated summary statistics for continuous and dichotomous variables (if provided) and undertook subgroup and sensitivity analyses., Main results, We included 66 RCTs in the review (> 24 weeks; 11,597 participants; age range 18 to 70 years) and 63 in the meta-analysis. For the primary outcome of treatment response, we found very low-quality evidence of treatment response for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo (number of studies (k) = 24, risk ratio (RR) 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 1.85, N = 4984). On this outcome there was also evidence of benefit for monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (k = 4, RR 2.36; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.75, N = 235), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) (k = 8, RR 1.83; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.55, N = 1270), and the benzodiazepines (k = 2, RR 4.03; 95% CI 2.45 to 6.65, N = 132), although the evidence was low quality. We also found clinical response for the anticonvulsants with gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) analogues (k = 3, RR 1.60; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.20, N = 532; moderate-quality evidence). The SSRIs were the only medication proving effective in reducing relapse based on moderate-quality evidence. We assessed tolerability of SSRIs and the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine on the basis of treatment withdrawal; this was higher for medication than placebo (SSRIs: k = 24, RR 2.59; 95% CI 1.97 to 3.39, N = 5131, low-quality evidence; venlafaxine: k = 4, RR 3.23; 95% CI 2.15 to 4.86, N = 1213, moderate-quality evidence), but there were low absolute rates of withdrawal for both these medications classes compared to placebo. We did not find evidence of a benefit for the rest of the medications compared to placebo., Authors' conclusions, We found evidence of treatment efficacy for the SSRIs, but it is based on very low- to moderate-quality evidence. Tolerability of SSRIs was lower than placebo, but absolute withdrawal rates were low.","Taryn Williams, Coenraad J. Hattingh, Catherine M. Kariuki, Sean A. Tromp, Anton J. van Balkom, Jonathan C.

975,"Background, It is estimated that by 2020, road traffic crashes will have moved from ninth to third in the world ranking of burden of disease, as measured in disability adjusted life years. The prevention of road traffic injuries is of global public health importance. Measures aimed at reducing traffic speed are considered essential to preventing road injuries; the use of speed cameras is one such measure., Objectives, To assess whether the use of speed cameras reduces the incidence of speeding, road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths., Search methods, We searched the following electronic databases covering all available years up to May 2010: the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (WebSPIRS), EMBASE (WebSPIRS), TRANSPORT, IRRD (International Road Research Documentation), TRANSDOC (European Conference of Ministers of Transport databases), Web of Science (Science and Social Science Citation Index), PsycINFO, CINAHL, EconLit, WHO database, Sociological Abstracts, Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Theses., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series and controlled before-after studies that assessed the impact of speed cameras on speeding, road crashes, crashes causing injury and fatalities were eligible for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, We independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed methodological quality, reported study authors' outcomes and where possible, calculated standardised results based on the information available in each study. Due to considerable heterogeneity between and within included studies, a meta-analysis was not appropriate., Main results, Thirty five studies met the inclusion criteria. Compared with controls, the relative reduction in average speed ranged from 1% to 15% and the reduction in proportion of vehicles speeding ranged from 14% to 65%. In the vicinity of camera sites, the pre/post reductions ranged from 8% to 49% for all crashes and 11% to 44% for fatal and serious injury crashes. Compared with controls, the relative improvement in pre/post injury crash proportions ranged from 8% to 50%., Authors' conclusions, Despite the methodological limitations and the variability in degree of signal to noise effect, the consistency of reported reductions in speed and crash outcomes across all studies show that speed cameras are a worthwhile intervention for reducing the number of road traffic injuries and deaths. However, whilst the the evidence base clearly demonstrates a positive direction in the effect, an overall magnitude of this effect is currently not deducible due to heterogeneity and lack of methodological rigour. More studies of a scientifically rigorous and homogenous nature are necessary, to provide the answer to the magnitude of effect.","Cecilia Wilson, Charlene Willis, Joan K.

976,"Background, Recent studies have attempted to disaggregate therapeutic intervention packages by looking at the impact of structure and process characteristics of environment upon outcome. However, what is commonly referred to as the 'black box' of therapy has yet to be comprehensively unpacked. This failure to analyse the components of therapy means that it remains unclear how much therapy should be provided, who should provide it, and which patients should be targeted to ensure that functional outcomes are maximized. This review, therefore, seeks to assess the effectiveness of specific therapeutic interventions in the rehabilitation of the paretic upper limb post stroke., Objectives, To identify if specific hands-on therapeutic interventions enhance motor activity and function of the upper limb post stroke., Search methods, We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (March 2010), the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field (March 2010) and the Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field (March 2010); MEDLINE (1966 to March 2010); AMED (1985 to March 2010); EMBASE (1980 to March 2010); CINAHL (1982 to March 2010); the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (March 2010); and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 1). In an effort to identify other published, unpublished and ongoing trials we planned to handsearch journals, searched ongoing trials registers, reviewed reference lists, and contacted relevant professional organizations., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults aged 18 years or over and including descriptions of specific hands-on interventions and techniques, rather than packages or approaches to treatment., Data collection and analysis, Following completion of the searches, two review authors independently assessed the trials and extracted data using a data extraction pro forma. The same two review authors independently recorded and documented the methodological quality of the trials., Main results, Three studies, involving a total of 86 participants, met all the selection criteria and were included in the review. However, extreme levels of heterogeneity were evident. Therefore, we could not undertake a meta-analysis of the results and completed a narrative synthesis instead., Authors' conclusions, Overall, the review demonstrated that the limited evidence of benefit of stretching, passive exercises and mobilization, when applied to the hemiplegic upper limb following stroke, merits further research.","Jackie Winter, Susan Hunter, Julius Sim, Peter Crome (2011).

978,"Background, Cognitive stimulation is an intervention for people with dementia which offers a range of enjoyable activities providing general stimulation for thinking, concentration and memory usually in a social setting, such as a small group. Its roots can be traced back to Reality Orientation (RO), which was developed in the late 1950s as a response to confusion and disorientation in older patients in hospital units in the USA. RO emphasised the engagement of nursing assistants in a hopeful, therapeutic process but became associated with a rigid, confrontational approach to people with dementia, leading to its use becoming less and less common., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness and impact of cognitive stimulation interventions aimed at improving cognition for people with dementia, including any negative effects., Search methods, The trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, called (updated 6 December 2011). The search termsused were: cognitive stimulation, reality orientation, memory therapy, memory groups, memory support, memory stimulation, global stimulation, cognitive psychostimulation. Supplementary searches were performed in a number of major healthcare databases and trial registers to ensure that the search was up to date and comprehensive., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cognitive stimulation for dementia which incorporated a measure of cognitive change were included., Data collection and analysis, Data were extracted independently by two review authors using a previously tested data extraction form. Study authors were contacted for data not provided in the papers. Two review authors conducted independent assessments of the risk of bias in included studies., Main results, Fifteen RCTs were included in the review. Six of these had been included in the previous review of RO. The studies included participants from a variety of settings, interventions that were of varying duration and intensity, and were from several different countries. The quality of the studies was generally low by current standards but most had taken steps to ensure assessors were blind to treatment allocation. Data were entered in the meta-analyses for 718 participants (407 receiving cognitive stimulation, 311 in control groups). The primary analysis was on changes that were evident immediately at the end of the treatment period. A few studies provided data allowing evaluation of whether any effects were subsequently maintained. A clear, consistent benefit on cognitive function was associated with cognitive stimulation (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.41, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.57). This remained evident at follow-up one to three months after the end of treatment. In secondary analyses with smaller total sample sizes, benefits were also noted on self-reported quality of life and well-being (standardised mean difference: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.11, 0.65]); and on staff ratings of communication and social interaction (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.71). No differences in relation to mood (self-report or staff-rated), activities of daily living, general behavioural function or problem behaviour were noted. In the few studies reporting family caregiver outcomes, no differences were noted. Importantly, there was no indication of increased strain on family caregivers in the one study where they were trained to deliver the intervention., Authors' conclusions, There was consistent evidence from multiple trials that cognitive stimulation programmes benefit cognition in people with mild to moderate dementia over and above any medication effects. However, the trials were of variable quality with small sample sizes and only limited details of the randomisation method were apparent in a number of the trials. Other outcomes need more exploration but improvements in self-reported quality of life and well-being were promising.

981,"Background, Acute psychotic illness, especially when associated with agitated or violent behaviour, can require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation. In several countries, clinicians often use benzodiazepines (either alone or in combination with antipsychotics) for this outcome., Objectives, To examine whether benzodiazepines, alone or in combination with other pharmacological agents, is an effective treatment for psychosis-induced aggression or agitation when compared with placebo, other pharmacological agents (alone or in combination) or non-pharmacological approaches., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (January 2012, 20 August 2015 and 3 August 2016), inspected reference lists of included and excluded studies, and contacted authors of relevant studies., Selection criteria, We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing benzodiazepines alone or in combination with any antipsychotics, versus antipsychotics alone or in combination with any other antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or antihistamines, for people who were aggressive or agitated due to psychosis., Data collection and analysis, We reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. If there was heterogeneity, this was explored using a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE., Main results, Twenty trials including 695 participants are now included in the review. The trials compared benzodiazepines or benzodiazepines plus an antipsychotic with placebo, antipsychotics, antihistamines, or a combination of these. The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low due to very small sample size of included studies and serious risk of bias (randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were not well conducted in the included trials, 30% of trials (six out of 20) were supported by pharmaceutical institutes). There was no clear effect for most outcomes., Authors' conclusions, The evidence from RCTs for the use of benzodiazepines alone is not good. There were relatively few good data. Most trials were too small to highlight differences in either positive or negative effects. Adding a benzodiazepine to other drugs does not seem to confer clear advantage and has potential for adding unnecessary adverse effects. Sole use of older antipsychotics unaccompanied by anticholinergic drugs seems difficult to justify. Much more high-quality research is still needed in this area.","Hadar Zaman, Stephanie J.

982,"Background, Those with serious/severe mental illness, especially schizophrenia and schizophrenic-like disorders, often have little to no insight regarding the presence of their illness. Psychoeducation may be defined as the education of a person with a psychiatric disorder regarding the symptoms, treatments, and prognosis of that illness. Brief psychoeducation is a short period of psychoeducation; although what constitutes 'brief psychoeducation' can vary. A previous systematic review has shown that the median length of psychoeducation is around 12 weeks. In this current systematic review, we defined 'brief psychoeducation' as programmes of 10 sessions or less., Objectives, To assess the efficacy of brief psychoeducational interventions as a means of helping severely mentally ill people when added to 'standard' care, compared with the efficacy of standard care alone., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group register September 2013 using the phrase:, Selection criteria, All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing brief psychoeducation with any other intervention for treatment of people with severe mental illness. If a trial was described as 'double blind' but implied randomisation, we entered such trials in a sensitivity analysis., Data collection and analysis, At least two review authors extracted data independently from included papers. We contacted authors of trials for additional and missing data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data. For continuous data, we calculated the mean difference (MD), again with 95% CIs. We used a fixed-effect model for data synthesis, and also assessed data using a random-effects model in a sensitivity analysis. We assessed risk of bias for each included study and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)., Main results, We included twenty studies with a total number of 2337 participants in this review. Nineteen studies compared brief psychoeducation with routine care or conventional delivery of information. One study compared brief psychoeducation with cognitive behavior therapy., Authors' conclusions, Based on mainly low to very low quality evidence from a limited number of studies, brief psychoeducation of any form appears to reduce relapse in the medium term, and promote medication compliance in the short term. A brief psychoeducational approach could potentially be effective, but further large, high-quality studies are needed to either confirm or refute the use of this approach.","Sai Zhao, Stephanie Sampson, Jun Xia, Mahesh B.

983,"Background, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by high levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that are present before the age of seven years, seen in a range of situations, inconsistent with the child's developmental level and causing social or academic impairment. Parent training programmes are psychosocial interventions aimed at training parents in techniques to enable them to manage their children's challenging behaviour., Objectives, To determine whether parent training interventions are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and associated problems in children aged between five and eigtheen years with a diagnosis of ADHD, compared to controls with no parent training intervention., Search methods, We searched the following electronic databases (for all available years until September 2010): CENTRAL (2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to 10 September 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 36), CINAHL (1937 to 13 September 2010), PsycINFO (1806 to September Week 1 2010), Dissertation Abstracts International (14 September 2010) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (14 September 2010). We contacted experts in the field to ask for details of unpublished or ongoing research., Selection criteria, Randomised (including quasi-randomised) studies comparing parent training with no treatment, a waiting list or treatment as usual (adjunctive or otherwise). We included studies if ADHD was the main focus of the trial and participants were over five years old and had a clinical diagnosis of ADHD or hyperkinetic disorder that was made by a specialist using the operationalised diagnostic criteria of the DSM-III/DSM-IV or ICD-10. We only included trials that reported at least one child outcome., Data collection and analysis, Four authors were involved in screening abstracts and at least 2 authors looked independently at each one. We reviewed a total of 12,691 studies and assessed five as eligible for inclusion. We extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the five included trials. Opportunities for meta-analysis were limited and most data that we have reported are based on single studies., Main results, We found five studies including 284 participants that met the inclusion criteria, all of which compared parent training with de facto treatment as usual (TAU). One study included a nondirective parent support group as a second control arm., Authors' conclusions, Parent training may have a positive effect on the behaviour of children with ADHD. It may also reduce parental stress and enhance parental confidence. However, the poor methodological quality of the included studies increases the risk of bias in the results. Data concerning ADHD-specific behaviour are ambiguous. For many important outcomes, including school achievement and adverse effects, data are lacking.","Morris Zwi, Hannah Jones, Camilla Thorgaard, Ann York, Jane A. Dennis (2011).

984,"On August 30, 2013, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) was notified by several hospitals of an increase in the number of patients visiting their emergency departments (EDs) with altered mental status after using synthetic marijuana. Synthetic marijuana is dried plant material sprayed with various synthetic cannabinoids and smoked as an alternative to smoking marijuana. In response to the increase in ED visits associated with the use of synthetic marijuana, CDPHE asked all Colorado EDs to report through EMResource (a web-based reporting system) any patients examined on or after August 21 with altered mental status after use of a synthetic marijuana product. Serum and urine specimens from patients also were requested. On September 8, CDPHE, with the assistance of CDC, began an epidemiologic investigation to characterize the outbreak, determine the active substance and source of the synthetic marijuana product, and prevent further morbidity and mortality. Investigators reviewed ED visit reports submitted through EMResource and medical charts. A probable case was defined as any illness resulting in a visit to a Colorado ED during August 21-September 18, 2013, by a patient with suspected synthetic marijuana use in the 24 hours preceding illness onset.

This study examined the effectiveness of Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) as a short-term treatment for reducing PTSD symptoms among Saudi firefighters. A randomized waiting-list control study was conducted with 34 traumatized firefighters were randomly allocated to NET or Waiting-list Control (WLC). The NET group received four therapy sessions of 60-90 min over a three-week period; those in the WLC condition received the same sessions after a three-week waiting period. Participants in both groups were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at 3 and 6 month follow ups. NET led to significant reductions in PTSD symptoms, anxiety and depression compared with WLC. After the WLC group received treatment, it showed the same improvements as the NET group. This occurred immediately post-treatment in both groups, but was not sustained at 3 and 6 month follow ups. Coping strategies and social support led to significant changes only in follow up times.

Bus drivers in large urban areas are frequently attacked. Over a period of 5 months, bus drivers who had been attacked, employees of the largest French urban transport company (RATP), participated in a study designed to evaluate the effects of cognitive behavior treatment provided shortly after such aggression. A total of 132 bus drivers were included in the study divided into 2 randomized groups: a control group (67 subjects) received the usual medical-social care offered by the company, and a treatment group (65 subjects) who, in addition, benefited from 1 to 6 sessions of cognitive behavior intervention, including: evocation of the aggression, relaxation, role plays, cognitive restructuring. Subjects were evaluated by self-questionnaires a few days post-aggression and re-evaluated 6 months later. At follow-up, results showed a statistically significant decrease in anxiety levels (measured by the HAD scale) and intrusion of the traumatic memory (as evaluated by the Horowitz scale) in the treatment group.

This study was aimed to quantitatively determine the impact of vertigo on healthcare resource use and work productivity. Methods: The economic burden of vertigo was assessed through a multi-country, non-interventional, observational registry of vertigo patients: the Registry to Evaluate the Burden of Disease in Vertigo. Patients included were those with a new diagnosis of Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, other vertigo of peripheral vestibular origin, or peripheral vestibular vertigo of unknown origin. Results: A total of 4,294 patients at 618 centers in 13 countries were included during the registry. Of the 4,105 patients analyzed, only half were in employment. Among this working patient population, 69.8% had reduced their workload, 63.3% had lost working days, and 4.6% had changed and 5.7% had quit their jobs, due to vertigo symptoms. Use of healthcare services among patients was high. In the 3 months preceding Visit 1, patients used emergency services 0.4 +/- 0.9 times, primary care consultations 1.6 +/- 1.8 times, and specialist consultations 1.4 +/- 2.0 times (all mean +/- SD).

990,"Very few biomarkers are available for the non-invasive detection of effects of urban air pollution on the respiratory tract. The objective was to evaluate whether Clara cell protein (CC16) and surfactant-associated protein-A (SP-A), two pulmonary secretory proteins, were useftil in the detection of effects of urban air pollutants on the pulmonary epithelium. These proteins were determined in the serum of 53 policemen working in Brussels, Belgium, and a control group of 59 foresters working in the countryside. Except for ozone (O<inf>3</inf>), annual concentrations of the main air pollutants (PM<inf>10</inf>, NO<inf>2</inf>, CO, SO<inf>2</inf> and benzene) were significantly higher in Brussels than in the country. The proportion of smokers was lower in urban policemen compared with foresters, but they smoked on average a similar number of cigarettes per day as confirmed by their urinary excretion of cotinine. Muconic acid, a marker of benzene exposure, was significantly higher in urban policemen than in foresters, in both smokers and non-smokers. Multiple regression analysis showed that the type of work, smoking habits and time spent outdoors and in a car were significant determinants of benzene uptake. Tobacco smoking impaired lung function to a similar extent in urban policemen and foresters. The serum levels of SP-A were significantly increased in smokers but were not different between policemen and foresters. Serum CC16 was significantly reduced by tobacco smoking and slightly decreased in policemen compared with foresters. Interestingly, the reduction of serum CC16 was more pronounced in the subgroup of traffic compared with survey policemen, the latter being also less exposed to benzene. The results suggest that serum pneumoproteins and especially serum CC16 could be useful in the detection of chronic effects of urban air pollutants on the respiratory epithelium of populations particularly at risk. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","K.

Benzene and 1,3-butadiene (BD) have been classified as a human carcinogen based on evidence for an increased genotoxic and epigenotoxic effects in both occupational exposure assessment and in vivo/in vitro studies. We have undertaken a biomonitoring of 25 traffic policemen and 23 office policemen in Beirut, through personal air monitoring, assessed by diffusive samplers, as well as through the use of biomarkers of exposure to benzene and BD. Personal benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) exposure were quantified by GC-MS/MS, urinary trans, trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA) by HPLC/UV, S-phenyl mercapturic acid (S-PMA), monohydroxy-butenyl mercapturic acid (MHBMA) and dihydroxybutyl mercapturic acid (DHBMA) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI(-)-MS/MS) in MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring) mode. We found that individual exposure to benzene in the traffic policemen was higher than that measured in traffic policemen in Prague, in Bologna, in Ioannina and in Bangkok. t,t-MA levels could distinguish between office and traffic policemen. However, median MHBMA levels in traffic policemen were slightly elevated, though not significantly higher than in office policemen. Alternatively, DHBMA concentrations could significantly distinguish between office and traffic policemen and showed a better correlation with personal total BTEX exposure. DHMBA, measured in the post-shift urine samples, correlated with both pre-shift MHMBA and pre-shift DHMBA. Moreover, there was not a marked effect of smoking habits on DHBMA. Taken together, these findings suggested that DHBMA is more suitable than MHBMA as biomarker of exposure to BD in humans. Traffic policemen, who are exposed to benzene and BD at the roadside in central Beirut, are potentially at a higher risk for development of diseases such as cancer than office policemen. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","M.

993,"The study investigates the quality of the management of occupational accidents and of accidents on the way to or from work. Special consideration is given to the prevention and effective early treatment of traumatic-hemorrhagic shock, which in serious accidents is often the pathophysiological cause of reversible or irreversible damage of organ systems, disability or death. In a series of 725 consecutive occupational accidents, accidents on the way to or from work and road accidents over a period of 2 years, and in 31 additional individual cases, the emergency treatment and further care of patients with incipient or advanced shock were examined. Assessment was based on protocols of initial emergency treatment and medical records of further hospital care. Specific attention was given to the development of shock-induced organ damage. When the emergency physician arrived at the site of the accident, of the 725 cases, 82 patients showed early signs of shock, 37 were in advanced shock, and 24 were dead. In accidents with early intervention of experienced medical personnel, securing of the airways, control of bleeding and sufficient substitution of volume and oxygen were usually done professionally, but analysis of the management of other cases showed delays and various shortcomings. In 25% of those who died, protracted circulatory shock due to insufficient volume substitution was the cause of death. Occupational rehabilitation failed in two thirds of the patients with advanced shock, but only in one third of the patients with incipient shock. The study demonstrates that immediate intervention by non-professionals in first aid, rapid arrival of the emergency care team, sufficient volume and oxygen substitution along with other emergency measures, and rapid transport to an appropriate trauma care facility, all improved the prognosis of the accident victims. Specific areas for improvement in the management of accident victims were found, especially in co-operation and co-ordination among non-professional first aid providers, occupational health and auxiliary personnel, and emergency medicine professionals.","D.

994,"This study focuses on 34 victims of aggression at the workplace, less than 48 hours following the incident of aggression. We compared victims who received an EMDR emergency protocol (URG-EMDR; n = 19) that we developed with those who received a method of intervention called eclectic therapy (n = 15). The results show that URG-EMDR therapy, provided within 48 hours, resulted in a greater decrease in perceived stress and a lower PCL-S score than eclectic therapy did. The scores were lower in both groups after 24 hours, and after 3 months, the drop was significantly greater among the victims treated with the URG-EMDR protocol; none of the EMDR-treated patients exhibited symptoms of posttraumatic stress. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","M.

995,"Objective: To describe the epidemiology and toxicity of clenbuterol in exposures reported to the NSW Poisons Information Centre (NSWPIC). Design and setting: Retrospective observational study analysing data from all calls about clenbuterol exposure recorded in the NSWPIC database from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2012. The NSWPIC coversthe Australian jurisdictions New South Wales, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory 24 hours a day and provides after-hours cover for the rest of Australia for 7 nights each fortnight. Main outcome measures: Total number of exposures, source of call (hospital, health care worker, member of the public), time from exposure to call, reasons for drug use, clinical features and advice given. Results: Callers reported 63 exposures to clenbuterol, with a dramatic increase from three in 2008 to 27 in 2012. Of the 63 calls, 35 were from hospital, two from paramedics, one from general practice and 21 direct from the public. At least 53 patients (84%) required hospitalisation. The commonest reasons for use were bodybuilding and slimming. The most common features were tachycardia (24 patients), gastrointestinal disturbance (16) and tremor (11). Exposure was also associated with cardiotoxicity including one cardiac arrest in a 21-year-old man. Conclusion: Although a well recognised doping issue among elite athletes, clenbuterol use has spread out into the general public, especially during 2012, and should be considered in patients using bodybuilding or slimming products who present with protracted sympathomimetic features. The potential for misuse of this substance requires reconsideration of its current poison schedule registration and its availability.","J. Brett, A. H. Dawson, J. A. Brown (2014).

996,"Consistent evidence has indicated that the exposure to environmental air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of occupational exposure to air pollution, especially to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the influence of co-morbidities on the atherosclerotic process and inflammation. For that, biomarkers of exposure such as 1-hydroxypyrene urinary, oxidative damage and markers of cardiovascular risk were determined in plasma, serum and blood. In addition, inflammation models such as carotid intima-media thickness and serum inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in 58 taxi drivers with and without co-morbidity. The results demonstrated that considering only taxi drivers without co-morbidities, 15% presented carotid intima-media thickness above reference values. For the first time it has been demonstrated that urinary 1-hydroxypyrene levels were associated with carotid intima-media thickness and with serum homocysteine levels. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that several factors may contribute to the increased carotid intima-media thickness, among which age, interleukin-6, fibrinogen and exposure to PAHs stand out. In summary, our results suggest that chronic occupational exposure to atmospheric pollution could be an additional contributor to the atherogenesis process, leading to impaired vascular health. Moreover, carotid intima-media thickness, serum homocysteine levels, fibrinogen and the total cholesterol/HDL-c ratio could be suggested as preventive measures to monitor drivers' health. © 2014.","N.

997,"Background: DOM (4-methyl-2, 5-dimethoxyamphetamine) is one of many compounds which are derivatives of 2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine. DOM was synthesized in 1964 and introduced to the street drug market. It was known as ""STP"" (Serenity Tranquility Peace) and became very popular in 1967 in the Haight-Ashbury district. DOM intoxication is characterized by euphoria, perceptual distortion, hallucinations and sympathetic stimulation. Case series: Our PCC was contacted regarding three young adults: a 20 y/o man, a 16 y/o woman and a 17 y/o woman who presented to the ED after ""doing DOM"". They had signs and symptoms of agitation, rigidity, mydriasis, sinus tachycardia (HR 130-160 beats/min) with normal blood pressure, mildly elevated temperature (99.4-99.9 degreeF), hypokalemia (serum K 2.8-3.2 mEq/L) and metabolic acidosis (anion gaps ranging from 19-26). In 2 patients the urine toxicology screen was positive for amphetamines, benzodiazepines and marijuana while it was negative in the remaining patient. The man had a leukocytosis of 16,800 cells/mm3. He developed rhabdomyolysis with an initial CPK of 4,857 U/L which peaked at 33,448 U/L on day 2. The 17 y/o woman's temperature increased to 100.2 degreeF and she experienced a rise in CPK from 984 U/L to 23,694 U/L on day 3. The 16 y/o woman had a mild elevation of CPK from 63 U/L to 492 U/L on day 1. None of the three patients developed any renal injury. All were treated with IV fluids and potassium correction. Benzodiazepines (lorazepam and diazepam) were given to all patients with improvement of symptoms. The 20 y/o man received propofol for several hours for added sedation. Discussion: DOM, along with its chemical cousins DOI, DOB, MDA, PMA and MDMA, are hallucinogenic amphetamines (HA) with a narrow therapeutic index and significant potential for severe toxicity and death. Long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae due to serotonin terminal degeneration and depletion has been reported with HA. Conclusion: PCC specialists and ED clinicians should be aware of the resurgence in the abuse of this 1960's era hallucinogen. Efforts to curtail its sale and use should be encouraged by reporting these exposure cases to law enforcement personnel and public health authorities.","A. M. Burda, M. J. Strugala, M. S. Wahl, J. Q.

998,"Background: Law enforcement personnel may be exposed to a variety of hazardous materials during investigation of clandestine methamphetamine laboratories. Case Report: A 28-year-old forensic specialist investigating a methamphetamine lab was exposed to phosphine without respiratory protection at approximately 2.7 ppm for 20-30 minutes. Shortly following exposure she developed dizziness, cough, headache, and diarrhea, although initial medical evaluation within 1-2 hours was unremarkable. Pulmonary examination at 4 and 7 days postexposure revealed bilateral rhonchi. The cough was worse with exertion, and persisted despite beta-agonist and steroid inhaler treatment. Conclusions: This is apparently the first published case of symptomatic occupational phosphine exposure in a law enforcement officer during investigation of a methamphetamine laboratory. If phosphine exposure is suspected, the possibility of delayed pulmonary toxicity should be recognized.","J. L. Burgess (2001).

999,"In the biomonitoring of human genotoxic effects, micronuclei (MN) usually are scored in phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated cultured lymphocytes. MN also can be examined in uncultured lymphocytes, which facilitates the analysis of genotoxic damage incurred in vivo. Characterization of MN in cultured lymphocytes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has shown a clear over-representation of the X and Y chromasomes in the MN of males. However, it is not known if this phenomenon also occurs in vivo. The purpose of the present study was to assess the frequency and composition of MN formed in vivo from immunomagnetically isolated uncultured T-lymphocytes of men. To evaluate the possible effects of genotoxic exposure on in vivo MN, we examined 17 railroad workers occupationally exposed to complex chemical mixtures and 14 referents, all nonsmokers. The results showed similar total frequencies of micronucleated cells among the exposed workers and the referents. When the MN were characterized by FISH, there were no significant differences between the exposed and referents with regards to the frequency of centromere-positive or centromere-negative MN. Centromeric label was observed in 69% of all MN, indicating that most of the MN contained whole chromosomes (or chromatids). 80% of the centromere-positive MN harbored autosomes, 12% Y chromosomes, and 8% X chromosomes. The occurrence of the Y- and X-chromosomes in MN was, respectively, 5.5- and 3.8-times greater than would be expected assuming an equal contribution by all chromosomes. Thus, sex chromosomes appear to be over-represented in lymphocyte MN of men in vivo, confirming previous results obtained in vitro. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","J. Catalan, G. C. M. Falck, H.

1000,"Background: The drug overdose mortality rate tripled between 1990 and 2006; prescription opioids have driven this epidemic. We examined the period 1990-2006 to inform our understanding of how the current prescription opioid overdose epidemic emerged in urban areas. Methods: We used data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to examine changes in demographic and spatial patterns in overdose fatalities induced by prescription opioids (i.e., analgesics and methadone) in New York City (NYC) in 1990-2006, and what factors were associated with death from prescription opioids vs. heroin, historically the most prevalent form of opioid overdose in urban areas. Results: Analgesic-induced overdose fatalities were the only types of overdose fatalities to increase in 1990-2006 in NYC; the fatality rate increased sevenfold from 0.39 in 1990 to 2.7 per 100,000 persons in 2006. Whites and Latinos were the only racial/ethnic groups to exhibit an increase in overdose-related mortality. Relative to heroin overdose decedents, analgesic and methadone overdose decedents were more likely to be female and to concurrently use psychotherapeutic drugs, but less likely to concurrently use alcohol or cocaine. Analgesic overdose decedents were less likely to be Black or Hispanic, while methadone overdose decedents were more likely to be Black or Hispanic in contrast to heroin overdose decedents. Conclusions: The distinct epidemiologic profiles exhibited by analgesic and methadone overdose fatalities highlight the need to define drug-specific public health prevention efforts. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","M.

1001,"Workplace violence (WPV) is a widely recognized problem in emergency departments (EDs). The majority of WPV studies do not include nonclinical staff and do not address expectations of violence, tolerance to violence, or perceptions of safety. Among a multidisciplinary sample of ED staff members, specific study aims were to (a) describe exposure to WPV; (b) describe perceptions of safety, tolerance to violence, and expectation of violence; (c) describe reporting behaviors and perceived barriers to reporting violence; (d) examine relationships between demographic variables, experiences of violence, tolerance to violence, perceptions of safety, and reporting behaviors; and (e) identify perceptions of viable interventions to improve workplace safety. A cross-sectional design was used to survey ED staff members in a Level 1 Shock Trauma center. Eleven disciplines were represented in 147 completed surveys; 88% of respondents reported exposure to WPV in the previous 6 months. Members of every discipline reported exposure to WPV; 98% of the sample felt safe at work and 64% felt violence was an expected part of the job. Most violence was not reported, primarily because ""nobody was hurt."" Emergency department staff members expected and experienced violence; nevertheless, there was a widespread perception of safety. Perceptions of safety and reasons for not reporting did not mirror previous findings. The WPV exposure is not isolated to clinical staff members and occurs even when prevention strategies are in place.

1002,"Aims: To investigate psychiatric disorders, somatic health, and professional effects in French train drivers having experienced a ""person under train"" accident, and somatic health and professional effects. Methods: A total of 202 train drivers were evaluated several times: immediately after the event, three months later, and one, two, and three years later. These drivers were compared with 186 train drivers not exposed to that psychotraumatic shock. The evaluations relied primarily on the GHQ-28 and MINI questionnaires. Results: In the exposed group, at the first evaluation, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress was 4%; scores >=5 on the GHQ-28 were significantly higher than in the non-exposed group (32% versus 6%), for both the overall result and three sub-scores (somatic symptoms, anxiety and sleep, and psychosocial functioning). All these differences disappeared within a year. Vulnerability factors concerned prior traumas, acute and lasting life events, and the particular occupational situation where the driver is not accompanied but drives the train away alone in the aftermath of the accident. Over 95% of subjects had no short, medium, or long term impairment of their occupational fitness. Conclusions: Most of the psycho-behavioural disorders were observed in the immediate aftermath of the accident and disappeared within a year. The driver's occupational future does not seem to be affected by the ""person under train"" accident. Consideration of a traumatic accident as a job related risk and close psychological support of drivers after an accident probably increase the subject's ability to recover from the event.","C.

1003,"Workplace violence means incidents or circumstances under which people are threatened verbally or physically due to the conditions relating their jobs. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons and consequences of acts of violence by physicians on patients and medical staff in the emergency department. This cross-sectional (descriptive-analytical) study collected information of all violent incidents involving the emergency room physicians in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Ahvaz, Iran over a period of 6 months using a questionnaire and face to face interview. The physicians engaged in the act of violence were aged between 24 and 46 years old with mean age of 33.4+/-0.55 years old. Physicians younger than 30 years old performed significantly more violent acts (p = 0.012). The most common reason and result of the acts of violence were inappropriate behavior by the patient and their companions (50.6%) and improved behavior by the patients and their companions (21.2%), respectively. There was no meaningful relationship between gender and the reason behind the violence (p = 0.725). Nor was there a meaningful relationship between the rank of the doctor and the reason of the violence (p = 0.096) as well as between the shift on which it happened (p = 0.425).

1005,"Background: We are currently in the midst of an epidemic of synthetic cannabinoid (SC) drug abuse. Pre-hospital providers, emergency physicians, hospitalists, and intensivists are challenged daily by the clinical consequences of this drug epidemic. Clinical effects of drug exposure are unpredictable and poorly characterized. The drugs are made in ad-hoc labs and the pharmaceutical characteristics of them are not entirely understood. Objective: To describe the clinical features exhibited by patients under the influence of specifically identified SCs. Methods: A convenience sample of emergency department (ED) patients presenting to a single urban academic ED with suspected SC exposure were enrolled in the study at the discretion of the treating provider. Blood and/or urine samples were obtained only if already ordered as part of the patient's routine clinical care. Specimens were sent to the Department of Health for identification of specific exposures using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Clinical data including patient age, sex, clinical presentation, initial vital signs, and ultimate disposition was obtained from retrospective chart review. Results: A total of 128 blood/urine samples were tested. Sevntytwo (56.3%) samples were found to be positive for SCs. Clinical data were extracted on 21 patients whose samples tested positive for the SCs AB-Chminaca 3-methyl-butanoic acid, ADB-Chminaca, AB-Chminaca, or a combination of the three. Five (23.8%) werefound to have a concomitant exposure of SC and another substance. Eighteen (85.7%) patients were male. Ages ranged from 21 to 67 years old. 15 (71.4%) patients had an initial presenting systolic blood pressure <115mmHg while 11 (52.4%) had an initial SBP <100mmHg. The average MAP of these 15 patients was 69mmHg. The remaining six patients had an initial SBP >130mmHg with an average MAP of 106mmHg. Of these six patients, three were also positive for a non-synthetic substance. Mental status ranged between somnolent 10 (47.6%), awake and alert 9 (42.8%), to agitated 2 (9.5%).

1008,"Background/Aim. Occupational stress is a term used to define ongoing stress that is related to the workplace. The study was conducted to determine association of occupational stress index (OSI) and its aspects with arterial hypertension and lipid disorders using data from a cross-sectional survey of male professional drivers. Methods. The cross-sectional study was performed in 439 professional drivers divided into groups (city- and intercity bus drivers, truck and taxi drivers). The OSI and OSI aspects (high demands, strictness, underload, extrinsic time pressure, noxious exposure, avoidance and conflict) were calculated using the standardized questionnaire. Determination of serum lipids, blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular risk factors were done. Results. A significant difference in prevalence of diagnosed hypertension and dyslipidemia was found along with a difference in total OSI and OSI aspects among examined subgroups of drivers. A total OSI was highest in city, high in intercity bus drivers, and the lowest one in truck and taxi drivers (82.79 +/- 3.5, 81.28 +/- 3.7, 73.75 +/- 3.5, 71.61 +/- 4.4, respectively; p < 0.01). Similar pattern showed triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol and BP, while HDL-cholesterol showed reverse order (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analyses with multiple OSI aspects adjusted for age and years of exposure showed associations of total OSI with arterial hypertension OR 5.5; 95% CI (2.24-7.95) and dyslipidemia OR 1.43 95% CI (1.09-2.80). Underload was the most important OSI aspect associated with the arterial hypertension OR 1.18; 95% CI (1.04-2.58) and elevated LDL cholesterol 1.26; 95 CI (1.19-2.1). A total OSI had a significant association with elevated LDL cholesterol 2.64; 95% CI (1.19- 7.7), triglycerides OR 3.27; 95% CI (1.20-5.1) and low HDL cholesterol OR 3.29; 95% CI (1.8-5.8) (p < 0.01). Conclusion. The study provides the evidence for the significant association of total OSI and underload with lipid disorders and elevated blood pressure in professional drivers, which could be a possible link between job stress and coronary heart disease. Regular periodical examinations and workplace interventions aimed to decrease total OSI and underload are important aspects in primary prevention and additional reduction of cardiovascular risk.","N.

The mean time to the ED was 4.1+/-0.9 h (3-6.5 h). The most common symptoms were anxiety (97.6%), nausea (56.1%) and vomiting (48.8%). Tests of the blood samples obtained at the ED revealed leucocytosis (11 070.6+/-4302.5/mul), increased blood glucose, LDH, CK and CK-MB levels. Toxicological analysis of blood and urine samples revealed endosulfan as the causative agent. Especially in the rural areas, cases with acute repetitive seizures should suggest endosulfan intoxication when the aetiology is uncertain even in the absence of any signs of intoxication.

1010,"Objectives: The goals of this session are as follows: 1) to learn about the biopsycho-social impact of population displacement; and 2) to learn a specific skill set for strengthening coping for aide workers and for refugees. Methods: This talk will describe how the George Washington (GW) University program in Global Mental Health organized two teams to respond to the different phases of the population displacement during the 2015-2016 refugee migration from Turkey to Greece and the subsequent closure of the Greece-Macedonian border. At the request of the US Embassy in Athens, with the support of the Greek nongovernmental organization, Metadrasi, GW provided a resilience workshop to help participants strengthen their own skills to help their colleagues help the refugees. The workshop focused on mindfulness training, psychological first aid, and hope modules. Results: Humanitarian workers began to experience vicarious trauma and burnout as they witnessed suffering and tried to help refugees struggle with new frustrations and dashed hopes. Specific resilientbuilding skills assisted workers in decreasing burnout, increasing productivity, and improving a sense of efficacy in their work. A multimodal approach that incorporates mindfulness, psychological first aid, and the skills of hope building were helpful to humanitarian workers and their clients. Conclusions: Clinicians working with those who have endured extreme trauma, migration, and human rights abuses are subject to burnout, despair, poor self-care, and more emotional stress. A specific skill set that incorporates mindfulness, psychological first aid, and hope building can assist in building resilience for both clinicians and their clients.","A. Dyer (2017).

1011,"Different strategies have been used to stimulate a return to work (RTW) among individuals suffering from long-term ailments. In Sweden a new law on ""resting disability pension"" permits disability pensioners to go back to work without jeopardising their benefits. In this study different variables related to RTW during 2000 by means of this legislation were identified among disability pensioners with musculoskeletal disorders. Individuals in the study group, when compared to a control group, had more often been disability pensioners for several years, had additional education, estimated their previous job to have been physically strenuous to a lesser degree, were more satisfied with the treatment at the social insurance office and had a more positive self-image.

1012,"Purpose The opioid overdose epidemic in the United States is continuing to escalate. In 2014, there were 18,893 deaths from prescription opioid pain relievers, a 16% increase from 2013. Naloxone hydrochloride (HCl), an opioid antagonist, is now encouraged to be co-prescribed with opioids for patients at increased risk for life-threatening opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). Naloxone HCl has been used parenterally for over 4 decades by emergency personnel for the reversal of OIRD. In the last decade, intranasal administration of naloxone by first responders using an off-label nasal atomization kit has become more prevalent. Data in the literature suggest that abnormal nasal physiology, drug interactions and certain diseases may impact the absorption and bioavailability of intranasally administered drugs, including naloxone; however, clinical studies specifically designed to examine this potentially clinically significant concern have not been conducted. As naloxone HCl is used in lifethreatening opioid emergencies, it is essential to consider the potential impact of common medical conditions and medications on naloxone absorption and exposure by different routes of administration when prescribing naloxone. Method This was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, 3-period crossover pharmacokinetic (PK) study. Key eligibility criteria were men and women 18-55 years of age diagnosed with chronic rhinitis but with no clinically significant nasal abnormalities, surgery, polyps, or trauma and no other clinically significant abnormal findings that would jeopardize the safety of the participants or impact the validity of the study results. The 3 study treatments were intramuscular administration of 2.0 mg naloxone (1 mg/mL in each thigh) using a standard syringe and needle (IM), intranasal administration of 2.0 mg naloxone (1 mg/mL in each nostril) using the LMA MAD NasalTM atomizer (IN), and intranasal administration of 2.0 mg naloxone 30 minutes after intranasal administration of a vasoconstrictor (Oxymetazoline) (V+IN). Blood samples for naloxone concentrations were collected pre-dose through 8-hours post-dose. Standard pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Safety assessments included clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations (including nares and injection site evaluations), 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, adverse event (AE) and concomitant medication monitoring. Results Thirty-six (36) volunteers completed the study (21 male/15 female; mean age 33.7 years; mean body mass index 25.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). C<inf>max</inf> and total naloxone exposure was greatest after IM compared to IN and V+IN. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C<inf>max</inf>, pg/mL) for IM (4539+/-2089) was greater than IN (1288+/-622) or V+IN (747+/-388). Mean area under the concentration- time curve (AUC<inf>0-t</inf>, pg-h/mL) for IM (9400+/-1261) was much greater than IN (1456+/-457) or V+IN (1112+/-391). The geometric mean ratio (GMR) for IM/IN was 3.57 for C<inf>max</inf> and 6.75 and 6.85 for AUC<inf>0-t</inf> and AUC<inf>0-inf</inf>, respectively. The V+IN C<inf>max</inf> was approximately half the IN C<inf>max</inf> (GMR of 0.58) and the GMR for V+IN/IN was 0.76 for both AUC<inf>0-t</inf> and AUC<inf>0-inf</inf>. During the early critical period of absorption, mean AUCpartial (pg-h/ mL) was greater for IN (176+/-110) than V+IN (94+/-88). The GMR for V+IN/IN was 0.38, also indicating a lower naloxone exposure following IN in the presence of the vasoconstrictor. Median T<inf>max</inf> was 15 minutes for IM and IN and 20 minutes for V+IN. There were no serious AEs. Three AEs were reported in the study. An AE of mild headache was reported for 2 volunteers. One volunteer experienced a mild, unrelated AE of epistaxis and was discontinued from the study (as epistaxis could impact absorption and confound the study results), and was not included in the PK analyses. Conclusions In volunteers with chronic rhinitis, overall naloxone absorption was less for IN and V+IN than for IM. Naloxone absorption was slower in V+IN than IN, esulting in markedly lower C<inf>max</inf> and naloxone exposure in the early critical phase. It is reasonable to expect that other IN vasoconstricting agents (e.g., phenylephrine, cocaine) are likely to have similar effects on IN naloxone absorption. The impact of common medical conditions or medications should be considered when selecting the route of naloxone administration to use in treatment of OIRD.","E. Edwards, C. Kessler, G. Kelley, A.

1013,"With the increasing use of cocaine in the United States, cocaine overdose deaths are being reported with increasing frequency. To describe patterns of cocaine use involved in cocaine overdose deaths, we reviewed the postmortem records from the Metropolitan Dade County Medical Examiner Department, Miami, Fla. We identified 239 cocaine overdose deaths from 1971 through 1987. During this period, the incidence of cocaine overdose deaths increased 20-fold, with the largest proportional increases occurring among persons aged older than 24 years, white persons, and men. The percentage of deaths that involved use of cocaine by nonparenteral routes, as well as newer and unknown preparations of cocaine (such as ''crack'' and ''free-base'' cocaine), incraesed. For example, the percentage of deaths that involved use of crack or free-base cocaine increased from 8% in 1981 to 20% in 1987. Persons who died after smoking crack or free-base cocaine had lower blood cocaine levels at autopsy (median level, 0.3 mg/L) than persons who died as a result of using cocaine hydrochloride (median level, 3.7 mg/L). Patterns of cocaine use involved in the epidemic of cocaine overdose deaths are changing. The data suggest that the newer preparations of cocaine, such as crack or free-base cocaine are playing an increasingly important role in this epidemic and that these preparations may be more toxic than cocaine hydrochloride.","L.

1014,"The Pre-Traumatic Vaccination Intervention (PTV) has been developed in an attempt to help rescue personnel cope with anticipated and non-anticipated disasters, and to prevent trauma-related mental disorders during and after a traumatogenic exposure. Contrary to the generally accepted approach of treating trauma after it has occurred, the PTV has been designed to be administered prior to the potentially traumatic event. Based on empirical findings, the PTV training techniques were designed to prepare the participants for distressful situations. Trainees were gradually exposed to increasingly severe sights using cognitive-behavioral techniques along with foreseen situations relating to their profession. Various interventions were aimed at normalizing using personal resources and implementing relaxation techniques. The PTV was administrated as part of the Israeli Defense Forces rescue personnel's and military police training courses. The results of an uncontrolled, preliminary study suggest that the intervention reduced the level of dissociation leading to more awareness to the traumatic event's details, less suffering, lower probability of making mistakes, and increased likelihood of returning to normal functioning. Lower dissociation may suggest a lower probability to be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder among rescue personnel.","N. Essar, Y. Palgi, R. Saar, M. Ben-Ezra (2010).

1015,"Institutional environments are challenging settings in which to provide rehabilitation. This study describes the time use of a group of inpatients, the majority diagnosed with schizophrenia, in a secure forensic psychiatric unit in Australia. Time diaries, interviews and fieldnotes were collected over 5 weeks. Eight participants completed time diaries for two consecutive days, of whom five were also interviewed using the Occupational Performance History Interview II. The participants' time use was dominated by personal care and leisure occupations. In general, the participants were dissatisfied with their time use, describing themselves as 'bored' or 'killing time'. Many perceived that the environment created barriers to their participation in valued occupations, yet some also found occupations that provided solace, challenge or a connection with the outside world. The findings indicate the importance of understanding individuals' unique occupational histories, interests and skills in order to create opportunities to engage them in relevant occupations that use personal resources, as part of forensic rehabilitation programmes, and the utility of the Occupational Performance History Interview II in this context. Further research exploring patient and staff perspectives on the challenges of occupational programming in forensic settings and the longitudinal impact of such programming on inpatients' occupational functioning, health and wellbeing is recommended.","L.

1016,"BACKGROUND: Nonmedical use of prescription opioids (NM-POs) has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Unintentional overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999. Herein, we examine NM-POs and their associated risk factors among two cohorts of trauma patients with at-risk drinking. METHODS: This secondary analysis examines NM-PO from two separate randomized trials that delivered brief alcohol interventions to patients in urban Level I trauma centers. In the first study, data were collected from 1,493 injured patients at a single trauma center, and in the second study, data were collected from 596 injured patients at two trauma centers. All participants were considered at-risk drinkers because they were admitted for an alcohol related injury as indicated by a positive blood alcohol concentration and/or self-reported heavy drinking. RESULTS: In Study 1, NM-PO nearly doubled from 5.2% before admission to 9.8% at 6 months after discharge. At 12 months after discharge, those who reported NM-PO (odds ratio [OR], 2.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-4.15) and drug use (OR, 2.62, 95% CI, 1.70-4.04) before admission had the highest odds for postdischarge NM-PO. In Study 2, NM-PO increased from 5.2% before admission to 6.8% at 12 months after discharge. At 12 months after discharge, those who reported NM-PO (OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.10-6.66) or drug use (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 2.00-8.21) before admission had the highest odds for postdischarge NM-PO. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there is an increased risk of postdischarge NM-PO among injured patients with at-risk drinking, particularly among those with a recent history of drug use or NM-PO. Cautious, evidence-based opioid prescribing may reduce exposure to prescription opioids in high-risk patients, risk of subsequent misuse, and possible diversion.

1017,"INTRODUCTION: Early recognition of the signs and symptoms of a heart attack can lead to reduced morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A workplace intervention was conducted among 523 Montana state health department employees in 2003 to increase awareness of the signs and symptoms of heart attack and the need to use 911. All employees received an Act in Time to Heart Attack Signs brochure and wallet card with their paychecks. Act in Time posters were placed in key workplace areas. A weekly e-mail message, including a contest entry opportunity addressing the signs and symptoms of heart attack, was sent to all employees. Baseline and follow-up telephone surveys were conducted to evaluate intervention effectiveness. RESULTS: Awareness of heart attack signs and symptoms and the need to call 911 increased significantly among employees from baseline to follow-up: pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back (awareness increased from 69% to 91%); feeling weak, light-headed, or faint (awareness increased from 79% to 89%); call 911 if someone is having a heart attack or stroke (awareness increased from 84% to 90%). Awareness of chest pain, pain or discomfort in the arms or shoulders, and shortness of breath were more than 90% at baseline and did not increase significantly at follow-up. At baseline, 69% of respondents correctly reported five or more of the signs and symptoms of heart attack; 89% reported correctly at follow-up.

1018,"Objective. To determine the association between patient admission due to trauma and the consumption of marihuana, cocaine and bazooka (basic cocaine paste) at the Central Hospital of Valencia, Venezuela. Material and methods. 148 subjects were studied who had entered the emergency room due to lesions caused by aggression (AL), traffic accidents (TA), work-related accidents (WRA), self-inflicted injury (SII) and intoxication (INT). A questionnaire was applied and toxicology analyses performed. Results. Drug consumption, alone or in combination, was found in 23.6% of individuals (13.5% cocaine, 7.4% marihuana and 2.7% both). Of the cocaine positive, 50% entered for AL, 20% for INT, 10% for SII, 5% for WRA and 15% for other causes. Of the marihuana positive, 36.4% entered for TA, followed by 27.3% for WRA, 18.18% for AL, 9.09% for INT and 9.09% for other causes. For combined drug consumption, entries for AL were 75% and for WRA, 25%. Alcohol consumption associated to cocaine was 50%, to marihuana, 9% and to combined drugs, 25%. Conclusions.

1020,"BACKGROUND: Among HIV+ patients, alcohol use is a highly prevalent risk factor for both HIV transmission and poor adherence to HIV treatment. The large-scale implementation of effective interventions for treating alcohol problems remains a challenge in low-income countries with generalized HIV epidemics. It is essential to consider an intervention's cost-effectiveness in dollars-per-health-outcome, and the long-term economic impact -or ""return on investment"" in monetary terms. METHODS: We conducted a cost-benefit analysis, measuring economic return on investment, of a task-shifted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered by paraprofessionals to reduce alcohol use in a modeled cohort of 13,440 outpatients in Kenya. In our base-case, we estimated the costs and economic benefits from a societal perspective across a six-year time horizon, with a 3% annual discount rate. Costs included all costs associated with training and administering task-shifted CBT therapy. Benefits included the economic impact of lowered HIV incidence as well as the improvements in household and labor-force productivity. We conducted univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results. RESULTS: Under the base case, total costs for CBT rollout was $554,000, the value of benefits were $628,000, and the benefit-to-cost ratio was 1.13. Sensitivity analyses showed that under most assumptions, the benefit-to-cost ratio remained above unity indicating that the intervention was cost-saving (i.e., had positive return on investment). The duration of the treatment effect most effected the results in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: CBT can be effectively and economically task-shifted to paraprofessionals in Kenya. The intervention can generate not only reductions in morbidity and mortality, but also economic savings for the health system in the medium and long term. The findings have implications for other countries with generalized HIV epidemics, high prevalence of alcohol consumption, and shortages of mental health professionals.

1022,"Psychophysiological measures offer objective information for workplace design according to user requirements. They are, however, rarely applied in industrial practice due to weak points from the designer's point of view, such as the differentiation of various superimposed stressors, inter-individual differences, and the effort required for data aquisition and handling. In this study a set of psychophysiological methods was used to analyse bus driver workplaces as a basis for redesign, and afterwards to evaluate design improvements. During inner-city operation bus drivers are exposed to a particular workload situation, especially due to the high density of traffic and bus stops. Their job is characterized by highly frequent and often simultaneous task execution, performed with a compulsory body posture and under exposure to vibration and noise. To reduce the workload related to the equipment and tasks of bus driving, a research project was initiated to design a new driver workplace that meets the specific ergonomic requirements of the drivers. A detailed workload analysis, consisting of a task analysis, a strain analysis derived from ECG measures and an eye movement analysis was performed during public bus driving in different cities and with different drivers and bus types. Although the results have to be considered as somewhat limited owing to the methodological restraints and conditions of a field study, they provided valuable guidance for design. A new concept for the driver cabin was created based on this database. After installation, this design was evaluated by similar psychophysiological measures. Comparison of the pre- and post results indicates that the redesigned work station reduced workload levels.","M. Gobel, J. Springer, J. Scherff (1998).

1024,"Prescription opioid overdoses and deaths constitute a public health epidemic, and recent studies show that emergency department (ED) prescribers may contribute to this crisis. We hypothesized that a multidisciplinary educational intervention would decrease ED opioid packs dispensed at discharge. Methods: This prospective study implemented a ""bundle"" of interdisciplinary educational modalities: lectures, journal clubs, case discussions, and an electronic medical record decision support tool. Implementation occurred in 2 urban EDs in the same health system at different times (""affiliate,"" September 2011; ""primary,"" January 2012) to better distinguish its effects. The primary outcome was preintervention/postintervention change in opioid discharge packs dispensed to all patients treated and discharged through August 2012 and was assessed by 2-way analysis of variance. The secondary outcome was bivariate analysis (using Fisher exact test) of change in opioid dispensing among patients with known risk factors for prescription opioid dependence: age less than 65 years, history of substance abuse, chronic pain, or psychiatric disorders. Results: A total of 71,512 and 45,746 patients were evaluated and discharged from primary and affiliate EDs, respectively. Orders for opioid discharge packs decreased from 13.9% to 8.4% and 4.7% to 1.9% at the primary and affiliate hospitals (P <.0001).

1025,"BACKGROUND: It has been reported that cocaine is associated with trauma patients at epidemic proportions. However, the injury patterns, complications, and mortality in cocaine test-positive trauma patients are not well known. METHODS: Retrospective review of all trauma patients with toxicology screen at a Level I trauma center between January 2002 and December 2005. A total of 1,096 patients were positive for cocaine but no other substances of abuse or alcohol. Nine hundred eighty-five patients of these cocaine test-positive patients were matched to a pool of 4,846 toxicology test-negative patients admitted during the same period with respect to age (<=18, 19-55, >55 years), gender, mechanism (blunt, penetrating), Injury Severity Score (ISS <16, 16-25, >25), head Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS <3, >=3), chest AIS (<3, >=3), abdominal AIS (<3, >=3), and extremity AIS (<3, >=3). Matched pairs of binary outcomes were analyzed using McNemars, and continuous data were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. RESULTS: The two groups had similar injury patterns and there was no difference in surgical procedures between cocaine test-positive and toxicology test-negative patients. Overall, there was no difference in mortality between the cocaine and test-negative patients (6.5% vs. 6.2%; p = 0.81), or between cocaine and test-negative patients with an ISS <16 (1.4% vs. 1.5%; p = 1.00), ISS 16 to 25 (13% vs. 12%; p = 1.00), and ISS >25 (59% vs. 54%; p = 0.70). The overall incidence of complications was 4% in cocaine patients and 3.6% in test-negative patients (p = 0.72), although the incidence of pneumonia was significantly higher in the cocaine test-positive patients (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Cocaine abuse in trauma patients is concerning. This study did not show a difference in mortality or length of intensive care unit stay between cocaine positive and negative patients.

We examined the hypothesis that downtime post-CI is associated with fewer symptoms of four long-term emotional sequelae in EMT/paramedics: depression, PTSD, burnout, and stress-related emotional symptoms (accepted cut-offs defined high scores). Two hundred and one paramedics completed questionnaires concerning an index CI including downtime experience, acute distress, and current emotional symptoms. Nearly 75% received downtime; 59% found it helpful; 84% spent it with peers. Downtime was associated only with lower depression symptoms, not with other outcomes. The optimal period for downtime was between < 30 minutes and end of shift, with > 1 day being less effective. Planned testing of mediation of the association between downtime and depression by either calming acute post-CI distress or feeling helped by others was not performed because post-CI distress was not associated with downtime and perceived helpfulness was not associated with depression. These results suggest that outcomes of CIs follow different pathways and may require different interventions. A brief downtime is a relatively simple and effective strategy in preventing later depression symptoms. © 2014 Janice Halpern et al.","J. Halpern, R. G. Maunder, B. Schwartz, M. Gurevich (2014).

1028,"Professional bus drivers are exposed to environments containing air pollution and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can induce cellular oxidative stress and DNA damage. This study investigated environmental factors associated with oxidative DNA damage in a cohort of long-distance bus drivers. In a comparison study, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a biomarker of DNA oxidative damage, was examined in 120 male long-distance bus drivers and 58 male office workers in Taiwan. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze association between urinary 8-OHdG levels and environmental factors. Bus drivers had higher urinary 8-OHdG levels (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 9.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.5-28.2) compared with office workers. Increased urinary 8-OHdG level was significantly related to cigarette smoking (aOR = 18.0, 95% CI = 7.1-52.1), consumption of energy drinks (aOR = 5.0, 95% CI = 2.1-12.6), and regular exercise (aOR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.5-10.2). A strong exposure-response relationship was found between urinary 8-OHdG and urinary cotinine (p < 0.0001). Among nonsmokers, bus drivers (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.0-17.7) had higher urinary 8-OHdG than office workers. Among both bus drivers and office workers, those who drank energy drinks (aOR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.2-12.2) had higher 8-OHdG levels than those who did not drink energy drinks. Adjusted for smoking, levels of 8-OHdG were increased in long-distance bus drivers exposed to traffic exhaust and ingested energy drinks. Future studies should explore what aspects of energy drinks may contribute to increased urinary 8-OHdG. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Y. Y. Han, M. Donovan, F. C. Sung (2010).

1029,"Background: For decades, Thailand has experienced high rates of illicit drug use and related harms. In response, the Thai government has relied on drug law enforcement to address this problem. Despite these efforts, high rates of drug use persist, and Thailand has been contending with an enduring epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among people who inject drugs (IDU).Methods: In response to concerns regarding drug-related harm in Thailand and a lack of research focused on the experiences and needs of Thai IDU, the Mitsampan Community Research Project was launched in 2008. The project involved administering surveys capturing a range of behavioral and other data to community-recruited IDU in Bangkok in 2008 and 2009.Results: In total, 468 IDU in Bangkok were enrolled in the project. Results revealed high rates of midazolam injection, non-fatal overdose and incarceration. Syringe sharing remained widespread among this population, driven primarily by problems with access to syringes and methamphetamine injection. As well, reports of police abuse were common and found to be associated with high-risk behavior. Problems with access to evidence-based drug treatment and HIV prevention programs were also documented. Although compulsory drug detention centers are widely used in Thailand, data suggested that these centers have little impact on drug use behaviors among IDU in Bangkok.Conclusions: The findings from this project highlight many ongoing health and social problems related to illicit drug use and drug policies in Bangkok. They also suggest that the emphasis on criminal justice approaches has resulted in human rights violations at the hands of police, and harms associated with compulsory drug detention and incarceration. Collectively, the findings indicate the urgent need for the implementation of evidence-based policies and programs in this setting. © 2013 Hayashi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","K.

1030,"Background: There have been sporadic reports of hypersensitivity reactions to plants of the Cannabinaceae family (hemp and hops), but it has remained unclear whether these reactions are immunologic or nonimmunologic in nature. Objective: We examined the IgE-binding and histamine-releasing properties of hashish and marijuana extracts by CAP-FEIA and a basophil histamine release test. Methods: Two workers at a forensic laboratory suffered from nasal congestion, rhinitis, sneezing and asthmatic symptoms upon occupational contact with hashish or marijuana, which they had handled frequently for 25 and 16 years, respectively. Neither patient had a history of atopic disease. Serum was analyzed for specific IgE antibodies to hashish or marijuana extract by research prototype ImmunoCAP, and histamine release from basophils upon exposure to hashish or marijuana extracts was assessed. Results were matched to those of 4 nonatopic and 10 atopic control subjects with no known history of recreational or occupational exposure to marijuana or hashish. Results: Patient 1 had specific IgE to both hashish and marijuana (CAP class 2), and patient 2 to marijuana only (CAP class 2). Controls proved negative for specific IgE except for 2 atopic individuals with CAP class 1 to marijuana and 1 other atopic individual with CAP class 1 to hashish. Stimulation of basophils with hashish or marijuana extracts elicited histamine release from basophils of both patients and 4 atopic control subjects. Conclusions: Our results suggest an IgE-related pathomechanism for hypersensitivity reactions to marijuana or hashish. © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.","T. Herzinger, P. Schopf, B. Przybilla, F.

1031,"Objective: Misuse, abuse, and diversion of prescription drugs are large and growing public health problems that have resulted in an overdose epidemic. We investigated whether short-acting or extended-release opioids were more frequently prescribed to those who died of an overdose and whether there was a linear relationship between dose strength and associated overdose deaths. Methods: The study population was North Carolina residents in 2010. We conducted a retrospective, population-based, descriptive study of medication histories of overdose decedents using data from vital statistics, medical examiner records, and a prescription drug monitoring program. Results: Unintentional or undetermined drug overdoses were responsible for 892 deaths. Out of 191 deaths involving methadone, only two were patients in opioid treatment programs. Immediate-release oxycodone was involved in the greatest number of opioid-related deaths. Out of 221 oxycodone deaths, 134 (61%) of the decedents filled a prescription for oxycodone in the 60 days prior to death. The most common strength dispensed within 60 days to a decedent who died of an oxycodone overdose was 10mg for immediate-release (72 prescriptions). Immediate-release oxycodone products (rho=1.00, P<0.01) and extended-release fentanyl products (rho=1.00, P<0.01) showed strong increasing linear trends between dose strength and proportion of prescriptions dispensed to decedents. Conclusions: A significant proportion of overdose decedents had been prescribed the same type of drugs that contributed to their death, especially for decedents who died from overdoses involving oxycodone, hydrocodone, and alprazolam. Higher dose strengths for certain opioids had higher associated mortality, and certain immediate-release opioids may be considered for public health prevention efforts. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","A.

1032,"Previous studies on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) investigated a variety of treatments and included mostly patients victims of sexual and combat assault. This study aimed to determine the short-term efficacy of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) in occupation-based PTSD. Employees of the public transportation system in Stockholm, who had been experiencing a person-under-train accident or had been assaulted at work were recruited. Subjects with trauma exposure since more than 3 months but less than 6 years were included. Twenty-four subjects who fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD were randomized to either EMDR therapy (n=13) or waiting list (WL, n=11). They were assessed pre-treatment and shortly after completion of treatment or WL period. The pre-defined primary outcome variable was full PTSD diagnosis. Secondary outcome variables were the results of various psychometric scales. Twelve participants began and completed five sessions of EMDR and nine completed the WL. After therapy, eight subjects in the EMDR group (67%) and one (11%) in WL did not fulfil the criteria for PTSD diagnosis (difference, P=0.02). Among the secondary outcome variables, there were significant differences post-treatment between the groups EMDR/WL in Global Assessment of Function (GAF) score and Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) score. This study indicates that EMDR has a short-term effect on PTSD in public transportation workers exposed to occupational traumatic events. Such intensive and brief therapy might be further validated in larger samples of exposed workers with longer periods of follow-up.","G. Hogberg, M. Pagani, O. Sundin, J. Soares, A. Aberg-Wistedt, B.

1033,"Objective Clozapine is used in the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia and is effective in reducing aggression; however a subgroup of patients is poorly responsive. For violent patients in this group, there is limited literature on the use of strategies to augment clozapine with other agents. Here we present a case series of 6 schizophrenia patients, within a high-security hospital, who have a history of serious violence and who were treated with clozapine augmented with amisulpride. Methods We reviewed case notes and health records for evidence of violence/aggression and positive factors such as engagement in activities, and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores were formulated. We also examined metabolic parameters before and after augmentation. Results All 6 of the patients showed clinical improvement in symptoms and a reduction in their risk of violence to others. Five patients had a reduction in number of violent/aggressive incidents, and all patients showed improvement in engagement in occupational, vocational, and/or psychological work. Metabolic parameters were largely unchanged except for 1 patient whose Body Mass Index (BMI) increased. Five patients reported side effects as unchanged or improved. Conclusion These schizophrenia patients with a history of violence showed clinical improvement and reduced aggression and violence with amisulpride augmentation of clozapine.

1035,"INTRODUCTION: Violent patients in the prehospital environment pose a threat to health care workers tasked with managing their medical conditions. While research has focused on methods to control the agitated patient in the emergency department (ED), there is a paucity of data looking at the optimal approach to subdue these patients safely in the prehospital setting. Hypothesis This study evaluated the efficacy of two different intramuscular medications, midazolam and haloperidol, to determine their efficacy in sedating agitated patients in the prehospital setting. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, observational trial wherein agitated patients were administered intramuscular haloperidol or intramuscular midazolam to control agitation. Agitation was quantified by the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). Paramedics recorded the RASS and vital signs every five minutes during transport and again upon arrival to the ED. The primary outcome was mean time to achieve a RASS less than +1. Secondary outcomes included mean time for patients to return to baseline mental status and adverse events. RESULTS: Five patients were enrolled in each study group. In the haloperidol group, the mean time to achieve a RASS score of less than +1 was 24.8 minutes (95% CI, 8-49 minutes), and the mean time for the return of a normal mental status was 84 minutes (95% CI, 0-202 minutes). Two patients required additional prehospital doses for adequate sedation. There were no adverse events recorded in the patients administered haloperidol. In the midazolam group, the mean time to achieve a RASS score of less than +1 was 13.5 minutes (95% CI, 8-19 minutes) and the mean time for the return of normal mental status was 105 minutes (95% CI, 0-178 minutes). One patient required additional sedation in the ED. There were no adverse events recorded among the patients administered midazolam. CONCLUSIONS: Midazolam and haloperidol administered intramuscularly appear equally effective for sedating an agitated patient in the prehospital setting. Midazolam appears to have a faster onset of action, as evidenced by the shorter time required to achieve a RASS score of less than +1 in the patients who received midazolam. Haloperidol offers an alternative option for the sedation of an agitated patient. Further studies should focus on continued investigation into appropriate sedation of agitated patients in the prehospital setting.","D. L. Isenberg, D. Jacobs (2015).

1037,"Traumatic events can occur and adversely affect people during their lifetime. Natural disasters such as the earthquake in Pakistan in 2005 or the Tsunami in Asia in 2004, terrorist atrocities around the world, or personal events such as physical or sexual assault, can result in psychological difficulties for those people directly affected by these events. The diagnostic term Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, DSM IV, 1994) is generally used to explain the often-severe psychological sequalae (van der Kolk, 1996; Servan-Schreiber, 2004; Shapiro, 1995) that people may exhibit when directly affected by trauma. However, what of those people not directly involved in the trauma, but those who have borne witness to it, either by listening to the stories of survivors, or in the case of the helping professionals (such as police officers, nurses, doctors, psychotherapists, fire-fighters), actively working with survivors in psychological distress?

1038,"Background Mental health complaints are quite common in health care employees and can have adverse effects on work functioning. The aim of this study was to evaluate an e-mental health (EMH) approach to workers' health surveillance (WHS) for nurses and allied health professionals. Using the waiting-list group of a previous randomized controlled trial with high dropout and low compliance to the intervention, we studied the pre- and posteffects of the EMH approach in a larger group of participants. Methods We applied a pretest-posttest study design. The WHS consisted of online screening on impaired work functioning and mental health followed by online automatically generated personalized feedback, online tailored advice, and access to self-help EMH interventions. The effects on work functioning, stress, and work-related fatigue after 3 months were analyzed using paired t tests and effect sizes. Results One hundred and twenty-eight nurses and allied health professionals participated at pretest as well as posttest. Significant improvements were found on work functioning (p = 0.01) and work-related fatigue (p < 0.01). Work functioning had relevantly improved in 30% of participants. A small meaningful effect on stress was found (Cohen d =.23) in the participants who had logged onto an EMH intervention (20%, n = 26). Conclusion The EMH approach to WHS improves the work functioning and mental health of nurses and allied health professionals. However, because we found small effects and participation in the offered EMH interventions was low, there is ample room for improvement.

Workplace health promotion programmes have shown positive return on investment (ROI). Little is known about how similar programmes would impact injury and cost among firefighters. Aims: To evaluate the impact of a workplace health promotion intervention on workers' compensation (WC) claims and medical costs among Oregon fire departments participating in the PHLAME (Promoting Healthy Lifestyles: Alternative Models' Effects) health promotion programme compared with Oregon fire departments not participating in PHLAME. Methods: Data from firefighters from four large urban fire departments in Oregon were evaluated using a retrospective quasi-experimental study design. Outcomes were (i) total annual firefighter WC claims, (ii) total annual incurred medical costs prior to and after implementation of the PHLAME firefighter worksite health promotion programme (iii) and an ROI analysis. Results: Data were obtained from 1369 firefighters (mean age of 42 years, 91% white, 93% male). WC claims (P < 0.001) and medical costs (P < 0.01) were significantly lower among PHLAME fire departments compared with Oregon fire departments not participating in the programme.

1041,"Introduction: To raise awareness among health care workers of the risk of withdrawal symptoms after longstanding and intense abuse of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid. Case presentation: A 23 year old Caucasian woman presented with gamma-hydroxybutyric addiction and withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms of gamma-hydroxybutyric withdrawal in this patient initially went unrecognized, upon which her situation deteriorated in such a way that she needed to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for airway protection and mechanical ventilation. Treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines led to liberation of the ventilator and further recovery. Conclusion: Withdrawal symptoms of gamma-hydroxybutyric addiction are often not well recognized and the responsible physicians at Emergency Department, Intensive Care Unit and the Psychiatry ward need better understanding of diagnose and treatment.

1042,"Background. Chronic low back pain (LBP) is a major public and occupational health problem, which is associated with very high costs. Although medical costs for chronic LBP are high, most costs are related to productivity losses due to sick leave. In general, the prognosis for return to work (RTW) is good but a minority of patients will be absent long-term from work. Research shows that work related problems are associated with an increase in seeking medical care and sick leave. Usual medical care of patients is however, not specifically aimed at RTW. The objective is to present the design of a randomized controlled trial, i.e. the BRIDGE-study, evaluating the effectiveness in improving RTW and cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary outpatient care program situated in both primary and outpatient care setting compared with usual clinical medical care for patients with chronic LBP. Methods/Design. The design is a randomized controlled trial with an economic evaluation alongside. The study population consists of patients with chronic LBP who are completely or partially sick listed and visit an outpatient clinic of one of the participating hospitals in Amsterdam (the Netherlands). Two interventions will be compared. 1. a multidisciplinary outpatient care program consisting of a workplace intervention based on participatory ergonomics, and a graded activity program using cognitive behavioural principles. 2. usual care provided by the medical specialist, the occupational physician, the patient's general practitioner and allied health professionals. The primary outcome measure is sick leave duration until full RTW. Sick leave duration is measured monthly by self-report during one year. Data on sick leave during one-year follow-up are also requested form the employers. Secondary outcome measures are pain intensity, functional status, pain coping, patient satisfaction and quality of life. Outcome measures are assessed before randomization and 3, 6, and 12 months later. All statistical analysis will be performed according to the intension-to-treat principle. Discussion. Usual care of primary and outpatient health services isn't directly aimed at RTW, therefor it is desirable to look for care which is aimed at RTW. Research shows that several occupational interventions in primary care are aimed at RTW. They have shown a significant reduction of sick leave for employee with LBP. If a comparable reduction of sick leave duration of patients with chronic LBP of who attend an outpatient clinic can be achieved, such reductions will be obviously substantial for the Netherlands and will have a considerable impact.

1043,"Background: Partner violence is a serious public health problem, due to their potential short-, medium- or long-term physical and psychological consequences. Violence is unbearable when it occurs between family members, and often remains unrevealed, invisible, hidden and repeated. The woman possibly feels trapped in a relationship of imprisonment. International studies have well-explored the psychopathological aspects of physical and sexual abuse within couples, but few explored the clinical profile of women victims of psychological violence or moral harassment. This study aims to define the clinical and psychopathological profile of women who are victims of psychological intimate partner violence. Methods: We contacted 628 women who consulted consecutively at the emergency ward of a university hospital covering a 300,000 catchment area. The telephone screening of psychological violence was therefore carried out using the Women's Experience with Battering (WEB) questionnaire (N = 226). An optional clinical interview was given to the women declaring themselves as victims of psychological intimate partner violence (N = 56) to evaluate the life events and the psychiatric disorders according to the DSM-IV. Finally, 43 participants (77%) gave their opinion on the qualitative aspects of the WEB questionnaire and their level of ease with this report. Results: In 63% (N = 35) of the cases, the victims and their partners had a rather high socioprofessional level. Women refer to emergency ward mostly for complaint of vague idiopathic pain (49%) or for psychiatric disorders (52%) with predominance of anxiety (28%) or addictive disorders (19%). The prevalence of potentially traumatic life events was found to be high in this group (83%). The traumatic psychological intimate partner violence was associated with a heightened prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, like anxiety (72%), depression (100%), posttraumatic stress disorder (100%), and addiction to alcohol (100%) or another psychoactive substance (50%). Finally, 44% of the women linked their gynecoobstetrical history to their psychological state of the relationship. Conclusion: Even if the psychopathological profile is relatively close, the sociodemographic profile of victims of psychological intimate partner violence is singularly different than that of the victims of physical or sexual abuse. This work underlines the necessity of a systematic screening of these aspects of violence in emergency medical services. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.","C. Lamy, F. Dubois, N.

1044,"Background: Florida, the epicenter of the recent prescription drug epidemic in the United States, maintains a statewide drug mortality surveillance system. We evaluated yearly profiles, demographic characteristics, and correlation between drug trends to understand the factors influencing drug-induced mortality. Methods: All drug-related deaths reported to the Florida Medical Examiners Commission during 2001-2012 were included (n=92,596). A death was considered ""drug-related"" if at least one drug was identified in the decedent. Depending on its contribution to death, a drug could be listed as a causative agent or merely present, but not both. Results: Rate of drug-caused deaths was 8.0 per 100,000 population in 2001, increasing to 17.0 in 2010 and then decreasing to 13.9 in 2012. Benzodiazepines had the highest mortality rate in 2010, although <10% were solely due these drugs. Opioid-caused mortality rate also peaked in 2010 and started to decline (-28%) in 2010-2012. The heroin-caused mortality rates were negatively correlated with opioids and benzodiazepines (rho's >= -0.670; P<=. 0.034). Ethanol- and cocaine-mortality rates stabilized to 3.0-3.1 and 2.8-3.0 per 100,000 over 2009-2012, respectively. Amphetamines, zolpidem, and inhalants-caused deaths were on the rise with rates of <=0.6 per 100,000. Conclusions: Overall declines in benzodiazepine- and opioid-caused deaths in 2011-2012 may have been related to Florida's attempts to regulate prescription drug abuse. This period, however, was also marked by a rise in heroin-caused mortality, which may reflect growing use of heroin as an alternative. Increases in amphetamines, zolpidem, and inhalants-induced mortality are an additional public health concern. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","D. Lee, C. Delcher, M. M. Maldonado-Molina, L.

For emergency physicians it is important to be aware of iritis, uveitis, or chorioretinitis as ocular manifestations of neurosyphilis especially in this high-risk population and to obtain RPR and HIV tests in the ED to facilitate early diagnosis, and treatment and to prevent irreversible vision loss.

1046,"Methadone is increasingly implicated in unintentional overdose deaths. Despite major interventions, rates continue to remain high. One primary intervention, Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) are limited in their ability to impact this epidemic due to federal law restricting Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) from sharing data to PDMPs, despite being a major source of Methadone dispensing. Methods: This retrospective, observational study analyzed all prescription-related deaths occurring in San Diego County during the year 2013 with a specific focus on methadone-related deaths. All patients designated by medical examiner to have died by unintentional prescription were then referenced in the California PDMP, the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES). Results: As a whole, patients who died had a high number of average prescriptions, 21, and averaged 4.5 different providers, and three different pharmacies. Methadone-related deaths (MRD) accounted for 46 out of the 254 total patient deaths (18.1%). Methadone prescriptions were found in 14 patients with PDMP reports, 10 of who had methadone on toxicology report. Notably, 100% of methadone prescribed by primary care specialists. MRD patients were less likely to have toxicology reports matching PDMP data compared to other related drug deaths (20.6 vs. 61.2%, p<. 0.0001). Of the 46 methadone deaths, only 10 (29.4%) had prescriptions for methadone recorded in the database. Out of the 51 patients with only one drug recorded at death, methadone was most common (n = 12; 23.5%). While all deaths had a notably high rate of chronic prescriptions at death (68.8% compared to 2% for all patients in CURES), there was no significant difference between MRD and other drug-related deaths (73.5 vs. 67.8%, p = 0.68, respectively). MRD patients were less likely than other drug patients to have matching PDMP data without any illicit substance or alcohol (14.7 vs. 41.4%, p = 0.003, respectively). Conclusion: Methadone is a long-acting opioid that carries a higher risk profile than other opioids. In San Diego, the great majority of MRD had no data on methadone in the statewide PDMP database, bringing to question the restriction of OTP clinics from uploading information into the database. A risk-benefit analysis should be made to consider changing laws that would allow for OTP to input data into PDMP. OTP should make it standard of care to check PDMP data on their patients. Methadone prescribed for pain management should be limited to the most compliant patients. Copyright © 2015 .","R. Lev, S. Petro, A. Lee, O. Lee, J. Lucas, E. M. Castillo, J. Egnatios, G. M.

1047,"Background The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention have declared prescription drug abuse an epidemic in the United States. However, demographic data correlating prescription-related deaths with actual prescriptions written is not well described. The purpose of this study is to compare toxicology reports on autopsy for prescription-related deaths with Prescription Drug Monitor Program (PDMP) data. Methods This is a retrospective analysis comparing 2013 San Diego Medical Examiner data on 254 unintentional prescription-related deaths obtained for 12 months before death with data from the California PDMP. Data were analyzed on age, sex, whether there was information on the PDMP, types and quantities of prescribed medications, number of pharmacies and providers involved, and whether there was a match between the Medical Examiner toxicology report and data from the PDMP. Results In 2013, there were 254 unintentional prescription-related deaths; 186 patients (73%) had PDMP data 12 months before death. Ingesting prescription medications with illicit drugs, alcohol, and/or over-the-counter medications accounted for 40% of the unintentional deaths. Opioids were responsible for the majority of single medication deaths (36; 70.6%). The average number of prescriptions was 23.5 per patient, and the average patient used 3 pharmacies and had 4.5 providers. Chronic prescription use was found in 68.8% of patients with PDMP data. Conclusions The PDMP data highlight important patterns that can provide valuable insight to clinicians making decisions regarding types and amounts of medications they prescribe. Although there is no guaranteed solution to prevent prescription-related deaths, PDMP data can be useful to prevent coprescribing and medication interaction and by following best clinical practices.

1048,"Objectives: To measure and compare the urinary cotinine concentration (U-cotinine) in non-smoking cabin attendants (C/A) working with the Scandinavian Airlines System, before and after work on intercontinental flights with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Methods: The study material consisted of 24 cabin attendants and one pilot, all volunteers and all without exposure to ETS in the home, working on 15 intercontinental flights. Information on age, gender and occupation was gathered, as well as possible sources of ETS exposure in other places, outside work and during previous flights, during a 3-day period prior to the investigation. Urine samples were taken before departure and after landing, on board, and were kept frozen (-20degreeC) until analysis. Cotinine was analyzed by a previously developed gas chromatographic method, using mass spectrometry (MS) with selected-ion monitoring (SIM). The difference in U-cotinine before and after the flight was compared. Moreover, the change in U-cotinine during the flight was related to occupation (work in the forward or aft galley) and observed degree of smoking during each flight. Results: The median U-cotinine was 3.71 mug/g crea; 2.4 mug/l (unadjusted) (interquartile range 2.08-8.67 mug/g crea) before departure, and 6.37 mug/g crea; 7.1 mug/l (interquartile range 3.98-19Clg/g crea) after landing, a significant difference (P < 0.003). C/A in the aft galley had a significantly higher concentration of U-cotinine after landing than subjects working in the front of the aircraft (P = 0.01). In C/A working in the aft galley, the median increase of U-cotinine was 3.67 mug/g crea, 3.2 mug/l (interquartile range 0.04-13.8 mug/g crea) during flight. In contrast, those seven subjects working in the forward part of the aircraft had no increase in U-cotinine during the flight (median increase 0.97 mug/g crea; 0.5 mug/l interquartile range 0.27-2.65 mug/g crea). Conclusion: Tobacco smoking in commercial aircraft may cause significant exposure to environmental tobacco smoke among C/A working in the aft galley, despite high air exchange rates and spatial separation between smokers and nonsmokers. This agrees with earlier studies, as well as measurements on the aircraft, showing a higher degree of ETS-related air pollution in the aft galley than in the forward galley. The average cotinine concentration in urine was similar to that in other groups with occupational exposure to ETS, e.g., restaurant staff: police interrogators and office workers. Since smoking in commercial aircraft may result in an involuntary exposure to ETS among non-smokers, it should be avoided.","T. Lindgren, S. Willers, G. Skarping, D. Norback (1999).

1050,"Background: Opioid use, abuse and prescribing habits have become a significant public health issue. There has been 400% increase in opioid prescribing over 10 years. Estimates show 100 million chronic pain patients at significant cost to the health system. In 2014,10.3 million people reported using prescription opioids non medically. ED visits involving misuse or abuse of prescription opioids increased 153% between 2004 and 2011. Between 2000 and 2014 the rates of death from prescription opioid overdose increased from 1.5 to 5.9 deaths per 100,000. Most physicians and prescribers do not have extensive knowledge of Addiction Medicine principles and may not adequately recognize risks of abuse or overdose. Methods: This was a case control study using a single round, categorical and Likert scale survey to a sample of ambulatory, non-urgent patients presenting to one of two campuses of an urban, academic Emergency Department-an urban tertiary care hospital and Level 1 Trauma Center with an annual census of 65,000 and an urban community based hospital with an annual census of 42,000. Cases were identified by the presence of an opiate medication on their triagemedication list. Control subjects with no self-reported opiate use were recruited near concurrent to cases. Any patient with an ESI of 1 or 2, non-English speakers and those unable to provide consent were excluded. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: A total of 290 patients were enrolled, 157 cases and 133 controls. The average age of the opiate users was 57.2 years (SD 14.90) vs 59.7 years (SD 15.07) for controls. There were no statistically significant differences among the groups for gender or race. Prescription opiate users were more likely to report smoking tobacco (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.13-3.32) and marijuana (OR 4.97; 95% CI 1.08-22.82). For cases, 92% reported chronic pain and 85.9% reported acute pain on the day of enrollment. 27% reported <3 month duration of opiate use, 18% for 6-12 months, and 42% for greater than 2 years. 96% of cases and 91% of controls reported having a primary care physician (PCP). Cases were more likely to report having at least one medical specialist (OR 6.33, 95% CI 3.71-10.7). Cases were more likely to report psychiatric medications (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.61-4.71) and GI medications, including stool softeners (OR 3.36, 95%CI 2.01-5.64) as part of their medication regimens. There was a statically significant difference between the groups when primary care physicians were prescribers for opiates (p=0), psychiatric medications (p=0.0006) and GI medications (p=0.0006). Conclusions: This study shows that cohort patients who self-report prescription opiate use are more likely to suffer chronic pain, have prolonged duration of opiate use, and obtain prescriptions from their primary care physicians. Frequency of co-prescriptions with psychiatric medications, most commonly benzodiazepines, reflect an increased risk of accidental overdose that may be unrecognized. Further provider and patient education in safe prescribing practices, appropriate prescription opiate use and risks of overdose is warranted. Summary: Opioid use, abuse, and overdose has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Often, indicators of addiction or risks of overdose are unrecognized by providers and prescribers. This study aimed to gather specific data from patients who presented to the ED and reported opiates as part of their medication regimen with attention to duration of opiate use and main source of opiate prescriptions.","P.

1051,"This study investigated nucleic acid oxidation associated with exposure to benzene at low levels in 239 workers recruited among traffic policemen, taxi drivers and gasoline pump attendants of the city of Parma (Italy). Biomarkers of exposure, namely urinary t,t-muconic acid (t,t-MA) and S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA), urinary cotinine, and urinary biomarkers of nucleic acid oxidation, namely 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua) were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Relevant polymorphisms of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), glutathione S-transferases M1-1 (GSTM1), T1-1 (GSTT1), and A1 (GSTA1) were characterized by polymerase chain reaction-based methods in a subgroup of subjects. Biomarkers of nucleic acid oxidation were correlated with each other (r >= 0.32, p < 0.0001) and with exposure biomarkers (r >= 0.28, p < 0.0001). Multiple linear regression models including age, sex and smoking habits as independent variables demonstrated that benzene exposure is associated with oxidation damage to nucleic acid, particularly to RNA (p < 0.0001) and is modulated by the NQO1 polymorphism.

1054,"Introduction: Insomnia is a signiicant health concern among older adults, and veterans are at higher risk than non-veterans. The Veterans Administration (VA) is currently training mental health providers to provide cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I); however, older veterans may decline CBT-I provided by mental health providers due to perceived stigma, and demand for CBT-I may outpace current provider training efforts. This randomized controlled trial tested a manualized CBT-I program, delivered by allied health personnel (health educators, social workers) to older veterans, under the supervision of a behavioral sleep medicine (BSM) specialist. Methods: 159 veterans [mean(SD) age=72(8)years; 97% male] were randomized to receive ive sessions of: manualized individual (n=54) or group (n=52) CBT-I; or an information-only control group (IC; n=53). Exclusion criteria included apnea-hypopnea index > 20 and serious or unstable psychiatric or medical illness. Those using medications for sleep and those with stable comorbidities were not excluded. CBT-I consisted of sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene and cognitive therapy. Patients completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) pre- and immediately post-treatment. 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments are ongoing. 3(group) X 2(time) ANOVAS with planned contrasts were used to test for differences across treatments. Results: There were signiicant time X group interactions for ISI (F=11.01; p<.001) and PSQI (F=20.06; p<.001). Planned comparisons showed ISI and PSQI scores improved from pre- to post-treatment with individual and group CBT-I compared to IC (p's<.0002). There were no differences between individual and group CBT-I (p>.62) for either measure. Conclusion: Individual and group CBT-I, delivered by allied health personnel, was effective in reducing insomnia symptoms and improving sleep. This model for delivering CBT-I may improve access in settings where a BSM specialist is not readily available, but may be able to train and supervise allied personnel. Future research should examine broad dissemination and implementation of this treatment model.","J. L. Martin, L. Fiorentino, C. H. Fung, J. M. Dzierzewski, S. Jouldjian, K. R. Josephson, C. A.

1055,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common and increasingly so in countries experiencing an epidemic of obesity. The rate of OSA is likely as high or higher in psychiatric patients and patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as compared with the general population. Obstructive sleep apnea can be detected by maintaining a high degree of suspicion in patients with risk factors, symptoms, and typical physical findings. Failure to detect OSA can lead to serious long-term problems with cardiovascular health, excessive sleepiness, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents. It is unknown whether failure to treat OSA could promote failure to respond to ECT or greater cognitive problems with ECT, but failure to recognize and manage the risk for OSA in patients receiving ECT might expose them to anesthetic difficulties. Ideally, patients with suspected OSA should have a sleep laboratory evaluation and a definitive treatment plan in place before ECT, but, sometimes, psychiatric urgency and lack of access to resources in developing countries would make this unworkable. At a minimum, steps can be taken during the ECT procedure to manage airway obstruction in suspected or known patients with OSA. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","W. V. McCall, L. Arias, R.

1056,"Synthetic cannabinoids have become a worldwide epidemic because they provide a sometimes legal, easily accessible, and presumably safe alternative to marijuana. Recently published reports have linked acute psychosis, myocardial infarctions, convulsions, self-harm, and even terrorist organizations to these designer substances. This case report outlines the first reported case of Black Diamond, a synthetic cannabis, leading to a self-inflicted burn to the bilateral upper extremities requiring a transradial amputation of the right arm and a toe transfer procedure of the left hand after loss of all digits. The patient presented to the emergency department with self-inflicted fourth-degree burns to the bilateral hands and forearms with second-degree burns of the face, for a total body surface area of 14.5%. The patient was found by firefighters with his hands aflame on his kitchen stove. With no previous medical or psychiatric history and collateral information to confirm the patient's mental status prior to use of Black Diamond, the patient's acute psychotic episode was attributed to Black Diamond. After multiple procedures and a lengthy recovery, the patient completed his post-graduate education and entered the professional world. As orthopedic surgeons, we should be involved in educating the public on the harm of these designer drugs, including self-mutilation. The popularity of synthetic drugs in the United States will continue to present a major challenge to all health care providers.

Individuals with previous trauma exposure exhibited significantly poorer hippocampal-dependent (allocentric) navigation performance on active navigation in a virtual environment (the Alternative Route task) regardless of whether or not they had PTSD (scoring above 20 on the PTSD Diagnostic Scale). No effect of trauma exposure was found in static perspective taking (the Four Mountains task). Moreover, an associative information processing bias in those with PTSD interfered with ability to use hippocampal-dependent processing in active navigation.

Methods: A 1-month census of contacts with mental health services, private psychiatric and general practices, as well as contact points in marginalized settings, was conducted in a national catchment of 1.1 million adults. The census yielded 3,800 individuals who screened positive for psychosis, of whom a random sample of 980 were administered a comprehensive semi-structured interview schedule. Results are presented on 112 persons with an ICD-10 diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Results: Overall, 69.6% of the 112 persons who met the ICD-10 criteria for bipolar disorder reported a recurrent episodic illness, 25.0% had a chronic course without clear remissions, and 5.4% had a single episode of mania. Assessed on a lifetime basis, suicidal ideation was common (78.6%) and levels of drug and alcohol abuse/dependence were high (32.1%). The majority (84.8%) had had at least one contact with inpatient, outpatient or emergency services in the previous year. Those with serious impairment had levels of service utilization similar to the rest of the sample, but were more likely to report a poorer quality of life and unmet service needs. While the percentage experiencing social and occupational dysfunction was substantial and similar for both sexes, women appeared to be better integrated socially than men. Comparisons with schizophrenia patients within the same survey sample highlighted less chronic impairment but equal or greater utilization of services by bipolar patients.

1059,"Background: High-security hospital patients are often complex in presentation and are characterized by treatment resistance, medication nonadherence and history of violence. Paliperidone is licensed both as an oral and depot antipsychotic medication in the treatment of schizophrenia. Clinical trials have shown that paliperidone depot is well tolerated with similar efficacy to risperidone depot but with additional practical advantages. Whilst data exist for the effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate (PP), there are no studies involving patients in forensic settings or those with comorbid personality disorder. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of PP on violence, aggression and personality disorder symptoms. Methods: This project was a retrospective service evaluation involving 11 patients, carried out in a high-security hospital. A combination of patient records and interviews with the treating consultant psychiatrist were used to ascertain a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score, the effect of PP on specific personality disorder symptom domains (cognitive-perceptual, impulsive-behavioural dyscontrol and affective dysregulation) and incidents of violence and aggression. Engagement with occupational and psychological therapies was also evaluated. Metabolic parameters were reviewed. Results: A total of 6 out of 11 patients continued on PP, most of whom had schizophrenia and dissocial personality disorder with histories of violence. All showed improvement in the CGI score with associated benefits in the three personality symptom domains. Overall, two patients demonstrated a reduction in the risk of violence. There was improvement in engagement with occupational therapy and psychological work. No significant effects on metabolic parameters were noted although hyperprolactinaemia, albeit asymptomatic, was consistently recorded. Conclusions: This pragmatic service evaluation of a small but complex patient group demonstrated, for the first time, that PP was effective in reducing violence as well as improving personality pathology across all dimensions: a finding which could have significant implications for management of such high-security patients.

It describes their diagnostic characteristics, interventions provided, and their results. Methods: Researchers coded data from intakes and medical charts of all patients who sought help (N=1,659) and entered treatment (N=663) at a disaster relief service between May 13, 2000 (day of the disaster), and June 1, 2004.

Results: In the population probably exposed, the cumulative referral-incidence for disaster-related mental health problems over four years was approximately 10%; in terms of referrals to the mental health facility over five years, the proportion of disaster-related referrals was 5.7%. Among adults, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the most common clinical diagnosis (53%, chart sample). However, depression was the most common CIDI diagnosis (58%, CIDI interview sample).

1062,"Background: Heroin adulteration with ultra-potent opioids has changed the face of the American opioid epidemic. Carfentanil, a l-receptor agonist approximately 10,000 times the potency of morphine, heightens overdose risk. We describe the first epidemic of carfentanil-related deaths in three Midwestern counties, and the multiagency task force convened to present a unified message to media and health professionals. Case series: An urban medical examiner's office evaluated five decedents with suspected opioid toxicity. All underwent autopsies revealing no life-threatening natural diseases or traumatic injuries; one patient had non-contributory arteriosclerotic heart disease. Initial testing revealed no toxic concentrations of commonly encountered medications or illicit substances. Clinical suspicion for opioid toxicity as the cause of death led to additional testing at NMS Labs for novel psychoactive substances and designer opioids. Decedents were found over an 18-d period in three noncontiguous counties. All had measurable blood carfentanil levels (median 0.27 ng/mL, range 0.13-0.64 ng/mL, Table 1). Four of the five had measurable blood ethanol concentrations; three had evidence of co-ingested substances including alprazolam, clonazepam, methamfetamine, benzoylecgonine, and 6-monoacetyl morphine. Three deaths were attributed in whole or part to carfentanil toxicity; the remainder were attributed to mixed drug toxicity. At the time of writing, two more decedents have tested positive for novel opioids, with quantitative testing in process. Case 1: A 31-year old male with reported history of heroin abuse found deceased near drug paraphernalia. Blood testing revealed evidence of both carfentanil and ethanol. Cause of death was attributed to mixed carfentanil and ethanol toxicity. Case 2: A 33-year old male with reported history of substance abuse, including heroin and fentanyl, found deceased near drug paraphernalia. Blood testing revealed evidence of carfentanil and ethanol. Cause of death was attributed to acute carfentanil and ethanol toxicity. Case 3: A 42-year-old female with history of recent overdose reversed with naloxone found deceased near drug paraphernalia. Blood testing revealed carfentanil, methamfetamine, morphine, and alprazolam. Cause of death was attributed to mixed drug toxicity. Case 4: A 34-year-old female with history of substance abuse including heroin found deceased near drug paraphernalia. Blood carfentanil, methamfetamine, benzoylecgonine, morphine, clonazepam, and 7-amino-clonazepam were detected. Cause of death was attributed to mixed drug toxicity. Case 5: A 23-year-old male with history of heroin abuse found deceased near drug paraphernalia. Blood carfentanil, ethanol, and urine 6-monoacetyl morphine were detectable. Cause of death was attributed to acute carfentanil toxicity. Case discussion: Human carfentanil toxicity is minimally described. Two previously published cases of confirmed carfentanil toxicity not resulting in death are reported; blood carfentanil concentrations were an order of magnitude lower than the present series (0.0133 and 0.0435 ng/mL). This microepidemic of carfentanil-related deaths lacked tight geographic clustering, suggesting the possibility of additional deaths not identified as carfentanil-related. Conclusions: Carfentanil's arrival to the Midwest has been heralded by multiple deaths. Local collaboration by the county medical examiners and sheriffs, forensic toxicologists, medical toxicologists, state health department, and regional Poison Center established a clinical diagnosis and identified the culprit agent and presented a unified message to the public (Figure presented).","T.

1063,"Objective: Malpractice lawsuits are increasing in our country as well as around the world recently. Malpractice lawsuits in our country in the field of psychiatry are less than other medical branches. In a study (Pakis et al. 2008) evaluating 525 malpractice cases, which resulted in death; there were only two psychiatry cases (0.4%). Insufficient patient safety, early discharge of patients, misdiagnosis, lack of consultation, the side effects and also drug abuse due to high-dose drug usage are the common causes of malpractice complaints in abroad. There are few studies in the field of psychiatric malpractice in Turkey. Therefore in this study our aim is to evaluate the results of medico-legal malpractice cases in the field of psychiatry. Methods: This study was conducted in Istanbul, the archive records of evaluated malpractice cases by the 3<sup>rd</sup>Speciality Board of Council of Turkish Forensic Medicine between the years 2005-2010 were reviewed and 27 cases related Psychiatry were included. Results: Eight of the grievances occurred in dispensaries and military hospitals, 7 in psychiatric hospitals, 6 in emergency services and the others were in different places. 23 of the defendants were psychiatrists and 4 of them were medical doctors from other clinics. 9 of the defendants were complained together with medical doctors from other clinics or health care workers. 16 of the defendants were male, 11 of them were female. 3<sup>th</sup> Speciality Board of Institute of Forensic Medicine's decisions about the cases were as below; in 14 of the cases there were no malpractice, in 9 of the cases there was malpractice, 3 of them couldn't be evaluated and in one of the cases must be evaluated by the court because of missing file. 16 of the victims were male and 11 of them were female. The average age of the cases was 35.1, (between 19 and 66 years old) 22 of the victims were dead, 5 of them were alive and well and one of them was disabled because of sequel of encephalitis. The autopsy was performed for 16 of dead victims and not performed for the rest of them. The boards decisions about the cause of death were as below: 7 of them couldn't be determined, 3 of them were because of pneumonia, 2 of them were due to hanging, and the others were different causes like sepsis, brain damage due to gun shot injury, gastric perforation and hemorrhage due to taking a corrosive substance, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest due to taking haloperidol, cardiovascular disease resulting pulmonary edema, cerebral hemorrhage, blunt head-abdominal and thoracic trauma, penetrating thoracic injury, general body trauma due to jump from a height. Conclusion: Most of the victims were young adults. Most of the complaints about Psychiatric malpractice were cases with death. Therefore psychiatrists have to do a detailed evaluation, be careful and intentive about requested consultations from emergency services or other clinics, exclude the organic etiology and also be aware of the risk of suicide.","S.

1064,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the experience of volunteer disaster psychiatrists who provided pro bono psychiatric services to 9/11 survivors in New York City, from September 12, 2001 to November 20, 2001. METHOD: Disaster Psychiatry Outreach (DPO) is a non-profit organization founded in 1998 to provide volunteer psychiatric care to people affected by disasters and to promote education and research in support of this mission. Data for this study were collected from one-page clinical encounter forms completed by 268 DPO psychiatrists for 2 months after 9/11 concerning 848 patients served by the DPO 9/11 response program at the New York City Family Assistance Center. RESULTS: In this endeavor, 268 psychiatrist volunteers evaluated 848 individuals and provided appropriate interventions. The most commonly recorded clinical impressions indicated stress-related and adjustment disorders, but other conditions such as bereavement, major depression, and substance abuse/dependence were also observed. Free samples were available for one sedative and one anxiolytic agent; not surprisingly, these were the most commonly prescribed medications. Nearly half of those evaluated received psychotropic medications. CONCLUSIONS: In the acute aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, volunteer psychiatrists were able to provide services in a disaster response setting, in which they were co-located with other disaster responders. These services included psychiatric assessment, provision of medication, psychological first aid, and referrals for ongoing care. Although systematic diagnoses could not be confirmed, the fact that most patients were perceived to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a substantial proportion received psychotropic medication suggests potential specific roles for psychiatrists that are unique and different from roles of other mental health professionals in the early post-disaster setting. In addition to further characterizing post-disaster mental health needs and patterns of service provision, future research should focus on the short- and long-term effects of psychiatric interventions, such as providing acute psychotropic medication services and assessing the effectiveness of traditional acute post-disaster interventions including crisis counseling and psychological first aid.

1065,"Objective: We sought to study the epidemiologic and medical aspects of alpine helicopter rescue operations involving the winching of an emergency physician to the victim. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical and operational reports of a single helicopter-based emergency medical service. Data from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2008 were analysed. Results: A total of 921 patients were identified, with a male:female ratio of 2:1. There were 56 (6%) patients aged 15 or under. The median time from emergency call to helicopter take-off was 7 min (IQR = 5-10 min). 840 (91%) patients suffered from trauma-related injuries, with falls from heights during sports activities the most frequent event. The most common injuries involved the legs (246 or 27%), head (175 or 19%), upper limbs (117 or 13%), spine (108 or 12%), and femur (66 or 7%). Only 81 (9%) victims suffered from a medical emergency, but these cases were, when compared to the trauma victims, significantly more severe according to the NACA index (p < 0.001). Overall, 246 (27%) patients had a severe injury or illness, namely, a potential or overt vital threat (NACA score between 4 and 6). A total of 478 (52%) patients required administration of major analgesics: fentanyl (443 patients or 48%), ketamine (42 patients or 5%) or morphine (7 patients or 1%). The mean dose of fentanyl was 188 micrograms (range 25-750, SD 127). Major medical interventions such as administration of vasoactive drugs, intravenous perfusions of more than 1000 ml of fluids, ventilation or intubation were performed on 39 (4%) patients.

1067,"Background: This study examined the prevalence, correlates, and perceived mental healthcare needs associated with subsyndromal PTSD in police involved in the World Trade Center (WTC) rescue and recovery effort. Methods: A total of 8466 police completed an interview/survey as part of the WTC Medical monitoring and Treatment Program an average of four years after 9/11/2001. Results: The past month prevalence of full and subsyndromal WTC-related PTSD was 5.4% and 15.4%, respectively. Loss of someone or knowing someone injured on 9/11 (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.56-1.86), pre-9/11 stressors (ORs = 1.30-1.50), family support (ORs = 0.83-0.94), and union membership (ORs = 0.50-0.52) were associated with both full and subsyndromal PTSD. Exposure to the dust cloud (OR = 1.36), performing search and rescue work (OR = 1.29), and work support (OR = 0.89) were additionally associated with subsyndromal PTSD. Rates of comorbid depression, panic disorder, and alcohol use problems (ORs = 3.82-41.74), and somatic symptoms and functional difficulties (ORs = 1.30-1.95) were highest among police with full PTSD, with intermediate rates among police with subsyndromal PTSD (ORs = 2.93-7.02; and ORs = 1.18-1.60, respectively). Police with full and subsyndromal PTSD were significantly more likely than controls to report needing mental healthcare (41.1% and 19.8%, respectively, versus 6.8% in trauma controls). Conclusions: These results underscore the importance of a more inclusive and dimensional conceptualization of PTSD, particularly in professions such as police, as operational definitions and conventional screening cut-points may underestimate the psychological burden for this population. Accordingly, psychiatric clinicians should assess for disaster-related subsyndromal PTSD symptoms in disaster response personnel. © 2012.","R. H. Pietrzak, C. B. Schechter, E. J. Bromet, C. L.

1069,"Background: Various interventions have been tested to achieve adherence to anti-psychotic maintenance medication in non-adherent patients with psychotic disorders, and there is no consistent evidence for the effectiveness of any established intervention. The effectiveness of financial incentives in improving adherence to a range of treatments has been demonstrated; no randomised controlled trial however has tested the use of financial incentives to achieve medication adherence for patients with psychotic disorders living in the community. Methods/Design: In a cluster randomised controlled trial, 34 mental health teams caring for difficult to engage patients in the community will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group, where patients will be offered a financial incentive for each anti-psychotic depot medication they receive over a 12 month period, or the control group, where all patients will receive treatment as usual. We will recruit 136 patients with psychotic disorders who use these services and who have problems adhering to antipsychotic depot medication, although all conventional methods to achieve adherence have been tried. The primary outcome will be adherence levels, and secondary outcomes are global clinical improvement, number of voluntary and involuntary hospital admissions, number of attempted and completed suicides, incidents of physical violence, number of police arrests, number of days spent in work/training/education, subjective quality of life and satisfaction with medication. We will also establish the cost effectiveness of offering financial incentives. Discussion: The study aims to provide new evidence on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of offering financial incentives to patients with psychotic disorders to adhere to antipsychotic maintenance medication.

1072,"Background: The medical literature reports health hazards for law enforcement personnel from repeated exposure to methamphetamine and related chemical compounds. Most effects appear transitory, but some Utah police officers with employment-related methamphetamine exposures developed chronic symptoms, some leading to disability. This report is of an uncontrolled retrospective medical chart evaluation of symptomatic officers treated with a sauna detoxification protocol designed to reduce the chronic symptoms and improve the quality of life. Methods: Sixty-nine officers consecutively entering the Utah Meth Cops Project were assessed before and after a treatment program involving gradual exercise, comprehensive nutritional support and physical sauna therapy. Evaluations included pre- and post-treatment scores of the Research and Development Corporation (RAND) 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) in comparison with RAND population norms, pre- and post-treatment symptom score intensities, neurotoxicity scores, Mini-Mental Status Examination, presenting symptom frequencies and a structured evaluation of treatment program safety. Results: Statistically significant health improvements were seen in the SF-36 evaluations, symptom scores and neurotoxicity scores. The detoxification protocol was well tolerated, with a 92.8% completion rate. Conclusions: This investigation strongly suggests that utilizing sauna and nutritional therapy may alleviate chronic symptoms appearing after chemical exposures associated with methamphetamine-related law enforcement activities.

1073,"Exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with many diseases. Oxidative and nitrosative stress are believed to be two of the major sources of particulate matter (PM)-mediated adverse health effects. PM in ambient air arises from industry, local heating, and vehicle emissions and poses a serious problem mainly in large cities. In the present study we analyzed the level of oxidative and nitrosative stress among 50 bus drivers from Prague, Czech Republic, and 50 matching controls. We assessed simultaneously the levels of 15-F<inf>2t</inf>-isoprostane (15-F<inf>2t</inf>-IsoP) and 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in urine and protein carbonyl groups and 3-nitrotyrosine (NT) in blood plasma. For the analysis of all four markers we used ELISA techniques. We observed significantly increased levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress markers in bus drivers. The median levels (min, max) of individual markers in bus drivers versus controls were as follows: 8-oxodG: 7.79 (2.64-12.34) nmol/mmol versus 6.12 (0.70-11.38) nmol/mmol creatinine (p < 0.01); 15-F<inf>2t</inf>-IsoP: 0.81 (0.38-1.55) nmol/mmol versus 0.68 (0.39-1.79) nmol/mmol creatinine (p < 0.01); carbonyl levels: 14.1 (11.8-19.0) nmol/ml versus 12.9 (9.8-16.6) nmol/ml plasma (p < 0.001); NT: 694 (471-3228) nmol/l versus 537 (268-13833) nmol/l plasma (p < 0.001). 15-F<inf>2t</inf>-IsoP levels correlated with vitamin E (R = 0.23, p < 0.05), vitamin C (R = -0.33, p < 0.01) and cotinine (R = 0.47, p < 0.001) levels. Vitamin E levels also positively correlated with 8-oxodG (R = 0.27, p = 0.01) and protein carbonyl levels (R = 0.32, p < 0.001). Both oxidative and nitrosative stress markers positively correlated with PM2.5 and PM10 exposure.

It endangers not only patients, but also health care professionals, especially emergency medical services (EMS) personnel because CO exposure is often unknown at the time EMS is called. Objective Our objective was to report a case of unrecognized CO exposure during the treatment of a patient that finally led to the hospitalization of 11 EMS personnel. Case Report A 71-year-old man was found unconscious in the basement of his house. EMS was called and, due to ST-segment elevations on electrocardiogram, the patient was treated for acute coronary syndrome. Unknown to EMS personnel, ongoing CO exposure was the cause of the patient's symptoms. EMS staff finally had to be evacuated by firefighters, and a total of 12 persons, including the initial patient, had to be hospitalized. Conclusions In the prehospital setting, hazardous environments always have to be considered as potential causes of a patient's altered status. Together with the correct use of modern equipment, such as permanently switched-on CO detectors, this can help avoid harm to both patients and staff. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","D. Roth, M. Krammel, W.

Retrospective chart review of opioid-related overdoses seen in our emergency department and a retrospective review of data from the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office Fentanyl Fatality Database from April 2005 through December 2006. Results. Our emergency department treated 43 patients with a total of 55 emergency department visits during this time. Paramedic transport was utilized for 83.6% of the emergency department visits and naloxone was administered during 80.4% of transports. Naloxone was administered during 47.3% of emergency department visits witwh total doses ranging from 0.4 mg to 12 mg. Eighty percent of cases were treated and discharged from the emergency department. During this same time frame, the Medical Examiner's office identified 342 fentanyl-related fatalities. In 2006, illicit fentanyl fatalities represented 6.9% of all Medical Examiner cases for that year. Approximately 80% of deaths occurred in Chicago. A peak in fentanyl-related deaths occurred in the spring of 2006 and again in the fall of 2006 while the number of emergency department visits peaked during May of 2006. Conclusion.

General management of drug abuse disorders is essential in epidemiological studies. Therefore, epidemiological supervision of drug abuse is an important issue in improving the actions done in National Drug Strategy. Material and methods: In this Routine Data Analyse, the information regarding all cases of morphine, opium and other psychotropic positive werte collected from Mazandaran Department of Forensic Centre which occurred in 2007-2012. Demographic and epidemiological data were extracted from recorded documents. Data was then analyzed in SPSS using chi-square and binomial tests. Results: In this study 272cases were evaluated of which 36.4% were due to drug intoxication. The mean age of the subjects was 39.46+/-14.27 years and they were most male and married. There were 69% urban and 31% rural. The rate of mortality was higher in people holding high school diploma or lower certificates. Self-employed people had the most mortality rate. Most of the studied cases (42.2%) used drugs through injection. Conclusion: According to this study the rate of mortality due to substance abuse is more among married young men aged 20-35.

Ambient air particles (PM10, PM2.5) and c-PAHs were monitored using Versatile Air Pollution Sampler (VAPS), and personal exposure was evaluated using personal samplers during working shift. Chromosomal aberrations were analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and conventional cytogenetic analysis. Urinary cotinine, plasma levels of vitamins A, E and C, folate, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL cholesterols and triglycerides were also analyzed as possible effect modifiers. During the sampling period the particulate air pollution monitored by VAPS was in January versus March as follows: PM10 55.6 mug/m<sup>3</sup> versus 36.4 mug/m<sup>3</sup>, PM2.5 44.4 mug/m<sup>3</sup> versus 24.8 mug/m<sup>3</sup>, c-PAHs 19.7 ng/m<sup>3</sup> versus 3.6 ng/m<sup>3</sup>, and B[a]P 4.3 ng/m<sup>3</sup> versus 0.8 ng/m<sup>3</sup>. Significant differences were observed for all FISH endpoints studied for the sampling in January and March (%AB.C. = 0.27 +/- 0.18 versus 0.16 +/- 0.17, p < 0.001, F<inf>G</inf>/100 = 1.32 +/- 1.07 versus 0.85 +/- 0.95, p < 0.01, AB/1000 (aberrations/1000 cells) = 4.27 +/- 3.09 versus 2.59 +/- 2.79, p < 0.001) while conventional cytogenetic analysis did not reveal any differences in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations. Factors associated with an increased level of translocations by FISH indicated the effect of age, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and vitamin C. We may conclude that FISH indicates that the city policemen in Prague represent a group of increased genotoxic risk. This is the first study reporting that translocations induced by c-PAHs in peripheral lymphocytes last only several weeks. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.","R. J. Sram, O.

1082,"Background: Acute organophosphate poisoning is rare in the UK, and the risks to attending staff are seldom appreciated. Study design: Report of an incident. Results: In May 2001, a 45-year-old man attempted suicide by drinking organophosphate insecticide, and was brought to an urban general hospital in a collapsed state. Twenty-five hospital workers and paramedics sought medical advice after coming into contact with the poisoned patient, of whom ten complained of symptoms related to toxin exposure. Provision of emergency services by the hospital was compromised, and the emergency department was closed until the area was decontaminated and staffing levels could be restored. Discussion: Ingestion of OP compounds can present a significant risk to health professionals as well as patients. Problems with the management of this patient included late recognition of the need for decontamination, large numbers of non-essential staff coming into contact with the patient, and the difficulty of carrying out medical procedures while wearing protective equipment. Decontamination should always be considered early, and the possibility of an ingested poison being vomited and causing a chemical spill should not be overlooked.","R. Stacey, D. Morfey, S.

1083,"Injection drug use is a growing problem on the US-Mexico border, where Tijuana is situated. We studied the context of injection drug use among injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana to help guide future research and interventions. Guided in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 male and 10 female current IDUs in Tijuana. Topics included types of drug used, injection settings, access to sterile needles, and environmental influences. Interviews were taped, transcribed verbatim, and translated. Content analysis was conducted to identify themes. Of the 20 IDUs, median age and age at first injection were 30 and 18. Most reported injecting at least daily: heroin (""carga,"" ""chiva,"" ""negra""), methamphetamine (""crico,"" ""cri-cri""), or both drugs combined. In sharp contrast to Western US cities, almost all regularly attended shooting galleries (""yongos"" or ""picaderos"") because of the difficulties obtaining syringes and police oppression. Almost all shared needles/paraphernalia [""cuete"" (syringe), ""cacharros"" (cookers), cotton from sweaters/socks (filters)]. Some reported obtaining syringes from the United States. Key themes included (1) pharmacies refusing to sell or charging higher prices to IDUs, (2) ample availability of used/rented syringes from ""picaderos"" (e.g., charging approximately 5 pesos or ""10 drops"" of drug), and (3) poor HIV/AIDS knowledge, such as beliefs that exposing syringes to air ""kills germs."" This qualitative study suggests that IDUs in Tijuana are at high risk of HIV and other blood-borne infections.

Method: Literature revision of the published reports on the L'Aquila earthquake has been performed. Results: Although important psychological distress has been reported by the population, capacity of resilience can be observed. However if resilient mechanisms intervened in immediate aftermath of the earthquake, important dangers are conceivable in the current medium-long-term perspective due to the long-lasting alterations of day-to-day life and the disruption of social networks that can be well associated with mental health problems. Conclusions: In a condition such as an earthquake, the immediate physical, medical, and emergency rescue needs must be addressed initially. However training first responders to identify psychological distress symptoms would be important for mental health triage in the field.","P. Stratta, S. De Cataldo, R. Bonanni, M. Valenti, F.

1085,"BACKGROUND: Paramedics are frequently subjected to traumatic experiences and have higher PTSD prevalence rates than people in the general population. However, the vast majority of paramedics do not develop PTSD. While several risk factors for PTSD have been established, little is known about protective factors. It has been suggested that a good sense of coherence (SOC) and high resilience lower the risk for developing PTSD. AIMS: To examine whether SOC and resilience are associated with PTSD severity in paramedics. METHOD: A cross-sectional study investigated SOC, resilience and PTSD in paramedics (N = 668). PTSD was assessed with the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS); resilience and SOC were measured with the Resilience Scale (RS-11) and the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-L9). Further measures included preparation of dealing with traumatic events and availability of psychological help. RESULTS: As expected, both resilience and SOC were negatively correlated with PTSD symptoms. The regression analysis showed that 19.2% of the total variance in symptom severity was explained by these variables. However, SOC was a better predictor than resilience for PTSD severity, as it accounted for more unique variance. Paramedics who were prepared for dealing with work-related traumatic events and who received psychological help had less severe PTSD symptoms and higher SOC scores than paramedics for whom these services were not available. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing resilience, and especially SOC, seems a promising approach to reduce PTSD symptom severity in high risk groups like paramedics.","M. Streb, P. Haller, T. Michael (2014).

1086,"Background. Healthcare workers (or relatives) crushing drug tablets for patients with difficulties in swallowing are at risk of developing sensitization via airborne exposure. Tetrazepam, in particular, is increasingly being described as an important occupational allergen in this regard, although other drugs are also involved. Objectives. To identify the allergenic culprits in 4 patients, namely 2 nurses, 1 pharmacy assistant, and 1 spouse, who all regularly crushed tablets of systemic drugs and presented with severe airborne dermatitis. Methods. The patients were patch tested with all of the drugs that they handled, as well as with potential cross-sensitizing molecules. Results. All 4 patients reacted to tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, some of which they had not previously come into contact with, which favours cross-reactivity rather than concomitant sensitization. These patients also had positive reactions to several other non-structurally related drugs for which, in some cases, there was no history of exposure. Conclusions. Subjects having to crush drugs, in either an occupational or a non-occupational context, and who present with dermatitis suspected of being airborne-induced, should be patch tested with all contacted medicaments, as well as with possible cross-reacting molecules. Prevention by the use of crushing devices and protective measures (gloves and masks) when medications are handled should be advised. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","I. Swinnen, K. Ghys, S. Kerre, L.

1087,"Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs), commonly known by the street name ""Spice,"" are designer drugs of abuse that mimic the psychoactive effects of marijuana. Intentional SC use has resulted in multiple toxicities (1,2), but little is known about occupational SC exposure. After a federal agency's law enforcement personnel in Nevada reported irritability and feeling ""high"" after raiding illegal SC laboratories and processing seized SCs, a request for a health hazard evaluation was made by the agency to CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in 2014 to evaluate agents' occupational SC exposures. After making the request for a health hazard evaluation, federal agents conducted a raid of an illegal SC laboratory, with assistance from local law enforcement and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) personnel and with NIOSH investigators observing from a distance. After the raid, agents collected and processed material evidence. NIOSH investigators tested agents' urine for SC levels before and after the raid and measured SCs in the air and on surfaces after the raid. DEA determined that AB-PINACA (an SC compound) and mitragynine (a plant material with opium-like effects, also known as ""kratom"") were present in the illegal laboratory. AB-PINACA, its metabolites, and mitragynine were not detected in agents' urine before the raid; however, one or more of these substances was found in the urine of six of nine agents after the raid and processing of the SC evidence. AB-PINACA was detected in one surface wipe sample from the SC laboratory; none was detected in the air in the laboratory or in the offices of the law enforcement agency where the materials were processed after the raid. No policies were in place regarding work practices and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during raids and evidence processing. To protect agents from SC exposures, NIOSH recommended that the agency require agents to wear a minimum level of PPE (e.g., protective gloves and disposable clothing) and undergo training in PPE and in handling and storing of contaminated evidence from SC laboratory raids. Showers and locker rooms also need to be provided so that agents can reduce contamination and prevent take-home exposure.","L. Tapp, J. G. Ramsey, A. Wen, R. Gerona (2017).

1089,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of methamphetamine-related diagnoses seen in the psychiatric emergency department (ED) of a large urban hospital, which serves an area with a known methamphetamine epidemic. This study also examines the characteristics and ED interventions of psychiatric patients with and without methamphetamine-related diagnoses. METHODS: The records of 904 patients admitted to the psychiatric ED of the largest urban hospital in Hawaii between March and May 2002 were reviewed. Diagnoses were made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV. Patients were classified as having a methamphetamine-related diagnosis if they were diagnosed with methamphetamine intoxication, dependency, abuse, withdrawal, methamphetamine-induced mood disorder or psychotic disorder. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six patients (18%) were diagnosed with a methamphetamine-related diagnosis. Patients with methamphetamine-related diagnoses were more likely to be male (70% vs. 57%), non-Caucasian (75% vs. 57%), and presented with suicidality (47% vs. 32%) and agitation (48% vs. 30%) more often than non-methamphetamine-related diagnosis patients. Poly-drug use (14% vs. 3%) and dual diagnosis (37% vs. 17%) were more common among patients with methamphetamine-related diagnoses. Patients with methamphetamine-related diagnoses were treated with sedating medications more frequently (37% vs. 25%), stayed longer in the ED (median 225 vs. 193 min), and were more likely to be admitted to the hospital (53% vs. 40%) than non-methamphetamine-related diagnoses patients.

1091,"Background: Biochemical toxicology in suicides provides a template to improve preventive interventions in cases of suicide. The menu for biochemical toxicological analysis in coroners' cases is not prescriptive in Ireland or in the United Kingdom. The aim of the study was to confirm that reliance on the results of an immunoassay screen for drugs of abuse and common analgesics in order to select samples for compound confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is likely to understate the potential role of drugs in suicide. Blood and urine samples were analyzed using enzyme immunoassay, alcohols by gas chromatography and urines were screened by Bio-Rad's Rapid Emergency Drug Identification (REMEDi) system. Laboratory data from analysis of 132 cases of suicide, including 101 cases of hanging revealed that 83 % were male confirming suicide as a male epidemic. Overall, alcohol was a factor in 57 %, benzodiazepines in 26 %, cannabinoids in 11 %, opioids in 19.7 %, sympathomimetics in 7.5 %, cocaine in 4.5 %, antidepressants 22 %, antipsychotics in 10 %, hypnotics in 5 %, and antihistamines in 4 % of these cases. Screening compounds in cases of hanging and other suicides should extend beyond the narrow focus of alcohol and illicit drugs to include a wide spectrum of psychoactive and other compounds as a standard procedure. The wide range of licit and illicit compounds found in these cases reflects current experience and dictates the necessity for chromatographic screening with mass spectroscopy confirmation in all cases as best practice. © 2012 Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.","W.

This study explored the association between nursing specialty and past-year substance use Methods. In an anonymous mailed survey, a balanced stratified sample of registered nurses (n4438) reported their use of marijuana, cocaine, and prescription-type drugs, as well as cigarette smoking and binge drinking. Results. Prevalence of use of all substances was 32%. Rates varied by specialty, even when sociodemographics were controlled. Compared with nurses in women's health, pediatrics, and general practice, emergency nurses were 3.5 times as likely to use marijuana or cocaine (odds ratio [OR] = 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5, 8.2); oncology and administration nurses were twice as likely to engage in binge drinking; and psychiatric nurses were most likely to smoke (OR= 2.4; 95% CI=1.6, 3.8). No specialty differences appeared for prescription-type drug use. Conclusions. Certain nursing specialties were more likely than others to be associated with substance use. The differences were not explained by demographic characteristics. Inasmuch as a comparison of these results for nurses with prior work on physicians found considerable agreement by specialty, preventive initiatives should consider interdisciplinary approaches to substance use education.","A.

1094,"BACKGROUND: Although several studies have examined the link between specific working conditions and health behaviours, very few have comparatively assessed the health behaviours of different occupational groups. AIMS: To compare protective and risky health behaviours among police officers, ambulance workers, hospital staff (doctors and nurses) and office workers, prompted by the need to identify key areas for interventions tailored to the needs of different occupational groups. METHODS: A cross-sectional postal survey using the Health Behaviours Inventory, assessing health behaviours which are risky (alcohol intake, smoking, coffee consumption, fast food meals and painkiller consumption) and protective (physical activity, eating breakfast and hours of sleep). RESULTS: The sample consisted of 1451 employees. Ambulance workers smoked the most cigarettes per day (F (4, 1405) = 8.63, P < 0.01), while doctors consumed twice as many fast food meals as any other occupational group (F (4, 1415) = 78.45, P < 0.01) and had the highest daily caffeine consumption (F (4, 1440) = 11.17, P < 0.01). Ambulance workers and doctors reported the highest frequency of alcohol consumption per week (F (4, 1421) = 10.13, P < 0.01). In regard to protective health behaviours, office workers reported the highest number of breakfast meals per week (F (4, 1431) = 5.7, P < 0.01) and sleeping hours per night (F (4, 1438) = 170.34, P < 0.01), while police officers and ambulance workers exercised more frequently (F (4, 1420) = 5.764, P < 0.01).

1095,"Background: Synthetic cannabinoid containing products are a public health threat as reflected by a number of outbreaks of serious adverse health effects over the past 4 years. The designer drug epidemic is characterized by the rapid turnover of synthetic cannabinoid compounds on the market which creates a challenge in identifying the particular etiology of an outbreak, confirming exposure in cases, and providing current information to law enforcement. Results: Between 28 May 2014 and 8 June 2014, 35 patients were evaluated and treated at the University of Florida Health Medical Center in Gainesville following reported exposure to a synthetic cannabinoid containing product obtained from a common source. Patients demonstrated acute delirium (24) and seizures (14), and five required ventilator support and ICU-level care; none died. The presence of N-[(1S)-1-(aminocarbonyl)-2-methylpropyl]-1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (AB-CHMINACA), or one of its predicted metabolites was confirmed in 15 of 21 cases. A rapid public health response and aggressive public messaging prevented further morbidity, identified the source, and led to law enforcement seizure of the implicated product. Discussion: The significance of this outbreak lies as much in the rapid occurrence of unpredictable, life-threatening adverse health effects from a newly identified synthetic cannabinoid compound as it does in the multidisciplinary investigation and novel partnership between local public health, the laboratory, and the chemical industry, resulting in termination of the outbreak. Conclusion: A coordinated response and collaboration between law enforcement, the local public health, emergency medical services and Health Center staff, were all key interventions in preventing a more substantial public health outbreak resulting from use of a novel synthetic cannabinoid compound. Real time collaborations between toxicology laboratories, suppliers of analytical standards and the public health system may be useful in the face of future novel chemical exposures.

1096,"INTRODUCTION: There is consistent scientific evidence that professional drivers constitute an occupational group that is highly exposed to work related stressors. Furthermore, several recent studies associate work stress and fatigue with unsafe and counterproductive work behaviors. This study examines the association between stress-related work conditions of Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) drivers and risky driving behaviors; and examines whether fatigue is a mechanism that mediates the association between the two. METHOD: A sample of 524 male Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) operators were drawn from four transport companies in Bogota, Colombia. The participants answered a survey which included an adapted version of the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) for BRT operators, as well as the Effort-Reward Imbalance and Job Content Questionnaires, the Subjective Fatigue subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) and the Need for Recovery after Work Scale (NFR). RESULTS: Utilizing Structural Equation Models (SEM) it was found that risky driving behaviors in BRT operators could be predicted through job strain, effort-reward imbalance and social support at work. It was also found that fatigue and need for recovery fully mediate the associations between job strain and risky driving, and between social support and risky driving, but not the association between effort/reward imbalance (ERI) and risky driving. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that a) stress related working conditions (Job Strain, Social Support and ERI) are relevant predictors of risky driving in BRT operators, and b) that fatigue is the mechanism which links another kind of stress related to working conditions (job strain and low social support) with risky driving. The mechanism by which ERI increases risky driving in BRT operators remains unexplained. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This research suggests that in addition to the individual centered stress-reduction occupational programs, fatigue management interventions aimed to changing some working conditions may reduce risky driving behaviors and promote safety in the professional drivers' jobs and on the road.

1097,"Objective. An epidemic of scopolamine poisonings occurred in Oslo in 2008 among users of illicit drugs, caused by fake RohypnolTM pills. The clinical features, diagnostic process, and handling of the epidemic are presented. Methods. Suspected cases of scopolamine poisoning were extracted by reviewing registration forms from an ongoing prospective clinical study of acute poisonings in Oslo. Medical records of extracted contacts were examined and cases included according to specified clinical criteria. Results. Forty-four cases of probable scopolamine poisoning were registered. Main clinical features were mydriasis, visual hallucinations, plucking behavior, agitation, and coma. No clinical diagnosis of anticholinergic syndrome was made prior to forensic analysis of the tablets, the most frequent diagnosis up to this point being unspecified drug-induced psychosis. Later in the epidemic, scopolamine poisoning became the dominating diagnosis. Ten patients were admitted to psychiatric hospitals, the rest recovered in medical units, or left health care against medical advice. Discussion. Scopolamine poisonings are rare, but the resulting anticholinergic syndrome is well described. The syndrome was not recognized until the forensic analysis result strikingly changed how the patients were diagnosed and handled. A unique aspect of this epidemic was the intoxicating agent being scopolamine-containing tablets looking like RohypnolTM, sold and used under the impression of being the latter. Conclusion. Recognizing the anticholinergic syndrome is important to provide proper treatment. Forensic analysis was the key to correct diagnosis in this outbreak, demonstrating its importance in verifying an epidemic of poisoning by fake drugs. © 2009 Informa UK, Ltd.","O. M. Vallersnes, C.

1098,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the knowledge, awareness and practices of health care workers towards universal precautions at the University Hospital of the West Indies. The study also examined the prevalence of injuries experienced by health care workers, as well as incidence of accidents and compliance with post-exposure prophylaxis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted in September and October 2007. A 28-item self-administered questionnaire was provided to two hundred health care workers including medical doctors, medical technologists, nurses and porters to assess knowledge and practices regarding universal precautions, prevalence of injuries and incidence of accidents. RESULTS: Almost two-thirds (62.3%) of the respondents were aware of policies and procedures for reporting accidents while one-third (33.2%) were unsure. All nurses were aware of policies and procedures for reporting accidents, followed by medical doctors (88%) and medical technologists (61.2%). The majority (81.5%) of the respondents experienced splashes from bodily fluid. Over three-quarters of medical doctors (78%) and two-thirds of nurses (64%) reported having experienced needle stick injuries, while the incidence among medical technologists was remarkably lower (26%). The majority of the respondents (59%) experienced low accident incidence while just over one-tenth (14%) reported high incidence. Eighty four respondents reported needle stick injuries; just under two-thirds (59.5%) of this group received post-exposure treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The study found that majority of health care workers were aware of policies and procedures for reporting accidents. Splashes from body fluids, needle stick injuries and cuts from other objects were quite prevalent among health care workers. There is a need for monitoring systems which would provide accurate information on the magnitude of needle stick injuries and trends over time, potential risk factors, emerging new problems, and the effectiveness of interventions at The University Hospital of the West Indies and other hospitals in Jamaica.","K.

1099,"Background: Accidental overdose, driven largely by opioids, is a leading cause of death among people who inject drugs (PWIDs). We conducted secondary analysis of data from a cohort of PWIDs to identify venues where high-risk PWID could be targeted by overdose education/naloxone distribution (OEND) programs. Methods: 573 PWIDs completed a quantitative survey between June, 2012 and January, 2014, which was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. The dependent variable was a dichotomous indicator of experiencing a heroin/opioid-related overdose in the past six months. Independent variables included: demographics, drug use behavior, and encounters with two venues - the health care and criminal justice systems - that could serve as potential venues for OEND programs. Results: Almost half (41.5%) reported ever experiencing a heroin/opioid overdose, and 45 (7.9%) reported experiencing at least one heroin/opioid overdose in the past six months. In the final multivariable model, receiving care in a hospital in the past six months (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AdjOR] 4.08, 95% Confidence Interval [C.I.] 2.07, 8.04, p<. 0.001) and being arrested for drug possession in the past six months (AdjOR 5.17, 95% C.I. 2.37, 11.24, p<. 0.001) were associated with experiencing an opioid overdose in the past six months. Conclusions: Identifying venues outside of those that traditionally target services to PWIDs (i.e., syringe exchange programs) will be critical to implementing OEND interventions at a scale sufficient to address the growing epidemic of heroin/opioid related deaths.

1101,"This study was conducted to determine if law enforcement personnel experience symptoms associated with methamphetamine lab investigation and to assess those factors that may result in more symptoms. A total of 258 standardized, self-administered surveys were distributed to law enforcement personnel attending national/regional training classes, between June 2004-February 2005. Ninety-three percent of the surveys were returned and used to determine symptoms experienced while investigating clandestine methamphetamine labs, as well as the job duties of the respondent and the personal protective equipment used. More than 70% of respondents reported headaches, central nervous system symptoms, respiratory symptoms, sore throat, and other symptoms. Unadjusted and adjusted risk of symptoms was higher for those who investigated more than 30 labs. Other significant risk factors included time spent in the lab, phase of investigation, presence of active chemical processes, and coexistent disease. Respirator use was not independently associated with the likelihood of reporting symptoms. It was concluded that methamphetamine lab investigation is positively associated with symptom reporting in a high percentage of law enforcement personnel involved in these tasks. For most individuals, the reported symptoms were transitory and diminished in a short time, but some individuals reported needing to seek medical attention with symptoms that persisted.","R. Z.

1102,"Based on the dual process model of human cognition, this study investigated the influence of dispositional mindfulness on operators' safety behaviors and its boundary conditions. In a sample of 212 nuclear power plant control room operators, it was found that both safety compliance and safety participation behaviors were positively influenced by dispositional mindfulness as measured by the 14-item Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory. This effect was still positive after controlling for age, intelligence, work experience and conscientiousness. Moreover, two boundary conditions were identified: the impact of dispositional mindfulness of safety behaviors was stronger among operators who were either more experienced or more intelligent. Theoretically, the framework we used to understand the benefit of mindfulness on safety behaviors has been proved to be useful. Practically, it provides a new and valid criterion that could be used in operators' selection and training program to improve organizational safety. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

1103,"Primary health care (PHC) in Nigeria (as in many developing countries) relies heavily on paramedical personnel. Using a self-report structured questionnaire design, 207 PHC workers were assessed on their knowledge and views about drug and alcohol abuse. PHC workers with previous exposure to some form of drug abuse training were significantly more likely to be aware of the correct usage for the term 'drug abuse', although the whole range of drugs of abuse/dependence was much less well appreciated. Drugs reported by the PHC workers to be commonly abused in the study area were in keeping with previous findings on drug abuse in the country. However, 75.4% of the PHC workers perceived drug abuse as a low grade problem, in contrast to recent reports, of the increasing magnitude of drug abuse problems in the country. About one fifth of PHC workers were of the opinion that drug abusers should be punished. Only 35 (16.9%) of those who indicated the need for treatment mentioned that this could be carried out by PHC personnel. Many of the PHC workers showed limited knowledge of factors associated with drug abuse and on the scope of preventive strategies against drug abuse. Suggestions are made on the short and long term training needs of the PHC workers in order to ensure the successful incorporation of drug abuse treatment and prevention programmes into the PHC programme in Nigeria.","O.

1104,"Occupational violence is a worldwide, multifaceted problem affecting all industries, including healthcare. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the experiences of 158 allied health professionals, 135 doctors, and 1229 nurses working in a rural area in eastern Australia. Response rates were 72 percent for allied health professionals and 62 percent for general practitioners (GPs) and nurses. Proportionately more nurses experienced occupational violence than did allied health providers and GPs. During the past 12 months (August 2001 to July 2002), 68 percent of nurses, compared with 47 percent of allied health providers and 48 percent of GPs, reported violence. All three professional groups indicated that the most distressing occupational violence was perpetrated by patients, followed by patients' relatives. The most frequent form of occupational violence was verbal abuse, followed by threatening behavior, physical violence, and obscene behavior. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of violence was found among the different allied health professional disciplines or fields of nursing. Health services management strategies addressing occupational violence need to be comprehensive and multidisciplinary in scope. Strategies to minimize violence need to focus on resource allocation, cultural change, and perseverance. Systems to monitor violence are a priority. Further research into the determinants of this pattern of violence is required.","C. Alexander, J. Fraser (2004).

METHODS: One hundred sixty-one participants were randomized to WSM, WSM with group support, WSM with group and expert clinical support, or wait-list control. Perceived stress, burnout, emotional and psychological well-being, mindfulness, and productivity were measured at baseline, weeks 8 and 16, and 1 year. RESULTS: Online usage was low with participants favoring CD use and group practice. All active groups demonstrated significant reductions in perceived stress and increases in emotional and psychological well-being compared with control. Group support improved participation, engagement, and outcomes. CONCLUSION: A self-directed mindfulness program with group practice and support can provide an affordable, effective, and scalable workplace stress management solution. Engagement may also benefit from combining web-based and traditional CD delivery.","D. Allexandre, A. M. Bernstein, E. Walker, J. Hunter, M. F. Roizen, T. J. Morledge (2016).

1106,"An investigation of predictors of returning to work in a sample of physically injured persons who are receiving workers' compensation benefits and vocational rehabilitation is presented. One hundred fourteen injured subjects (86 with back injury; 28, other injury) undergoing vocational rehabilitation and receiving workers' compensation benefits were assessed on demographic, emotional, cognitive, financial incentive, and miscellaneous variables. Predictors for returning to work were identified using stepwise logistic regression. Patients with moderate or severe depression, defined as a score greater than 16 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were significantly less likely to return to work following vocational rehabilitation efforts than patients with less severe depression (for back-injured patients, odds ratio (OR) = 31, 95% CI [8.8, 108]). BDI scores correctly classified 84 percent of the back-injury and 86% of the other-injury groups with respect to their return to work. The level of workers' compensation benefit was the only variable that added (marginally) to the predictive power of the BDI. In a physically injured population receiving workers' compensation benefits, who are judged to be not clearly permanently disabled, level of depressive symptoms is a strong predictor of returning to work. Caution is warranted in using the BDI as the sole determinant in a forensic situation for making a real-world prediction, as BDI responses are easy to fake. Treatment of concurrent depression is an important component of helping physically injured workers resume gainful employment.","P. Ash, S. I. Goldstein (1995).

1107,"OBJECTIVE: While neuroleptics remain the mainstay of drug intervention in the emergency management of psychosis, a variety of agents have received study as alternatives or adjuncts to these drugs in an attempt to improve the safety and efficacy of acute treatment. The purposes of this study were to investigate the efficacy and safety of alprazolam as a neuroleptic adjunct for schizophrenic patients in psychotic relapse and to clarify the effects of combination treatment on specific aspects of the psychotic process. METHOD: Twenty-eight acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia who were admitted to an emergency psychiatric service were randomly assigned to treatment with either haloperidol and alprazolam or haloperidol with placebo under double-blind conditions. Drug administration lasted 72 hours. RESULTS: Both groups improved significantly. The combination-treated group required significantly less medication and had 56% fewer dystonic reactions. The addition of alprazolam was most effective for symptoms of excitement and uncooperativeness, particularly in the initial hours of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of alprazolam and haloperidol seems to be the most effective for agitated patients, particularly in the first 48 hours of treatment. It may also result in fewer dystonic reactions.","J. G. Barbee, D. M. Mancuso, C. R. Freed, A. A. Todorov (1992).

1108,"BACKGROUND: The Poisons Information Centre receives many inquiries about acute exposures to chemical products. Our aim was to characterise the frequency and severity of such exposures and to raise awareness of chemicals that rarely cause poisoning, but may lead to serious systemic toxicity even in small amounts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from inquiries to the Poisons Information Centre in the period 2004-2006 and from the Product Register on the use of selected chemicals. RESULTS: In 2004-2006, the Poisons Information Centre received 35,802 inquiries regarding acute exposures to chemicals or chemical products. Most of the exposures (72%) were assessed as non-toxic or involving risk of minor poisoning, while only 7.8% were assessed as involving risk of severe poisoning. The substances most frequently involved were cleaning agents, cosmetics/personal care products and hydrocarbon fuels, whereas risk of severe poisoning is related to alkali and hydrocarbon exposures. Poisonings with hydrofluoric acid and glycols/glycol ethers are rare, but the outcome is often severe. As many as 84% of the hydrofluoric acid exposures and 36% of the ingestions of ethylene glycol by children were assessed as involving risk of moderate or severe poisoning. INTERPRETATION: Exposure to chemicals or chemical products is frequent, but rarely leads to severe poisonings. Data from inquiries to the Poisons Information Centre are representative of the chemical exposure conditions. It is important to have detailed product information readily available to assure correct treatment after exposure incidents.","J. Borgeraas, R. Lindqvist (2008).

1109,"Regional poison control centers (PCCs) were surveyed nationally to assess their policies and practices in handling work-related exposures. A 24-item survey was mailed to the executive directors of 44 American Association of Poison Control Centers' certified PCCs nationwide. The survey also requested permission to call the PCC to conduct a blinded role-playing exercise of a case of work-related trichloroethane exposure. Responses on the management questionnaire were compared with the actual responses provided by information specialists in the role-playing exercise. Seventy-five percent of PCCs completed the survey; 43% completed the telephone role-playing exercise. Survey respondents generally overestimated what they thought was routinely done to assess work-related calls, compared with what actually occurred at the time of the work-related call in the role-playing exercise. For example, 32% indicated that their PCC asked about the activities of nearby workers, but none of the PCC staff actually did so. Eighty-nine percent of the PCC executive directors surveyed thought that their staff routinely advised callers to notify their employer about work-related exposure concerns, but this occurred in only 11% of the calls. We concluded that PCCs' responses to work-related calls are inadequate. Given the public health impact of work-related calls, PCCs should develop, implement, and monitor written protocols to better address the public health issues of workplace poisonings.","E. A.

1110,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate which categories of medication are most commonly implicated in overdose, to compare this information with prescription data and to explore how the medications used in overdoses are typically acquired. METHODS: A 12-month audit (11/2003-10/2004) of all medication overdose presentations to an inner-Melbourne ED was conducted and the medications compared to published population-based prescription data. Interviews were conducted with 31 patients who attended the ED following a medication overdose and typical stories regarding the acquisition of medications reported. RESULTS: The same broad categories of medications identified in earlier studies were found to contribute to the majority of overdoses in this study, namely benzodiazepines, antidepressants, analgesics and antipsychotics. Two benzodiazepine medications, diazepam and alprazolam, appeared to be over-represented in the overdose data relative to their population rates of prescription. Patient interviews revealed three main reasons for the original acquisition of the medications used in overdose: treatment purposes (77%); recreational use (16%); and overdose (7%). The most common source of medications (68%) used in overdose was prescription by the patient's usual doctor. CONCLUSION: The high representation of benzodiazepines among medications used in overdose is of ongoing concern. IMPLICATIONS: The time of medication prescription and dispensing may be an ideal opportunity for overdose prevention, through judicious prescribing, consideration of treatment alternatives, patient education and encouraging the safe disposal of unused medications.","P.

We present the 2004 study and compare the results with the previous years. METHODS AND RESULTS: Methodology has been identical across VEIA STUDY. Of 1508 AP, 610 are suicide attempts (IAVIS), 319 ethylic, (IAVE), and 218 by illicit drugs (IAVD).

CONCLUSIONS: There is an important increase (34%) of cases and the incidence surpasses all published in our country. There are no gender differences nor in the whole neither the Health Area Census, but there are differences in IAVIS, IAVE and IAVD. IAVIS increase in 35%. Benzodiacepines poisoning increases two-fold as well as antidepressive drugs do in women. In men also increase, but in a minor extent. Acetaminophen remains the same in 23%. NSAID's, adjuvants and myorelaxants increase in women as do also alcohol and other poisons that almost equal men's. There are 13 cases of IAVIS in patients with alimentary disorders. Among men, a quarter are illicit drug abusers. In IAVE, the group without alcoholism grows and the total decreases. Illicit drugs duplicate the number of the former year.

RESULTS: The percentage of patients with depersonalization, similarly to other studies, is quantitatively different in the two samples. However, what seems obvious is that if the differences for what concerns the frequency and the symptomatic intensity are rather marked, otherwise for what concerns the psychodinamic aspect the differences appears less sharp.

METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted with workers who had been treated in EDs for potential work-related exposures to BBP in 2000-2002. Respondents were drawn from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. RESULTS: Of the 593 interviews, 382 were from hospitals, 51 were from emergency medical service/firefighting (EMS/FF), 86 were from non-hospital healthcare settings (e.g., nursing homes, doctors' offices, home healthcare providers, etc.), 22 were from law enforcement (including police and correctional facilities), and 52 were from other non-healthcare settings (i.e., schools, hotels, and restaurants). Needlestick/sharps injuries were the primary source of exposure in hospitals and non-hospital healthcare settings. Skin and mucous membrane was the primary route of exposure in EMS/FF. Human bites accounted for a significant portion of the exposures in law enforcement and other non-healthcare settings. In general, workers from non-hospital settings were less likely to use PPE, to have BBP safety training, to be aware of the BBP standards and exposure treatment procedures, and to report or seek treatment for a work-related exposure compared to hospital workers.

1117,"Transit operators, relative to workers in many other occupations, experience high levels of work-related stress, as documented through neuroendocrine elevations on the job vis-a-vis resting states (J Occup Health Psychol. 1998;3:122-129). Previous research suggests that self-reported job stress is associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption among transit operators (Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 2000;24:1011-1019) and with absenteeism (Working Environment for Local Public Transport Personnel, Stockholm: Swedish Work Environmental Fund, 1982; Work Stress. 1990;4:83-89). The purpose of this study was to examine the interrelationships between alcohol use, stress-related factors (stressful life events, job stressors, and burnout), and short-term absenteeism among a multiethnic cohort of urban transit operators. Self-reported measures of alcohol, stress-related factors, and short-term absenteeism were obtained from a sample (n=1,446) of San Francisco municipal transit operators who participated in the 1993-1995 Municipal Railway Health and Safety Study. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that absenteeism among drinkers was associated with risk for alcohol dependence [odds ratio (OR)=2.46, heavy drinking (OR=1.87), alcohol-related harm (OR=2.17), increased drinking since becoming a transit operator (OR=1.74), and having any problem drinking indicator (OR=1.72). The association between absenteeism and stress-related factors varied by gender and drinking status. Final multivariate models among drinkers indicated that among males, problem drinking (OR=1.82), stressful life events (OR=1.62), and job burnout (OR=1.22) were independently associated with elevated odds of absenteeism. Among female drinkers, only stressful life events (OR=5.17) was significantly associated with elevated odds of absenteeism.

1118,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of hypotension associated with the use of midazolam for prehospital rapid-sequence intubation (RSI). METHODS: A retrospective review was performed using charts from the two aeromedical agencies servicing the authors' region. The RSI protocols used by crews from the northern (north) and the southern (south) parts of the region were identical, with the exception of midazolam dosing. The north crews used 0.1 mg/kg for all patients, while the south crews used 0.1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 5 mg. All patients receiving midazolam for prehospital RSI were pooled, with multiple linear regression used to investigate the relationship between midazolam dose and both hypotension and a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) following RSI. Patients weighing >50 kg and patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) were evaluated separately to determine differences between north and south with regard to midazolam dosing and incidence of hypotension. Multivariate logistical regression was used to test for these differences and for potential confounders such as age, initial SBP, and Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS). RESULTS: A total of 219 patients were identified from the north (n = 75) and the south (n = 144). Multiple linear regression revealed a statistically significant relationship between midazolam dose and both hypotension and an SBP decrease following RSI. There was no difference between north and south with regard to age, sex, incidence of TBI, initial SBP, or GCS. In patients >50 kg, those from the north received higher doses of midazolam and had a higher incidence of hypotension than those from the south.

After EMS transport, the Placebo Stress versus Control group had significantly increased epinephrine (51 +/- 4 pg/mL versus 37 +/- 4 pg/mL; P < 0.05) but not norepinephrine (216 +/- 24 pg/mL versus 237 +/- 18 pg/mL) plasma levels, whereas no significant differences in catecholamine plasma levels occurred between groups after either 25 or 50 microg/kg of midazolam. In conclusion, simulated EMS patients may be subject to more stress during staircase transport than during transport in an EMS vehicle. Titrating sedation with 25 microg/kg of midazolam significantly reduced endogenous catecholamines but not heart rate. IMPLICATIONS: Simulated emergency medical service patients were more likely to be stressed when being transported by paramedics through a staircase than in an ambulance. Accordingly, it may be beneficial to inject sedative drugs before initiating transport to ensure patient comfort and safety.","V. Dorges, V. Wenzel, S. Dix, A. Kuhl, T. Schumann, M. Huppe, H.

1121,"Between October 1983 and December 1985, 268 patients were brought by police to a psychiatric hospital in south London under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Comparisons were made between 'blacks' and 'whites' on several clinical and demographic variables. The vast majority of admissions received a psychiatric diagnosis. An excess of black admissions was recorded. Black men were younger, were more likely than whites to be given neuroleptics, to be put on compulsory orders, and to be given an out-patient appointment when discharged from hospital. More black men were given a case-note diagnosis of schizophrenia or drug-induced psychosis. The differences in clinical management between ethnic groups could be at least partly accounted for by these differences in diagnosis. Treatment did not appear to be independent of diagnosis among the black admissions.","J. Dunn, T. A. Fahy (1990).  Police admissions to a psychiatric hospital.

1122,"OBJECTIVE: To report on a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) who attempted suicide by taking an overdose of interferon (IFN) beta-1a. CASE SUMMARY: A 38-year-old man with MS and depressive symptoms self-administered approximately 6 or 7 prefilled syringes containing 44 mug (12 MIU) of subcutaneous IFN beta-1a in a suicide attempt. Clinical examination in the emergency department revealed a modest rise in body temperature and diffuse redness of the skin of the limbs and truncal region. The patient's signs and symptoms resolved over the following 24 hours. IFN beta-1a was temporarily withdrawn and treatment with citalopram, which the patient had spontaneously discontinued before the suicide attempt, was resumed. Laboratory assessment showed no modifications in biochemical and hematologic parameters. The IFN beta-1a concentration in the serum sample taken at 48 hours after the suicide attempt confirmed that the patient had taken a very high dose of IFN. DISCUSSION: Depression, a common condition in MS patients, was precipitated in this patient by the spontaneous discontinuation of citalopram and not influenced by IFN beta-1a therapy, which the patient resumed at 44 mug 3 times per week. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the risks of depression in MS patients and the danger of discontinuing treatment with antidepressants. This report also shows that approximately 264-308 mug of IFN beta-1a, the highest single dose of IFN beta-1a reported taken by a human as of this writing, caused only a transient and self-limiting malaise.","N.

1123,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: To assess the prevalence and correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression and anxiety disorders other than PTSD, among three samples with different level of exposure to the March 11, 2004 terrorist attacks in Madrid. METHOD: We sampled three groups of persons-those injured in the attacks, the residents of Alcala de Henares, and police officers involved with the rescue effort-with different exposure to the March 11, 2004 terrorist attacks, using random sampling from comprehensive censuses of all three groups. In person interviews were conducted with all three groups between 5 and 12 weeks after March 11, 2004. Questionnaire included assessment of socio-demographic characteristics, of PTSD using the Davidson trauma scale, and of a range of psychiatric illnesses using the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI). RESULTS: The overall sample included 127 persons injured in the attack, 485 residents of Alcala de Henares, and 153 policemen involved in rescue. Of all three groups 57.5%, 25.9% and 3.9% of persons, respectively, reported symptoms consistent with any assessed psychiatric disorder. The use of psychoactive medication before March 11, 2004 was consistently the main predictor of PTSD and major depression among those injured and of major depression and anxiety disorders others than PTSD among residents of Alcala. CONCLUSIONS: There was a substantial burden of psychological consequences of the March 11, 2004 terrorist attacks two months after the event. Persons with prior mental illness are at higher risk of post-event psychopathology, across groups of exposure.","R. Gabriel, L. Ferrando, E. S. Corton, C. Mingote, E. Garcia-Camba, A. F. Liria, S.

1124,"OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of emergency department visits related with ecstasy usage, determine the rate of re-visits of the patients and their related factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. RESULTS: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months. The need for an urgent psychiatric visit (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 2.9-12.8) and hospital admission (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.5-8.4) during their first ED attendance were independently associated with a greater risk of re-attendance. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy consumption frequently leads to an ED visit, sometimes due to severe medical complications, and at least 15% of patients will need urgent care again for drug-related problems within the next 3 years. This likelihood increases along with increased severity of the index episode (need of psychiatric consultation or hospital admission).","M. Galicia, S. Nogue, E. Sanjurjo, O. Miro (2010).

1125,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Liquid ecstasy (GHB) is a new cause of drug overdose in our country. To describe the epidemiological profile and clinical manifestations, we analyzed cases of poisoning by GHB attended by the Emergency Departments (ED) of 2 hospitals of the city of Barcelona. PATIENTS AND METHOD: During two years (2003-2004) all cases of poisoning or overdose due to GHB attended in the ED of the Hospital del Mar and the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona were collected. The diagnosis was clinical and/or by means of toxicological analysis. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and therapeutic variables as well as the evolution were collected. RESULTS: A total of 339 patients (mean age 23.5 years, 62% male) were identified. Most patients (89%) were admitted during the early morning and during weekends (89%). Symptoms began in a public place in 97%. Reduced consciousness was the most important clinical manifestation, since 72% of patients had a Glasgow Coma Score of 12 or less. Seventy per cent stated having consumed GHB with other drugs, mainly ethyl alcohol (53%) and cocaine (16%). Some form of treatment was required in 32% of cases and 20 cases were administered an antidote: naloxone (12 cases), flumazenil (8 cases) and physostigmine (6 cases). Five patients needed orotracheal intubation and ventilatory support. One patient needed advanced vital support. There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: GHB intoxication leading to reduced consciousness is a frequent motive for admission to the ED, mostly in young people and in the early morning during the weekend. GHB intoxication should be discarded in all cases of coma of unknown origin.","M. Galicia, S. Nogue, J. To-Figueras, J. L. Echarte, M. L. Iglesias, O. Miro (2008).

The patient presented with lethargy and cardiac conduction delays (QRS 110 msec, QTc 458 msec) and developed a delayed seizure. On admission, therapy with intravenous sodium bicarbonate promptly narrowed the QRS to 90 msec. A comprehensive toxicology screen demonstrated only a serum fluoxetine concentration of 901 ng/mL (therapeutic range, 37-301), a serum norfluoxetine concentration of 451 ng/mL (29-329) and a serum acetaminophen concentration of 174 mg/L. Tricyclic antidepresants were specifically noted to be absent. A self-limiting generalized seizure was witnessed 16 hours after ingestion. At this time the bicarbonate infusion had been ceased and the QRS interval was not prolonged.

Thirty-six outpatient clients received at least three sessions of integrative psychotherapy, which included elements of psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral therapy approaches, under routine clinical conditions. Approximately 19% of clients experienced a sudden gain and 27% of clients experienced a sudden deterioration. Those who experienced deteriorations had worse therapy outcomes compared with those who did not. Clinical implications are discussed, including the importance of routine monitoring of client treatment response for sudden deteriorations to enhance positive treatment outcomes.

She had consulted her primary care physician and dentist without achieving the correct diagnosis or significant relief of her symptoms. The emergency physician made the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia by obtaining a history of severe paroxysmal ipsilateral facial pain activated by numerous facial stimuli. A light stimulation of the trigger point precipitated the pain. Her pain relief from carbamazepine lent further credence to the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia and appropriate referral to a neurosurgeon. Pain relief was ultimately achieved for the last 8 months by a neurectomy of the right infraorbital nerve. [References: 18]","E. M. Jackson, G. M. Bussard, M. A. Hoard, R. F. Edlich (1999).

1131,"Relay operations are an important mode of freight transportation within Australia. Relay work requires multiple crews to drive the train continuously from one specified destination to another and return. Importantly, the nature of relay work requires train drivers to sleep on-board during designated resting shifts. The main aim of the present study was to investigate the quality and quantity of sleep obtained in on-board rest facilities (relay vans) during extended (four-day) relay operations. Drivers (n = 9) working the Port Augusta to Darwin relay operation volunteered to participate. The first leg of the trip typically took 40 h followed by an overnight stay in Darwin (between 8-12 h) prior to return. Two crews, each consisting of two drivers, changed every 8 h, giving the crew an 8 h rest in the relay van prior to each 8 h working shift. Using polysomnography, home sleep data were collected prior to and following each trip using a standard five-channel EEG montage. All sleep periods during the relay trip (including Darwin) were also recorded. Additionally, subjective sleep quality ratings were recorded following each sleep period. Analyses revealed that the quantity of sleep obtained in the relay vans (3.3 h) was significantly reduced compared to home (6.8 h). In general, the total sleep time was increased at night and reduced during the day. In terms of quality, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and amount of slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep did not differ significantly between home and the relay vans. The results of the study highlight sleep quantity as the main concern during extended relay operations. Future research should focus on investigating the subjective and objective impact of this sleep reduction on waking functions.","S. M. Jay, D. Dawson, N. Lamond (2006).

1132,"More than 35,000 individuals are estimated to have responded to the World Trade Center (WTC) site following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The federally funded WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (WTCMMTP) provides medical monitoring and occupational medicine treatment as well as counseling regarding entitlements and benefits to the workers and volunteers who participated in the WTC response. A major component of the WTCMMTP is the WTC Mental Health Program (WTCMHP), which offers annual mental health assessments and ongoing treatment for those found to have 9/11 associated mental health problems. In the program's 9.5 years of evaluating and treating mental health problems in thousands of Ground Zero responders, diversity in multiple domains (e.g., gender, family, profession and employment status, state of physical health, cultural identity, and immigration status) has been a hallmark of the population served by the program. To illustrate the types of issues that arise in treating this diverse patient population, the authors first present a representative case involving a Polish asbestos worker with an alcohol use disorder. They then discuss how accepted alcohol treatment modalities can and often must be modified in providing psychiatric treatment to Polish responders, in particular, and to foreign-born patients in general. Treatment modalities discussed include cognitive and behavioral therapy, relapse prevention strategies, psychodynamic therapy, motivational approaches, family therapy, group peer support, and pharmacotherapy.

This paper describes such a course developed for the Tel-Aviv University Medical School graduate program in occupational health. The course objectives are consistent with the current call for improved training in psychosocial issues in medical care. Twenty-three occupational health practitioners (physicians, nurses, hygienists, and social workers) participated in a bisemester course. The first part included a stress management and prevention program based on the Rational-Emotive Training model. The main aim was to reduce irrational or dysfunctional thinking, which is considered a causal factor in stress and burnout. The second part involved the development and implementation of a field project on primary and secondary prevention of stress and its outcomes. Precourse, midcourse, and postcourse questionnaires showed a significant improvement in participants' psychosocial ability and a reduction in dysfunctional thinking compared with the control group.

1134,"BACKGROUND: Initial management of acute occupational low back pain (AOLBP) commonly occurs in the emergency department (ED), where opioid prescribing can vary from the clinical guidelines that recommend limited use. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore how opioids are prescribed in the ED and the impact on work disability and other outcomes in AOLBP. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. All acute compensable lost-time LBP cases seen initially in the ED with a date of injury from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011 were identified within a nationally representative Workers' Compensation dataset. Multivariate models estimated the effect of early opioids (received within 2 days of ED visit) on disability duration, long-term opioid use, total medical costs, and subsequent surgeries. RESULTS: Of the cohort (N = 2887), 12% received early opioids; controlling for severity, this was significantly associated with long-term opioid use (adjusted risk ratio = 1.29; 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.58) and increased total medical costs for those in the highest opioid dosage quartile, but not associated with disability duration or subsequent low back surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Early opioid prescribing in the ED for uncomplicated AOLBP increased long-term opioid use and medical costs, and should be discouraged, as opioid use for low back pain has been associated with a variety of adverse outcomes.

1136,"A prospective observational study in an inner-city teaching hospital was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous methohexital (MTX) in the emergency department (ED). Pulse oximetry, vital signs and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were recorded serially for 30 minutes after the administration of MTX to 76 adult patients. Likert scales of 1 to 5 were used to record the physician's assessment of the adequacy of sedation and the patient's assessments of recall and pain of the procedure. Patients received an average of 88 +/- 21 mg of MTX for a variety of indications (orthopedic procedures, 78%; sedation for other procedures, 14%; intubation, 5%; and psychiatric interview, 3%). No patient had clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure. Eight (10.5%) had apnea, although only one patient had oxygen saturations of less than 90%. Each episode was brief and easily managed with bag-valve-mask ventilation. Risk factors for apnea included a history of alcoholism (P = .0003) and recent recreational narcotic use (P = .0139). Patients were maximally sedated in an average of 37 +/- 42 seconds. In the subset of initially alert patients, GCS scores decreased from 15 at baseline to 5.9 +/- 4.5. The physician's assessment of the adequacy of sedation was excellent (4.7 +/- 0.7). Patients reported little recall (1.3 +/- 0.9) or pain (1.3 +/- 0.8). It was concluded that MTX caused clinically insignificant changes in hemodynamics or oxygenation, although respiratory depression did occur; significant respiratory depression was brief and easily managed. MTX provided rapid and excellent levels of sedation with little or no patient recall or pain.","B. Lerman, D. Yoshida, M. A. Levitt (1996).

1138,"CONTEXT: Novel psychoactive substances (NPS) are being created and introduced at an unprecedented rate, causing frequent, large-scale epidemics. Current identification of NPS in clinical settings in the USA is limited to the retrospective case or small cluster analysis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of non-targeted comprehensive drug screening in the agitated patients in an emergency department (ED) setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective, observational case series that was conducted in the ED of an urban Level I Trauma Center with an annual census of approximately 65,000 patients per year. Since it is common clinical practice at this facility for haloperidol to be used as a second-line chemical restraint when initial dose(s) of benzodiazepines are deemed insufficient, we surmised that the subset of ED patients with psychomotor agitation severe enough to receive both these pharmaceuticals would be likely users of NPS. For 1 month, biweekly pharmacy medication audits identified 49 of these patients. There were sufficient, remaining blood samples from 23 of these patients for analysis. Serum from stored blood samples was analyzed using liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF/MS; LC 1260, TOF/MS 6230, Agilent). Retrospective chart review was done to identify patient clinical information. RESULTS: Six patient samples yielded seven different NPS: JWH-073, JWH-081, JWH-200, methylenedioxybenzylpiperazine, mephedrone, methoxetamine, and herkinorin.

There is limited data on clinical characteristics of patients with ART-associated gynaecomastia in resource-limited settings and little guidance on the optimal management of this adverse drug reaction (ADR). We describe the clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of gynaecomastia cases reported to the National HIV & Tuberculosis Health Care Worker Hotline in South Africa. METHODS: We identified all gynaecomastia cases in adolescent boys and men on ART reported to the hotline between June 2013 and July 2014. We collected follow up data telephonically at monthly intervals to document clinical management and outcomes. RESULTS: We received 51 reports of gynaecomastia between June 2013 and July 2014; 11% of the 475 patient-specific ADR queries to the hotline. All patients were on efavirenz-based ART. Mean age was 34 years (standard deviation 12) and seven were adolescents. The median onset of gynaecomastia was 15 months after efavirenz initiation (interquartile range 6-42). Gynaecomastia was bilateral in 29 patients (57%) and unilateral in 16 (31%). Serum testosterone was quantified in 25 of 35 patients with follow up data, and was low in 2 (8%). Efavirenz was replaced with an alternative antiretroviral in 29/35 patients (83%) and gynaecomastia improved in 20/29 (69%).

1143,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Exposures to HIV are frequently managed in the emergency department (ED) for assessment and potential initiation of HIV postexposure prophylaxis. Despite established guidelines, it is unclear whether patients with a nonoccupational exposure are managed similarly to patients with an occupational exposure. METHODS: This retrospective study used an administrative database to identify consecutive patients at a single ED with a discharge diagnosis of ""blood or body fluid exposure"" without sexual assault from April 1, 2007 to June 30, 2013. Patient exposure details and physician management were ascertained according to predefined guidelines. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with high-risk exposures who were correctly given HIV prophylaxis; the secondary outcome was the proportion of patients with low-risk exposures who were correctly not given HIV prophylaxis. Other outcomes included the proportion of patients who had a baseline HIV test in the ED, the proportion who followed up with an HIV test within 6 months, and the number of seroconversions in this group. All outcomes were compared between nonoccupational and occupational exposure. RESULTS: Of 1,972 encounters, 1,358 patients (68.9%) had an occupational exposure and 614 (31.1%) had a nonoccupational exposure. In the occupational exposure group, 190 patients (14.0%) were deemed high risk, with 160 (84.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 78.1% to 88.9%) appropriately given prophylaxis. In the nonoccupational exposure group, 287 patients (46.7%) had a high-risk exposure, with 208 (72.5%; 95% CI 66.8% to 77.5%) given prophylaxis, for a difference of 11.7% (95% CI 3.8% to 19.1%). For low-risk exposures, appropriate management of both occupational and nonoccupational exposure was similar (92.4% versus 93.0%). At the index ED visit, 90.5% of occupational exposure patients and 76.7% of nonoccupational exposure patients received HIV testing, for a difference of 13.8% (95% CI 10.1% to 17.7%). At 6 months, 25.4% of patients with an occupational exposure and 35.0% of patients with a nonoccupational exposure had a follow-up test, for a difference of -9.6% (95% CI -14.2% to -5.1%). Of patients who had follow-up testing within 6 months, 4 of 215 (1.9%) in the nonoccupational exposure group tested newly positive for HIV, whereas 0 of 345 (0%) in the occupational exposure group tested positive. CONCLUSION: For ED patients with blood or body fluid exposures, those with high-risk nonoccupational exposures were not given HIV prophylaxis nearly twice as often as those with high-risk occupational exposure. Although 6-month follow-up testing rates were low, 1.9% of high-risk nonoccupational exposure patients seroconverted.","S. O'Donnell, T. D. Bhate, E. Grafstein, W. Lau, R. Stenstrom, F. X.

1144,"Prochlorperazine (Compazine, PCZ) is a frequently used medication in the emergency department (ED). Akathisia and dystonia are known adverse reactions to the use of this medication, but their incidence in the ED has not been well studied. We conducted a prospective, descriptive study to evaluate the frequency of akathisia and dystonia in the ED from the use of IV or IM PCZ in patients with nausea/vomiting or headache. Two hundred-twenty nine patients (> or =18 years old) were enrolled and contacted within 2 weeks of ED discharge to access the incidence of these adverse reactions. After the use of PCZ in the ED, 16% of patients developed akathisia and 4% developed dystonia.

1145,"INTRODUCTION: There is increasing evidence relating the presence of depression in seniors and the risk of hospital admission in medical departments from the Emergency Services. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of antidepressant treatment (ATD) as a protective factor for emergency hospitalization in older people. METHOD: All patients aged 65 and over who required urgent attention for medical reasons at the Emergency Department of the Corporacio Sanitaria i Universitaria Parc Tauli (Sabadell, Barcelona, Spain) for the period between January and October 2012 were included in the study. Sociodemographic variables, alcohol and tobacco use, medical history and psychopharmacological treatment were obtained. The necessary sample size was calculated and a simple randomization was performed. Subsequently, a descriptive statistical analysis and parametric tests were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 674 patients (53% women) were evaluated, with a mean age of 78.45 years, and 27.6% of the cases (71% women) were receiving ATD. Among the 333 admitted patients (50%), 83 individuals (24.6%) had previously received ATD; this contrasts with the 103 cases (30.6%) of prior ATD treatment among the patients who were not admitted. After comparative analysis, the relationship between previous use of ATD and being admitted to hospital was not statistically significant in our global sample. This relationship was only statistically significant among the group aged 75 and over (neg. sig. 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, ATD was associated with a decreased risk of hospital admission for urgent medical conditions in people aged 75 and over. Treating depression may protect the elderly against admission to the Emergency department and may potentially be a quality criterion in preventing complications in this population.","N. Ortuno, J.

1147,"This article presents data on the prevalence of hearing impairment among the workers engaged in the main means of transportation(air and railway transport). They show that the relative frequency of occupational loss of hearing in the cockpit members of commercial aviation amounts to one third of all cases of analogous diseases in this country. The main professional groups of transport works suffering from hearing impairment are constituted by the representatives of the so-called elite specialities, such as flying crew personnel, locomotive engineers, and their assistants. This fact constitutes an important aspect (not only of medical but also of socio-economic significance) of the problem under consideration. The high prevalence of professional hearing impairment among the transport workers is attributable to the high noise level in the cabins of locomotives and aircraft cockpits as well as to the inadequate expert and diagnostic work or imperfection of the regulatory documentation.","V.

1148,"Midazolam is a new imidazobenzodiazepine derivative that is two to three times as potent as diazepam, is water-soluble, has a rapid onset and short duration of action, and produces a profound amnestic effect. These properties make it an extremely useful drug for outpatient sedation. We performed retrospective review of midazolam use in a general emergency department over a one-year period. Midazolam was used in 120 patients, 71 men and 49 women, with an average age of 46 years. The average dose given was 3.4 mg, with a range of 1 to 10 mg. In 69 of the cases (57%) other drugs were administered, most commonly an opiate. There were only four adverse reactions. One patient developed urinary retention, one patient vomited, and two patients were somnolent for a prolonged period of time. There were no serious cardiovascular or respiratory problems. We conclude that midazolam is a safe drug to use in the emergency department. Close monitoring of the patient and the availability of airway support equipment are mandatory.","E. A. Ramoska, R.

1149,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the adherence of occupational physicians (OP) to the Dutch guideline on the management of common mental health problems and its effect on return to work as part of the process evaluation of a trial comparing adherence to the guideline to care as usual. The first hypothesis was that guideline adherence among the ""guideline group"" will be higher compared to the ""usual care group"". The second hypothesis was that better guideline adherence by the occupational physician will be associated with earlier return to work. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, five participating OP had to provide care based on the Dutch guideline to 240 police workers with common mental health problems (the ""guideline group""). The same OP had to provide usual care to the participants in the control group (the ""usual care"" group), including minimal involvement and easy access to a psychologist. In evaluating the process, we assessed guideline adherence via an audit of medical files, using 20 guideline-based performance indicators. Mean rates of guideline adherence were related to the duration until first and full return to work, using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The mean rate of the sum score of guideline adherence was 10 in a range of 0-20 [standard deviation (SD) 1.8] and did not significantly differ between the intervention and control group. Mean better guideline adherence showed a statistically significant association with a shorter time to first and full return to work [hazard ratio 1.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0-1.2], which was explained by keeping more regular contact with the worker and the work system and better monitoring of stagnation or return to work. CONCLUSIONS: No contrast in guideline adherence was found between guideline-based versus usual care. This can be explained by contamination between the guideline and usual care group. Even though guideline adherence was only average, better adherence predicted earlier return to work. Guidelines for management of common mental health problems and return to work should focus on regular contact with the worker and the work organisation.","D. S. Rebergen, D. J. Bruinvels, C. M.

1150,"BACKGROUND: Mental health problems often lead to prolonged sick leave. In primary care, the usual approach towards these patients was the advice to take rest and not return to work before all complaints had disappeared. When complaints persist, these patients are often referred to psychologists from primary and specialized secondary care. As an alternative, ways have been sought to activate the Dutch occupational physician (OP) in primary care. Early 2000, the Dutch Association of Occupational Physicians (NVAB) published a guideline concerning the management by OPs of employees with mental health problems. The guideline received positive reactions from employees, employers and Dutch OPs. This manuscript describes the design of a study, which aims to assess the effects of the guideline, compared with usual care. METHODS/DESIGN: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), subjects in the intervention group were treated according to the guideline. The control group received usual care, with minimal involvement of the OP and easy access to a psychologist. Subjects were recruited from two Dutch police departments. The primary outcomes of the study are return to work and treatment satisfaction by the employee, employer, and OP. A secondary outcome is cost-effectiveness of the intervention, compared with usual care. Furthermore, prognostic measures are taken into account as potential confounders. A process evaluation will be done by means of performance indicators, based on the guideline. DISCUSSION: In this pragmatic trial, effectiveness instead of efficacy is studied. We will evaluate what is possible in real clinical practice, rather than under ideal circumstances. Many requirements for a high quality trial are being met. Results of this study will contribute to treatment options in occupational health practice for employees on sick leave due to mental health problems. Additionally, they may contribute to new and better-suited guidelines and stepped care. Results will become available during 2007. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN34887348.","D.

1151,"The clinical records of patients attended at emergency hospitals in fifteen hospitals in Madrid, Valencia and Gran Canaria during 1994 were retrospectively analyzed. Seventy-three emergencies related to the consumption of design drugs, hallucinogens or amphetamines (100 times lower than because of opiates or cocaine) were recorded. Apart from the responsible drug for the emergency visit, in most cases the usual consumption of other substances was mentioned. Acute psychopathological reactions predominated. Three patients were admitted and five were derived to other hospitals; the remaining patients improved and were discharged. The number of emergencies on account of these drugs is relatively low, with a proportion of less than one in 10,000 emergencies attended in these areas and might not radically change if the current predominant consumption pattern is maintained.","M.

1152,"We studied cross-seasonal changes in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms in 52 wildland firefighters in Northern California. The mean cross-seasonal change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was -1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.5%, -2.0%) with a corresponding mean change in forced expiratory volume (FVC) of -0.3% (95% CI 0.4%, -1.0%). Decreases in FEV1 and FVC were most strongly associated with hours of recent fire-fighting activity (P = .002 and .01, respectively). When the study group was divided into three categories based on recent fire-fighting activity, firefighters in the high activity category (mean +/- SE, 73 +/- 7 hours of fire-fighting in previous week) had a -2.9% (130 mL) change in FEV1 and a -1.9% (102 mL) change in forced vital capacity (FVC). There was a significant cross-seasonal increase in most respiratory symptoms evaluated. Several symptoms (eye irritation, nose irritation, and wheezing) were associated with recent fire-fighting. These findings suggest that wildland firefighters experience a small cross-seasonal decline in pulmonary function and an increase in several respiratory symptoms. Research is under way to identify the fire conditions and specific components of exposure that produce pulmonary irritants, and to examine the potential reversibility of acute pulmonary change.","N.

1153,"INTRODUCTION: After a major disaster in a developing country, the graphic media coverage of the dead and injured invariably leads to an influx of volunteering healthcare personnel to the disaster zone. Very few studies document the outcomes of the treatment rendered in this field setting, under compromised conditions. We revisited the rural victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake in an attempt to analyse their surgical outcome and the status of their physical/psychosocial rehabilitation, 2 years after the disaster. METHOD: We traced displaced victims treated for earthquake-related injuries to their new homes. A community health worker interviewed patients with an oral questionnaire in the local language about injuries, the examining physician and first aid, orthopaedic implants, amputations, wounds, disability, deformity, residual pain, occupational and economic rehabilitation, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and perceptions of healthcare rendered. RESULTS: We located 133 of the 179 non-urban victims, from 11 villages. There were 10% missed injuries, 19% infection rate, restricted range of motion in 12%, non-union rate in 23% and reoperations in 30.5% patients. Fifty-one percent had resumed their previous occupation, but only 30% had recovered economically. Of 98% who had destroyed homes, 89% had their homes rebuilt. Residual sadness was the only significant PTSD symptom. CONCLUSION: This trauma outcome study highlights the shortcomings of surgeons for disaster-related work. One-tenth of the injuries were missed, suggesting that field examination at the site of disaster was more difficult than in the comfort of the hospital emergency room. Further there were inappropriately timed, aggressive implant operations, short time commitments, a lack of follow-up and a high rate of reoperations contributing to subsequent morbidity. These pointed to a need for training in disaster medicine within the curriculum of surgical residency. On the brighter side, despite poor sterility, prolonged transport times and no prehospital care, the postoperative infection rate was lower than expected. This perhaps was due to use of potent antibiotics in a previously unexposed rural population. Good physiotherapy given in the temporary shelters, by the informal carers within the family and by voluntary groups, kept up a good range of motion and reduced the final disability. PTSD was marked 3-6 months after the event, but was minimal 2 years postquake. Sadness about the event was the only residual PTSD symptom. While there were varying perceptions of satisfactory outcome, we found good coping mechanisms in place. The simple village folks were largely happy to be alive and accepted the residual deformities and cosmetic blemishes as a ""small price to pay"".","N. Roy, H. Shah, V. Patel, H. Bagalkote (2005).

1154,"OBJECTIVE: To assess adrenocortical function following intravenous etomidate use in emergency department (ED) patients requiring intubation. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of consecutive patients presenting to the ED requiring intubation. Patients were randomized to receive a single bolus induction dose of either 0.05-0.1 mg/kg midazolam (control group) or 0.3 mg/kg etomidate (etomidate group) during a standardized rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) with succinylcholine. The primary outcome variable was adrenocortical function at 4, 12, and 24 hours post-induction as assessed by measured serum cortisol response to exogenous cosyntropin (cosyntropin stimulation test, CST). Fisher's exact test was used to compare CST results between groups. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were enrolled: 8 control, 10 etomidate, and 13 excluded from analysis for either incomplete data or steroid use during the study period. The 4-hour CST results were significantly different between study groups, with a normal response in 100% of control patients vs 30% of etomidate patients (p = 0.004). The 12- and 24-hour CSTs did not differ significantly between groups: normal CST in 100% of control patients at 12 and 24 hours vs 100% and 90% among etomidate patients at 12 and 24 hours, respectively (p = 1.0 at 12 and 24 hours). Measured cortisol levels of patients with abnormal CSTs remained within normal laboratory reference ranges. CONCLUSION: Use of etomidate in ED patients requiring RSI results in adrenocortical dysfunction. However, cortisol levels remain within normal laboratory levels during this period of dysfunction. Adrenocortical dysfunction appears to resolve within 12 hours of a single bolus dose of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate.","C. L. Schenarts, J. H. Burton, R. R. Riker (2001).

1157,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare two related pharmacological agents used for the chemical restraint of agitated and combative patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, double-blind, prospective study was carried out in patients requiring physical restraint in a university hospital emergency department. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight violent or agitated adult patients whom the attending physician believed would benefit from chemical restraint to protect the patient and staff and to expedite evaluation. INTERVENTION: Twenty-one participants were administered 5 mg haloperidol IM; 26 were administered 5 mg droperidol IM; 12 were administered haloperidol IV; and nine were administered 5 mg droperidol IV. RESULTS: All patients were rated on a five-point combativeness scale at five, ten, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after the study drug was given. Vital signs also were recorded at these times. IM droperidol decreased combativeness significantly more than IM haloperidol at ten (P = .006), 15 (P = .01), and 30 (P = .04) minutes. There was no significant difference between the two drugs when given by the IV route (beta at the 5% confidence level, P = .78).

1158,"Dementia is a relatively common syndrome seen in the elderly emergency department population. The emergency physician usually sees demented patients secondary to behavioral complications. Diagnosing the syndrome of dementia principally consists of ruling out treatable causes, which can be performed either in an in-patient or out-patient location. The emergency presentations of dementia include disturbances of activity, aggression, and psychosis. Complications that are primarily treated non-pharmacologically include circadian rhythm disturbance, catastrophic reaction (excessive emotional response), and wandering, as well as some mild verbal outbursts and delusions. Pharmacologic interventions are usually necessary for agitation, physical attacks, and significant delusions or hallucinations. Neuroleptic medication is the principal pharmacologic class with which to treat these symptoms, although benzodiazepines are also effective. [References: 38]","M. J. Tueth (1995).

1160,"OBJECTIVE: An epidemic of scopolamine poisonings occurred in Oslo in 2008 among users of illicit drugs, caused by fake Rohypnol pills. The clinical features, diagnostic process, and handling of the epidemic are presented. METHODS: Suspected cases of scopolamine poisoning were extracted by reviewing registration forms from an ongoing prospective clinical study of acute poisonings in Oslo. Medical records of extracted contacts were examined and cases included according to specified clinical criteria. RESULTS: Forty-four cases of probable scopolamine poisoning were registered. Main clinical features were mydriasis, visual hallucinations, plucking behavior, agitation, and coma. No clinical diagnosis of anticholinergic syndrome was made prior to forensic analysis of the tablets, the most frequent diagnosis up to this point being unspecified drug-induced psychosis. Later in the epidemic, scopolamine poisoning became the dominating diagnosis. Ten patients were admitted to psychiatric hospitals, the rest recovered in medical units, or left health care against medical advice. DISCUSSION: Scopolamine poisonings are rare, but the resulting anticholinergic syndrome is well described. The syndrome was not recognized until the forensic analysis result strikingly changed how the patients were diagnosed and handled. A unique aspect of this epidemic was the intoxicating agent being scopolamine-containing tablets looking like Rohypnol, sold and used under the impression of being the latter. CONCLUSION: Recognizing the anticholinergic syndrome is important to provide proper treatment. Forensic analysis was the key to correct diagnosis in this outbreak, demonstrating its importance in verifying an epidemic of poisoning by fake drugs.","O. M. Vallersnes, C. Lund, A. K. Duns, H.

1161,"OBJECTIVES: To predict symptomatology (post-traumatic distress, fatigue, and burnout) due to acute and chronic work related stressors among ambulance personnel. METHODS: Data were gathered from 123 ambulance workers in The Netherlands in a longitudinal design. At two measurements they completed standardised questionnaires to assess health symptoms, such as the Impact of Event Scale, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and the Checklist Individual Strength. Acute stressors were assessed with specific questions, and chronic work related stressors were measured with the Questionnaire on the Experience and Assessment of Work. RESULTS: Most of the ambulance workers had been confronted with acute stressors in their work. They also reported more chronic work related stressors than a reference group. Of the participants, more than a tenth suffered from a clinical level of post-traumatic distress, a tenth reported a fatigue level that put them at high risk for sick leave and work disability and nearly a tenth of the personnel suffered from burnout. Best predictors of symptomatology at time 2 were lack of social support at work and poor communication, such as not being informed about important decisions within the organisation. CONCLUSIONS: Ambulance personnel are at risk to develop health symptoms due to work related stressors. Although, acute stressors are related to health symptoms, such as fatigue, burnout, and post-traumatic symptoms, it was not found to predict health symptoms in the long term. Main risk factors have to do with social aspects of the work environment, in particular lack of support from the supervisor as well as colleagues and poor communication. When implementing workplace interventions these social aspects need to be taken into account.","E. van der Ploeg, R. J. Kleber (2003).

1162,"The main characteristics of the Yantai model are (a) a three-tier (county, township, village) management structure; (b) the vertical integration of community mental health workers, including a professional advisory group of psychiatrists from the central psychiatric hospital, groups of community psychiatrists at small county psychiatric hospitals, non-psychiatric physicians who run psychiatric out-patient clinics at township general hospitals, and village paramedics ('village doctors') who supervise patients in the community; (c) ongoing training of all community mental health workers; (d) registration and yearly follow-up of all patients with mental illnesses in the community; (e) provision of home-care services to a proportion of acutely ill patients; and (f) most of the cost of the service is borne by the state. The network of services provided by this model makes it convenient for patients to obtain treatment and, if necessary, go into hospital; it reduces the economic burden on the family and the community; it combines treatment, prevention, rehabilitation, and supervision under one administrative network; and it decreases the overall level of psychopathology and psychosocial dysfunction in the community.","Q.

1163,"BACKGROUND: Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a dangerous chemical that can cause severe cutaneous burns as well as possible systemic toxicity. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all human HF exposure cases reported to the National Poison Control Center of Taiwan between 1991 and 2010. RESULTS: In this 20-year survey, 324 calls were identified, with a majority of dermal exposure (84%). Occupational exposure accounted for 80% of all cases, with workers in semiconductor industry (61%), cleaning industry (15%), chemical or metal industry (13%), and other industries (11%). Electrolyte imbalances were uncommon, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia were recorded in 8.6%, 1.2%, and 1.5% of all cases, respectively. Most cases (64%) of dermal exposure received antidotal treatment. Treatment modalities of dermal exposure included calcium gluconate soaking, 49.8%; intravenous calcium, 20.6%; and topical use of calcium gluconate gel, 13.9%. Twenty patients (7%) received surgery. Following HF exposure, the majority of patients presented with mild (56.5%) or moderate (36.7%) toxic effects. However, four patients were severely intoxicated; two patients died of HF-related dysrhythmia and shock. CONCLUSIONS: Significant symptomology may occur following HF exposure, and most of the HF exposure required hospitals evaluation. Calcium gluconate soaks appear to be effective in reducing local pain and tissue damage. Hyperkalemia should not be overemphasized as a common finding in HF exposure, hypokalemia tends to occur in cases of severe HF poisoning.","M. L. Wu, C. C. Yang, J. Ger, W. J. Tsai, J. F.

1165,"OBJECTIVE: To review, firstly, published studies comparing classic antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and/or combination of both; and secondly, available data on the use of atypical antipsychotic medications in controlling agitation and aggressive behaviour seen in psychiatric patients in emergency. METHOD: In the first review, studies comparing antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and combination of both; and in the second review, efficacy trials of atypical antipsychotics that include an active and/or inactive comparator for the treatment of acute agitation were identified and reviewed. Data from clinical trials meeting the inclusion criteria were summarised by recording improvement rates, definition of improvement, and timing of defined improvement for individual studies. RESULTS: In the first review, 11 trials were identified meeting the inclusion criteria, eight with a blind design. The total number of subjects was 701. These studies taken together suggest that combination treatment may be superior to the either agent alone with higher improvement rates and lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. In the review of atypical antipsychotic agents as acute antiagitation compounds, five studies were identified, three with a blind design. The total number of subjects was 711, of which 15% (104) was assigned to the placebo arm. This review found atypical antipsychotics to be as effective as the classic ones and more advantageous in many aspects. CONCLUSION: Atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, ziprasidone, and olanzapine with or without benzodiazepines should be considered first in the treatment of acute agitation. If these agents are not available the combination of a classic antipsychotic and a benzodiazepine would be a reasonable alternative. An oral treatment should always be offered first for building up an alliance with the patient and suggesting an internal rather than external locus of control. [References: 42]","A. Yildiz, G. S.

1166,"The following is a description of Helping the Helpers training for 200 teachers and mental health workers from Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia 6 months after the Tsunami disaster. The goal of the training was to build support systems for disaster helpers, who would later treat the local populations who suffered directly or indirectly. The training program included theory and experiential activities concerning trauma, from a holistic coping model perspective, with sensitivity for specific cultural modes of response to processing loss. The article describes the multidimensional model of coping resources called ""BASIC Ph"" used in training crisis and disaster helpers and therapists throughout the world. We used a variety of body/mind activities such as movement, relaxation, healing touch, guided imagery, metaphoric cards, and forms of art therapy. These methods helped develop strategies for coping with trauma and demonstrated effective ways for assisting individuals, families, and communities in the post-Tsunami recovery.

1167,"Evidence-based treatments (EBT) for PTSD remain underutilized. Analog research, however, indicates that patients may be more amenable to receiving EBT for PTSD than utilization rates suggest. This study sought to extend previous studies by investigating PTSD treatment preferences among law enforcement individuals (i.e., active duty officers, cadets, criminal justice students). We asked 379 participants, with varying trauma histories, to read a police traumatic event and imagine they had developed PTSD. Participants rated the credibility of 6 treatment options which they might encounter in a treatment setting, and chose their most and least preferred treatments. Next, they evaluated a widely used debriefing intervention aimed at preventing PTSD. Almost 90% of participants chose exposure or Cognitive Processing Therapy as their first or second most preferred treatment, and they rated these interventions as significantly more credible than the other 4 treatment options. The sample showed ambivalence regarding the perceived efficacy of debriefing but found the rationale credible. This study supports previous analog research indicating that patients may be more interested in EBT than indicated by utilization rates, and suggests that law enforcement departments should consider offering EBT to officers who develop PTSD.

1168,"Paramedics have the highest rate of PTSD among emergency service workers, higher than police or firefighters. This disorder can be detrimental to their personal and family lives, as well as their careers. Current biomedical, behavioral, and socioenvironmental interventions do not address paramedics' work environment, which contributes to the high rate of PTSD. Occupational health nurses can influence the triad of factors contributing to PTSD among paramedics by facilitating social support and emotional expression while advocating for reduced job exposure to traumatic events. This goal can be accomplished by using a component of the Ottawa Charter, creating a supportive work environment, as a framework. Occupational health nurses, together with management and paramedics, can facilitate a sustainable and supportive work environment that initiates change from within the trauma membrane of paramedics' workplaces to prevent PTSD.

1170,"Energy psychology uses cognitive operations such as imaginal exposure to traumatic memories or visualization of optimal performance scenarios -- combined with physical interventions derived from acupuncture, yoga, and related systems -- to induce psychological change. Although a controversial approach, this combination purportedly brings about, with unusual speed and precision, therapeutic shifts in affective, cognitive, and behavioral patterns that underlie a range of psychological concerns. Energy psychology has been applied in the wake of natural and human-made disasters in the Congo, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kenya, Kosovo, Kuwait, Mexico, Moldavia, Nairobi, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, and the United States. At least three international humanitarian relief organizations have adapted energy psychology as a treatment in their postdisaster missions. Four tiers of energy psychology interventions include (1) providing immediate relief/stabilization, (2) extinguishing conditioned responses, (3) overcoming complex psychological problems, and (4) promoting optimal functioning. The first tier is most pertinent in psychological first aid immediately following a disaster, with the subsequent tiers progressively being introduced over time with complex stress reactions and chronic disorders. This article reviews the approach, considers its viability, and offers a framework for applying energy psychology in treating disaster survivors.

1171,"In the new and evolving field of traumatology, the need to keep practitioners apprised of emerging developments is acute. While many journals about trauma exist, most of them focus primarily on publication of empirical research studies. Applied professionals rarely read these journals because they see empirical investigations as having very little relevance to their daily practice. Regrettably, these circumstances foster divisiveness between traumatologists who identify themselves mainly as researchers and those who consider themselves chiefly practitioners. Providing an avenue for bridging and integrating the sub-cultures of trauma research and practice is one of the primary aims of the Journal of Trauma Practice (JTP). JTP also seeks to unite the diverse professions that routinely work with traumatized populations, such as emergency room personnel and other medical practitioners, attorneys and forensic specialists, law enforcement personnel, and emergency service workers. Accomplishing these objectives will require openness to innovation while maintaining high standards of scholarship.

During our many years working in the field, we have observed that psychological trauma is a challenging consequence of the multifaceted situations confronting individuals and communities after disasters. In this article, we describe the EMDR humanitarian interventions provided since 1998 in Latin America and the Caribbean to address survivors' psychological distress after natural disasters (e.g., flooding, landslides, earthquakes), man-made disasters, human massacre, and severe interpersonal violence. Treatment has been provided to child, adolescent, and adult survivors, often in community settings, and to first responders and cancer patients. The EMDR early intervention protocols are brief effective interventions that can be used in the field or emergency situations; there is a body of research supporting the use of modified EMDR therapy protocols to treat acute trauma in both group and individual formats (Jarero, Artigas, & Luber, 2011).

A preliminary psychometric assessment was conducted with the 60 State Attorney General employees who were working with the corpses to establish a triage criterion and provide baseline measures. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the Short Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Rating Interview were administered, and the 32 individuals whose scores indicated moderate-to-severe posttraumatic stress and PTSD symptoms were treated with the eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) Protocol for Recent Critical Incidents (EMDR-PRECI). Participants were assigned to two groups: immediate treatment (severe scores) and waitlist/delayed treatment (moderate scores). Each individual client session lasted between 90 and 120 minutes. Results showed that one session of EMDR-PRECI produced significant improvement on self-report measures of posttraumatic stress and PTSD symptoms for both the immediate treatment and waitlist/delayed treatment groups. This study provides preliminary evidence in support of the protocol's efficacy in a natural setting of a human massacre situation to a group of traumatized adults working under extreme stressors. More controlled research is recommended to evaluate further the protocol's efficacy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate GM density in PTSD in relation to trauma load, and to assess the GM differences between responders (R) and non-responders (NR) to EMDR therapy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of 21 subjects exposed to occupational trauma, who developed PTSD (S), and of 22 who did not (NS), were compared by means of an optimized Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis as implemented in SPM. Within S, further comparisons were made between 10 R and 5 NR. A regression analysis between GM density and the Traumatic Antecedents Questionnaire (TAQ) was also performed on all 43 subjects. Results showed a significantly lower GM density in S as compared to NS in the left posterior cingulate and the left posterior parahippocampal gyrus. Moreover, NR showed a significantly lower GM density as compared to R in bilateral posterior cingulate, as well as anterior insula, anterior parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala in the right hemisphere. Regression analysis showed that GM density negatively correlated with trauma load in bilateral posterior cingulate, left anterior insula, and right anterior parahippocampal gyrus. In conclusion, a GM lower density in limbic and paralimbic cortices were found to be associated with PTSD diagnosis, trauma load, and EMDR treatment outcome, suggesting a view of PTSD characterized by memory and dissociative disturbances.

1178,"This article looks at a psychotherapist's lessons learned at the intersection of trauma and antisocial behavior in 20 years of working in American prisons, forensic hospitals, and trauma centers. Typically, PTSD presents as an anxiety disorder with the symptom triad of avoidance, reexperiencing, and hyperarousal. Therapy can proceed once some level of safety has been achieved. But many potential patients do not have a safe space for the work to proceed. Instead, they are living in conditions of ongoing exposure to trauma that has been variously described as complex PTSD and continuous traumatic stress. Anxiety would hardly be adaptive for survival in this environment and, in fact, the symptom picture is often dominated by anger, aggression, and callousness. When these potential patients are found in jails, prisons, and hospital emergency rooms, their outward presentation, instead of centering on anxiety, can appear more like conduct disorder or even criminal psychopathy. They may have been victims, but they frequently have also been perpetrators of violence. These patients need and deserve a trauma-centered treatment, but exposure therapy is hardly appropriate for someone who is experiencing ongoing traumatic conditions. Therapy can proceed, however, and be successful, but the techniques that the therapist uses may be quite different from those found in other settings. A theory of how trauma connects to antisocial presentations will be described, and some of the lessons learned in working with this population will be shared.

By working in professional positions in law enforcement, fire sciences, emergency medical services and search and rescue and as 911 operators and dispatchers, emergency room staff (including doctors and nurses), child welfare workers, and even psychotherapists, these individuals experience direct or secondary trauma from the work environment. The work of caring for the emotional and physical needs of others takes its toll on those in the trenches. In these inimitable circumstances, the exposure can lead to direct traumas and/or vicarious trauma for the professional in a first responder role.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations between empirically supported PTSD symptom clusters (i.e. reexperiencing, avoidance, numbing, hyperarousal) and AS dimensions (i.e. psychological concerns, social concerns, somatic concerns). Participants were 138 active-duty police officers (70.7% female; mean age = 38.9 years; mean time policing = 173.8 months) who, as a part of a larger study, completed measures of trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, AS, and depressive symptoms. All participants reported experiencing at least one event that they perceived as traumatic, and 44 (31.9%) screened positive for PTSD. Officers with probable PTSD scored significantly higher on AS total as well as the somatic and psychological concerns dimensional scores than did those without PTSD. As well, a higher percentage of officers with probable PTSD scored positively on the AS-derived Brief Screen for Panic Disorder (Apfeldorf et al., 1994) compared with those without PTSD. A series of regression analyses revealed that depressive symptoms, number of reported traumas, and AS somatic concerns were significant predictors of PTSD total symptom severity as well as severity of reexperiencing. Avoidance was predicted by depressive symptoms and AS somatic concerns. Only depressive symptoms were significantly predictive of numbing and hyperarousal cluster scores. These findings contribute to understanding the nature of association between AS and PTSD symptom clusters. Implications for the treatment of individuals having PTSD with and without panic-related symptomatology are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Gordon J. G.

One such workplace is the transportation industry, where employees are often exposed to trauma. However, extant research shows that a considerable proportion of people with PTSDdo not seek specialty mental health treatment. Objective: In this qualitative study, we sought to better understand the experience of a traumatic event at work and the barriers and motivating factors for seeking mental health treatment. Participants: Twenty-nine Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) employees participated in a one-on-one interview, 18 soon after the traumatic event and 11 after entering a specialized treatment program. Methods: Semi-structured, one-on-one interviews were conducting using qualitative description and analyzed using content analysis. Results: Participants described emotional responses after the trauma such as guilt, anger, disbelief as particularly difficult, and explained that barriers to seeking help included the overwhelming amount and timing of paperwork related to the incident as well as negative interactions with management. Motivating factors included family and peer support, as well as financial and emotional issues which persuaded some to seek help. Conclusions: Seeking treatment is a multifactorial process.

1187,"Aim: This article presents a strategy to prevent trauma, support and care for railway personnel who experience critical incidents (CI) on the job, usually fatalities by accident or suicide. Method: We reviewed all publications on CI management, support and care practices in the railway industry, as well as practices in place in Canada (unpublished protocols). Semi structured interviews were conducted with 40 train engineers and conductors involved in CIs and the content was coded and analysed quantitatively. Results: Employees’ satisfaction with the help received after the incident varies according to the behaviour of the local manager, company officers and police, the level of compliance with existing company protocols to help them, the presence of unmet expectations for support and care, their perceived competency of clinicians they consulted and the level of trust toward their employers. Conclusion: On the basis of the interview results, the review of existing railway practices and discussions with railway stakeholders, a model protocol was developed for a comprehensive workplace prevention, support and care protocol to reduce the negative impact of railway critical incidents on employees. This protocol includes preventive actions before traumatic events occur, immediate responses at the site of incident, interventions within the first few days after the incident and longer term support and interventions provided by the company and by outsourced experts.

1188,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore what the attitudes of small firm owner-managers are to developing the skills of their key resources and then examine how these and other factors affect owner-managers’ preferences for training these employees. Design/methodology/approach: This study of training in small road transport firms in West Australia is cast in light of the literature on human resource management in small firms underpinned by insights drawn using the resource based view of the firm. Small firms (less than 20 people) dominate this industry, while the increasing freight task, and extreme distances between West Australian ports, towns and mines highlight this sectors’ importance. Survey results from 39 small road transport firms and interviews with nine owner-managers are analysed. Findings: Legislative, regulatory and licensing requirements were shown to be a key determinant of skills development. Employers ensured that basic standards for employee certification and qualification were met, as the penalty for not doing so would be too high. Regulations drove the need for certain types of training—licenses, fatigue management, occupational health and safety, handling dangerous goods, the Maritime Security Identification Card card, forklift license, mine site inductions—while owner-managers knew where to get the training their staff needed. Although regulation appeared most visible in prescribing what happened in relation to training for drivers, the relevance of owner-managers’ attitudes could not be ignored, nor could conditions in the firms external environment as this shaped how these requirements were met. Research limitations/implications: The RBV is useful in showing how skill development enabled similarity in skills across firms, while the attitudes owner-managers and economic and social conditions meant what happened in firms around skill development varied. The importance of small firm owner-managers’ attitudes are clearly highlighted and shown to influence organizational decisions and choices around training, but these were not independent of the regulatory framework and the economic and social conditions within which the firm operated. The small firms in this study did engage workers in formal training when necessary but it was put in the context of the idiosyncratic approach of the owner-manager and the day-to-day needs of the firm. 'Training' was essentially about ensuring certain types of skills were held by employees and then passing on knowledge to ensure the behavior of employees was consistent with the owner-manager’s vision for the firm in its current environment. Originality/value: Ways industry and government can encourage training activity that goes beyond the day-to-day firm needs are suggested.

1189,"Background: Introduced in July 2001, Australian Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) was the inaugural national policy initiative to provide community access to government-funded psychological services in primary care. Our aim was to examine the achievements of ATAPS in relation to its stated objectives using a set of indicators that largely drew on data from a minimum data set that we designed for the evaluation of ATAPS. Methods: We used de-identified professional-, consumer- and session-level data from the minimum dataset, and secondary analyses of our quantitative and qualitative data collected for a series of specific evaluation studies. Available data covered the period from 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2012. Results: Approximately 350,000 referrals were made to the ATAPS program over the 9.5 year analysis period, 79 % of which resulted in services. Over 1.4 million sessions were offered. Overall, 29 % of consumers were male, 4 % children, and 3 % Aboriginal people; 54 % of consumers had depression and 41 % an anxiety disorder; at least 60 % were on low incomes; and around 50 % resided outside of major cities. The most common interventions delivered were cognitive and behavioural therapies. Selected outcome measures indicated improvement in mental health symptoms. Conclusions: Access to Allied Psychological Services achieved its objectives within a decade of operation. The program delivered evidence-based services to a substantial number of consumers who were disadvantaged and historically would not have accessed services. Importantly, where data were available, there were indications that ATAPS achieved positive clinical outcomes for consumers. This suggests that ATAPS carved an important niche by successfully addressing unmet need of hard-to-reach consumers and through means that were not available via other programs.

1191,"Individuals working for the emergency services often bear witness to distressing events. This outcome study examines therapeutic interventions for Fire Service personnel (FSP) experiencing symptoms of trauma, depression, anxiety and low levels of self-compassion. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of using Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT) as an adjunct to Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT) in reducing symptoms of trauma, anxiety and depression and increasing self-compassion. A convenience sample (n = 17) of participants, referred for therapy following a traumatic incident, were allocated to receive 12 sessions of either TF-CBT or TF-CBT coupled with CFT. The study employed a repeated-measures design. Data were gathered pre- and post-therapy, using three questionnaires: (1) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; (2) Impact of Events Scale-R; (3) Self-Compassion Scale—Short Form. TF-CBT combined with CFT was more effective than TF-CBT alone on measures of self-compassion. Significant reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety, hyperarousal, intrusion and avoidance and a significant increase in self-compassion occurred in both groups post-therapy. The study provides some preliminary evidence to suggest that FSP may benefit from therapeutic interventions aimed at cultivating self-compassion. Further research is warranted using a larger sample size and adequately powered randomized controlled trial, to detect statistically significant differences and to negate the risk of confound due to low numbers resulting in significant differences between groups at baseline. Using CFT as an adjunct to TF-CBT may help FSP, who bear witness to the distress of others, cultivate compassion for their own suffering.

1192,"Background: Telephone-administered cognitive behavioural therapy (T-CBT) has attracted international recognition as a potential means of providing effective psychological treatment whilst simultaneously lowering costs, maximizing service efficiency and improving patient access to care. A lack of rigorous exploration of therapist perspectives means that little is known about professional readiness to adopt such delivery models, or the work that may be involved in ensuring successful implementation. Methods: This paper reports on a qualitative exploration of professional views of high intensity T-CBT. Semi-structured interviews with 18 UK accredited Cognitive Behavioural Therapists with nursing or allied health backgrounds were collected and analysed according to Normalisation Process Theory, a contemporary and empirically-derived theory of health technology implementation. Results: Despite increasing research effort seeking to determine the effectiveness of T-CBT, the clinical rationale for its use remains insecure. Professional perceptions of T-CBT as a high risk delivery strategy emerge as a key factor delaying T-CBT routinisation in practice. T-CBT champions draw on experiential knowledge to demonstrate that remote services can add value, a key factor being the recognition that telephone-mediated services can provide viable access for hard to reach populations. T-CBT uptake will be facilitated by i) the modification of existing protocols to address new methods of exchanging information and data, and (ii) greater clarification of the reach and span of telephone therapies, including the most appropriate division of labour across different service levels and settings. Conclusions: The integration and normalisation of high intensity T-CBT into mental health services demands greater recognition and redress of the existing socio-technical matrices within which nursing and allied health practitioners work. The future spread of higher intensity T-CBT is contingent upon the willingness of service managers to support staff in the delivery and governance of non-face-to-face therapy models. Clear delineation of the role and scope of T-CBT and the extent to which it will extend or replace existing provision is required.

1196,"This dissertation examines cardiovascular health (CVH) among Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers. CVH is defined by the American Heart Association (AHA) as the simultaneous presence of seven ideal factors; smoking status, body mass index, physical activity, healthy diet score, total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose. Cardiovascular diseases comprise the top causes of death in the United States, and because of this, the AHA has set forth a 2020 Impact Goal to improve the CVH of those in the United States by 20% while reducing mortality from cardiovascular events by 20%. The first aim of this dissertation was to compare overall CVH, and its individual components, between nationally-certified EMS professionals and the general population. Overall ideal CVH and ideal component CVH was found to be higher in EMS when compared to the general population. Specifically, EMS professionals were more likely to have ideal levels of physical activity, diet, cholesterol and fasting blood glucose. The second aim of this dissertation was to identify associations between work-life characteristics and CVH among EMS professionals. Some work-life characteristics were identified to be associated with ideal CVH. It was noted that as the number of EMS organizations at which the provider performed EMS work increased, overall CVH ii decreased. Those providers working in aeromedical services and those who reported conducting patient care had higher prevalence of ideal CVH when compared to other types of agency types and services. Lastly, those providers who were more highly satisfied with their main EMS job had a higher prevalence of ideal CVH when compared to those that were dissatisfied. The third aim of this dissertation was to identify associations between CVH and absenteeism among EMS professionals. A higher prevalence of workplace absenteeism was observed among first responders when compared to estimates from the general working population. Females self-reported a higher number of missed workdays when compared to males and as age increased, an increase in number of missed workdays and a decrease in ideal CVH was observed. Those individuals who were married reported fewer missed workdays and higher ideal CVH then those of other types of marital status. With respect to work-life characteristics, those EMS professionals practicing in an advanced life support setting (Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians and paramedics) reported greater average missed workdays than those working in a basic life support setting (Emergency Medical Responders and Emergency Medical Technicians). Lastly, as typical weekly call volume increased to did the reported absenteeism. Specific characteristics that were found to be associated with both absenteeism and CVH included sex, age, marital status, certification level and typical weekly call volume. This dissertation highlights the necessity for several areas of future research in both cardiovascular disease and occupational epidemiology. First, a longitudinal assessment of CVH and research into tailored public health interventions to increase the proportion of EMS providers with all seven ideal CVH components is needed. Second, an understanding of the causal relationship between CVH and health outcomes and job performance among EMS professionals is warranted. Since stressful work conditions are thought to exacerbate cardiovascular disease risk, additional workplace interventions to mitigate the negative consequences of providing prehospital emergency care may be needed. Lastly, a detailed assessment of the causal mechanisms linking CVH with workplace absenteeism is required to expand the understanding of the relationship between the EMS profession and overall health.

Four hundred twenty-six participants completed the Knowledge Validation Inventory–Revised. The self-reported needs for training are reported across the 10 knowledge domains of rehabilitation counseling. The overall training needs (TN) score for the sample was moderate. For the broader knowledge domains, respondents reported the highest mean TN scores for Case Management and Utilization of Community Resources, Disability Management, Vocational Consultation, and Services for Employers. A secondary purpose was to compare the self-perceived training needs of rehabilitation counselors who are certified rehabilitation counselors (CRCs) with those of counselors who do not possess a CRC. Higher reported training needs were indicated for individuals without CRCs. A third purpose was to examine the relationship between counselor demographic variables and training needs. Gender and years of experiences were significant predictors of perceived training needs.

Healing Hands for Haiti International Foundation has established a rehabilitation aide programme as a means of providing rehabilitation services. This article illustrates some of the successes, challenges, and dilemmas that arise in the provision of such an education. Methods: Graduates and students answered a 23-item questionnaire designed to investigate respondents' perceptions of the training programme. These responses were then coded and quantified for analysis. Results: The author interviewed 32 of 49 graduates and current students. Forty-five percent of graduates were working as rehabilitation aides, and the majority of those were working in urban areas. Graduate's earnings differed greatly. Respondents suggested that the programme needed to help the graduates find employment after graduation and to provide continuing training. The most common limitation in education mentioned by the graduates was a need for basic nursing skills and first-aid education. Conclusion: The most common difficulties and dilemmas in providing a rehabilitation aide programme were: lack of resources including job opportunities for graduates, and lack of proper support available from supervising healthcare providers. Curricula for similar programs must be culturally sensitive, help create employment opportunities, and provide continuing educational opportunities for their graduates.

1199,"The 'Blind to Therapist Protocol' (B2T) is, essentially, that. It allows a client to go through the Standard Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) Protocol without revealing the content of the problem. This protocol is often used in conjunction with any client group in which divulging information might be uncomfortable to the individual prior to the use of EMDR. In 1993, the protocol was developed after encountering problems with a client's ability to disclose imagery content. The protocol took well over 10 years to perfect and was first published in 2009. It has been used to treat a wide variety of clients in many types of situations. The workers—including train engineers, airplane pilots, ship captains, police officers, prison guards, doctors, nurses, paramedics, and firemen—are characterized by the need to make life-and-death decisions in a variety of situations for which they are personally responsible. In other words, those who have memories associated with not being in control at precisely the time when they are responsible for being in control. The most frequent use of the B2T Protocol is among clients who have difficulties with divulging information concerning their own child abuse in which they fear overwhelming or disgusting the therapist with the nature of the material to be treated. In such instances, the protocol is very successful and can be a useful addition to the therapist's repertoire. It helps build the therapeutic relationship by demonstrating to clients that the therapist has trust in them. Once the client has seen how the therapist copes with material being raised, the Standard EMDR Protocol is used. The B2T Protocol has been successfully used also in the following situations: 1) Management of the potential vicarious traumatization of the therapist in which the therapist has been through a similarly traumatic experience to the client's; 2) Culturally-related and translator-facilitated EMDR situations where expressing strong emotions in front of fellow countrymen and women may be inappropriate; 3) Culturally-related and translator-facilitated EMDR situations where there are fears that divulging detailed information may result in information being 'leaked' by the translator and potentially put the client's family at risk back in their home country; 4) Clients with aphasia; the B2T Protocol has been successfully used to treat clients ranging from those with a significant stammer to clients with pronounced aphasia and limited ability to express themselves.

1201,"The presentation of mental illness at work has different implications and consequences depending on the specific nature of the job, work context, regulatory framework and risks for the employee, organization and society. Naturally there are certain occupational groups where human factors and/or mental illness could impair safety and mental acuity, and with potentially devastating consequences. For pilots, the medical criteria for crew licensing are stipulated by regulatory aviation authorities worldwide, and these include specific mental illness exclusions. The challenge of assessment for mental health problems is, however, complex and the responsibility for psychological screening and testing falls to a range of different specialists and groups including AMEs (authorized aviation medical examiners), GPs and physicians, airline human resources departments, psychologists, human factor specialists and pilots themselves. Extending and developing the ideas of Aviation Mental Health (2006), which described a range of psychological issues and problems that may affect pilots and the consequences of these, this book presents an authoritative, comprehensive and practical guide to modern, evidence-based practice in the field of mental health assessment, treatment and care. It features contributions from experts in the field drawn from several countries, professions and representing a range of aviation-related organisations, displaying a range of different skills and methods that can be used for the clinical assessment of pilots and in relation to specific mental health problems and syndromes.

1202,"Introduction: Changing health behaviors and health-related environments is important in reducing chronic disease. Minority workplaces are potential venues to provide regular, effective health promotion opportunities to underserved individuals. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of changing workplace policy, programs, and practices in minority-owned workplaces. Methods: Four minority Native American-owned businesses were recruited to participate in this study. The intervention was a set of recommended standards and guidelines gleaned from the US Preventive Task Force and The Community Guide relevant to workplaces. Each workplace selected between 4 and 6 target areas to improve over the year-long intervention period. The evaluation tool was a semistructured survey conducted at baseline and at 1-year followup, with workplace staff responsible for benefits and services to employees. Feasibility was evaluated by assessing the likelihood that the workplaces implemented health promotion activities in the year-long intervention. Results: Several practices and policies changed significantly during the intervention in the four workplaces, including coverage for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), elimination of out-of-pocket costs for screening and tobacco cessation, accountability systems for providers, posted stair use, cessation line availability that included NRT, offering weight loss programs, offering physical activity programs, and conducting targeted communication programs about health promotion. Other practices and polices changed in the expected direction but were not significant. Conclusion: Changing workplace programs, practices, and policies is feasible in minority workplaces, with support and tools provided by outside organizations. These findings could drive a full-scale test of the intervention in minority businesses in order to improve the health of disadvantaged workers.

1203,"This paper explores the role of feelings experienced by professionals in community forensic practice. A modified grounded theory approach was used to conduct an analysis of transcripts made from five individual semi-structured interviews with multi-disciplinary professionals working in community mental health teams. The participants were asked to reflect on their feelings when working with forensic patients in the community and the extent to which they believed these feelings could influence professional practice. The following codes were established: emotional responses; binary thinking; deconstructing labels; bureaucratic defence procedures; practice dilemmas; the professional is personal; applying the therapeutic model to the practitioner; trauma; fantasy and imagination. As well as illustrating the significant impact that feelings have upon forensic practitioners, this paper also makes some suggestions to improve future practice. These include the use of psychoanalytic theory and ‘mindfulness’ strategies to enhance the awareness of mental health professionals regarding the influence of feelings upon practice.

1204,"Depression in the workplace is becoming more common. It is responsible for the upsurge in long-term sick leave. Its prevention requires the improvement of working conditions and the management of burnout. Health workers, faced with suffering, illness, death are subject to significant mental workload. Some authors believe that the mental workload is multiplied by 2–7 among hospital staff. Physical and nervous overload is expressed by psychosomatic and neuropsychiatric manifestations. We conducted a work aimed to study the interactions between depression and professional activity among health care workers in the Governorate of Sousse, Tunisia during five years from 1 January 2009 until 31 December 2013. Data was collected from medical and administrative records accessed at the Regional Commission of long-term sick leave in Sousse. Concerned patients were invited to answer additional questions during consultation. We have attempted to identify the socio-professional characteristics of absentees, and to determine the possible role of working conditions in the decompensation of depression in order to establish preventive measures. Our work is a retrospective descriptive study which surveyed 204 health workers who have obtained a long-term sick leave for depressive syndrome during the study period. The prevalence of absenteeism was estimated to 4.45%. Some employees have submitted more than one sick leave, which raises the number of sick leaves to 768 during the study period. The study population is relatively young, with about 50.9% of absentees aged between 50 and 59 years. A female predominance was noted (77.9% of absentees). Our population was composed mainly of married employees (79.9%) which had, in 88.7% of cases, at least one dependent child. Older paramedics were more affected than any other occupational group. The most affected services were, in descending order, medical, gynecological and obstetric services, administrative services, emergency services, outpatient and finally pediatric services. Most common medical affections were hypertension, diabetes, cancer and rheumatic diseases. Personal history of psychiatric diseases was mentioned by 38% of cases. As pointed by many authors, healthcare workers commonly relate the genesis of their psychiatric disorder to socio-professional conditions. Physical load was declared by 46.1% of cases and metal overload was described by 27.9% of questioned workers. Other common stressing situation was the permanent contact with patients and/or their family. Conflictual relationship with colleagues and/or superiors was declared by 17.6% of cases. It appears from our study that 10.8% of absent for depressive syndrome feel insecure in their work. This feeling seems to be more pronounced in recent years after the revolution in Tunisia (2011). Indeed, the rate of violence against care workers has tripled after the revolution. The most important consequence of this disease is long-term absenteeism which has an expensive cost expressed by economic and social outcomes. In our survey, we found that the absenteeism was 21.57% with 80,327 lost working days which is pretty near to 44 years lost per year of work during the of study period. The analysis of our results showed that the absenteeism indicators are very high and it is urgent to have a real plan of action. This plan primarily affects prevention. The management of depression in the workplace requires a multidisciplinary intervention and better coordination between occupational physician and psychiatrist or psychologist.

We aimed to investigate how health professionals define or understand wellness and its practice in the context of childhood disability. Method: A qualitative, interpretive approach was taken. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 health professionals (allied health therapists and managers) providing early intervention and ongoing therapy within four Australian childhood health and disability services. Years of experience providing services to children with disabilities and their families ranged from 6 months to 30 years (M = 9.41, SD = 9.04).

We examined the period 1990–2006 to inform our understanding of how the current prescription opioid overdose epidemic emerged in urban areas. Methods: We used data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to examine changes in demographic and spatial patterns in overdose fatalities induced by prescription opioids (i.e., analgesics and methadone) in New York City (NYC) in 1990–2006, and what factors were associated with death from prescription opioids vs. heroin, historically the most prevalent form of opioid overdose in urban areas. Results: Analgesic-induced overdose fatalities were the only types of overdose fatalities to increase in 1990–2006 in NYC; the fatality rate increased sevenfold from 0.39 in 1990 to 2.7 per 100,000 persons in 2006.

Analgesic overdose decedents were less likely to be Black or Hispanic, while methadone overdose decedents were more likely to be Black or Hispanic in contrast to heroin overdose decedents. Conclusions: The distinct epidemiologic profiles exhibited by analgesic and methadone overdose fatalities highlight the need to define drug-specific public health prevention efforts.

1212,"Background: In Hong Kong, the Employees' Compensation Ordinance (ECO), based on the model of the English Workmen's Compensation Act 1943, establishes a no-fault, non-contributory system for work injuries. It focuses merely on the minimum social expectation in compensating injured workers in monetary terms, but does not place much emphasis on prevention, rehabilitation and return to work polices for workers with injury. There is a need to reform an effective and comprehensive occupational rehabilitation system for workers with work injury in Hong Kong. Methods: This paper presents a case study of a worker with work injury undergoing occupational rehabilitation through services provided in the local community setting by the Hong Kong Workers' Health Centre. Results: The case study highlights some crucial factors and/or intervention modalities in facilitating workers' return to work, including timely intervention, work-site based rehabilitation, communication among different stakeholders, dynamics of company, rehabilitation counselling, community integration and individualized work resettlement. Conclusion: Without reviewing and revamping the current ECO, the goal to provide timely and effective occupational rehabilitation services for workers with injury could not be fully achieved.

This study provides an initial assessment of the mental health attitudes and behaviors of these soldiers. To date, there is no known research assessing Combat Medic behavioral health or their help seeking behavior following deployment. Medics who were 12 months post-deployment from a yearlong deployment to combat were compared with a baseline group of Medics who had never been deployed to war. Participants completed a survey containing measures of mental health service utilization, perceived stigma and barriers to care, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Medics screening positive for a mental health issue were more likely to report concerns about stigma and barriers to care compared to those who screened negative. Medics who had deployed to the combat were more likely to screen positive for major depression, and have sought care for mental health issues compared to the baseline group. There were no differences in PTSD screenings between the deployed group and the baseline group. Findings indicate that depression may be a salient issue for previously deployed Combat Medics.

1215,"Although occupational therapists have been practicing in forensic settings for many years, there is a paucity of literature regarding the nature of this practice in Canada. The purpose of this study was to describe the practices of Canadian occupational therapists in forensic mental health. An online survey was designed based on the Canadian Practice Process Framework. Following purposive and snowball sampling, responses were analysed with descriptive statistics and content analysis. Twenty‐seven clinicians responded (56% response rate). Respondents indicated commonalities in workplaces, client caseloads and practice challenges. The outstanding need in Canada to demonstrate client outcomes through the use of evaluation instruments reflects those practice gaps identified internationally. Education, advocacy and research are critical areas for the development of Canadian forensic occupational therapy. Although findings heavily reflect one provincial context and may not be generalizable to nonhospital settings, a number of priority areas were identified. Future efforts should clarify the role of forensic occupational therapy to stakeholders, and validate their contributions through research that evaluates intervention efficacy and meaningful outcomes.

1216,"Introduction: Every year many workers are excluded from work because of a work disability attributable to a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD). Factors associated with the development and persistence of the work disability can be related to the worker, work environment, compensation policies, healthcare system and insurance system. Workers' understanding/representations of their disability are associated with coping behaviors aimed at helping them adapt to or solve their health problem. A representation is a complex, organized entity incorporating thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes regarding a particular subject. Representations have been studied in anthropology, sociology and psychology since the 1960s, but often in a compartmentalized way. These representations provide an important key to understanding what motivates workers during rehabilitation and the return-to-work process. To build upon disciplinary knowledge and better understand workers' efforts to cope with their persistent disability, this article therefore aims to pool the different knowledge available on the illness representation concept, from the fields of anthropology, sociology and psychology in order to gain a better understanding of its application in the MSD context. Methods: An electronic literature search (French, English) from 1960 on was conducted in medical, paramedical and social science databases (MedLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, etc.) using predetermined key words. After screening abstracts based on a set of criteria, content analysis was performed on the 131 articles retained. Results: The theoretical models and approaches can be divided into three categories: (1) personal experience; (2) interactionist; and (3) sociocultural. The models found in sociology and anthropology are mainly descriptive and developed in a medical context, and only rarely in an occupational health context. However, these models could add elements to psychosocial models that are more dynamic and oriented toward understanding the reasons behind specific behaviors. Conclusion: Bridging the gap between these disciplines will help us achieve a new level of knowledge that will, by taking social interactions into account, enhance understanding of workers' representations, and the behaviors they adopt to manage their MSD-related disability.

1217,"Based on a review of the studies from interpretive and medical sociology, the communication process occurring in one occupational therapy treatment session is examined to illustrate how the occupational therapist balanced intersubjectivity with control. The concepts of knowledge schemata (the expectations and beliefs people bring to a situation) and footings (the shifts in alignment, or focus, that occur during interaction) are central to the analysis of the videotaped session showing work with a 38-yr-old fireman who became a quadriplegic. The process of achieving a balance between professional power and an understanding of the patient's experience may be fostered in education and in clinical supervision through increased emphasis on the importance of understanding the values and beliefs of patients and on the development and refinement of interactive skills.

1218,"Purpose: Patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) do not always receive appropriate allied health care. This is partially because of the large heterogeneity among these conditions, some of which are quite rare. Individual allied health care professionals, therefore, have relatively little opportunity to develop relevant experience with these patients. To overcome this problem, we developed specialist multidisciplinary advice regarding management of patients with NMD for occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT) and speech therapy (ST) in a primary care or rehabilitation setting. The aims of the study were to explore to what extent this allied health care advice was implemented with a focus on the amount of therapy received and to explore possible barriers to implementation. Methods: One-hundred two patients visited the Neuromuscular Centre Nijmegen for OT, PT and ST consultations. Integrated allied health care advice was written on the basis of these consultations and a multidisciplinary meeting. All patients, their therapists and rehabilitation physicians received this advice. Following the advice, questionnaires were sent out at baseline and at 6 months follow up, collecting data on implementation of the amount of therapy suggested and on possible barriers for adherence. Results: Advice for ST and OT was fully implemented in primary care, but only partially (58%) in a rehabilitation setting. Advice to reduce the amount of PT was implemented in only 15% of the cases. Possible barriers were related to the advice itself (feasibility of treatment duration, correctness and completeness), the patient (motivation) and the professional (experience in treatment of NMDs). Therapists expressed a desire to have the opportunity to discuss the treatment advice with the multidisciplinary team. Conclusions: The extent to which multidisciplinary advice was implemented differed for OT and ST compared to PT and for the setting (primary care or rehabilitation). Possible barriers were identified at different levels. We recommend follow-up telephone calls to provide therapists opportunity for discussion.

Aim: To describe practice patterns of OT services in Australian EDs. Method: Of 129 Australian public hospital EDs, 41 were identified to have offered OT services in the past 5 years (32%). Using snowball sampling an investigator designed survey was sent to 51 occupational therapists who were identified to have worked in these EDs in the past 5 years. Findings: 30 subjects (58% response rate) from 21 sites participated. Mean age 30.4, 29 females, one male and an average of 9-year clinical experience. OT service was usually provided within multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary teams by full-time employed staff and patients were overwhelmingly Australian Triage Scale level 4 or 5 and were over 65 years. Few standardized assessment or outcome measures were used. The OT role was consistently focused on functional assessment and provision of interventions such as equipment prescription, patient education and referral to community and support services to ensure safe discharge or inform inpatient admission decisions.

The researchers investigated cost containment influences on occupational therapists specializing in hand therapy to determine how therapists provide holistic care within cost containment constraints. Five hand therapists were chosen based on selection criteria of hand therapy and holistic care practice. Using a grounded theory approach, the researchers gathered data via interviews and clinical observations. Data were analyzed through open, axial, and selective coding, and critiqued by an expert panel for emerging theory and concepts. Occupational therapists developed new skills or refined existing skill through adapting, educating, and strategizing in response to environmental demands. Tenets of the occupational adaptation model matched the strategies used by the participants. Occupational therapists specializing in hand therapy adapted to cost containment constraints by modifying professional settings and skills, educating multiple consumers, and implementing innovative interventions.

1222,"The first objective of this work is to study post-traumatic stress disorders possibly presented by victims of the Concordia shipwreck that occurs on January 13, 2012, in Italy. The second objective is to relate the evolution of symptoms with various characteristics of the individual, the context and the support the victims received. Patients: In the boat, 462 French men and women were on this cruise. After the disaster, 211 French survivors founded an association of victims, and 198 of them agree to participate in our study (M = 49.6 years, SD = 14.7, range = 19–85), mostly female (56%). Materials and methods: With the collaboration of the association and its lawyer, for each survivor who agreed to participate in the study, we had access to the complaint files, certificates of psychologists, medical certificates, and a 'diary newspaper' written by the victims. We administered the PTSD Checklist Scale (PCLS) two times, first six months after the shipwreck and secondly one year after the whipwreck. According to the authors of the French version (Yao et al., 2003), this scale measures the three sub-syndromes of PTSD described in the DSM IV (reexperience, avoidance, increased arousal). The scale assesses the intensity of 17 PTSD symptoms, rated by the subject on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = not at all, 2 = somewhat, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = very often), thereby determining a score. This scale was sent by email to each of the victims with instructions. Finally, for each of the 198 survivors, we collected the following data: age, gender, events that motivated people to go cruising, period before discharge, estimated subjective severity scale (1 to 10), injury, days of Temporary Interruption of Work (ITT), psychotropic drugs absorption, meeting with a medical and psychological emergency unit just after the shipwreck, consulting psychologist or physician when survivors came back home. Results: The number of survivors with PTSD is higher than in other studies, both six months (79.3%) and one year after the shipwreck (61.6%). Two elements seem likely to explain why. First, the sample is very homogeneous, all survivors were directly exposed to the same traumatic event. The second is related to a prolonged and intense stress period during the ship sinking, and then a long period of evacuation and wandering on the island before rescues had been organized. We also found that physical injuries are related to PTSD intensity and its duration. As in other studies that measured symptoms of PTSD after a traumatic event, six months after the shipwreck, women have a higher average score than men. This difference disappears on the second assessment, one year after the event. Psychotraumatic symptoms experienced by women progressing well faster than men's. Survivors who benefited from the intervention of a medical end psychological emergency unit just after the shipwreck have higher scores on the PCLS and we also found that they look more often to health care facilities after the event. Monitoring by Primary Care Physicians indicate that most of them have not diagnosed PTSD and prescribed psychotropic drugs to 40.9% of the survivors without significantly positive effect on the improvement of symptoms. Conclusions: The results mainly highlight the links between gender and severity of post-traumatic symptoms, presence of physical injury and the intensity and duration of the disorder and, at last, influence of the support for survivors.

Three focus groups were conducted with clinicians across three purposively selected rehabilitation centers. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: Fourteen allied health-care professionals (six occupational therapists, six physical therapists, and two social workers) with previous dance experience participated in this study. Four main themes emerged from the analysis representing the personal and organizational factors influencing on the implementation of dance interventions: (1) Clinician's dance experience and training, (2) Interest and personal beliefs towards using dance as a potential intervention, (3) Support from the organization of the institution, and (4) Available resources. Although each site was different, the main factors acting as barriers and facilitators were similar for all three sites.

1226,"The working environment is an important determinant of employee well-being. Previous UK studies report registered nurses' perception of the working environment using the Work Environment Scale (WES), but surprisingly few include data for nurses working in mental health or learning disability settings. One hundred and sixty-one (58.8%) registered nurses working day shifts in five specialist divisions (forensic adult mental health, adolescent mental health, elderly continuing care, adult and adolescent learning disability and brain injury rehabilitation) of a large charitable hospital comprising mostly secure (i.e. 'locked') wards completed the WES. Nurses working in separate clinical divisions differed only on the 'physical comfort' subscale. These results are discussed in the context of previous UK research: this sample of nurses scored differently on a number of subscales, with the working environment characterized by relatively high levels of support, cohesion and managerial control and slightly lower levels of autonomy. It is unclear whether the differences reflect the organizational (i.e. non-NHS) context, or a secure environment effect.

1227,"This study explored how the evidenced-based practise (EBP) is perceived by Dutch occupational therapists (OTs), what sources of research data are used to make clinical decisions, and what barriers are identified in implementing EBP. A self-administered, pre-tested, questionnaire was distributed through an email survey and postal mail among the 200 randomly stratified selected OTs out of a total population of 2,019 Dutch OTs. Analyses of data comprised descriptive statistics of all variables and test statistics to evaluate the differences between demographical groups. Dutch OTs have a very positive attitude toward the EBP. Barriers experienced are mostly related to a lack of skills needed to implement the EBP and to the characteristics of the work environment. The attitude, experiences and barriers are mainly similar to research findings in other countries or professions. A unique barrier to the implementation of the EBP found in this study was that Dutch OTs perceived evidence written in a foreign (non-Dutch) language as a barrier to using evidence in non-Dutch languages. The results of the study, derived from a partly representative group of working OTs, implicate universal problems regarding the effective implementation of the EBP. Solutions to increase the implementation of the EBP from an international point of view are called for and need to be evaluated.

This paper questions how global citizenship, the acquisition of awareness and skills to sensitively navigate through a rapidly globalized social world, is cultivated amidst international partnerships focused on short‐term immersion opportunities. Using an ethnographic methodology to examine the experiences of occupational therapy students abroad, this paper addresses the potential for competing agendas when the motivation to participate within these partnerships is driven in part by a desire to 'do good.' The empirical lens was directed towards the students' verbal, written and enacted narratives rather than the sociocultural realm of the sending institution, the host organization or the occupational realities of the local communities, therefore is limited in discursive scope. Nevertheless, the need is great for further critical appraisal of objectives and expectations by all parties to foster a partnership culture of reciprocity and equality and to diminish the neocolonial legacy of Western expertise dissemination. By examining how the stated and implied desire to do good exists alongside the risk to do harm to individuals and international networks, the conclusions can be extended locally to highlight the challenges to 'partnering up' between clinicians and patients.

This case study illustrates such an intervention in a complex situation involving asocial service agency and its client. Following a curtailment of services and an arrest, the client developed an escalating homicidal anger toward the agency administrator. Once a Tarasoff warning was received, the agency contacted a security company who organized a threat assessment and management plan involving interdisciplinary collaboration. Information developed in the course of the assessment was presented to prosecutors, who facilitated the client’s arrest and involuntary psychiatric commitment until he was judged to be no longer dangerous. This case ultimately involved an integration of the services of security, law enforcement, mental health professionals, prosecutors, the courts and the state mental health system in leading to a successful diversion of the client from a path of intended violence.

Although accounts of adverse events associated with police fatigue are not scarce, literature on the association between chronic fatigue and on-duty injury are limited. Methods: Participants were officers from the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress (BCOPS) Study. A 10-item questionnaire was administered to assess how tired or energetic the officers generally felt irrespective of sleep hours or workload. The questionnaire consisted of five positively-worded and five negatively phrased items that measured feelings of vigor/energy and tiredness, respectively. Total as well as separate scores for positive and negative items were computed by summing scores of individual items. Payroll records documenting each officer's work history were used to assess occurrence of injury. Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) of injury. Results: Nearly 40% of officers reported feeling drained. Overall prevalence of on-duty injury during the past year was 23.9%. Injury prevalence showed a significant increasing trend across tertiles of total fatigue score: 19.6, 21.7, and 30.8% for lowest, middle and highest tertiles, respectively (trend p-value = 0.037). After controlling for potential confounders, a 5-unit increase in total fatigue score was associated with a 12% increase in prevalence of injury which was marginally significant (p = 0.075). A 5-unit increase in fatigue score of the positively worded items was associated with a 33% increase in prevalence of injury (PR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04–1.70, p = 0.022). Conclusion: Officers who do not feel active, full of vigor, alert, or lively had a significantly higher prevalence of non-fatal work place injury compared to their counter parts. Practical applications: With additional prospective evidence, workplace interventions designed to enhance level of energy may reduce feelings of tiredness and hence may prevent workplace injury.

1232,"The efficacy of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy has been well established by numerous scientific studies over the past 25 years. The ability to achieve a rapid resolution of trauma symptoms often after only a few EMDR sessions allows clinicians to treat many survivors in a very short period of time. This makes EMDR an ideal intervention after a catastrophic event. The main objective of this article is to describe how European EMDR Associations have provided interventions in emergency situations. Natural and man-made disaster relief projects in Italy, Greenland, and the Netherlands are highlighted. EMDR Europe Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP) projects sponsored by Austria and Sweden in the Ukraine and Estonia have provided trainings for clinicians. National EMDR Europe associations have developed initiatives in many other areas of the world, such as in Vietnam (EMDR Italy), Cuba (EMDR Spain and Italy), in Pakistan (EMDR United Kingdom and Ireland), in China (EMDR Germany), and in Kenya (EMDR Germany). These projects illustrate the resilience of the populations affected and the generosity of the EMDR Europe community.

1233,"The aim of this study was to examine how adherence knowledge, skills and beliefs influence allied health clinicians’ efforts to enhance primary care patient adherence to antidepressant medication. The authors also sought to establish whether clinicians’ knowledge, beliefs and skills would improve following completion of a Medication Alliance training program. In the first part of the study 72 primary care allied health clinicians, most of whom were psychologists (75%), followed by social workers (17%) and occupational therapists (8%) were recruited. In the second part of the study, 24 clinicians participated in the adherence skills training program, ‘Medication Alliance’. In the first study, clinician general beliefs about medicines were assessed using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), while their specific beliefs with respect to the effectiveness of antidepressant medication in the treatment of depressive disorders was assessed with three questions developed for the study. In the second study, clinician knowledge was assessed using The Medication Alliance Clinical Knowledge Questionnaire, a 15-item multiple-choice questionnaire. A series of between-group t-tests were used to determine if previous training had any impact on BMQ, Adequacy, Effectiveness, Role and Strategy Use scales. The results revealed there were significant differences between those who received prior training and those who had not on all five measures with those receiving training using more strategies to enhance adherence and having more positive attitudes about medications and adherence efforts.

To this aim a group of Italian ambulances workers of Turin has been examined. 30 stretcher bearers, 30 nurses, and 30 physician have been analyzed using two instruments: a questionnaire on the motivations and the emotions and the Eysenck Personality Inventory. From the results it emerged that the workers are motivated to help other people and they feel positive emotions like interest and serenity. The positive mood during the work seems to depend on their general motivation and their extroversion. At the contrary it emerged a progressive desensitization to the negative emotions; moreover it seems that neurotic workers experience more positive emotions than negative ones.

1239,"Background: Antipsychotic drugs have been linked to sudden death among psychiatric patients, with a suggestion that prolongation of the QT-interval detectable on a standard electrocardiogram may be linked to fatal cardiac arrhythmias in these circumstances. Patients in secure forensic psychiatric facilities may be particularly likely to be on high-dose antipsychotic medication, and yet, as far as the authors are aware, no study of QT-intervals among such patients has been reported. Aim: To investigate the prevalence of QT-interval abnormalities and associated known risk factors for fatal cardiac arrhythmias in a sample of forensic patients. Method: Participants had a 12-lead electrocardiogram taken at 50 mm/s. Information was collected on their age, gender, psychiatric diagnosis, history of cardiovascular, liver and kidney diseases, and smoking, on all medications and on history of seclusion over the previous 12 months. Analysis was carried out using binary logistic regression. Results: Lower rates of QT-interval abnormalities than might be expected for this population were found. It was also found that a high dose of antipsychotics was associated with QTc prolongation (Adjusted OR = 9.5, 95% CI 2.6-34.2), a result consistent with previous literature. Conclusion: Forensic patients need not be at increased risk of QTc abnormality provided risk factors are properly managed. A high dose of antipsychotic medication increases the risk of QTc prolongation.

Objective: To describe the cardiovascular adaptations observed among firefighter recruits during firefighter training academies using measures of estimated maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and heart rate recovery (ΔHR). Methods: Firefighter recruits (n = 41) enrolled in a 16-week firefighter training academy completed a 5-minute step test during the first, eighth, and sixteenth week of training. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA) calculations were conducted to determine changes in estimated VO2max and ΔHR. Results: Results of the RM ANOVA calculations revealed that mean estimated VO2max and mean ΔHR differed significantly between time points: F(2, 80) = 75.525, p < 0.001, and F(2, 80) = 4.368, p = 0.016, respectively. No significant changes were observed in mean estimated VO2max and mean ΔHR beyond the eighth week of training. No significant relationship was identified between estimated VO2max and ΔHR.

Method: A qualitative study was conducted in the Sydney metropolitan area through individual semistructured interviews with eight GPs, which were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results: Themes included (i) difficulties and opportunities associated with multidisciplinary care; (ii) potential for CDM items to be used to support falls prevention strategies; and (iii) the user-friendliness of the CDM items. Conclusion: Effective coordination of multidisciplinary care between GPs and allied health professionals was desired but difficult to achieve through the CDM system, making translation of falls prevention evidence into clinical practice challenging. Further education on falls prevention and CDM item modification is needed to bridge this gap.

1245,"Today trauma stabs at the heart of America, intruding into practitioners' sessions and their homes. In mass disasters, besides primary trauma symptoms of immediate victims, secondary symptoms reverberate into first responders, family and friends, clinicians providing longer term aftercare, surrounding communities, and those experiencing distal 'trauma by television.' A practitioner's hometown disaster echoes with dual risks: (a) primary victimization from living at the disaster epicenter and (b) secondary trauma through helping other victims. This dual shock for clinicians arrives at the moment when professional demands escalate. Any practitioner in a hometown disaster needs to balance community needs with personal needs for recovery, integration, and resiliency. As a remedy for either others' or a clinician's own trauma, creative treatment methods enhance standard cognitive behavioral treatments for trauma. The field of trauma psychology needs a creativity evidence base comparable with the strong evidence for cognitive behavioral approaches. My own story in the aftermath of a mass human-made disaster depicts a creativity-laced odyssey of transformation from primary and secondary trauma, through training-based experiences from cognitive behavioral and creative treatments, to serenity.

Objective: To examine attitudes of athletic trainers (ATs) and physical therapists (PTs) on the effectiveness of mental imagery, goal setting, and positive self-talk to improve rehabilitation adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. Design: The ATs and PTs were contacted via electronic or physical mailings to complete a single administration survey that measured their beliefs about the effectiveness of psychological skills for increasing adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes undergoing rehabilitation. Setting: Professional member databases of the National Athletic Trainers' Association and the American Physical Therapy Association. Patients or Other Participants: Of the 1000 ATs and 1000 PTs who were selected randomly, 309 ATs (age = 34.18 ± 8.32 years, years in profession = 10.67 ± 7.34) and 356 PTs (age = 38.58 ± 7.51 years, years in profession = 13.18 ± 6.17) responded. Main Outcome Measure(s): The Attitudes About Imagery (AAI) survey measures attitudes about psychological skills for enhancing adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. The AAI includes demographic questions and 15 items on a 7-point Likert scale measuring attitudes about the effectiveness of mental imagery, self-talk, goal setting, and pain control on rehabilitation adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. Test-retest reliability ranged from .60 to .84 and Cronbach αs ranged from .65 to .90. We calculated 1-way analyses of variance to determine whether differences existed in attitudes as a result of the professionals' education, training experience, and interest. Results: Mean differences were found on attitudes about effectiveness of psychological skills for those who reported formal training and those who reported interest in receiving formal training (P < .05). In addition, ATs held more positive attitudes than PTs on 9 of 15 AAI items (P < .05). Conclusions: Overall, ATs and PTs held positive attitudes on the effectiveness of psychological skills to augment the rehabilitation process.

The purpose of this study was to uncover how occupational therapy educators and scholars perceive and experience (1) developing and sustaining global partnerships and (2) lessons learned. In this qualitative study, 30 occupational therapy educators and researchers completed an online survey. Eight participated in an interview. Results found major themes that help develop and sustain partnerships: building relationship of trust and respect, communicating effectively, cultivating cultural competence, sharing power and resources with collaborators and creating a context for reciprocal learning. Lessons learned include a call to walking humbly, building relationships of trust and respect, establishing open and honest communication, supporting local solutions to local problems, ensuring equality of resources and learning from their global partners. The findings suggest that global partnerships have the potential to transform both partners if the partners engage with mutual understanding and respect.

1249,"Presents the case report of a 19-year-old man with mutism in noncatatonic schizophrenia, which was refractory to various antipsychotic drugs including clozapine, but responded dramatically to the addition of a low dose of fluvoxamine. Considering his longitudinal course, however, his onset of schizophrenia was speculated to go back to the age of 10 years. We only knew about the medication of the previous hospital where he was refractory to 12 mg/d of paliperidone for 4 months, 30 mg/d of aripiprazole for 13 months, and 48 mg/d of perfenazine combined with aripiprazole for 16 months. Therefore, we diagnosed him as suffering from treatment resistance schizophrenia. This patient had mutism lasting 16 months in noncatatonic schizophrenia. Fluvoxamine is a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor and may increase clozapine levels and C/N ratio. If mutism in noncatatonic schizophrenia is one of the negative symptoms, it seems likely that fluvoxamine addition may improve mutism via the effects on negative symptoms. Although it is unknown that these effects of fluvoxamine addition on mutism and/or negative symptoms were due to an increased clozapine level, fluvoxamine alone, or a synergistic effect between fluvoxamine and clozapine, the present case suggests that a small dose of fluvoxamine addition to clozapine may improve mutism in some noncatatonic schizophrenic patients.

Using a case–control design, MVC deaths were ascertained using a military mortality registry, and an integrated health system database provided information on health system eligibility, pharmacy transactions, and medical encounters. Cases and controls were matched on comparable observation time outside periods of deployment. Among selected categories, only one, antidepressant medications, was an independent predictor of fatal MVC (odds ratio, 3.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–10.07). Male gender, Black race, enlisted rank, service branch (Navy and Marine Corps), and selected co-morbidities were also independent predictors. Unexpectedly, the odds of younger age quartiles (<27 years) and history of deployment were reduced for MVC cases. Although results need to be considered in the context of data limitations, the association between prescribed antidepressants and fatal MVC may reflect unmeasured co-morbidities, such as combined effects of prescribed and over-the-counter medications and/or alcohol or other substance abuse. Younger individuals, representing new military accessions in training or returning from deployment with serious injuries, may have fewer opportunities to operate vehicles, or targeted efforts to reduce MVC following deployment may be showing a positive effect.

Results demonstrated that demandingness beliefs indirectly affected the various symptom groups of PTSD through a set of secondary irrational beliefs that include catastrophizing, low frustration tolerance, and depreciation beliefs. Conclusions: Results were consistent with the predictions of REBT theory and provides strong empirical support that the cognitive variables described by REBT theory are critical cognitive constructs in the prediction of PTSD symptomology.

1257,"Background: Firefighters must be ready to respond to a broad range of emergencies every duty day. In the course of many of these emergencies, firefighters witness events which have the potential to induce emotional trauma, such as badly injured people, deceased children, and individuals who are highly distraught. Previous research suggests that repeated exposure to these traumas (RET) may have negative impacts on the emotional and mental health of fire service personnel. Research on the mental health of firefighters has been limited to small surveys reporting the prevalence of specific mental health problems such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder among firefighters. Objective: Despite the likelihood that RET leads to negative outcomes in firefighters, data is lacking on how exposure impacts fire service personnel. The current study examines the experiences of firefighters related to RET. Methods: Using formative research methods, we examined the beliefs and experiences of firefighters and administrators from across the United States regarding the impact of RET on firefighter health. Results: Study findings highlight the cumulative psychological toll of repeated exposure to traumatic events including desensitization, flashbacks, and irritability. Conclusion: Results of the current study suggest that RET is a significant concern for emergency responders that warrants additional research and attention. It is likely that the long term consequences of RET are closely intertwined with other mental health outcomes and general well-being of this important occupational group.

1258,"Purpose: This study surveyed US programmes that train professionals in assistive technology (AT). Surveys contained questions regarding programme characteristics, audiences, training content, and approaches. Method: This multi-method, longitudinal study gathered information from 55 programmes in 27 states concerning their courses, curricula, and training audiences in 2002 and again in 2004. The study focused on 45 unique programmes conducting AT training for formal credit, which included graduate or undergraduate credit or degrees, continuing education units (CEUs), and/or AT credential. Results: Twenty-five programmes at universities and colleges (average age 10 years) trained mainly graduate students, and typically offered five or six three-unit AT courses. Twenty community-based programmes (average age 7 years) offered mainly 1- or 2-day workshops. Special educators represented the largest group of trainees. Thirty-two training directors and 135 instructors described training barriers, curriculum issues, distance and hands-on learning methods, and future AT training directions. Conclusions: Multidisciplinary AT training not only reaches core audiences of disability-related professionals, but has expanded to include new audiences. Special and general educator training may be a model for inclusion. Although distance learning can reach diverse audiences, faculty in training programmes also emphasised hands-on training. AT training programmes experience considerable turnover and remain vulnerable to funding losses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Lita H. Jans, Marcia J.

1259,"This article reports the follow-up results of our field study (Jarero & Uribe, 2011) that investigated the application of the eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) Protocol for Recent Critical Incidents (EMDR-PRECI) in a human massacre situation. A single individual session was provided to 32 forensic personnel of the State Attorney General in the Mexican state of Durango who were working with 258 bodies recovered from clandestine graves. Pre-post results showed significant improvement for both immediate treatment and waitlist/delayed treatment groups on the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and Short PTSD Rating Interview (SPRINT). In this study, we report the follow-up assessment, which was conducted, at 3 and 5 months posttreatment. Follow-up scores showed that the original treatment results were maintained, with a further significant reduction of self-reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress and PTSD between posttreatment and follow-up. During the follow-up period, the employees continued to work with the recovered corpses and were continually exposed to horrific emotional stressors, with ongoing threats to their own safety. This suggests that EMDR-PRECI was an effective early intervention, reducing traumatic stress for a group of traumatized adults continuing to work under extreme stressors in a human massacre situation. It appears that the treatment may have helped to prevent the development of chronic PTSD and to increase psychological and emotional resilience.

The experimenter trained them to collect data on targeted maladaptive behavior of one consumer at one time of the day. Following the in-service and the in-service plus feedback trainings, the experimenters assessed whether data collection accuracy increased for that consumer at that time and whether these improved data collection skills generalized to the other consumers and different times. The experimenter used a multiple-baseline-across-participants design to demonstrate experimental control. All three staff improved their data-collection-accuracy from instruction to in-service, and then from in-service to in-service plus feedback. Additionally, improved data collection generalized to two different consumers and two separate time periods.

Her further diagnoses were major depression, trichotillomania, and social phobia. She refused specific psychotherapy but consented to supportive talks and drug therapy. Paroxetine and sertraline were stopped by the patient due to serotonergic side effects. Olanzapine had some effect on nightmares and aggression, but daytime sedation was not tolerable. Valproate and mirtazapine also were too sedative. Ziprasidone had neither effects nor side effects. Finally, we titrated aripiprazole from 15 to 30 mg/d. Within four weeks, the patient reported a more stable mood and noticeably reduced anxiety symptoms, leading to a more reliable participation in external occupational therapy.

Usual protocols for the treatment of traumatic incident exposure were less effective than usual. Counseling proceeded and the concept of performing a reverent act (reverent thought, prayer, funeral rite attendance, grave side visit) was introduced. All subjects discussed a plan and some form of reverent act was performed with positive effect. A study design was developed to examine the prevalence of similar experiences of presence among ESWs and their use of reverent acts on behalf of deceased victims. Sixty-two (62) questionnaire responses were received and 22 subjects identified from the employee assistance unit files were interviewed.

1266,"Introduction: There is a scarcity of research establishing a relationship between mental illness and the U.S. military service members who participate in the field of military humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR). One of the few studies in this area showed that participation in military HA/DR was not associated with depressive symptoms, however, the study was limited by sample size. This study examined (1) the relationship between participation in military HA/DR and mental health symptoms and military stress and (2) the relationship between HA/DR and mental health treatment and therapy. Materials and Methods: Data from the 2011 Health Related Behaviors Survey was used. The analytic sample consisted of U.S. military service members who participated in HA/DR (the Haiti earthquake and Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf ) (n = 573) compared to those who participated in non-HA/DR deployments from 2007 to 2011 (n = 986). Multivariate models were used to examine the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variables while controlling for a set of variables that may confound the relationship between the two. Results: The logistic regression model found that participating in HA/DR deployments decreased the likelihood of service members reporting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms by 3% (p < 0.1) and depressive symptoms by 1% (p < 0.05). Furthermore, participation decreased the likelihood of having a prescription for antidepressants during and/or 3 months after deployment by 1% (p < 0.05). Additional results showed that junior enlisted and senior enlisted members were more likely to report symptoms of PTSD than senior officers (p < 0.05). Marines were more likely to seek treatment and therapy for depression than U.S. Coastguard members (p < 0.1). Conclusion: Results showed that participation in HA/DR was associated with significant reductions in PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and the use of antidepressants by service members. Further research needs to understand the mechanism of these associations for better planning and implementation of HA/DR and delivery of care to service members who participate in these missions.

The highest numbers of accident cases were from the production enterprise with 150–199 employees and from the industrial sector of engineering. Essential safety elements for SMEs are accident reports, accident investigation and safety inspections. It is clear that the SMEs in this study had better health and safety management than expected, probably because their products were in the group of the twenty-four highest exporting (by value) commodities of Thailand or they were forced by customers.

1272,"Due to the nature of police work, Law Enforcement officers are repeatedly exposed to various types of trauma. Experiencing trauma personally, or vicariously via witnessing or even providing aid, can lead to an increased risk for development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Law Enforcement officers belong to an insular culture often featuring rigid tenets and expectations of both behavior and thought that serves as not only a strong protective factor for the mitigation of PTSD, but also as a potential risk factor for the development and exacerbation of PTSD. Police culture may compound with novel stressors related to work problems (e.g. administrative issues, heavy workload, internal investigations), family problems (e.g. lack of communication, deterioration of relationships), substance abuse (condoned self-medicating, comorbidity of alcohol use and mental health disorders), and suicidal ideation (may be increased by the stigma of seeking mental health treatment and repeated exposure to highly traumatic situations) experienced by Law Enforcement officers which may then exacerbate the likelihood of developing PTSD. The present study sought to explore the potential relationship between PTSD and specific stressors including: work problems, family problems, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation in Law Enforcement. An archival analysis was conducted using data from a random sample of Law Enforcement officers (n=100) from agencies across the United States. Linear regression was utilized to analyze the sample; the results of the study supported the hypothesis that PTSD is influenced by external stressors experienced by Law Enforcement officers. The overall results were statistically significant, demonstrating that the four predictor variables accounted for 68% of PTSD scores within the sample.

1273,"Background: In this paper, we present the protocol for a cluster-randomised trial to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a workplace mental health intervention in the state-wide police department of the south-eastern Australian state of Victoria. n. The primary aims of the intervention are to improve psychosocial working conditions and mental health literacy, and secondarily to improve mental health and organisational outcomes. Methods/design: The intervention was designed collaboratively with Victoria Police based on a mixed methods pilot study, and combines multi-session leadership coaching for the senior officers within stations (e.g., Sergeants, Senior Sergeants) with tailored mental health literacy training for lower and upper ranks. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated using a two-arm cluster-randomised trial design, with 12 police stations randomly assigned to the intervention and 12 to the non-intervention/usual care control condition. Data will be collected from all police members in each station (estimated at > 20 per station). Psychosocial working conditions (e.g., supervisory support, job control, job demands), mental health literacy (e.g., knowledge, confidence in assisting someone who may have a mental health problem), and mental health will be assessed using validated measures. Organisational outcomes will include organisational depression disclosure norms, organisational cynicism, and station-level sickness absence rates. The trial will be conducted following CONSORT guidelines. Identifying data will not be collected in order to protect participant privacy and to optimise participation, hence changes in primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed using a two-sample t-test comparing summary measures by arm, with weighting by cluster size. Discussion: This intervention is novel in its integration of stressor-reduction and mental health literacy-enhancing strategies. Effectiveness will be rigorously evaluated, and if positive results are observed, the intervention will be adapted across Victoria Police (total employees ~16,500) as well as possibly in other policing contexts, both nationally and internationally.

Previous trauma theory research indicated when not addressed, the impact of such trauma leads to serious physical and mental health problems. The use of the PCIS with the study population had not been evaluated. This study was conducted, using archival data, to address this gap. The sample consisted of LEOs in the southeastern US. Officers participated in either PCIS-only or PCIS + EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) groups and were also categorized according to time since the incident. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) was administered at the start of each PCIS and again at 6 months. Dependent t tests were used to demonstrate significant pre/post decreases in IES-R scores for both groups. Of clinical concern at pretest, the IES-R scores for the PCIS + EMDR group were reduced to below the scale’s threshold for clinical concern. Regression analyses were used to also document significant links connecting the time since the incident, type of incident, and gender with IES-R scores. These preliminary findings lend support for the PCIS, with implications for social change and further study: With continued research and recommendations, the PCIS can be enhanced to best help LEOs remain healthy and fit for duty, resulting in a safer society.

1277,"Aim: To determine if differences exist between paediatric intensive care nurses and allied health professionals in empathy, secondary trauma, burnout, pain exposure and pain ratings of self and others. Early and late career differences were also examined. Background: Nurses are routinely exposed to patient pain expression. This work context may make them vulnerable to adverse outcomes such as desensitization to patient pain or a compromise in personal well-being. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Data were collected from a convenience sample of paediatric intensive care nurses (n = 27) and allied health professionals (n = 24), from September 2014–June 2015, at a Canadian health centre. Both groups completed one demographic and three behavioural scales. Participants underwent fMRI while rating the pain of infant and adult patients in a series of video clips. Data were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric methods. fMRI results are reported in a second paper. Results: Nurses were significantly more likely to be exposed to pain at work than allied health professionals and scored significantly higher on dimensions of empathy, secondary trauma and burnout. Nurses scored their own pain and the pain of infant and adult patients, higher than allied health participants. Less experienced nurses had higher secondary trauma and burnout scores than more experienced nurses. Conclusions: Paediatric intensive care work demands, such as patient pain exposure, may be associated with nurse’s higher report of empathy and pain in self and others, but also with higher levels of secondary trauma and burnout, when compared with allied health professionals.

Occupational therapists with their holistic, humanistic approach and scientific training can play an important role in restoring physical functions and enhancing occupation participation for survivors of the natural disasters. Active participation in and contribution to research and holistic management of disaster survivors should ensure the occupational therapy profession a seat at the table in future health policy and practice decisions on disaster management.

1279,"Diabetes is a lifelong, chronic illness that requires significant behavior modification for proper management. These behavioral changes, which include the regularization of diet, routine exercise, control of stress, and pharmacological treatment, must be followed 24 hours per day. This article focuses on the management of diabetes in the workplace. Most Americans spend a significant part of their day at work, and for many these days are long enough to account for most of the individual’s waking time. Diabetes management must be part of workplace life if affected individuals are to successfully control the disease. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) provides a general legal framework for access of individuals with disabilities to public places and for accommodating employees with disabilities in the workplace. Although the ADA contains very specific guidance for physical accommodations, such as wheelchair access, it provides little guidance relevant to workers with diabetes. This article reviews the problems in ADA jurisprudence as it relates to diabetes. Some of these problems are common to other chronic diseases under the ADA. The article concludes that courts would reach more consistent and effective rulings if they used a more sophisticated view of diabetes.

Rights of access: services to the public, public authority functions, private clubs and premises.

The aim of this study was to examine the neuronal circuitry underlying responses to script-driven imagery in traumatized police officers with and without PTSD and with low comorbidity rates. Methods: In a case-matched control study, 30 traumatized police officers with and without PTSD underwent clinical assessment and 99m technetium-hexa-methyl-propylene-amine-oxime single photon emission computed tomography scanning with neutral and trauma scripts. Statistical parametric mapping was applied to analyze changes in regional cerebral blood flow. Results: The main findings were significantly less activation in the medial frontal gyrus and more activation in the right cuneus in the PTSD group relative to the trauma-exposed control group in reaction to trauma versus neutral scripts. Within the PTSD group, subjects showed less activation in the superior temporal gyrus, left lentiform nucleus, left middle frontal gyms, and left inferior frontal gyrus in reaction to trauma scripts. Conclusions: We confirmed previous findings of dysfunction of the medial frontal gyrus in PTSD in a new population with low comorbidity rates. Other alterations were found in certain brain structures involved in emotional, memory, linguistic, visuospatial, and motor processing.

Rates of sickness absence in the public sector are higher than those in the private sector, with the exception of the fire service where they are consistently lower. Aims: To understand the influences that increase attendance among operational firefighters. Methods: A series of semi-structured interviews undertaken with operational staff to explore their attitudes to sickness absence. Results: Review and analysis of participant responses identified a number of key themes, namely employee well-being, including physical fitness and mental health; employee engagement with the fire service as manifested by culture, experience, nature of the job and leadership; organizational factors including the staffing model and relationship with occupational health services and policy, which describes both refinements to and implementation of targeted policies. Conclusions: Previously observed factors such as improved fitness and the distinct firefighter culture play a role, yet other factors emerged that could explain the differences. These include the greater work–life balance offered by their shift patterns, the terms and conditions of employment and perhaps most importantly the evolution of precisely targeted policies that understand the unique nature of the operational fire service.

1285,"Controlled studies have shown that motivational incentives reduce drug use, but community implementation has been limited. This observational study examines the effect of a contingency management (CM) program on urine, attendance, and cost measures in a community substance abuse treatment program for adolescents. Treatment included elements of 12-step facilitation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and motivational enhancement. All urine tests included cannabinoids, opioids, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and amphetamines. Patients with negative urines or perfect attendance earned chances to draw weekly from a bag for prizes of varying value, and the number of draws increased with each consecutive negative urine test. Data were collected for those patients (age 12–18) treated immediately before (n=83) and after (n=264) the CM program was introduced to the treatment center, and positive urine rates were compared using chi-square tests. Patients treated with the CM program had lower rates of urines positive for opioids (p<0.005) and cocaine (p<0.05), and non-significantly but consistently lower rates of urines positive for all other drug classes. Altogether, the proportion of urines positive for any drug decreased from 33.3% to 23.4% (p<0.01). Pre- and post-CM comparisons of attendance reveal lower daily attendance rates but longer retention in treatment. Expenses were minimal at $0.39 per patient per day.

He was a giant of the field literally and figuratively. He was a visionary who developed and explored some of the earliest applications of behavior analysis and was one of the field’s greatest thinkers. He credited some of his vigor and appreciation for the importance of change to his early days in the rugged territory of Alaska where his father was a homesteader and railroad worker. In addition to mental health, developmental disabilities, and autism, Todd’s work extended to nursing homes, police departments, and work with Indian nations, neighborhoods, and what he called 'living environments.'

1287,"Trauma is common in our everyday lives (Ursano, 1997). Air disasters significantly impact health and community stability even when only a few individuals are the primary victims. Air travel becomes more and more frequent thus raising the possibilities for plane accidents. What is society's responsibility to deal with and treat the victims of air disasters? It appears that the attitude of the government and the aircraft industry safety officials focus on preventing a crash and not surviving it (Canilli & Goldman, 198 1). This dissertation looks at possible ways of treating victims. The responses of individuals to disasters vary. People experience overpowering terror and mental distress. Factors such as severity of the stressor, genetic predisposition, developmental phase, social support, prior traumatization and preexisting personality exist. Traumatic stressors experience feelings such as troubling memories, arousal, and avoidance, How the victims interact with their environment and society after a plane disaster is a major focus of this dissertation. The research states that people exposed to a traumatic event experience intense fear, helplessness, or horror. The phenomena of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and an increasing intake of alcohol and drugs are some of the side effects of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The level of social support, the meaning of the trauma, the victim's psychological response, personality, and previous life experiences are all crucial factors in the victim's eventual response to trauma as well as to the form of treatment and resumption of a normal life. Moreover, the research indicates that cultural, social and individual differences may influence the rescue worker's coping styles and the physician's and clinician's ability to give correct treatment. An effective program of treatment is the main aspect of this dissertation. The central objective of this program is to provide support, education and counseling to individuals and their families regarding the nature and process of psychological trauma and loss as a result of an air crash also facilitating victims to reintegrate back into their 'normal' life. The strategies will be of the program are as follows: (a) decrease overwhelming emotions and cognitive disorganizations, (b) normalize intensive emotional reaction, (c) facilitate emotional disclosure, (d) prevent avoidance by encouraging coping skills, and (e) return to pre-event functioning both personally and professionally. It is anticipated that any airline seeking to address psychological services related to air disaster will find this program a useful resource and incorporate (and modify as needed) the program to suit specific and preferential needs. The program provides victims with the opportunity to have psychotherapeutic needs met within a structured and consistent surrounding on a daily basis. Psychological services will be available in certain areas such as; psychological education, psychological debriefing, individual psychotherapy, group therapy, family therapy, behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and art therapy. Psychiatric assessments and psychotropic medication will be provided as well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Hun-Jue Luu (2000).

1292,"Purpose: This paper aims to capture the views of forensic mental health service users; focusing on how services promote the aspiration to work, the development of skills for work, and the vocational rehabilitation process. It seeks to provide insight into forensic mental health service users’ views on the barriers and enablers to accessing work together with suggestions for enhancing practice, and implications for further research. Design/methodology/approach: Ten participants from a range of forensic mental health services throughout Scotland took part in semi-structured interviews. Participants were involved in either paid work, voluntary work or work preparation. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) allowed exploration of an individual’s lived experiences and how they make sense of this. Findings: Service users valued the opportunity to address vocational issues at the earliest opportunity in their rehabilitation. Work had an overwhelmingly positive impact on mental health. Analysis of interview transcripts revealed three master themes: 'Normalising my life': the positive impact of work; 'Gradual steps': facing barriers; and 'Practical help and encouragement': feeling supported. There is much to gain from good multidisciplinary rehabilitation within secure hospitals and the community, with work playing an important role in recovery and symptom control. Forensic services should focus on employment and the aspiration to work early, demonstrating awareness that attitude and the aspiration to work are a much more reliable indicator of success than diagnosis and mental health symptoms. Originality/value: Few qualitative studies have investigated service users’ views of work within forensic mental health, yet such information can be crucial to enhance and improve service delivery.

1296,"U.S. courts frequently require forensic examiners to offer opinions concerning the likelihood that criminal defendants found incompetent to stand trial can have their competence 'restored' through treatment. Yet no jurisdiction has established legal guidelines for testimony concerning restorability, and several authors have suggested that mental health professionals cannot accurately predict whether treatment to restore competence will succeed. This study asked whether reliable information that is consistently available at the time of examination might support empirically grounded opinions about the likelihood of restoration. Using records from all 351 inpatient pretrial defendants who underwent competence restoration at a state psychiatric hospital from 1995 through 1999, I evaluated whether several types of information that are reliable and that could consistently be made available to forensic examiners--including evaluees' demographic characteristics, diagnoses, symptom patterns, criminal charges, number of prior public sector hospitalizations, and cumulative prior length of stay (LOS)--would predict outcome of restoration efforts. I modeled the probability of successful restoration using logistic regression equations, and evaluated the equations' predictive accuracy using k-fold cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Lower probability of restoration was associated with having a misdemeanor charge, longer cumulative LOS, older age, and diagnoses of mental retardation, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder. Although the overall rate of successful restoration for felony defendants was 75 percent, logistic equations allowed selection of subgroups with high predicted probabilities of restoration (>90%) and low probabilities of restoration (<35%). In cross-validation simulations, predictive equations had ROC areas of 0.727 for all defendants, and 0.735 for felony defendants. These findings provide scientific support for testimony that two types of incompetent evaluees have well-below-average probabilities of being restored: chronically psychotic defendants with histories of lengthy inpatient hospitalizations and defendants whose incompetence stems from irremediable cognitive disorders (such as mental retardation). Nonetheless, courts may still deem low probabilities of success to be 'substantial' enough to warrant attempts at restoration.

Purpose: This study explored the experiences of stakeholders involved in the integration of internationally educated occupational therapists (IEOTs) into the BC workforce. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the three primary stakeholder groups (40 IEOTs, 12 supervising occupational therapists, seven managers), as well as with seven key informants. Participants were purposively sampled and thematic analysis was applied to the data. Findings: Three themes were identified that fit sequentially along a workforce-integration continuum: 'coming to Canada,' 'registering with the college,' and 'integrating into the workplace.' Within those themes, findings were organized into two categories, 'ingredients for success' and 'stumbling block,' and multiple subcategories. Implications: The findings suggest that hiring IEOTs can bring benefits to the workplace and clients.

1301,"Purpose: To investigate the organizational perspectives on the effectiveness of their attendance management policies for chronically ill employees. Methods: A mixed-method approach was employed involving questionnaire survey with employees and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders of the organizational policies. Results: Participants reported that attendance management polices and the point at which systems were triggered, posed problems for employees managing chronic illness. These systems presented risk to health: employees were more likely to turn up for work despite feeling unwell (presenteeism) to avoid a disciplinary situation but absence-related support was only provided once illness progressed to long-term sick leave. Attendance management polices also raised ethical concerns for 'forced' illness disclosure and immense pressures on line managers to manage attendance. Conclusions: Participants felt their current attendance management polices were unfavourable toward those managing a chronic illness. The policies heavily focused on attendance despite illness and on providing return to work support following long-term sick leave. Drawing on the results, the authors conclude that attendance management should promote job retention rather than merely prevent absence per se.

1302,"Purpose: People with lower-limb amputations are routinely fitted with an artificial limb. Good communication with prosthetists is vital in meeting patients’ needs in this process. The present study aimed to identify the salient issues surrounding problematic interaction between patients and prosthetists from the point of view of patients. Method: Three on-line discussion groups for people with lower-limb amputations were searched for all posts which discussed such issues. A total of 527 electronic messages comprised the data set, from 155 authors. All data served as the basis for analysis. Results: A phenomenologically-informed thematic analysis identified three themes: ‘Becoming a prosthesis user: Not knowing what to expect’; ‘Unmet expectations: Trying to get the prosthetist to do something’; and ‘Working with your prosthetist: The need to communicate well’. The presented results are illustrated with posts from 25 participants. Conclusions: The results indicate the need to improve communication between prosthetists and patients, including that prosthetists should strive to share more information, to communicate in more understandable language and to provide more opportunities for patients to make choices in the prosthesis prescription process.

1303,"Objectives: We aimed to examine the experiences of advanced trainees in forensic psychiatry as they practise testifying as expert witnesses in a mock court setting. Methods: Five advanced trainees (including the first author) submitted court-ordered forensic reports in advance of attending the mock court. Senior colleagues had roles of Judge, prosecution and defence lawyers. House officers and medical students were summoned as jury. Over a year, each trainee had the experience of direct and cross-examination by opposing legal teams. Following the mock trial, each participant was given immediate feedback and subsequently asked to complete a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: The experience of participating in a mock court has learning value for advanced trainees specialising in forensic psychiatry in anticipation of giving evidence in a court of law. Constructive feedback enabled attendees to gain valuable education in a supportive setting. Of particular value was guidance in the use of technical language in presenting evidence in a court setting, knowledge of the breadth of questions that could be put forth to an expert witness, desensitisation training in an adversarial albeit simulated setting, and acquiring skills in staying calm under pressure. Conclusions: The importance of a well-written report, good preparation and anxiety management were significant learning points.

Employing the ideas of user participation and mass customisation, this research addresses the need for reduced product costs and optimised product flexibility. Method: An adaptable six-question Delphi study was developed to establish consensus among AT professionals on design issues relating to a specified AT domain requiring innovation. The study is demonstrated for the special access technology (SAT) domain. A modified morphological matrix structures the application of the study results to the product design process. Results: Fourteen professionals from the Republic of Ireland and the UK participated. Consensus was reached on prevalent parts of SAT that malfunction, primary reasons for SAT malfunction, characteristics of clients associated with SAT selection, client needs regarding SAT use and training, desirable traits of SAT and clinicians’ frustrations with SAT. Conclusion: The study revealed a range of problems related to SAT, highlighting the complexities of successful SAT adoption.

1306,"Pays tribute to the late Donal F. M. Early, formerly consultant psychiatrist, Glenside Hospital, Bristol. On April 12, 2004, the death occurred of one of the giants of twentieth century psychiatry. It was in rehabilitation and industrial therapy that he made his mark. Institutionalization was a major problem in all mental hospitals. Many long-stay patients were unemployed or working for pocket money in the various hospital departments. New treatments improved prognosis, which without proper employment discharge was impossible. In 1957, he enlisted the help of a local industrialist whose business relied on out-workers to assemble ball-point pens. This was started in the occupational therapy department and, by the end of 1958, one-third of the patients were working. These new ideas worried the trade unions. He invited their representatives to visit the hospital and gained the support of the regional secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union. Don was invited to become a World Health Organization advisor in Industrial Rehabilitation and visited Spain, Turkey, France, Italy, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. His industrial rehabilitation movement contributed so much to the more enlightened treatment of chronic mental illness, the reduction of in-patient numbers and the move to community care.

During disaster the role of the occupational therapist will require a more specific operative framework within nongovernmental organizations and community health services. Design: Systematic review. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the evidence that highlight occupational therapist’s role in disaster area through a systematic review. Materials and Methods: Research on MEDLINE was performed. All articles from 2005 to 2015 concerning rehabilitation and occupational therapy in disaster areas were included. Results: Ten studies were selected to be included in this review. Four interesting points emerged: the importance of having rehabilitation intervention in postdisaster situations, the necessity to include a rehabilitation team in the early phase of disaster response, the need to provide a method to address the difficult evacuation, and finding the safest method of transport of people with preexisting disabilities and new injuries. Conclusions: The amount of evidence with respect to specific intervention of the occupational therapist’s role in a disaster situation is limited. However some evidence suggests that it could be a good means for reducing the number of medical complications and deaths of persons with preexisting disabilities. The evidences found highlight the necessity to create a multidisciplinary team addressing needs in disasters situation, in which the occupational therapist could certainly contribute.

1308,"Atypical antipsychotics have less neurological side-effects than the older drugs but are only available as oral preparations. This may limit their use in forensic patients. The authors sent a postal questionnaire to all consultant psychiatrists working in forensic settings in the UK to determine their views. 156 questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 60%. Respondents tended to overestimate the benefits and underestimate the side-effects of the atypical antipsychotics. The majority often prescribed atypical antipsychotics and depots together. Psychoeducation and serum level monitoring were used to optimize/monitor compliance by 50%. It is concluded that using atypical antipsychotics as monotherapy is problematic in forensic settings. The extent of polypharmacy means that patients may experience the side-effects of both typical and atypical antipsychotics. More could be done to facilitate and monitor compliance.

1309,"Background: Robberies are the leading motive for work-related homicide and assault. Interventions to reduce robberies and related injuries have been limited to convenience stores, and evaluations have not addressed compliance as a factor in program effectiveness. Setting/Participants: A total of 314 intervention and 96 control businesses were included in this intervention evaluation. Intervention: The Workplace Violence Prevention Program provided a customized robbery and violence prevention program to a stratified random sample of 314 small, high-risk businesses in Los Angeles City. An additional 96 comparison businesses did not receive the intervention. The intervention included individualized consultation, printed materials, training brochures, and a video. Interventions were conducted from August 1997 through August 2000. Main Outcome Measures: For both intervention and comparison businesses, a comprehensive security program assessment was conducted at baseline and at 3- and 12-month follow-up visits. Crime rates in intervention and comparison businesses were examined for 12 months pre- and post-intervention with the use of police reports. Results: By the second follow-up visit, compliance to the intervention program was significant for each program component. Employee training was the most frequently implemented intervention component. Neighborhood crime level, primary language spoken by the business owner, and the number of employees were all related to compliance. Although crime rates generally increased for all businesses from the pre- to post-intervention periods, businesses with high compliance to the program experienced a decrease in overall violent crime and robbery. Conclusions: Participating businesses were willing to voluntarily implement components of the intervention program, and greater implementation was related to reductions in robbery and violent crime.

1310,"Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition, requiring extensive rehabilitation from a range of health care professionals. However, it is unclear if patients view the professionals' input into their rehabilitation in the same way as those professionals. This paper presents findings from a qualitative study into patient participation in spinal cord injury rehabilitation. The aim of the part of the study reported here was to identify whether there is agreement between health care professionals and patients perceptions of professional roles in spinal cord injury rehabilitation. Results are presented from semi-structured interviews conducted with five doctors, five physiotherapists, three occupational therapists and 20 patients in a spinal cord injury unit in England. Findings suggest considerable agreement between professionals and patients about the role those professionals play in their rehabilitation. Physiotherapists are perceived to be key to rehabilitation, occupational therapists focus on hand function but physiotherapists and occupational therapists complement each other. Doctors coordinate the team yet reduce their input as patients move out of the acute phase into rehabilitation. There are some tensions but the early input of these professionals into patients' rehabilitation may help to develop understanding of roles. Congruence between patients and professionals may mean that patients have realistic expectations and encourage a more equal relationship between them.

Social context is inseparable from WHP. It covers workers' organizations and representatives, management, safety committees, occupational health services, health and safety enforcement agencies, general health services, non-government organizations, insurance systems, academic and other institutions, regulatory stipulations pertaining WHP, and material resources. Management preferred passive interventions, helping cover expert costs, participating in planning and granting time.

Participants: Police personnel treated for PTSD (n = 121). Methods: In this retrospective study all police officers had an intake interview before and an outtake interview following a 16-week treatment for PTSD. Information about several personal characteristics, PTSD complaints, and work related factors were gathered. A t-test and chi-square test were used to evaluate differences between working police personnel and police personnel on sick leave at intake and outtake. Binary logistic regression was used to test whether the intake data were related to returning to work at outtake. Results: At the start of the treatment half of the police personnel were on sick leave (n = 59) and at outtake 48 participants who were not working at intake had returned to work. None of the variables at intake contributed significantly to return to work at outtake. Conclusion: The majority of police officers returned to work after the treatment program.

1314,"Suicide is now the third leading cause of death in the United States for 10-24-year-olds. Many theories have been proposed to explain this increase: from the little black box on antidepressant medications to the explosion of social media, from economic strife to the trauma of military service, from the stigma surrounding having a mental illness to the stigma of asking for help. Undoubtedly, suicide remains a complex behavior, most often the result of numerous risk factors that come together in a perfect storm. Although research has revealed little in the identification of predictors, it has provided rich data on the complex relationships of suicide to bullying/cyberbullying, self-injury, depression, substance abuse, trauma, and parental rejection of LGBT youth. Despite these facts and statistics, the school mental health professional might be surprised to know that there is often resistance—even denial—from school administrations regarding implementing suicide prevention strategies. It is critical that all school mental health professionals be familiar with all of the current aspects, data, and research of suicide risk and suicide intervention in schools. They must continue to work with administrators to ensure safe campuses for all students and prepare their school personnel to recognize and intervene with students who present at all levels of risk for suicide (including depression screenings). They must continue to work compassionately with parents on prevention and early intervention with children with mental health issues. They must continue to work collaboratively with their community mental health partners and law enforcement. School mental health professionals can make all the difference in the world by ensuring that their schools have in place prevention, intervention, and postvention strategies regarding suicidal youth.

1316,"This qualitative study examined the experiences of occupational therapists working in palliative care. Multiple qualitative interviews were conducted with each of eight occupational therapists working with people who are terminally ill. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed for recurring and unique themes. Five themes emerged: satisfaction, hardship, coping, spirituality, and growth. Common themes, while resonating through all participants' stories, were experienced in a uniquely personal way by each participant. The result was the discovery of an individualized 'personal-professional connection' for each participant. The exploration of personal-professional connections can contribute to the understanding of occupational therapy practice in palliative care. Furthermore, these individual stories may resonate for other occupational therapists and inspire personal and professional reflection; validation of feelings and issues can arise from parallel comparisons. Therapists may in turn gain insight into the relationship between their own personal and professional experiences.

These were 'limited acknowledgment of nursing's complex role', 'divisive work practices' and 'discontinuous teamwork'. Segregation limited the extent to which nurses could contribute to patient rehabilitation. Conclusion: The delivery of multi-professional inpatient rehabilitation is complex.

Methods: Men with waist circumference > 100 cm were randomized into a lifestyle counseling (LIFE, N = 55) and a reference (REF, N = 58) group. The LIFE group participated in monthly counseling on nutrition, physical activity, and sleep for 12 months aiming at 10% weight loss. After 12 months, the REF group participated in 3-month counseling. Assessments took place at 0, 12, and 24 months. Between-group differences in changes were analyzed by generalized linear modeling. Metabolic risk (Z score) was calculated from components of metabolic syndrome. Results: The mean body weight change after 12 months was -3.4 kg in LIFE (N = 47) and 0.7 kg in REF (N = 48) [net difference -4.0 kg, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -1.9– -6.2]. Six men in LIFE reduced body weight by ≥ 10%. Changes in waist circumference were -4.7 cm in LIFE and -0.1 cm in REF (net -4.7 cm, 95% CI -6.6– -2.7).

1320,"The focus of this study was continuity in the careers of 151 women nurse's aides and a comparison group of 53 nurses. Nurse's aides have a high occurrence of on-the-job injuries. Often, the injury results in a permanent disability that prevents such persons from returning to their jobs. When this happens, the nurse's aides may be referred for vocational rehabilitation counseling. However, for most disabled nurse's aides, traditional career development approaches were not entirely helpful. For example, many nurse's aides reported that they had been satisfied with their jobs and their vocational identities, which made the selection of other occupations difficult. Additional obstacles to making alternate vocational choices included limited education and modest exposure to the world of work. Path analysis using least squares multiple regression was used to assess the tenability of the proposed models and test the pattern of variable linkages. An association was found between age, vocational identity, and job satisfaction in both the target and comparison samples. In addition, several boundary conditions (age, gender, ethnicity, occupational prestige, social economic indicators, educational level attained, and wages) were assessed to determine their possible contribution to the outcome of the study. The results of the study suggested that the nurse's aides' careers developed in a different pattern than did the nurses' careers. That is, biological conditions, boundary conditions, and environmental conditions may play more of a role in determining continuity in career for some groups of people than for others.

Hospitals losses occur due to decreased staff retention, prestige, and patient and visitor satisfaction. Objective: The purpose of the baseline survey reported here was to identify and describe staff experiences, concerns, and perceptions related to violence and abuse perpetrated by patients, family, and non-family visitors in a Level 1 emergency department. Participants: The survey sample was composed of 41 registered nurses and 10 paramedics.

Witnessing such trauma results in a host of mental illnesses and possible post traumatic brain injury, resulting in homelessness, a need for substance abuse programs, therapy, etc., upon returning to civilian life. This study seeks to explore veteran's preference in participating in programs ran by peer veterans versus programs ran by civilians for veterans. Currently, the Unites States Department of Veteran Affairs has concentrated on two evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy treatments that have been shown to be very effective in treating post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms: Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE) in helping symptoms of trauma. The measures used were a demographic preference scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory. Results indicated that Veterans prefer to work with and/seek veteran's programs however veterans who had previous experience with therapy and other services, as well as experience symptoms of depression and anxiety prefer to complete services with either veterans or civilians.

1331,"In the aftermath of a critical incident, most law enforcement agencies and other emergency service personnel have access to psychosocial programs (e.g., critical incident stress management [CISM] interventions). Critical Incident Stress Management involves a number of different interventions, including structured group interventions that facilitate sharing of experiences, normalization of reactions, and psychosocial education on trauma and coping, as well as individual support. Only personnel who have had special training should do these kinds of interventions. However, further therapeutic support may be needed, and EMDR is an effective intervention for police officers. Law enforcement officers are resilient individuals who have gone through background checks, pre-employment psychological screening, rigorous training, and usually a year of probation where their performance is evaluated. However, the therapist should have some knowledge of the police occupation and culture to optimize credibility and effectiveness. For the EMDR therapist who is providing therapeutic support in the aftermath of a disaster or critical incident, it is hoped the following information will facilitate understanding of the law enforcement profession and culture.

1332,"Warfighters face stressors such as sleep deprivation, information overload, exposure to injuries/dead bodies, and anxiety for the welfare of fellow Warfighters and family left behind. Consequently, we are continuously losing Warfighters due to psychological stress. Researchers have recently reported that approximately 18% of Warfighters returning from Iraq and 11% returning from Afghanistan (n = 6,201) screened positive for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a debilitating condition resulting from experiencing trauma, characterized by continuous memories of the traumatic experience. Military medical personnel are not immune to stress since they have a challenging and demanding dual role--that of a Warfighter and a first responder. In fact, it has been reported that many first responders report serious psychological distress, including PTSD. Even though many researchers are studying Warfighters' stress, there is still a gap in the literature on studies with support personnel (i.e., medics) and females. During a recent interview, a researcher reported finding no statistically significant PTSD symptoms difference between males (11%, n = 300) and females (12%, n = 50) in a sample of Warfighters holding violence-prone support jobs (i.e., medics). However, other researchers had previously reported that approximately 20% of females and 8% of males who had been exposed to traumatic events did develop PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, some researchers suggest that females might be less likely to be exposed to adverse stressful events but more likely to develop PTSD if exposed. Thus, an overall increased prevalence of PTSD in females (10% vs. 5% in males) can be accounted for by a significantly greater vulnerability to develop PTSD after exposure. Females also seem to have a longer course of illness than males with a median time to remission being 35 months for females compared to 9 months for males. The purpose of this study is not to identify which gender is more prone to PTSD. However, given the premise that males typically grow-up being exposed to more stressful situations than females (i.e., teasing each other, playing rough sports), and the lack of studies on female Warfighters (especially, in the medical field), we propose to test the effectiveness of Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) for female military medical personnel. SIT proposes that repeated exposure in stressful, but controlled conditions (i.e., via virtual reality) enables individuals to gradually adapt to stressors and learn how to cope. By conducting virtual reality SIT, or 'VR-SIT', the stressors can be applied systematically and paced appropriately for each individual. Our VR-SIT pilot study is currently underway and preliminary findings will be presented at the 2006 CyberTherapy Conference in Canada.

1333,"Paramedics are frequently subjected to traumatic experiences and have higher PTSD prevalence rates than people in the general population. However, the vast majority of paramedics do not develop PTSD. While several risk factors for PTSD have been established, little is known about protective factors. It has been suggested that a good sense of coherence (SOC) and high resilience lower the risk for developing PTSD. Aims: To examine whether SOC and resilience are associated with PTSD severity in paramedics. Method: A crosssectional study investigated SOC, resilience and PTSD in paramedics (N = 668). PTSD was assessed with the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS); resilience and SOC were measured with the Resilience Scale (RS-11) and the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-L9). Further measures included preparation of dealing with traumatic events and availability of psychological help. Results: As expected, both resilience and SOC were negatively correlated with PTSD symptoms. The regression analysis showed that 19.2% of the total variance in symptom severity was explained by these variables. However, SOC was a better predictor than resilience for PTSD severity, as it accounted for more unique variance. Paramedics who were prepared for dealing with work-related traumatic events and who received psychological help had less severe PTSD symptoms and higher SOC scores than paramedics for whom these services were not available. Conclusions: Enhancing resilience, and especially SOC, seems a promising approach to reduce PTSD symptom severity in high risk groups like paramedics.

1334,"Study Objectives: Firefighters’ schedules include extended shifts and long work weeks which cause sleep deficiency and circadian rhythm disruption. Many firefighters also suffer from undiagnosed sleep disorders, exacerbating fatigue. We tested the hypothesis that a workplace-based Sleep Health Program (SHP) incorporating sleep health education and sleep disorders screening would improve firefighter health and safety compared to standard practice. Design: Prospective station-level randomized, field-based intervention. Setting: US fire department. Participants: 1189 firefighters. Interventions: Sleep health education, questionnaire-based sleep disorders screening, and sleep clinic referrals for respondents who screened positive for a sleep disorder. Measurements and Results: Firefighters were randomized by station. Using departmental records, in an intention-to-treat analysis, firefighters assigned to intervention stations which participated in education sessions and had the opportunity to complete sleep disorders screening reported 46% fewer disability days than those assigned to control stations (1.4 ± 5.9 vs. 2.6 ± 8.5 days/firefighter, respectively; p = .003). There were no significant differences in departmental injury or motor vehicle crash rates between the groups. In post hoc analysis accounting for intervention exposure, firefighters who attended education sessions were 24% less likely to file at least one injury report during the study than those who did not attend, regardless of randomization (OR [95% CI] 0.76 [0.60, 0.98]; χ² = 4.56; p = .033). There were no significant changes pre- versus post-study in self-reported sleep or sleepiness in those who participated in the intervention.

1335,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the preferred sources and methods for acquiring physical activity information of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) using the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking. A secondary objective was to explore the barriers and facilitators to physical activity information seeking. Methods: Twenty-one participants diagnosed with MS participated in focus groups or telephone interviews. Results: A direct content analysis of the transcripts revealed that individuals appeared to generally prefer receiving physical activity information during period of relapse and remission. Participants also had positive beliefs toward physical activity and a clear preference for a time when physical activity messages would be relevant. Receiving physical activity information from credible sources such as the MS Society of Canada, healthcare professionals and peers with MS was also deemed important. The Internet was a preferred source to receive information due to its accessibility, but it often was considered to lack credibility. The lack of physical activity information specific to MS is the greatest barrier for individuals with MS to learn about physical activity. Conclusions: Healthcare professionals, National MS Societies, and peers should work together to deliver specific and relevant physical activity messages the MS population. Implications for Rehabilitation: (a) People with MS want more physical activity information from credible sources. (b) Multiple vehicles of physical activity information delivery (i.e. healthcare providers, peers, MS Society) should be utilized. (c) Physical activity information should be tailored to the individual with MS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Shane N.

This study identifies the prevalence of mental illness, a risk factor for substance abuse, and chronic pain among prescription drug overdose deaths in West Virginia and ascertains whether psychotropic drugs contributing to the deaths were used to treat mental illness or for nonmedical purposes. Method: In 2007, we abstracted data on mental illness, pain, and drugs contributing to death from all unintentional prescription drug overdose deaths in 2006 recorded by the West Virginia Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Decedent prescription records were obtained from the state prescription drug monitoring program. Results: Histories of mental illness and pain were documented in 42.7% and 56.6% of 295 decedents, respectively. Psychotropic drugs contributed to 48.8% of the deaths, with benzodiazepines involved in 36.6%. Benzodiazepines contributing to death were not associated with mental illness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6-1.8), while all other psychotropic drugs were (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI, 2.0-7.6). Of decedents with contributory benzodiazepines, 46.3% had no prescription for the drug. Conclusions: Mental illness may have contributed to substance abuse associated with deaths. Clinicians should screen for mental illness when prescribing opioids and recommend psychotherapy as an adjunct or an alternate to pharmacotherapy. Benzodiazepines may have been used nonmedically rather than as a psychotropic drug, reflecting drug diversion.

1337,"On Monday, August 29, 2005 Hurricane Katrina made landfall along the Louisiana and Alabama coastlines. The storm was recorded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as the greatest natural disaster to strike the United States. Emergency Medical Service (EMS) workers from around the nation were dispatched to the disaster area to aid in the recovery operation. A small squad of volunteers from a regional disaster response team was dispatched on October 2005 by FEMA to Hurricane Katrina disaster areas. The team, composed of 24 members, worked the disaster area six weeks after the initial impact. This delayed response provided me with opportunistic informants who could report the effects of cumulative stress reactions that occurred during and shortly after their response into that devastated region. This study was grounded in Critical Incident Stress Management Theory (CISM) developed by Jeff Michell. This inquiry utilized focus groups and key informant individual interviews as the primary source of data. In this research project, I used an interpretive approach to data collection and analysis. Open ended lines of inquiry were used. An analysis of responses indicated that severe disruptions occurred in each of the five components of CISM. These disruptions included early intervention treatments for EMS providers, exposure to critical incidents, provision of psychosocial support to rescuers in need, an opportunity for expression of thoughts and feelings, crisis education and assistance in the development of coping mechanisms. A theme of disturbance also emerged within this study's subjects from interactions with administrative and political systems that were present in the Hurricane Katrina Recovery Area. Additionally, other factors such as the presence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms, disturbance in relationships, reduced job satisfaction and existential dilemmas were reported by the subjects. Cumulative stress from disaster recovery work has gone unrecognized. This study suggests that professional counselors and the national EMS system must begin to address the affects of cumulative stress on emergency providers in a systemic way.

Given the challenges individuals with intellectual disability may face, this population is often dependent upon key workers to manage their health and well‐being. One aim of a wider study on the self‐management of diabetes by people with intellectual disability was to explore how key workers supported their self‐management. That aim was the focus of this paper. Between 2009 and 2010, 17 staff from five residential intellectual disability services and two supported independent living services within New Zealand, consented to a semi‐structured interview. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed using Thomas' General Inductive Approach. Three overarching themes emerged; having knowledge and understanding, being lifestyle police and ensuring future well‐being. While knowledge, skills and perspectives varied, all participants were committed to ensuring that the lifestyle of the person concerned was compatible with the management of their diabetes. A range of perspectives existed between the expectations they had of themselves, colleagues and the individual with diabetes. There was an identified need for initial and ongoing education of permanent and casual staff and the people themselves with diabetes in collaboration with health and disability services to build confidence and promote self‐management practices. In so doing, the impacts of this long‐term condition may be reduced and the health outcomes improved for people with intellectual disability.

1341,"Little is known about characteristics of non-fatal workplace violence. In the general population younger age, being a Person of Color, and being male are associated with an individual's higher risk of victimization and their lower likelihood to report victimization to the police. Yet limited research has been done to evaluate if this is the case for incidents occurring in the workplace. While research addressing workplace violence is being conducted, national data is limited and much of the research is over a decade old (Duhart, 2001). Additionally, there is great variability by occupation in the amount of workplace violence research being done. Because of their high risk for victimization, health care workers, particularly nurses, have been the focus of many academic studies. This growing body of research has evaluated nurses' experiences of physical violence in the workplace, but correctional nurses are often excluded. Because of the perception that correctional health care is a risky profession it's surprising that little research has focused on correctional nurses experiences. Using two data sources (1) national, and (2) state level data on correctional nurses, rates of workplace violence, descriptions of incidents of workplace violence, and an exploration of factors that prevent workplace violence were conducted. The first study utilized secondary data from the 2000-2005 National Crime Victimization Study. Results indicate that workplace violence trends have remained fairly steady from 2000-2005 with police officers having the highest risk for victimization. The second study used data collected from 172 correctional nurses via a self-administered questionnaire. Analysis of this data showed that, among correctional nurses, the risk of workplace physical violence is comparable to nurses in other high risk fields and their risk for non-physical workplace violence is substantially higher. Both studies indicate that workers commonly under-report workplace violent victimization to authority figures. Results of this dissertation have implications for identifying workers at an increased risk for victimization in the workplace, thus allowing for targeted implementation of effective workplace violence prevention interventions.

It is a core clinical skill for both psychologists and psychiatrists. The recent UK government Offender Personality Disorder (PD) Strategy proposes a key role of probation staff in CF. Yet, CF in forensic settings has only recently received research attention, and it is unclear how and by whom it ought to be performed. Aims: This study aimed to gain consensus on the key characteristics of CF in PD offenders. Methods: We conducted an electronic Delphi survey of experts with a background in psychology or psychiatry. Results: Consensus was achieved on who can perform CF, who it should be offered to and the benefits, process, theoretical models and content of CF. A cognitive–behavioural therapy or schema-focused model was felt to be best suited to inform CF in PD offenders. No agreement was achieved on the assessment of quality of CF. Discussion: Our findings support the government’s PD strategy in that experts agreed that CF could be performed by professionals other than psychiatrists and psychologists. However, more research is needed on how to best assess the quality of CF and its utility in determining treatment pathways. Clinical implications: It may be possible for probation staff to take on a more active role in CF for PD offenders using a cognitive–behavioural or schema-focused model.However, a significant amount of training will be required for probation staff to acquire the relevant skills.

Methods: A survey of 309 Los Angeles taxi drivers provides basic data on health status, job stress, and work-related injuries. We further analyzed the data using a Modified Poisson regression approach with a robust error variance to estimate the relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of work-related injuries. Focus group results supplemented and helped interpret the quantitative data. Results: The joint effect of good health and low job stress was associated with a large reduction in the incidence of injuries, consistent with the hypothesis that health status and stress levels modify each other on the risk of work-related injury. Conclusion: These results suggest that the combination of stress reduction and health management programs together with changes in the stressful conditions of the job may provide targeted avenues to prevent injuries.

While several forms of amphetamine are useful in some areas of medicine, methamphetamine as an abused substance is associated with severe and multifaceted consequences. Problems associated with the abuse of amphetamine and its derivatives such as methamphetamine have been well documented. As the manufacture and use of methamphetamine across the United States has increased, the impact of methamphetamine abuse has been felt beyond individual users; families as well as communities can be seriously affected.

The commenting author discusses his parallel experiences in his work as a behavior therapist providing services in the aftermath of the disaster but feels that Lubetkin's observations and recommendations do not sufficiently distinguish between immediate postdisaster interventions and those that may be applied appropriately weeks or months after the disaster.

That is, rather than intervening with exposure and cognitive restructuring techniques, the task is to offer comfort and support, to depathologize people's reactions to severe stress, to listen empathically, to encourage people to talk to family and friends, and to provide triage.

1346,"Reviews the book, CBT for Adults: A Practical Guide for Clinicians by Lynne M. Drummond (2014). This book is a comprehensive guide to the use of cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) throughout adult psychiatry’. The book also include a brief summary of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies. This book is particularly useful resource for psychiatrists in training and indeed other medics, such as general practice trainees, who have a particular interest in mental health.The strength of the book is the excellent case examples which it contains.The book does not just show how things can go ‘swimmingly well’ if one put into practice the techniques, but rather are complicated and typical of the complex scenarios which we actually encounter in psychiatry. This is a good, comprehensive textbook, particularly for trainee psychiatrists, although they will obviously need to add to it the indispensable experience of face-to-face contact in CBT and practice how to construct CBT formulations from a variety of clinical scenarios.

1347,"Background: Factors affecting the evidence-based practice (EBP) capabilities of allied health staff are complex and are linked with institutional barriers, personal self-belief, and individual experience and ability. This study's aim was to measure the effect of training and organisational change on EBP measures among allied health staff. Methods: Sixty-three percent of allied health hospital staff (201/303) completed an online survey measuring constructs of EBP. Results were compared to those from the same survey conducted in the previous year, with a response rate of 72.2% (182/252). Eighty staff completed the survey at both time points. Independent and repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare levels of self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, knowledge, and use, according to discipline over time. Results: A significant increase in EBP self-efficacy was observed over time (p = 0.03), as well as amongst staff who completed the survey at both time points (p = 0.013). Significant differences existed between professions at time 2 in EBP-outcome expectancy (p = 0.002) and EBP use (p = 0.016). Conclusions: Targeted within-department and general allied health workplace evidence-based interventions to improve EBP constructs have been effective at improving overall allied health EBP self-efficacy. Different departments have demonstrated individual improvements in EBP scores, potentially reflecting different training and organisational strategies implemented across departments.

1349,"Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic and pervasive developmental disorder that is not restricted to the childhood years. Methods: This paper reviews non-pharmacological interventions that are available at present for preschoolers, school-age children, adolescents and adults. Results: The most appropriate intervention for preschoolers is parent training. For school-age children with moderate impairments there is some evidence to suggest that group parent training programmes and classroom behavioural interventions may suffice as a first-line treatment. For school-age children with severe impairments, interventions are more appropriate when combined with stimulant medication (i.e., integrated treatment packages are likely to be more successful than standalone treatments). Multimodal interventions seem to be best suited for middle school adolescent children, which most likely reflects that these interventions usually integrate home and school treatment strategies and often include an element of social skills training. Stimulant medication is generally the first line of treatment for adults but CBT has also been found to be effective at addressing the complex needs of this population. Conclusion: Current research has largely ignored that ADHD is a developmental disorder that spans the preschool to adult years. Most studies focus on young school-age children and outside of this age group there is a dearth of controlled trials that provide conclusive evidence. As children mature the mode and agent of intervention will shift to reflect the developmental needs and circumstances of the individual.

Method: One hundred and thirty-three adult burn trauma victims entered the study. After initial questionnaire completion, participants were randomly allocated to an individual/couple PD group or a control group who received no intervention; 110 (83%) were interviewed by an assessor blind to PD status three and 13 months later. Results: Sixteen (26%) of the PD group had PTSD at 13-month follow-up, compared with four (9%) of the control group. The PD group had higher initial questionnaire scores and more severe dimensions of burn trauma than the control group, both of which were associated with a poorer outcome.

The objective was to determine (1) the types of clinical events perceived as critical and (2) the usefulness of critical incident stress debriefings for emergency nurses. Methods: Questionnaires asking emergency nurses to rate clinical incidents as critical and to respond to questions about their experiences with debriefings were sent to members of three state ENAs. Structured interviews about personal experiences with critical incidents and debriefings were conducted with 26 respondents. Results: Emergency nurses responding to the questionnaire viewed the death of a child and the death of a coworker as the most critical of the possible events. The majority of interviewees saw an incident related to the death of a child as the most critical in their careers. Of the questionnaire respondents, 32% had participated in debriefings; 88% of those found them helpful in reducing critical incident stress. Discussion: The findings suggest that managers should be alerted to the possibility of acute stress responses when emergency nurses experience a child's death. Education regarding stress and debriefings may be helpful to ED personnel.","Burns C. & Harm N.J. (1993) Emergency nurses’ perceptions of critical incidents and stress debriefing.

Objectives of the study were to explore and describe Emergency Medical Technicians' (EMTs) experiences of critical incidents and views about potential interventions, in order to facilitate development of interventions that take into account EMS culture. We interviewed 60 EMT practitioners and supervisors, and examined interview transcripts using ethnographic content analysis. EMT practitioners want emotional support in their workplace soon after a critical incident, and welcome interventions that would enhance this. They also experience a brief timeout as important in preventing sequelae of CIS. Exchanges with supervisors and peers that are experienced as supportive are illustrated. Barriers to support are described, as well as ways to address them. Educating supervisors and front-line practitioners to recognize and respond supportively to critical incidents is acceptable to them. However, an organizational culture that stigmatizes vulnerability is the most insidious and challenging barrier to accessing support after a critical incident. Addressing the issue of stigma is critical to developing appropriate interventions.","J. Halpern, M. Gurevich, B. Schwartz, and P.

Standard psychometrics were administered before, following, and six months after treatment, and therapist ratings of symptomotology were concurrently obtained in personal interviews. When compared to the waiting-list control, those subjects receiving implosive therapy showed significant improvement across many of the psychometric measures and the therapist ratings of psychopathology. Specific changes in the re-experiencing dimension of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were notable, while treatment did not seem to influence the numbing and social avoidance aspects of PTSD.

1363,"Objective: Crime is now a top-priority public-health issue in many urban areas. Sao Paulo’s state police force was the target of gunfire attack on an unprecedented scale. Several officers were killed or wounded, and many more were affected by psychological trauma. We investigated the brain activity underlying trauma, the coping effect of psychotherapy, and resilience in a highly homogenous sample that experienced the same traumatic event. The design applied was a between-group comparison of cerebral blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signals and symptom scores of police officers with and without partial Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (pPTSD). Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the retrieval of traumatic memories of 36 volunteers divided in three groups: (1) pPTSD policemen submitted to psychotherapy; (2) pPTSD policemen on the wait list; and (3) symptom-free (resilient) policemen. All participants were given a baseline fMRI scan and a follow-up scan some 40 days later. Not given psychotherapy, groups 2 and 3 were controls. Results: Group 1 showed 37% fewer PTSD symptoms post-psychotherapy and their scores and neural expressions were comparable to Group 3 resilient policemen. A marked increased in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity was concomitant with decreased amygdala activity during traumatic memory retrieval in both resilient and pPTSD participants (after psychotherapy) and these findings were associated with symptom attenuation. Conclusions: Our results provide neurophysiological evidence of resilience in a high-risk group for PTSD. Psychotherapy may help to build narratives and resilient integrated translations of fragmented traumatic memories via mPFC, and thus weaken their sensory content while strengthening them cognitively.","Peres, Foerster, Santana, Fereira, Nasella, Savoia, Moreira-Almeida, & Lederman H.

Police officers are exposed on daily basis to stressful and traumatic events, that is, the events outside usual human experience (e.g. serious threat to one's life and body integrity, witnessing violent acts or severe physical harm or death of another). Consequences and symptoms of stress include physical and psychosomatic illnesses, behavior changes, emotional and cognitive problems. Once the reaction to traumatic experience, judged by its intensity and duration, exceeds one's ""subjective coping threshold"" we talk about pathologic reaction to trauma which can cause various psychological disorders. Objectives: Objective of our work was to develop a structured stress management program based on cognitive behavior therapy principles for persons in high risk professions such as police officers. Another objective was to evaluate the effects of structured stress management program on police officers by measuring their anxiety levels before and after the treatment. Materials and methods: The subjects were police officers, aged from 30 to 45 years, divided into two groups, each consisting of 20 persons. One group received structured stress management program and another did not. All members of both groups completed BAI and ASI tests ahead and after the treatment, as well as three months after the treatment. Outcomes: Statistical data analyzes revealed that the subjects who had received stress management program displayed a statistically significant anxiety sensitivity reduction, developed more active and planned coping strategies for stressful situations, had less somatic reactions to stress and have thus also achieved improved performance at work and in private life. The subjects were also significantly more likely to request medical advice after completing psychotherapeutic program. Conclusions: - The group of police officers who had received the structured stress management program registered statistically significant anxiety sensitivity reduction compared to the test group. - The subjects who had completed the program were significantly more likely than the subjects from control group to request medical advice in crisis situations.","Sijaric-Voloder, S., & Capin, D.

We wanted to evaluate the association of mental health diagnoses with respiratory disease diagnoses among post-deployment veterans.Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all Afghanistan and Iraq War veterans who were discharged from the military or otherwise became eligible to receive Veterans Health Administration services. The primary exposure was receipt of a mental health diagnosis and the primary outcome was receipt of a respiratory diagnosis as recorded in the electronic health record. We used multivariable adjusted logistic regression to measure the associations of mental health diagnoses with respiratory diagnoses and conducted several analyses exploring the timing of the diagnoses.Results: Among 182,338 post-deployment veterans, 14% were diagnosed with a respiratory condition, 77% of whom had a concomitant mental health diagnosis. The incidence rates were 5,363/100,000 person-years (p-y), 587/100,000 p-y, 1,450/100,000 p-y, and 233/100,000 p-y for any respiratory disease diagnosis, bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive lung disease diagnoses, respectively, after the date of first Veterans Health Administration utilization. Any mental health diagnosis was associated with increased odds for any respiratory diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.37-1.46). The association of mental health diagnoses and subsequent respiratory disease diagnoses was stronger and more consistent than the converse.Conclusion: Many Afghanistan and Iraq War veterans are diagnosed with both respiratory and mental illnesses.

Little is known about the impact this has on quality of life particularly in countries where the risk of infection is high. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the impact SSNIs have on the quality of life of healthcare workers in Kenya, where blood borne illness prevalence is high. METHODS: A hospital-wide survey of a facility in Nairobi was conducted. Data was collected online from at risk healthcare workers using Burckhardt and Anderson's Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) and a 10-item symptoms questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 416 participants, 192 (46.2%) had experienced SSNIs. Their mean QOLS scores were considerably lower than that predicted for a healthy population. The relationship between symptoms and QOLS scores showed a strong positive correlation (Pearson's r = 0.753). Tests of association between QOLS scores and SSNI type, anti-retroviral (ARV) drug use, educational level and staff cadre revealed significant association (p < 0.05). However, on key demographic variables, the association was non-dependent, indicating that the impact was felt similarly by many staff. CONCLUSIONS: SSNIs clearly impact on healthcare workers quality of life. Hospital management should ensure measures are taken to reduce SSNIs and provide appropriate personal protection equipment.

The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a demographic questionnaire were administered. Mediation regression models were utilized to evaluate direct and indirect associations between worry, dissociation and sleep quality after controlling for age, gender, marital status, education, prior psychiatric disorders, familial loading and time spent watching TV series in a week. Regression models indicated that direct dose-response relationship between dissociative symptomatology and sleep quality was not statistically significant. However, indirect effects of dissociative symptoms though pathological worry were substantial. More specifically, we found that the DES total, absorption/ imaginative involvement and dissociative amnesia had significant indirect effects on poor sleep quality via excessive worry as measured by the PSWQ. We concluded that dissociative symptoms are indirectly associated with sleep through negative repetitive thoughts such as pathological worry. Therefore, new generation therapeutic approaches particularly mindfulness therapy should be considered in the first-line treatments of sleep disturbance.","Abdullah Yıldırım, Murat Boysan, Onur Yılmaz (2018/09//).

1373,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex multifactorial mental disorder with unknown aetiology and heterogeneous presentations. Due to its complexity, in order for treatment to be effective, the treatment approach should be individualised, integrated and multidisciplinary, and address the four major biopsychosocial components: (1) genetics, age, sex, race and existing medical conditions; (2) diet, lifestyle and smoking; (3) depression, anxiety, stress or excessive anger; and (4) social support system, quality of marriage and finances. The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has proved itself to be safe and effective for many disorders, and its application in the treatment of mental disorders is increasing.

Health Canada has recommended that healthcare professionals further their knowledge of the disease process in order to facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment and to improve patient outcomes. The intention of this review article is to provide cardiovascular specialists with an overview of the prevalence, epidemiology and stages of Lyme disease, focusing on the topic of Lyme carditis, an early disseminated complication of Lyme disease that directly impacts the cardiovascular system. With prompt recognition and treatment, acute Lyme carditis is reversible. As such, cardiovascular specialists play a pivotal role in caring for this patient population. Evidence-based practices for screening, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme carditis will be discussed by summarizing the literature that currently informs clinical practice. A case study will be used to illustrate these concepts. Given the emerging state of Lyme disease, increased awareness and education will be necessary to address current diagnostic, treatment and research gaps.","Crystal Blakely (2018///Fall2018).

Methods: This study employed a nonequivalent control group design using pretest and posttest measurements. Sampling was conducted with a convenient method. 44 firefighters (experimental group=22, control group=22) who were at high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression were selected from 1,337 firefighters working in fire stations in multiple sites. Data were collected between August and October 2016. The post-traumatic stress disorder management program was provided to the experimental group for 8 weeks. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-squared and independent t-tests. Results: Compared with the control group, participants in the experimental group showed significantly decreased scores for PTSD (t=-3.34, p=.002) and depression (t=-2.09, p=.043). Conclusion: Our study findings show that firefighters’ PTSD and depression can be systematically managed. Clinical practice should strengthen the ability to cope with PTSD by relieving the psychological trauma of firefighters who experience repeated traumatic events.","한 동 수,배 정 이 (2018/09//).  소방공무원 외상 후 스트레스 관리 프로그램이 외상 후 스트레스와 우울에 미치는 효과 Journal of Korean Academy of Psychiatric & Mental Health Nursing, 27(3),  240",0,,1168

1380,"Based on 10 months of fieldwork in the Acholi region of northern Uganda among youth and adults who were forcefully recruited into the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) during the war, this article provides qualitative details to research on 'appetitive aggression.' Through two case-stories the article unfolds first person articulations of how 'appetitive aggression' is experienced as 'the urge to kill' and how it relates to the emic Acholi spiritual concept of 'cen'; a local Luo expression used to describe places and human beings possessed by evil spirits. The analysis illuminates what the individual and social implications of 'the urge to kill' and 'cen' entail for two Acholi men; first in a militia and then in a civil post-war context. The analysis then relates these findings to soldier experiences across cultures and time periods. While our analysis supports the findings in 'appetitive aggression' studies that appetitive aggression serves as a resilient protective factor against developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this study documents that once the former forcefully recruited return to civilian life, 'appetitive aggression' and 'the urge to kill' precipitate individual and at times lethal social and moral complications in a fragile post-war community. Thus, the article argues that appetitive aggression and the emic perceptions and experiences of it among the local population are essential to consider in studies, processes and programs targeting demobilization, rehabilitation, reconciliation and re-integration.","Helle Harnisch, Anett Pfeiffer (2018/06//).

Its conservative management includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs, wrist and thumb immobilization, ultrasonic therapy (US Th.) and low level laser therapy (LLLT). Invasive methods include local injection of steroid in tendon sheath (inj. LHC) and surgery involving release of tendon sheath. Materials and Method: Sixty patients clinically diagnosed de Quervains tenosynovitis were included in the study and randomly assigned to two groups.The average age was 36 years (range: 21-45 years). One group was given LLLT + US Th. And other was injection LHC. The clinical criteria used were Finkelstein's test, tenderness over radial styloid (Ritchie's tenderness scale), grip strength, pain (visual analog scale [VAS]) and radiological criteria was ultrasonographic assessment of change in thickness of APL and EPB tendon sheath. They were measured before commencement and at the end of seven sessions of therapy, as per standard procedure. Results: Improvement was seen within both groups in the following outcome measures assessed: Ritchie's tenderness scale, grip strength and VAS. Finkelstein's test was significantly improved in inj.

Methods This study combines two quasi-experimental approaches to improve causal inference by better accounting for these biases: (i) linear fixed effects regression analysis and (ii) linear instrumental variable analysis. We extract 13 annual waves of national cohort data including 13 260 working-age (18–64 years) employees. The exposure variable is self-reported level of psychosocial job quality. The instruments used are two common workplace entitlements. The outcome variable is the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). We adjust for measured time-varying confounders. Results In the fixed effects regression analysis adjusted for time-varying confounders, a 1-point increase in psychosocial job quality is associated with a 1.28-point improvement in mental health on the MHI-5 scale (95% CI: 1.17, 1.40; P < 0.001). When the fixed effects was combined with the instrumental variable analysis, a 1-point increase psychosocial job quality is related to 1.62-point improvement on the MHI-5 scale (95% CI: −0.24, 3.48; P = 0.088).

To examine the correlates and odds of receiving overlapping benzodiazepine and opioid prescriptions and whether co-prescription was associated with greater odds of falling or visiting the emergency department. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. A large private integrated health system and a Veterans Health Administration integrated health system. Subjects. Five hundred seventeen adults with musculoskeletal pain and current prescriptions for long-term opioid therapy. Methods. A multivariate logistic regression model examined correlates of having overlapping benzodiazepine and opioid prescriptions in the year before enrollment in the cross-sectional study. Negative binomial models analyzed the number of falls in the past three months and past-year emergency department visits. In addition to propensity score adjustment, models controlled for demographic characteristics, psychiatric diagnoses, medications, overall comorbidity score, and opioid morphine equivalent dose. Results. Twenty-five percent (N=127) of participants had co-occurring benzodiazepine and opioid prescriptions in the prior year. Odds of receiving a benzodiazepine prescription were significantly higher among patients with the following psychiatric diagnoses: anxiety disorder (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=4.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.67�32, P<0.001), post-traumatic stress disorder (AOR=2.24, 95% CI = 1.14�38, P=0.019), and bipolar disorder (AOR=3.82, 95% CI = 1.49�81, P=0.005).

Two occupational therapists and one nurse received training in, and then delivered one of the three interventions. Qualitative feedback interviews with participants, and archived video recordings of intervention sessions were analysed thematically. Results Key features of each manualised intervention were evident in the online sessions and perceived by clients as enhancing engagement (for example, peer support and strategy training).

This study is a retrospective chart review undertaken in a single-community emergency department. During October and November 2015, emergency medicine pharmacists completed an educational initiative targeting medical and nursing staff designed to reduce prophylactic administration of ondansetron. The multifaceted educational initiative comprised of a link to an animated video, posters at strategic locations in the department, e-mail reminders, brief presentations during shift change, and 1-on-1 discussion (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvx8zKJBCCI). All patients who received IV morphine or hydromorphone during September and December 2015 were identified using pharmacy dispensing records, and 150 patients from each period were randomly selected for retrospective chart review. The primary outcome was the change in the proportion of prophylactic administration of ondansetron with IV opioids for acute pain in the emergency department. The proportion of patients administered prophylactic ondansetron decreased from 41% in the preintervention period to 26% in the postintervention period (difference 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.8 to 25.9, P = 0.005).

1392,"Accessible summary: What is known on the subject?: Mental health nurses are affected by interpersonal, practice‐related and organizational factors that can increase workplace stress and reduce their physical and mental health and well‐being. Resilience programmes are a strength‐based preventative approach to supporting individuals to overcome workplace adversities. What the paper adds to existing knowledge?: This qualitative inquiry is the first study to report mental health nurses' perspectives and experiences on a workplace resilience programme. Strengthening mental health nurses' resilience through a resilience programme involved a process of understanding resilience, and applying resilience strategies such as positive self‐talk, managing negative self‐talk, detaching from stressful situations, being aware of and managing emotions, and showing more empathy, to address workplace challenges. To address the range of resources needed to support mental health nurses' resilience, a social–ecological approach to workplace resilience can be used to promote resource provision at individual, work unit, organizational and professional levels. What are the implications for practice?: Resilience programmes are one resource for addressing the impacts of workplace stressors on mental health nurses. Organizational barriers and risks to staff well‐being need to also be addressed to build a resilient workforce. Incorporating resilience strategies into clinical supervision or reflective practice models may help sustain beneficial outcomes following a resilience programme and support resilient practice. Abstract: Introduction: Mental health settings are potentially high‐stress workplaces that can lead to nurses' poorer health and well‐being. Resilience programmes are a strengths‐based preventative approach for promoting mental health and well‐being in the face of adversity; however, there is no prior research on mental health nurses' perspectives on resilience programmes. Aim: To explore the perspectives of mental health nurses participating in a mental health service‐initiated resilience programme (Promoting Adult Resilience). Method: An exploratory qualitative inquiry was undertaken. Multiple qualitative data: open‐ended responses and semi‐structured interviews and focus groups, were thematically analysed. Results: Twenty‐nine registered nurses from a metropolitan mental health service participated. Four main themes were as follows: being confronted by adversity; reinforcing understandings of resilience; strengthening resilience; and applying resilience skills at work. Discussion: This is the first study to report mental health nurses' perspectives on a resilience programme. Resilience programmes can help improve nurses' self‐efficacy and ability to realistically appraise stressful situations and to moderate their emotional responses to others. Implications for practice: It is recommended resilience programmes are provided to promote nurses' well‐being and resilient practices. To build a resilient workforce, the wider barriers and risks to staff well‐being need to be addressed at a unit, organizational and professional level.","Kim Foster, Celeste Cuzzillo, Trentham Furness (2018/06//Jun-Aug2018).

1394,"Background: Facilitating return to work can be challenging due to the complexity of work disability. Few studies have examined rehabilitation programs based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy that intend to support return to work, and none have investigated therapists' experience with providing such programs. The aim of this study was therefore to explore therapists' experience of addressing the return to work process in an inpatient occupational rehabilitation program based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.Methods: This was a qualitative interview study supported by participant observation. Therapists were interviewed regarding their experiences with addressing return to work in an inpatient occupational rehabilitation program based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. In addition, the rehabilitation program was investigated through participant observation. The interviews were analysed according to Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis and informed by an analysis of field notes from the participant observation.Results: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy was experienced as a meaningful approach to facilitate return to work, as it allowed therapists to address all relevant aspects of the individual participant's life that might influence work participation. The therapists' twofold goal was to support participants in building both a meaningful life and sustainable work participation. To do so, they attempted to instil long-term and interrelated processes concerning ownership, causes of sick leave, relation to expectations, the values of work, and the scope of agency.Conclusion: Unfolding values connected to work participation might reconcile the tension between work and family life by integrating work with other areas of life. Providing work participation with personal meaning also seems especially commensurable with a context where economy presents a poor incentive for return to work. Therapists should, however, be attentive to the need to secure the prominence of return to work by relating participants' chosen themes explicitly to their return to work process. Therapists should also be aware of the dilemma that may arise when they attempt to refrain from providing advice while simultaneously encouraging actions they consider appropriate to facilitate sustainable work participation. In addition, having an individual-oriented approach to occupational rehabilitation may obscure the extent to which return to work is a multi-stakeholder process.","Nina E. Klevanger, Marius S.

Treatment may include physical interventions, such as exercise therapy, which was last reviewed in 2004., Objectives, The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy (ET) for patients with CFS as compared with any other intervention or control., Search methods, We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and SPORTDiscus up to May 2014 using a comprehensive list of free-text terms for CFS and exercise. We located unpublished or ongoing trials through the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to May 2014). We screened reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field for additional studies, Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials involving adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS who were able to participate in exercise therapy. Studies had to compare exercise therapy with passive control, psychological therapies, adaptive pacing therapy or pharmacological therapy., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessments and data extraction. We combined continuous measures of outcomes using mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs). We combined serious adverse reactions and drop-outs using risk ratios (RRs). We calculated an overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome., Main results, We have included eight randomised controlled studies and have reported data from 1518 participants in this review. Three studies diagnosed individuals with CFS using the 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); five used the Oxford criteria. Exercise therapy lasted from 12 to 26 weeks. Seven studies used variations of aerobic exercise therapy such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing provided at mixed levels in terms of intensity of the aerobic exercise from very low to quite rigorous, whilst one study used anaerobic exercise. Control groups consisted of passive control (eight studies; e.g. treatment as usual, relaxation, flexibility) or CBT (two studies), cognitive therapy (one study), supportive listening (one study), pacing (one study), pharmacological treatment (one study) and combination treatment (one study). Risk of bias varied across studies, but within each study, little variation was found in the risk of bias across our primary and secondary outcome measures., Authors' conclusions, Patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy, and no evidence suggests that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes. A positive effect with respect to sleep, physical function and self-perceived general health has been observed, but no conclusions for the outcomes of pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression, drop-out rate and health service resources were possible. The effectiveness of exercise therapy seems greater than that of pacing but similar to that of CBT. Randomised trials with low risk of bias are needed to investigate the type, duration and intensity of the most beneficial exercise intervention.","Lillebeth Larun, Kjetil G Brurberg, Jan Odgaard-Jensen, Jonathan R Price (#year#).

1396,"Background, This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane Review titled 'Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults', and considers only neuropathic pain (pain from damage to nervous tissue). Antiepileptic drugs have long been used in pain management. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug used in management of chronic pain conditions., Objectives, To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2009 to April 2018, online clinical trials registries, and reference lists., Selection criteria, We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and biases. Primary outcomes were: at least 30% pain intensity reduction over baseline; much or very much improved on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale (moderate benefit); at least 50% pain intensity reduction; or very much improved on PGIC (substantial benefit). We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE., Main results, We included 45 studies lasting 2 to 16 weeks, with 11,906 participants - 68% from 31 new studies. Oral pregabalin doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg daily were compared with placebo. Postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and mixed neuropathic pain predominated (85% of participants). High risk of bias was due mainly to small study size (nine studies), but many studies had unclear risk of bias, mainly due to incomplete outcome data, size, and allocation concealment., Authors' conclusions, Evidence shows efficacy of pregabalin in postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuralgia, and mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain, and absence of efficacy in HIV neuropathy; evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain is inadequate. Some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment. There were no substantial changes since the 2009 review.","Sheena Derry, Frances Rae Bell, Sebastian Straube, Philip J Wiffen, Dominic Aldington, Andrew R Moore (#year#).

1398,"Background, Peer support provides the opportunity for peers with experiential knowledge of a mental illness to give emotional, appraisal and informational assistance to current service users, and is becoming an important recovery-oriented approach in healthcare for people with mental illness., Objectives, To assess the effects of peer-support interventions for people with schizophrenia or other serious mental disorders, compared to standard care or other supportive or psychosocial interventions not from peers., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials on 27 July 2016 and 4 July 2017. There were no limitations regarding language, date, document type or publication status., Selection criteria, We selected all randomised controlled clinical studies involving people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other related serious mental illness that compared peer support to standard care or other psychosocial interventions and that did not involve 'peer' individual/group(s). We included studies that met our inclusion criteria and reported useable data. Our primary outcomes were service use and global state (relapse)., Data collection and analysis, The authors of this review complied with the Cochrane recommended standard of conduct for data screening and collection. Two review authors independently screened the studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion until the authors reached a consensus. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary data, and the mean difference and its 95% CI for continuous data. We used a random-effects model for analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach., Main results, This review included 13 studies with 2479 participants. All included studies compared peer support in addition to standard care with standard care alone. We had significant concern regarding risk of bias of included studies as over half had an unclear risk of bias for the majority of the risk domains (i.e. random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, attrition and selective reporting). Additional concerns regarding blinding of participants and outcome assessment, attrition and selective reporting were especially serious, as about a quarter of the included studies were at high risk of bias for these domains., Authors' conclusions, Currently, very limited data are available for the effects of peer support for people with schizophrenia. The risk of bias within trials is of concern and we were unable to use the majority of data reported in the included trials. In addition, the few that were available, were of very low quality. The current body of evidence is insufficient to either refute or support the use of peer-support interventions for people with schizophrenia and other mental illness.","Tong Wai Chien, Andrew V Clifton, Sai Zhao, Steve Lui (#year#).

1399,"This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:, The primary objective of this review is to determine the effectiveness of smoking reduction and cessation interventions (alone, or in combination with other interventions), delivered primarily in an outpatient or community-based setting among individuals with mental disorders, on rates of abstinence at the longest follow-up (minimum six months), mental health symptoms and adverse events., Secondary objectives are to examine the impact of such interventions on rates of abstinence at the end of the intervention, change in daily cigarette consumption, and quality-of-life or other function scores. We will explore (via subgroup analyses) potential differential effects on the basis of intervention type, control group type, recruitment setting (inpatient versus outpatient), mental disorder type, and motivation to quit at study intake., We may come across studies testing interventions which aim to increase the uptake of smoking interventions in people with a mental disorder. This may comprise interventions that either are incorporated into the system of delivering care, aimed at health professionals (e.g. within a community mental health facility), as well as interventions aimed directly at people with a mental disorder to increase uptake. In this case we aim to examine whether these interventions increase the uptake of the smoking cessation treatment among people with a mental disorder, as well as whether they ultimately result in increased quit rates.","Emily Stockings, Nicola Black, Kate M Bartlem, Alexandra P Metse, Tim Regan, Jacqueline M Bailey, Luke Wolfenden, John Wiggers, Jennifer A Bowman (#year#).

1400,"Background, Brain tumours can cause significant disability, which may be amenable to multidisciplinary rehabilitation. However, the evidence base for this is unclear. This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [2013, Issue 1, Art. No. CD009509] on 'Multidisciplinary rehabilitation after primary brain tumour treatment'., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in people after primary brain tumour treatment, especially the types of approaches that are effective (settings, intensity)., Search methods, For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library up to Issue 12 of 12, 2014), MEDLINE (1950 to January week 2, 2015), EMBASE (1980 to January week 2, 2015), PEDro (1985 to January week 2 2015), and LILACS (1982 to January week 2, 2015). We checked the bibliographies of papers we identified and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to seek published and unpublished trials., Selection criteria, Controlled clinical trials (randomised and non-randomised clinical trials) that compared multidisciplinary rehabilitation in primary brain tumour with either routinely available local services or lower levels of intervention, or studies that compared multidisciplinary rehabilitation in different settings or at different levels of intensity., Data collection and analysis, Three review authors independently assessed study quality, extracted data, and performed a 'best evidence' synthesis based on methodological quality., Main results, We did not identify any studies for inclusion in the previous version of this review. For this update, the literature search identified one low-quality controlled clinical trial involving 106 participants. The findings from this study suggest 'low-level' evidence to support high-intensity ambulatory (outpatient) multidisciplinary rehabilitation in reducing short- and long-term motor disability (continence, mobility and locomotion, cognition), when compared with standard outpatient care. We found improvement in some domains of disability (continence, communication) and psychosocial gains were maintained at six months follow-up. We found no evidence for improvement in overall participation (quality of life and societal relationship). No adverse events were reported as a result of multidisciplinary rehabilitation. We found no evidence for improvement in quality of life or cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation. It was also not possible to suggest best 'dose' of therapy., Authors' conclusions, Since the last version of this review, one new study has been identified for inclusion. The best evidence to date comes from this CCT, which provides low quality evidence that higher intensity ambulatory (outpatient) multidisciplinary rehabilitation reduces short- and long-term disability in people with brain tumour compared with standard outpatient care. Our conclusions are tentative at best, given gaps in current research in this area. Although the strength of evidence has increased with the identification of a new controlled clinical trial in this updated review, further research is needed into appropriate and robust study designs; outcome measurement; caregiver needs; evaluation of optimal settings; type, intensity, duration of therapy; and cost-effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in the brain tumour population.","Fary Khan, Bhasker Amatya, Louisa Ng, Kate Drummond, Mary Galea (#year#).

1401,"Background, Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Diagnosis and treatment may drastically affect quality of life, causing symptoms such as sleep disorders, depression and anxiety. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a programme that aims to reduce stress by developing mindfulness, meaning a non-judgmental, accepting moment-by-moment awareness. MBSR seems to benefit patients with mood disorders and chronic pain, and it may also benefit women with breast cancer., Objectives, To assess the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in women diagnosed with breast cancer., Search methods, In April 2018, we conducted a comprehensive electronic search for studies of MBSR in women with breast cancer, in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries (World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov). We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings., Selection criteria, Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing MBSR versus no intervention in women with breast cancer., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Using a standardised data form, the review authors extracted data in duplicate on methodological quality, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest (quality of life, fatigue, depression, anxiety, quality of sleep, overall survival and adverse events). For outcomes assessed with the same instrument, we used the mean difference (MD) as a summary statistic for meta-analysis; for those assessed with different instruments, we used the standardised mean difference (SMD). The effect of MBSR was assessed in the short term (end of intervention), medium term (up to 6 months after intervention) and long term (up to 24 months after intervention)., Main results, Fourteen RCTs fulfilled our inclusion criteria, with most studies reporting that they included women with early breast cancer. Ten RCTs involving 1571 participants were eligible for meta-analysis, while four studies involving 185 participants did not report usable results. Queries to the authors of these four studies were unsuccessful. All studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias since participants could not be blinded, and only 3 of 14 studies were at low risk of selection bias. Eight of 10 studies included in the meta-analysis recruited participants with early breast cancer (the remaining 2 trials did not restrict inclusion to a certain cancer type). Most trials considered only women who had completed cancer treatment., Authors' conclusions, MBSR may improve quality of life slightly at the end of the intervention but may result in little to no difference later on. MBSR probably slightly reduces anxiety, depression and slightly improves quality of sleep at both the end of the intervention and up to six months later. A beneficial effect on fatigue was apparent at the end of the intervention but not up to six months later. Up to two years after the intervention, MBSR probably results in little to no difference in anxiety and depression; there were no data available for fatigue or quality of sleep.","Lisa K Schell, Ina Monsef, Achim Wockel, Nicole Skoetz (#year#).

1402,"Background, Bipolar disorder is a common condition associated with high morbidity; developing efficacious, safe treatments is therefore essential. Lithium is an effective maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. It acts as mood stabiliser and reduces the risk of suicide. However, evidence assessing the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of acute mania is less robust. Current evidence-based guidelines cite multiple anti-dopaminergic and mood-stabilising agents as initial treatments: more definite evidence is needed to decide if lithium should be the first-line therapy., Objectives, 1. To assess the effects of lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatment in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder., 2. To review the acceptability and tolerability of treatment with lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatments in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We also searched the World Health Organization trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have incorporated studies from searches to 18 May 2018 into the current analyses., Selection criteria, Prospective randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo or alternative drug treatment in treatment of acute mania. We included anyone with bipolar disorder, male and female, of any age., Data collection and analysis, At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We used odds ratios (ORs) to analyse binary efficacy outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuously distributed outcomes. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was moderate or substantial, in which case we used a random-effects model. We used Review Manager 5 to analyse data. We assessed the certainty of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach., Main results, We found 36 randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo, one of 12 drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of acute mania. Studies included male and female participants (n = 4220), of all ages, who all fitted criteria for a manic episode within the context of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder., Authors' conclusions, This systematic review indicates that lithium is more effective than placebo as a treatment for acute mania but increases the risk for somnolence and tremor. Limited evidence suggests little or no difference between lithium and other mood stabilisers (valproate, carbamazepine) or antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, haloperidol). Olanzapine may be an exception, as it is probably slightly more effective than lithium. There is uncertain evidence that risperidone may also be more effective than lithium. Lithium is probably more effective at treating acute mania than topiramate. When compared to placebo, lithium was more likely to cause adverse events. However, when compared to other drugs, too few studies provided data on adverse effects to provide high-certainty evidence. More, rigorously designed, large-scale studies are needed to definitively conclude if lithium is superior to other interventions in treating acute mania.","Rebecca F McKnight, J.G.N.

1403,"Background, Visual field defects are estimated to affect 20% to 57% of people who have had a stroke. Visual field defects can affect functional ability in activities of daily living (commonly affecting mobility, reading and driving), quality of life, ability to participate in rehabilitation, and depression and anxiety following stroke. There are many interventions for visual field defects, which are proposed to work by restoring the visual field (restitution); compensating for the visual field defect by changing behaviour or activity (compensation); substituting for the visual field defect by using a device or extraneous modification (substitution); or ensuring appropriate diagnosis, referral and treatment prescription through standardised assessment or screening, or both., Objectives, To determine the effects of interventions for people with visual field defects after stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, and PDQT Databse, and clinical trials databases, including ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO Clinical Trials Registry, to May 2018. We also searched reference lists and trials registers, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts., Selection criteria, Randomised trials in adults after stroke, where the intervention was specifically targeted at improving the visual field defect or improving the ability of the participant to cope with the visual field loss. The primary outcome was functional ability in activities of daily living and secondary outcomes included functional ability in extended activities of daily living, reading ability, visual field measures, balance, falls, depression and anxiety, discharge destination or residence after stroke, quality of life and social isolation, visual scanning, adverse events, and death., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook an assessment of methodological quality for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, method of dealing with missing data, and other potential sources of bias. We assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach., Main results, Twenty studies (732 randomised participants, with data for 547 participants with stroke) met the inclusion criteria for this review. However, only 10 of these studies compared the effect of an intervention with a placebo, control, or no treatment group, and eight had data which could be included in meta-analyses. Only two of these eight studies presented data relating to our primary outcome of functional abilities in activities of daily living. One study reported evidence relating to adverse events., Authors' conclusions, There is a lack of evidence relating to the effect of interventions on our primary outcome of functional ability in activities of daily living. There is limited low-quality evidence that compensatory scanning training may be more beneficial than placebo or control at improving quality of life, but not other outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to reach any generalised conclusions about the effect of restitutive interventions or substitutive interventions (prisms) as compared to placebo, control, or no treatment. There is low-quality evidence that prisms may cause minor adverse events.","Alex Pollock, Christine Hazelton, Fiona J Rowe, Sven Jonuscheit, Ashleigh Kernohan, Jayne Angilley, Clair A Henderson, Peter Langhorne, Pauline Campbell (#year#).

1404,"Background, Oral poisoning is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide, with estimates of over 100,000 deaths due to unintentional poisoning each year and an overrepresentation of children below five years of age. Any effective intervention that laypeople can apply to limit or delay uptake or to evacuate, dilute or neutralize the poison before professional help arrives may limit toxicity and save lives., Objectives, To assess the effects of pre-hospital interventions (alone or in combination) for treating acute oral poisoning, available to and feasible for laypeople before the arrival of professional help., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and three clinical trials registries to 4 December 2018, and we also carried out reference checking and citation searching., Selection criteria, We included randomized controlled trials comparing interventions (alone or in combination) that are feasible in a pre-hospital setting for treating acute oral poisoning patients, including but potentially not limited to activated charcoal (AC), emetics, cathartics, diluents, neutralizing agents and body positioning., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently performed study selection, data collection and assessment. Primary outcomes of this review were incidence of mortality and adverse events, plus incidence and severity of symptoms of poisoning. Secondary outcomes were duration of symptoms of poisoning, drug absorption, and incidence of hospitalization and ICU admission., Main results, We included 24 trials involving 7099 participants. Using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, we assessed no study as being at low risk of bias for all domains. Many studies were poorly reported, so the risk of selection and detection biases were often unclear. Most studies reported important outcomes incompletely, and we judged them to be at high risk of reporting bias., Authors' conclusions, The studies included in this review provided mostly low- or very low-certainty evidence about the use of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning. A key limitation was the fact that only one included study actually took place in a pre-hospital setting, which undermines our confidence in the applicability of these results to this setting. Thus, the amount of evidence collected was insufficient to draw any conclusions.","Bert Avau, Vere Borra, Anne-Catherine Vanhove, Philippe Vandekerckhove, Peter De Paepe, Emmy De Buck (#year#).

1405,"Background, Alcohol use in young people is a risk factor for a range of short- and long-term harms and is a cause of concern for health services, policy-makers, youth workers, teachers, and parents., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of universal, selective, and indicated family-based prevention programmes in preventing alcohol use or problem drinking in school-aged children (up to 18 years of age)., Search methods, We identified relevant evidence from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid 1966 to June 2018), Embase (1988 to June 2018), Education Resource Information Center (ERIC; EBSCOhost; 1966 to June 2018), PsycINFO (Ovid 1806 to June 2018), and Google Scholar. We also searched clinical trial registers and handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and the included studies., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs (C-RCTs) involving the parents of school-aged children who were part of the general population with no known risk factors (universal interventions), were at elevated risk of alcohol use or problem drinking (selective interventions), or were already consuming alcohol (indicated interventions). Psychosocial or educational interventions involving parents with or without involvement of children were compared with no intervention, or with alternate (e.g. child only) interventions, allowing experimental isolation of parent components., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane., Main results, We included 46 studies (39,822 participants), with 27 classified as universal, 12 as selective, and seven as indicated. We performed meta-analyses according to outcome, including studies reporting on the prevalence, frequency, or volume of alcohol use. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low, and there was high, unexplained heterogeneity., Authors' conclusions, The results of this review indicate that there are no clear benefits of family-based programmes for alcohol use among young people. Patterns differ slightly across outcomes, but overall, the variation, heterogeneity, and number of analyses performed preclude any conclusions about intervention effects. Additional independent studies are required to strengthen the evidence and clarify the marginal effects observed.","Conor Gilligan, Luke Wolfenden, David R Foxcroft, Amanda J Williams, Melanie Kingsland, Rebecca K Hodder, Emily Stockings, Tameka-Rae McFadyen, Jenny Tindall, Shauna Sherker, Julie Rae, John Wiggers (#year#).

1406,"Background, Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves the induction of a seizure by the administration of an electrical stimulus via electrodes usually placed bilaterally on the scalp and was introduced as a treatment for schizophrenia in 1938. However, ECT is a controversial treatment with concerns about long-term side effects such a memory loss. Therefore, it is important to determine its clinical efficacy and safety for people with schizophrenia who are not responding to their treatment., Objectives, Our primary objective was to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of ECT for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials including clinical trial registries on 9 September 2015 and 4 August 2017. There were no limitations on language, date, document type, or publication status for the inclusion of records in the register. We also inspected references of all the included records to identify further relevant studies., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of ECT in people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between the groups and its 95% CIs. We employed the fixed-effect model for all analyses. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using the GRADE framework., Main results, We included 15 studies involving 1285 participants (1264 completers with an average age of 18 to 46 years) with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. We rated most studies (14/15, 93.3%) as at high risk of bias due to issues related to the blinding of participants and personnel. Our main outcomes of interest were: (i) clinically important response to treatment; (ii) clinically important change in cognitive functioning; (iii) leaving the study early; (iv) clinically important change in general mental state; (v) clinically important change in general functioning; (vi) number hospitalised; and (vii) death. No trial reported data on death., Authors' conclusions, Moderate-quality evidence indicates that relative to standard care, ECT has a positive effect on medium-term clinical response for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, there is no clear and convincing advantage or disadvantage for adding ECT to standard care for other outcomes. The available evidence was also too weak to indicate whether adding ECT to standard care is superior or inferior to adding sham-ECT or other antipsychotics to standard care, and there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ECT alone. More good-quality evidence is needed before firm conclusions can be made.","JM Diarmid Sinclair, Sai Zhao, Fang Qi, Kazare Nyakyoma, SW Joey Kwong, Clive E Adams (#year#).

1407,"Background, Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes to ease the transition from cigarette smoking to abstinence. It works by reducing the intensity of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Although there is clear evidence that NRT used after smoking cessation is effective, it is unclear whether higher doses, longer durations of treatment, or using NRT before cessation add to its effectiveness., Objectives, To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to one another., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, and trial registries for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search: April 2018., Selection criteria, Randomized trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Trials comparing NRT to control, and trials comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered elsewhere., Data collection and analysis, We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking abstinence was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and study withdrawals due to treatment. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model., Main results, We identified 63 trials with 41,509 participants. Most recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. We judged 24 of the 63 studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results, apart from in the case of the preloading comparison. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36, 14 studies, 11,356 participants; I(superscript 2) = 4%). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, 5 studies, 1655 participants; I(superscript 2) = 38%), and that 21 mg are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08, 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence (again limited by imprecision) also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41, 3 studies, 3446 participants; I(superscript 2) = 0%). Five studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I(superscript 2) = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit. Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward; there was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, 9 studies, 4395 participants; I(superscript 2) = 0%). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05, 8 studies, 3319 participants; I(superscript 2) = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast-acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuing patch use on lapse; and participant- versus clinician-selected NRT. However, in most cases these findings are based on very low- or low-certainty evidence, and are the findings from single studies., Authors' conclusions, There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking. For patch dose comparisons, evidence was of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Twenty-one mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches, and using 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than using 15 mg (16-hour) patches, although in the latter case the CI included one. There was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT prior to quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is of low and very low certainty. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are both measured and reported.","Nicola Lindson, Samantha C Chepkin, Weiyu Ye, Thomas R Fanshawe, Chris Bullen, Jamie Hartmann-Boyce (#year#).

1408,"Background, Unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition that affects muscle control and function on one side of the body. Children with unilateral CP experience difficulties using their hands together secondary to disturbances that occur in the developing fetal or infant brain. Often, the more affected limb is disregarded. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) aims to increase use of the more affected upper limb and improve bimanual performance. CIMT is based on two principles: restraining the use of the less affected limb (for example, using a splint, mitt or sling) and intensive therapeutic practice of the more affected limb., Objectives, To evaluate the effect of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) in the treatment of the more affected upper limb in children with unilateral CP., Search methods, In March 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro, OTseeker, five other databases and three trials registers. We also ran citation searches, checked reference lists, contacted experts, handsearched key journals and searched using Google Scholar., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs or clinically controlled trials implemented with children with unilateral CP, aged between 0 and 19 years, where CIMT was compared with a different form of CIMT, or a low dose, high-dose or dose-matched alternative form of upper-limb intervention such as bimanual intervention. Primarily, outcomes were bimanual performance, unimanual capacity and manual ability. Secondary outcomes included measures of self-care, body function, participation and quality of life., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts to eliminate ineligible studies. Five review authors were paired to extract data and assess risk of bias in each included study. GRADE assessments were undertaken by two review authors., Main results, We included 36 trials (1264 participants), published between 2004 and 2018. Sample sizes ranged from 11 to 105 (mean 35). Mean age was 5.96 years (standard deviation (SD) 1.82), range three months to 19.8 years; 53% male and 47% participants had left hemiplegia. Fifty-seven outcome measures were used across studies. Average length of CIMT programs was four weeks (range one to 10 weeks). Frequency of sessions ranged from twice weekly to seven days per week. Duration of intervention sessions ranged from 0.5 to eight hours per day. The mean total number of hours of CIMT provided was 137 hours (range 20 to 504 hours). The most common constraint devices were a mitt/glove or a sling (11 studies each)., Authors' conclusions, The quality of evidence for all conclusions was low to very low. For children with unilateral CP, there was some evidence that CIMT resulted in improved bimanual performance and unimanual capacity when compared to a low-dose comparison, but not when compared to a high-dose or dose-matched comparison. Based on the evidence available, CIMT appears to be safe for children with CP.","Brian J Hoare, Margaret A Wallen, Megan N Thorley, Michelle L Jackman, Leeanne M Carey, Christine Imms (#year#).

1409,"Background, Cognitive impairment, a defining feature of dementia, plays an important role in the compromised functional independence that characterises the condition. Cognitive training (CT) is an approach that uses guided practice on structured tasks with the direct aim of improving or maintaining cognitive abilities., Objectives, * To assess effects of CT on cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers., Search methods, We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, on 5 July 2018. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified through monthly searches of several major healthcare databases and numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. In addition to this, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's trials portal, ICTRP, to ensure that searches were comprehensive and up-to-date., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that described interventions for people with mild to moderate dementia and compared CT versus a control or alternative intervention., Data collection and analysis, We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and through contact with trial authors if required. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We divided comparison conditions into active or passive control conditions and alternative treatments. We used a large number of measures and data to evaluate 19 outcomes at end of treatment, as well as 16 outcomes at follow-up in the medium term; we pooled this information in meta-analyses. We calculated pooled estimates of treatment effect using a random-effects model, and we estimated statistical heterogeneity using a standard Chi[superscript digit two] statistic. We graded the evidence using GradePro., Main results, The 33 included trials were published between 1988 and 2018 and were conducted in 12 countries; most were unregistered, parallel-group, single-site RCTs, with samples ranging from 12 to 653 participants. Interventions were between two and 104 weeks long. We classified most experimental interventions as 'straight CT', but we classified some as 'augmented CT', and about two-thirds as multi-domain interventions. Researchers investigated 18 passive and 13 active control conditions, along with 15 alternative treatment conditions, including occupational therapy, mindfulness, reminiscence therapy, and others., Authors' conclusions, Relative to a control intervention, but not to a variety of alternative treatments, CT is probably associated with small to moderate positive effects on global cognition and verbal semantic fluency at end of treatment, and these benefits appear to be maintained in the medium term. Our certainty in relation to many of these findings is low or very low. Future studies should take stronger measures to mitigate well-established risks of bias, and should provide long-term follow-up to improve our understanding of the extent to which observed gains are retained. Future trials should also focus on direct comparison of CT versus alternative treatments rather than passive or active control conditions.","Alex Bahar-Fuchs, Anthony Martyr, MY Anita Goh, Julieta Sabates, Linda Clare (#year#).

1410,"Background, Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychosocial treatment that aims to help individuals re-evaluate their appraisals of their experiences that can affect their level of distress and problematic behaviour. CBT is now recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as an add-on treatment for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Other psychosocial therapies that are often less expensive are also available as an add-on treatment for people with schizophrenia. This review is also part of a family of Cochrane Reviews on CBT for people with schizophrenia., Objectives, To assess the effects of CBT compared with other psychosocial therapies as add-on treatments for people with schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study Based Register of Trials (latest 6 March, 2017). This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register., Selection criteria, We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with schizophrenia who were randomly allocated to receive, in addition to their standard care, either CBT or any other psychosocial therapy. Outcomes of interest included relapse, global state, mental state, adverse events, social functioning, quality of life and satisfaction with treatment. We included trials meeting our inclusion criteria and reporting useable data., Data collection and analysis, We reliably screened references and selected trials. Review authors, working independently, assessed trials for methodological quality and extracted data from included studies. We analysed dichotomous data on an intention-to-treat basis and continuous data with 60% completion rate. Where possible, for binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR), for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed-effect model for analyses unless there was unexplained high heterogeneity. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce a 'Summary of findings' table for our main outcomes of interest., Main results, The review now includes 36 trials with 3542 participants, comparing CBT with a range of other psychosocial therapies that we classified as either active (A) (n = 14) or non active (NA) (n = 14). Trials were often small and at high or unclear risk of bias. When CBT was compared with other psychosocial therapies, no difference in long-term relapse was observed (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; participants = 375; studies = 5, low-quality evidence). Clinically important change in global state data were not available but data for rehospitalisation were reported. Results showed no clear difference in long term rehospitalisation (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.14; participants = 943; studies = 8, low-quality evidence) nor in long term mental state (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.01; participants = 249; studies = 4, low-quality evidence). No long-term differences were observed for death (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.98; participants = 627; studies = 6, low-quality evidence). Only average endpoint scale scores were available for social functioning and quality of life. Social functioning scores were similar between groups (long term Social Functioning Scale (SFS): MD 8.80, 95% CI -4.07 to 21.67; participants = 65; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence), and quality of life scores were also similar (medium term Modular System for Quality of Life (MSQOL): MD -4.50, 95% CI -15.66 to 6.66; participants = 64; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). There was a modest but clear difference favouring CBT for satisfaction with treatment - measured as leaving the study early (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; participants = 2392; studies = 26, low quality evidence)., Authors' conclusions, Evidence based on data from randomised controlled trials indicates there is no clear and convincing advantage for cognitive behavioural therapy over other - and sometimes much less sophisticated and expensive - psychosocial therapies for people with schizophrenia. It should be noted that although much research has been carried out in this area, the quality of evidence available is mainly low or of very low quality. Good quality research is needed before firm conclusions can be made.","Christopher Jones, David Hacker, Alan Meaden, Irene Cormac, Claire B Irving, Jun Xia, Sai Zhao, Chunhu Shi, Jue Chen (#year#).

1411,"Background, Telephone services can provide information and support for smokers. Counselling may be provided proactively or offered reactively to callers to smoking cessation helplines., Objectives, To evaluate the effect of telephone support to help smokers quit, including proactive or reactive counselling, or the provision of other information to smokers calling a helpline., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, clinicaltrials.gov, and the ICTRP for studies of telephone counselling, using search terms including 'hotlines' or 'quitline' or 'helpline'. Date of the most recent search: May 2018., Selection criteria, Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials which offered proactive or reactive telephone counselling to smokers to assist smoking cessation., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We pooled studies using a random-effects model and assessed statistical heterogeneity amongst subgroups of clinically comparable studies using the I(superscript 2) statistic. In trials including smokers who did not call a quitline, we used meta-regression to investigate moderation of the effect of telephone counselling by the planned number of calls in the intervention, trial selection of participants that were motivated to quit, and the baseline support provided together with telephone counselling (either self-help only, brief face-to-face intervention, pharmacotherapy, or financial incentives)., Main results, We identified 104 trials including 111,653 participants that met the inclusion criteria. Participants were mostly adult smokers from the general population, but some studies included teenagers, pregnant women, and people with long-term or mental health conditions. Most trials (58.7%) were at high risk of bias, while 30.8% were at unclear risk, and only 11.5% were at low risk of bias for all domains assessed. Most studies (100/104) assessed proactive telephone counselling, as opposed to reactive forms., Authors' conclusions, There is moderate-certainty evidence that proactive telephone counselling aids smokers who seek help from quitlines, and moderate-certainty evidence that proactive telephone counselling increases quit rates in smokers in other settings. There is currently insufficient evidence to assess potential variations in effect from differences in the number of contacts, type or timing of telephone counselling, or when telephone counselling is provided as an adjunct to other smoking cessation therapies. Evidence was inconclusive on the effect of reactive telephone counselling, due to a limited number studies, which reflects the difficulty of studying this intervention.","William Matkin, M.

1412,"Background, A number of treatments can help smokers make a successful quit attempt, but many initially successful quitters relapse over time. Several interventions have been proposed to help prevent relapse., Objectives, To assess whether specific interventions for relapse prevention reduce the proportion of recent quitters who return to smoking., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, clinicaltrials.gov, and the ICTRP in February 2018 for studies mentioning relapse prevention or maintenance in their title, abstracts, or keywords., Selection criteria, Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of relapse prevention interventions with a minimum follow-up of six months. We included smokers who quit on their own, were undergoing enforced abstinence, or were participating in treatment programmes. We included studies that compared relapse prevention interventions with a no intervention control, or that compared a cessation programme with additional relapse prevention components with a cessation programme alone., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane., Main results, We included 77 studies (67,285 participants), 15 of which are new to this update. We judged 21 studies to be at high risk of bias, 51 to be at unclear risk of bias, and five studies to be at low risk of bias. Forty-eight studies included abstainers, and 29 studies helped people to quit and then tested treatments to prevent relapse. Twenty-six studies focused on special populations who were abstinent because of pregnancy (18 studies), hospital admission (five studies), or military service (three studies). Most studies used behavioural interventions that tried to teach people skills to cope with the urge to smoke, or followed up with additional support. Some studies tested extended pharmacotherapy., Authors' conclusions, Behavioural interventions that teach people to recognise situations that are high risk for relapse along with strategies to cope with them provided no worthwhile benefit in preventing relapse in assisted abstainers, although unexplained statistical heterogeneity means we are only moderately certain of this. In people who have successfully quit smoking using pharmacotherapy, there were mixed results regarding extending pharmacotherapy for longer than is standard. Extended treatment with varenicline helped to prevent relapse; evidence for the effect estimate was of moderate certainty, limited by unexplained statistical heterogeneity. Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, did not detect a benefit from extended treatment with bupropion, though confidence intervals mean we could not rule out a clinically important benefit at this stage. Low-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, did not show a benefit of extended treatment with nicotine replacement therapy in preventing relapse in assisted abstainers. More research is needed in this area, especially as the evidence for extended nicotine replacement therapy in unassisted abstainers did suggest a benefit.","Jonathan Livingstone-Banks, Emma Norris, Jamie Hartmann-Boyce, Robert West, Martin Jarvis, Peter Hajek (#year#).

1413,"Background, Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major cause of chronic, neurological disability, with a significant long-term disability burden, often requiring comprehensive rehabilitation., Objectives, To systematically evaluate evidence from published Cochrane Reviews of clinical trials to summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of rehabilitation interventions for people with MS (pwMS), to improve patient outcomes, and to highlight current gaps in knowledge., Methods, We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews up to December 2017, to identify Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effectiveness of organised rehabilitation interventions for pwMS. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of included reviews, using the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (R-AMSTAR) tool, and the quality of the evidence for reported outcomes, using the GRADE framework., Main results, Overall, we included 15 reviews published in the Cochrane Library, comprising 164 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and four controlled clinical trials, with a total of 10,396 participants. The included reviews evaluated a wide range of rehabilitation interventions, including: physical activity and exercise therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), whole-body vibration, occupational therapy, cognitive and psychological interventions, nutritional and dietary supplements, vocational rehabilitation, information provision, telerehabilitation, and interventions for the management of spasticity. We assessed all reviews to be of high to moderate methodological quality, based on R-AMSTAR criteria., Authors' conclusions, The evidence suggests that regular specialist evaluation and follow-up to assess the needs of patients with all types of MS for appropriate rehabilitation interventions may be of benefit, although the certainty of evidence varies across the different types of interventions evaluated by the reviews. Structured, multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes and physical therapy (exercise or physical activities) can improve functional outcomes (mobility, muscle strength, aerobic capacity), and quality of life. Overall, the evidence for many rehabilitation interventions should be interpreted cautiously, as the majority of included reviews did not include data from current studies. More studies, with appropriate design, which report the type and intensity of modalities and their cost-effectiveness are needed to address the current gaps in knowledge.","Bhasker Amatya, Fary Khan, Mary Galea (#year#).

1414,"Background, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been recognised as a global health concern, and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Projections of the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that prevalence rates of COPD continue to increase, and by 2030, it will become the world's third leading cause of death. Depression is a major comorbidity amongst patients with COPD, with an estimate prevalence of up to 80% in severe stages of COPD. Prevalence studies show that patients who have COPD are four times as likely to develop depression compared to those without COPD. Regrettably, they rarely receive appropriate treatment for COPD-related depression. Available findings from trials indicate that untreated depression is associated with worse compliance with medical treatment, poor quality of life, increased mortality rates, increased hospital admissions and readmissions, prolonged length of hospital stay, and subsequently, increased costs to the healthcare system. Given the burden and high prevalence of untreated depression, it is important to evaluate and update existing experimental evidence using rigorous methodology, and to identify effective psychological therapies for patients with COPD-related depression., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies for the treatment of depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2018, Issue 11), and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from June 2016 to 26 November 2018. Previously these databases were searched via the Cochrane Airways and Common Mental Disorders Groups' Specialised Trials Registers (all years to June 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to 26 November 2018 to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Additionally, the grey literature databases and the reference lists of studies initially identified for full-text screening were also searched., Selection criteria, Eligible for inclusion were randomised controlled trials that compared the use of psychological therapies with either no intervention, education, or combined with a co-intervention and compared with the same co-intervention in a population of patients with COPD whose depressive symptoms were measured before or at baseline assessment., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts identified by the search to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. We assessed two primary outcomes: depressive symptoms and adverse events; and the following secondary outcomes: quality of life, dyspnoea, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(subscript 1)), exercise tolerance, hospital length of stay or readmission rate, and cost-effectiveness. Potentially eligible full-text articles were also independently assessed by two review authors. A PRISMA flow diagram was prepared to demonstrate the decision process in detail. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' evaluation tool to examine the risk of bias, and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. All outcomes were continuous, therefore, we calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We used a random-effects model to calculate treatment effects., Main results, The findings are based on 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a total of 1500 participants. In some of the included studies, the investigators did not recruit participants with clinically confirmed depression but applied screening criteria after randomisation. Hence, across the studies, baseline scores for depressive symptoms varied from no symptoms to severe depression. The severity of COPD across the studies was moderate to severe., Authors' conclusions, The findings from this review indicate that psychological therapies (using a CBT-based approach) may be effective for treating COPD-related depression, but the evidence is limited. Depressive symptoms improved more in the intervention groups compared to: 1) no intervention (attention placebo or standard care), 2) educational interventions, and 3) a co-intervention (pulmonary rehabilitation). However, the effect sizes were small and quality of the evidence very low due to clinical heterogeneity and risk of bias. This means that more experimental studies with larger numbers of participants are needed, to confirm the potential beneficial effects of therapies with a CBT approach for COPD-related depression.","Justyna Pollok, EM Joep van Agteren, Adrian J Esterman, Kristin V Carson-Chahhoud (#year#).

1415,"Background, People with coronary heart disease (CHD) often require prolonged absences from work to convalesce after acute disease events like myocardial infarctions (MI) or revascularisation procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Reduced functional capacity and anxiety due to CHD may further delay or prevent return to work., Objectives, To assess the effects of person- and work-directed interventions aimed at enhancing return to work in patients with coronary heart disease compared to usual care or no intervention., Search methods, We searched the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, NIOSHTIC, NIOSHTIC-2, HSELINE, CISDOC, and LILACS through 11 October 2018. We also searched the US National Library of Medicine registry, clinicaltrials.gov, to identify ongoing studies., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining return to work among people with CHD who were provided either an intervention or usual care. Selected studies included only people treated for MI or who had undergone either a CABG or PCI. At least 80% of the study population should have been working prior to the CHD and not at the time of the trial, or study authors had to have considered a return-to-work subgroup. We included studies in all languages. Two review authors independently selected the studies and consulted a third review author to resolve disagreements., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors extracted data and independently assessed the risk of bias. We conducted meta-analyses of rates of return to work and time until return to work. We considered the secondary outcomes, health-related quality of life and adverse events among studies where at least 80% of study participants were eligible to return to work., Main results, We found 39 RCTs (including one cluster- and four three-armed RCTs). We included the return-to-work results of 34 studies in the meta-analyses., Authors' conclusions, Combined interventions may increase return to work up to six months and probably reduce the time away from work. Otherwise, we found no evidence of either a beneficial or harmful effect of person-directed interventions. The certainty of the evidence for the various interventions and outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. Return to work was typically a secondary outcome of the studies, and as such, the results pertaining to return to work were often poorly reported. Adhering to RCT reporting guidelines could greatly improve the evidence of future research. A research gap exists regarding controlled trials of work-directed interventions, health-related quality of life within the return-to-work process, and adverse effects.","Janice Hegewald, Uta E Wegewitz, Ulrike Euler, Jaap L van Dijk, Jenny Adams, Alba Fishta, Philipp Heinrich, Andreas Seidler (#year#).

1416,"Background, International clinical practice guidelines routinely recommend that cardiac patients participate in rehabilitation programmes for comprehensive secondary prevention. However, data show that only a small proportion of these patients utilise rehabilitation., Objectives, First, to assess interventions provided to increase patient enrolment in, adherence to, and completion of cardiac rehabilitation. Second, to assess intervention costs and associated harms, as well as interventions intended to promote equitable CR utilisation in vulnerable patient subpopulations., Search methods, Review authors performed a search on 10 July 2018, to identify studies published since publication of the previous systematic review. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) databases (Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)), in the Cochrane Library (Wiley); MEDLINE (Ovid); Embase (Elsevier); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCOhost); and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) on Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics). We checked the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews for additional studies and also searched two clinical trial registers. We applied no language restrictions., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with myocardial infarction, with angina, undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention, or with heart failure who were eligible for cardiac rehabilitation. Interventions had to aim to increase utilisation of comprehensive phase II cardiac rehabilitation. We included only studies that measured one or more of our primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were harms and costs, and we focused on equity., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified references for eligibility, and we obtained full papers of potentially relevant trials. Two review authors independently considered these trials for inclusion, assessed included studies for risk of bias, and extracted trial data independently. We resolved disagreements through consultation with a third review author. We performed random-effects meta-regression for each outcome and explored prespecified study characteristics., Main results, Overall, we included 26 studies with 5299 participants (29 comparisons). Participants were primarily male (64.2%). Ten (38.5%) studies included patients with heart failure. We assessed most studies as having low or unclear risk of bias. Sixteen studies (3164 participants) reported interventions to improve enrolment in cardiac rehabilitation, 11 studies (2319 participants) reported interventions to improve adherence to cardiac rehabilitation, and seven studies (1567 participants) reported interventions to increase programme completion. Researchers tested a variety of interventions to increase utilisation of cardiac rehabilitation. In many studies, this consisted of contacts made by a healthcare provider during or shortly after an acute care hospitalisation., Authors' conclusions, Interventions may increase cardiac rehabilitation enrolment, adherence and completion; however the quality of evidence was low to moderate due to heterogeneity of the interventions used, among other factors. Effects on enrolment were larger in studies targeting healthcare providers, training nurses, or allied healthcare providers to intervene face-to-face; effects on adherence were larger in studies that tested remote interventions. More research is needed, particularly to discover the best ways to increase programme completion.","Carolina Santiago de Araujo Pio, SS Gabriela Chaves, Philippa Davies, Rod S Taylor, Sherry L Grace (#year#).

1417,"Background, Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterised by a failure to maintain a normal body weight due to a paucity of nutrition, an intense fear of gaining weight or behaviour that prevents the individual from gaining weight, or both. The long-term prognosis is often poor, with severe developmental, medical and psychosocial complications, high rates of relapse and mortality. 'Family therapy approaches' indicate a range of approaches, derived from different theories, that involve the family in treatment. We have included therapies developed on the basis of dominant family systems theories, approaches that are based on or broadly similar to the family-based therapy derived from the Maudsley model, approaches that incorporate a focus on cognitive restructuring, as well as approaches that involve the family without articulation of a theoretical approach.This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010., Objectives, To evaluate the efficacy of family therapy approaches compared with standard treatment and other treatments for AN., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) and PsycINFO (OVID) (all years to April 2016). We ran additional searches directly on Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 2008 and 2016 to 2018). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov, together with four theses databases (all years to 2018). We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have included in the analyses only studies from searches conducted to April 2016., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of family therapy approaches compared to any other intervention or other types of family therapy approaches were eligible for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, Four review authors selected the studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We used a random-effects meta-analysis. We used the risk ratio (with a 95% confidence interval) to summarise dichotomous outcomes and both the standardised mean difference and the mean difference to summarise continuous measures., Main results, We included 25 trials in this version of the review (13 from the original 2010 review and 12 newly-included studies). Sixteen trials were of adolescents, eight trials of adults (seven of these in young adults aged up to 26 years) and one trial included three age groups: one adolescent, one young adult and one adult. Most investigated family-based therapy or variants. Reporting of trial conduct was generally inadequate, so that in a large number of studies we rated the risk of bias as unclear for many of the domains. Selective reporting bias was particularly problematic, with 68% of studies rated at high risk of bias in this area, followed by incomplete outcome data, with 44% of studies rated at high risk of bias in this area. For the main outcome measure of remission there was some low-quality evidence (from only two studies, 81 participants) suggesting that family therapy approaches might offer some advantage over treatment as usual on rates of remission, post intervention (risk ratio (RR) 3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 8.23; I(superscript 2) = 0%). However, at follow-up, low-quality evidence from only one study suggested this effect was not maintained. There was very low-quality evidence from only one trial, which means it is difficult to determine whether family therapy approaches offer any advantage over educational interventions for remission (RR 9.00, 95% CI 0.53 to 153.79; 1 study, N = 30). Similarly, there was very low-quality evidence from only five trials for remission post-intervention, again meaning that it is difficult to determine whether there is any advantage of family therapy approaches over psychological interventions (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; participants = 252; studies = 5; I(superscript 2) = 37%) and at long-term follow-up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.28; participants = 200; studies = 4 with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons for different age groups; I(superscript 2) = 0%). There was no indication that the age group had any impact on the overall treatment effect; however, it should be noted that there were very few trials undertaken in adults, with the age range of adult studies included in this analysis from 20 to 27. There was some evidence of a small effect favouring family based therapy compared with other psychological interventions in terms of weight gain post-intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.63; participants = 210; studies = 4 with 1 of these contributing 3 pairwise comparisons for different age groups; I(superscript 2) = 11%) Overall, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether there were any differences between groups across all comparisons for most of the secondary outcomes (weight, eating disorder psychopathology, dropouts, relapse, or family functioning measures), either at post-intervention or at follow-up., Authors' conclusions, There is a limited amount of low-quality evidence to suggest that family therapy approaches may be effective compared to treatment as usual in the short term. This finding is based on two trials that included only a small number of participants, and both had issues about potential bias. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is an advantage of family therapy approaches in people of any age compared to educational interventions (one study, very low quality) or other psychological therapies (five studies, very low quality). Most studies contributing to this finding were undertaken in adolescents and youth. There are clear potential impacts on how family therapy approaches might be delivered to different age groups and further work is required to understand what the resulting effects on treatment efficacy might be. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether one type of family therapy approach is more effective than another. The field would benefit from further large, well-conducted trials.","Caroline A Fisher, Sonja Skocic, Kathleen A Rutherford, Sarah E Hetrick (#year#).

1418,"Background, Insomnia is a major public health issue affecting between 6% to 10% of the adult population in Western countries. Eszopiclone is a hypnotic drug belonging to a newer group of hypnotic agents, known as new generation hypnotics, which was marketed as being just as effective as benzodiazepines for this condition, while being safer and having a lower risk for abuse and dependence. It is the aim of the review to integrate evidence from randomised controlled trials and to draw conclusions on eszopiclone's efficacy and safety profile, while taking methodological features and bias risks into consideration., Objectives, To assess the efficacy and safety of eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia compared to placebo or active control., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX and registry databases (WHO trials portal, ClinicalTrials.gov) with results incorporated from searches to 10 February 2016. To identify trials not registered in electronic databases, we contacted key informants and searched reference lists of identified studies. We ran an update search (21 February 2018) and have placed studies of interest in awaiting classification/ongoing studies. These will be incorporated into the next version of the review, as appropriate., Selection criteria, Parallel group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing eszopiclone with either placebo or active control were included in the review. Participants were adults with insomnia, as diagnosed with a standardised diagnostic system, including primary insomnia and comorbid insomnia., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently extracted outcome data; one reviewer assessed trial quality and the second author cross-checked it., Main results, A total of 14 RCTs, with 4732 participants, were included in this review covering short-term (<= 4 weeks; 6 studies), medium-term (> 4 weeks <= 6 months; 6 studies) and long-term treatment (> 6 months; 2 studies) with eszopiclone. Most RCTs included in the review included participants aged between 18 and 64 years, three RCTs only included elderly participants (64 to 85 years) and one RCT included participants with a broader age range (35 to 85 years). Seven studies considered primary insomnia; the remaining studies considered secondary insomnia comorbid with depression (2), generalised anxiety (1), back pain (1), Parkinson's disease (1), rheumatoid arthritis (1) and menopausal transition (1)., Authors' conclusions, Eszopiclone appears to be an efficient drug with moderate effects on sleep onset and maintenance. There was no or little evidence of harm if taken as recommended. However, as certain patient subgroups were underrepresented in RCTs included in the review, findings might not have displayed the entire spectrum of possible adverse events. Further, increased caution is required in elderly individuals with cognitive and motor impairments and individuals who are at increased risk of using eszopiclone in a non-recommended way.","Susanne Rosner, Christian Englbrecht, Renate Wehrle, Goran Hajak, Michael Soyka (#year#).

1421,"Background, Persistent (chronic) pain is a frequent complaint in survivors of torture, particularly but not exclusively pain in the musculoskeletal system. Torture survivors may have no access to health care; where they do, they may not be recognised when they present, and the care available often falls short of their needs. There is a tendency in state and non-governmental organisations' services to focus on mental health, with poor understanding of persistent pain, while survivors may have many other legal, welfare, and social problems that take precedence over health care., Objectives, To assess the efficacy of interventions for treating persistent pain and associated problems in survivors of torture., Search methods, We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in any language in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, LILACS, and PsycINFO, from database inception to 1 February 2017. We also searched trials registers and grey literature databases., Selection criteria, RCTs of interventions of any type (medical, physical, psychological) compared with any alternative intervention or no intervention, and with a pain outcome. Studies needed to have at least 10 participants in each arm for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, We identified 3578 titles in total after deduplication; we selected 24 full papers to assess for eligibility. We requested data from two completed trials without published results., Main results, Three small published studies (88 participants) met the inclusion criteria, but one had been retracted from publication because of ethical problems concerned with confidentiality and financial irregularities. Since these did not affect the data, the study was retained in this review. Despite the search including any intervention, only two types were represented in the eligible studies: two trials used cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with biofeedback versus waiting list on unspecified persistent pain (58 participants completed treatment), and one examined the effect of complex manual therapy versus self-treatment on low back pain (30 participants completed treatment). Excluded studies were largely either not RCTs or did not report pain as an outcome., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any intervention for persistent pain in survivors of torture.","Emma Baird, Amanda C Williams, Leslie Hearn, Kirstine Amris (#year#).

1422,"Background, Given the substantial period of time adults spend in their workplaces each day, these provide an opportune setting for interventions addressing modifiable behavioural risk factors for chronic disease. Previous reviews of trials of workplace-based interventions suggest they can be effective in modifying a range of risk factors including diet, physical activity, obesity, risky alcohol use and tobacco use. However, such interventions are often poorly implemented in workplaces, limiting their impact on employee health. Identifying strategies that are effective in improving the implementation of workplace-based interventions has the potential to improve their effects on health outcomes., Objectives, To assess the effects of strategies for improving the implementation of workplace-based policies or practices targeting diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and alcohol use., Search methods, We searched the following electronic databases on 31 August 2017: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; MEDLINE In Process; the Campbell Library; PsycINFO; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and Scopus. We also handsearched all publications between August 2012 and September 2017 in two speciality journals: Implementation Science and Journal of Translational Behavioral Medicine. We conducted searches up to September 2017 in Dissertations and Theses, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the US National Institutes of Health Registry. We screened the reference lists of included trials and contacted authors to identify other potentially relevant trials. We also consulted experts in the field to identify other relevant research., Selection criteria, Implementation strategies were defined as strategies specifically employed to improve the implementation of health interventions into routine practice within specific settings. We included any trial with a parallel control group (randomised or non-randomised) and conducted at any scale that compared strategies to support implementation of workplace policies or practices targeting diet, physical activity, obesity, risky alcohol use or tobacco use versus no intervention (i.e. wait-list, usual practice or minimal support control) or another implementation strategy. Implementation strategies could include those identified by the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) taxonomy such as quality improvement initiatives and education and training, as well as other strategies. Implementation interventions could target policies or practices directly instituted in the workplace environment, as well as workplace-instituted efforts encouraging the use of external health promotion services (e.g. gym membership subsidies)., Data collection and analysis, Review authors working in pairs independently performed citation screening, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment, resolving disagreements via consensus or a third reviewer. We narratively synthesised findings for all included trials by first describing trial characteristics, participants, interventions and outcomes. We then described the effect size of the outcome measure for policy or practice implementation. We performed meta-analysis of implementation outcomes for trials of comparable design and outcome., Main results, We included six trials, four of which took place in the USA. Four trials employed randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs. Trials were conducted in workplaces from the manufacturing, industrial and services-based sectors. The sample sizes of workplaces ranged from 12 to 114. Workplace policies and practices targeted included: healthy catering policies; point-of-purchase nutrition labelling; environmental supports for healthy eating and physical activity; tobacco control policies; weight management programmes; and adherence to guidelines for staff health promotion. All implementation interventions utilised multiple implementation strategies, the most common of which were educational meetings, tailored interventions and local consensus processes. Four trials compared an implementation strategy intervention with a no intervention control, one trial compared different implementation interventions, and one three-arm trial compared two implementation strategies with each other and a control. Four trials reported a single implementation outcome, whilst the other two reported multiple outcomes. Investigators assessed outcomes using surveys, audits and environmental observations. We judged most trials to be at high risk of performance and detection bias and at unclear risk of reporting and attrition bias., Authors' conclusions, Available evidence regarding the effectiveness of implementation strategies for improving implementation of health-promoting policies and practices in the workplace setting is sparse and inconsistent. Low certainty evidence suggests that such strategies may make little or no difference on measures of implementation fidelity or different employee health behaviour outcomes. It is also unclear if such strategies are cost-effective or have potential unintended adverse consequences. The limited number of trials identified suggests implementation research in the workplace setting is in its infancy, warranting further research to guide evidence translation in this setting.","Luke Wolfenden, Sharni Goldman, Fiona G Stacey, Alice Grady, Melanie Kingsland, Christopher M Williams, John Wiggers, Andrew Milat, Chris Rissel, Adrian Bauman, Margaret M Farrell, France Legare, Ali Ben Charif, Tchala Herve Zomahoun, Rebecca K Hodder, Jannah Jones, Debbie Booth, Benjamin Parmenter, Tim Regan, Lin Sze Yoong (#year#).

1424,"Background, Delirium is defined as a disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition with reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention, and reduced orientation to the environment. Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently develop ICU delirium. It can profoundly affect both them and their families because it is associated with increased mortality, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer hospital and ICU stay and long-term cognitive impairment. It also results in increased costs for society., Objectives, To assess existing evidence for the effect of preventive interventions on ICU delirium, in-hospital mortality, the number of delirium- and coma-free days, ventilator-free days, length of stay in the ICU and cognitive impairment., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, CINAHL from 1980 to 11 April 2018 without any language limits. We adapted the MEDLINE search for searching the other databases. Furthermore, we checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We also checked the following trial registries: Current Controlled Trials; ClinicalTrials.gov; and CenterWatch.com (all on 24 April 2018)., Selection criteria, We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult medical or surgical ICU patients receiving any intervention for preventing ICU delirium. The control could be standard ICU care, placebo or both. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE., Data collection and analysis, We checked titles and abstracts to exclude obviously irrelevant studies and obtained full reports on potentially relevant ones. Two review authors independently extracted data. If possible we conducted meta-analyses, otherwise we synthesized data narratively., Main results, The electronic search yielded 8746 records. We included 12 RCTs (3885 participants) comparing usual care with the following interventions: commonly used drugs (four studies); sedation regimens (four studies); physical therapy or cognitive therapy, or both (one study); environmental interventions (two studies); and preventive nursing care (one study). We found 15 ongoing studies and five studies awaiting classification. The participants were 48 to 70 years old; 48% to 74% were male; the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score was 14 to 28 (range 0 to 71; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death). With the exception of one study, all participants were mechanically ventilated in medical or surgical ICUs or mixed. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Six studies were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors. We report results for the two most commonly explored approaches to delirium prevention: pharmacologic and a non-pharmacologic intervention., Authors' conclusions, There is probably little or no difference between haloperidol and placebo for preventing ICU delirium but further studies are needed to increase our confidence in the findings. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of physical and cognitive intervention on delirium. The effects of other pharmacological interventions, sedation, environmental, and preventive nursing interventions are unclear and warrant further investigation in large multicentre studies. Five studies are awaiting classification and we identified 15 ongoing studies, evaluating pharmacological interventions, sedation regimens, physical and occupational therapy combined or separately, and environmental interventions, that may alter the conclusions of the review in future.","Forsyth Suzanne Herling, Ingrid E Greve, Eduard E Vasilevskis, Ingrid Egerod, Camilla Bekker Mortensen, Merete Ann Moller, Helle Svenningsen, Thordis Thomsen (#year#).

1425,"Background, Recognition is growing that social anxiety disorder (SAnD) is a chronic and disabling disorder, and data from early trials demonstrate that medication may be effective in its treatment. This systematic review is an update of an earlier review of pharmacotherapy of SAnD., Objectives, To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in adults and identify which factors (methodological or clinical) predict response to treatment., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR-Studies and CCMDCTR-References) to 17 August 2015. The CCMDCTR contains reports of relevant RCTs from MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and CENTRAL (all years). We scanned the reference lists of articles for additional studies. We updated the search in August 2017 and placed additional studies in Awaiting Classification, these will be incorporated in the next version of the review, as appropriate., Selection criteria, We restricted studies to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy versus placebo in the treatment of SAnD in adults., Data collection and analysis, Two authors (TW and JI) assessed trials for eligibility and inclusion for this review update. We extracted descriptive, methodological and outcome information from each trial, contacting investigators for missing information where necessary. We calculated summary statistics for continuous and dichotomous variables (if provided) and undertook subgroup and sensitivity analyses., Main results, We included 66 RCTs in the review (> 24 weeks; 11,597 participants; age range 18 to 70 years) and 63 in the meta-analysis. For the primary outcome of treatment response, we found very low-quality evidence of treatment response for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo (number of studies (k) = 24, risk ratio (RR) 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 1.85, N = 4984). On this outcome there was also evidence of benefit for monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (k = 4, RR 2.36; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.75, N = 235), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) (k = 8, RR 1.83; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.55, N = 1270), and the benzodiazepines (k = 2, RR 4.03; 95% CI 2.45 to 6.65, N = 132), although the evidence was low quality. We also found clinical response for the anticonvulsants with gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) analogues (k = 3, RR 1.60; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.20, N = 532; moderate-quality evidence). The SSRIs were the only medication proving effective in reducing relapse based on moderate-quality evidence. We assessed the SSRIs and the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine on the basis of treatment withdrawal; this was higher for medication than placebo (SSRIs: k = 24, RR 2.59; 95% CI 1.97 to 3.39, N = 5131, low-quality evidence; venlafaxine: k = 4, RR 3.23; 95% CI 2.15 to 4.86, N = 1213, moderate-quality evidence), but there were low absolute rates of withdrawal for both these medications classes compared to placebo. We did not find evidence of a benefit for the rest of the medications compared to placebo., Authors' conclusions, We found evidence of treatment efficacy for the SSRIs, but it is based on very low- to moderate-quality evidence. Tolerability of SSRIs was lower than placebo, but absolute withdrawal rates were low.","Taryn Williams, Coenie J Hattingh, Catherine M Kariuki, Sean A Tromp, Anton J van Balkom, Jonathan C Ipser, Dan J Stein (#year#).

1426,"Background, This is the second update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2009. Millions of workers worldwide are exposed to noise levels that increase their risk of hearing disorders. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention interventions., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing occupational noise exposure or occupational hearing loss compared to no intervention or alternative interventions., Search methods, We searched the CENTRAL; PubMed; Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; and OSH UPDATE to 3 October 2016., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time-series (ITS) of non-clinical interventions under field conditions among workers to prevent or reduce noise exposure and hearing loss. We also collected uncontrolled case studies of engineering controls about the effect on noise exposure., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We categorised interventions as engineering controls, administrative controls, personal hearing protection devices, and hearing surveillance., Main results, We included 29 studies. One study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure in a 12-year time-series analysis but there were no controlled studies on engineering controls for noise exposure. Eleven studies with 3725 participants evaluated effects of personal hearing protection devices and 17 studies with 84,028 participants evaluated effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs)., Authors' conclusions, There is very low-quality evidence that implementation of stricter legislation can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Controlled studies of other engineering control interventions in the field have not been conducted. There is moderate-quality evidence that training of proper insertion of earplugs significantly reduces noise exposure at short-term follow-up but long-term follow-up is still needed.","Christina Tikka, Jos H Verbeek, Erik Kateman, Thais C Morata, Wouter A Dreschler, Silvia Ferrite (#year#).

1428,"Background, Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience sleep deprivation caused by environmental disruption, such as high noise levels and 24-hour lighting, as well as increased patient care activities and invasive monitoring as part of their care. Sleep deprivation affects physical and psychological health, and patients perceive the quality of their sleep to be poor whilst in the ICU. Artificial lighting during night-time hours in the ICU may contribute to reduced production of melatonin in critically ill patients. Melatonin is known to have a direct effect on the circadian rhythm, and it appears to reset a natural rhythm, thus promoting sleep., Objectives, To assess whether the quantity and quality of sleep may be improved by administration of melatonin to adults in the intensive care unit. To assess whether melatonin given for sleep promotion improves both physical and psychological patient outcomes., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2017), Embase (1974 to September 2017), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to September 2017), and PsycINFO (1806 to September 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles., Selection criteria, We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with adult participants (over the age of 16) admitted to the ICU with any diagnoses given melatonin versus a comparator to promote overnight sleep. We included participants who were mechanically ventilated and those who were not mechanically ventilated. We planned to include studies that compared the use of melatonin, given at an appropriate clinical dose with the intention of promoting night-time sleep, against no agent; or against another agent administered specifically to promote sleep., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE., Main results, We included four studies with 151 randomized participants. Two studies included participants who were mechanically ventilated, one study included a mix of ventilated and non-ventilated participants and in one study participants were being weaned from mechanical ventilation. Three studies reported admission diagnoses, which varied: these included sepsis, pneumonia and cardiac or cardiorespiratory arrest. All studies compared melatonin against no agent; three were placebo-controlled trials; and one compared melatonin with usual care. All studies administered melatonin in the evening., Authors' conclusions, We found insufficient evidence to determine whether administration of melatonin would improve the quality and quantity of sleep in ICU patients. We identified sparse data, and noted differences in study methodology, in ICU sedation protocols, and in methods used to measure and report sleep. We identified five ongoing studies from database and clinical trial register searches. Inclusion of data from these studies in future review updates would provide more certainty for the review outcomes.","Sharon R Lewis, Michael W Pritchard, Oliver J Schofield-Robinson, Phil Alderson, Andrew F Smith (#year#).

1429,"Background, A large number of people are employed in sedentary occupations. Physical inactivity and excessive sitting at workplaces have been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and all-cause mortality., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness of workplace interventions to reduce sitting at work compared to no intervention or alternative interventions., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, OSH UPDATE, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal up to 9 August 2017. We also screened reference lists of articles and contacted authors to find more studies., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross-over RCTs, cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs), and quasi-RCTs of interventions to reduce sitting at work. For changes of workplace arrangements, we also included controlled before-and-after studies. The primary outcome was time spent sitting at work per day, either self-reported or measured using devices such as an accelerometer-inclinometer and duration and number of sitting bouts lasting 30 minutes or more. We considered energy expenditure, total time spent sitting (including sitting at and outside work), time spent standing at work, work productivity and adverse events as secondary outcomes., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles for study eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors for additional data where required., Main results, We found 34 studies - including two cross-over RCTs, 17 RCTs, seven cluster-RCTs, and eight controlled before-and-after studies - with a total of 3,397 participants, all from high-income countries. The studies evaluated physical workplace changes (16 studies), workplace policy changes (four studies), information and counselling (11 studies), and multi-component interventions (four studies). One study included both physical workplace changes and information and counselling components. We did not find any studies that specifically investigated the effects of standing meetings or walking meetings on sitting time., Authors' conclusions, At present there is low-quality evidence that the use of sit-stand desks reduce workplace sitting at short-term and medium-term follow-ups. However, there is no evidence on their effects on sitting over longer follow-up periods. Effects of other types of interventions, including workplace policy changes, provision of information and counselling, and multi-component interventions, are mostly inconsistent. The quality of evidence is low to very low for most interventions, mainly because of limitations in study protocols and small sample sizes. There is a need for larger cluster-RCTs with longer-term follow-ups to determine the effectiveness of different types of interventions to reduce sitting time at work.","Nipun Shrestha, Katriina T Kukkonen-Harjula, Jos H Verbeek, Sharea Ijaz, Veerle Hermans, Zeljko Pedisic (#year#).

1430,"Background, Studies report that up to 80% of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may struggle with symptoms of depression. However, this major comorbidity in COPD is rarely managed effectively. A number of recent studies indicate that left untreated, COPD-related depression is associated with worse quality of life, worse compliance with COPD treatment plan, increased exacerbations, hospital admissions, and healthcare costs when compared to individuals with COPD without depression. Regrettably, COPD practice guidelines do not provide conclusive treatment recommendations for the use of antidepressants in patients with COPD, and base their guidelines on findings from trials in the general population. This may be problematic, as there is an elevated risk of respiratory issues associated with antidepressant treatment and COPD. Evaluating effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions specifically for patients with COPD and depression was therefore paramount., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of depression in patients with COPD., Search methods, The last search was performed on 26 November 2018. We initially searched the following databases via the Specialised Trials Registers of the Cochrane Airways and Common Mental Disorders Groups (to June 2016): MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, and the Cochrane Library trials register (CENTRAL). Searches from June 2016 to November 2018 were performed directly on Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 26 November 2018. We searched the grey literature databases to identify studies not indexed in major databases and the reference lists of studies initially identified for full-text screening., Selection criteria, All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of pharmacological interventions with no intervention, placebo or co-intervention in adults with diagnosed COPD and depression were eligible for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed articles identified by the search for eligibility. Our primary outcomes were change in depressive symptoms and adverse events. The secondary outcomes were: change in quality of life, change in dyspnoea, change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(subscript 1)), change in exercise tolerance, change in hospital utilisation (length of stay and readmission rates), and cost-effectiveness. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the pooled mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as appropriate. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% CI using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework., Main results, Of the 1125 records screened for eligibility, four RCTs (N = 201 participants), and one on-going study, met the inclusion criteria. Two classes of antidepressants were investigated in two separate comparisons with placebo: a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence to make definitive statements about the efficacy or safety of antidepressants for treating COPD-related depression. New RCTs are needed; with better methodological quality and more accurate reporting of the methods used. Moreover, longer-term follow-up data collection is needed, including outcomes such as adverse events, hospital utilisation and cost-effectiveness.","Justyna Pollok, EM Joep van Agteren, Kristin V Carson-Chahhoud (#year#).

1431,"Background, Chronic pain is common and significantly impacts on the lives of persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Various types of non-pharmacological interventions are widely used, both in hospital and ambulatory/mobility settings to improve pain control in pwMS, but the effectiveness and safety of many non-pharmacological modalities is still unknown., Objectives, This review aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological therapies for the management of chronic pain in pwMS. Specific questions to be addressed by this review include the following., Search methods, A literature search was performed using the specialised register of the Cochrane MS and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Review Group, using the Cochrane MS Group Trials Register which contains CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACUS, Clinical trials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 10 December 2017. Handsearching of relevant journals and screening of reference lists of relevant studies was carried out., Selection criteria, All published randomised controlled trials (RCTs)and cross-over studies that compared non-pharmacological therapies with a control intervention for managing chronic pain in pwMS were included. Clinical controlled trials (CCTs) were eligible for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, All three review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool for best-evidence synthesis. Pooling data for meta-analysis was not possible due to methodological, clinical and statistically heterogeneity of the included studies., Main results, Overall, 10 RCTs with 565 participants which investigated different non-pharmacological interventions for the management of chronic pain in MS fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. The non-pharmacological interventions evaluated included: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), psychotherapy (telephone self-management, hypnosis and electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback), transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS), hydrotherapy (Ai Chi) and reflexology., Authors' conclusions, Despite the use of a wide range of non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of chronic pain in pwMS, the evidence for these interventions is still limited or insufficient, or both. More studies with robust methodology and greater numbers of participants are needed to justify the effect of these interventions for the management of chronic pain in pwMS.","Bhasker Amatya, Jamie Young, Fary Khan (#year#).

1432,"Background, Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychosocial treatment that aims to re-mediate distressing emotional experiences or dysfunctional behaviour by changing the way in which a person interprets and evaluates the experience or cognates on its consequence and meaning. This approach helps to link the person's feelings and patterns of thinking which underpin distress. CBT is now recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as an add-on treatment for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. This review is also part of a family of Cochrane CBT reviews for people with schizophrenia., Objectives, To assess the effects of cognitive behavioural therapy added to standard care compared with standard care alone for people with schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (up to March 6, 2017). This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register., Selection criteria, We selected all randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) involving people diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorders, which compared adding CBT to standard care with standard care given alone. Outcomes of interest included relapse, rehospitalisation, mental state, adverse events, social functioning, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment.We included studies fulfilling the predefined inclusion criteria and reporting useable data., Data collection and analysis, We complied with the Cochrane recommended standard of conduct for data screening and collection. Where possible, we calculated relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary data and mean difference (MD) and its 95% confidence interval for continuous data. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE., Main results, This review now includes 60 trials with 5,992 participants, all comparing CBT added to standard care with standard care alone. Results for the main outcomes of interest (all long term) showed no clear difference between CBT and standard care for relapse (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.00; participants = 1538; studies = 13, low-quality evidence). Two trials reported global state improvement. More participants in the CBT groups showed clinically important improvement in global state (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.84; participants = 82; studies = 2 , very low-quality evidence). Five trials reported mental state improvement. No differences in mental state improvement were observed (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.02; participants = 501; studies = 5, very low-quality evidence). In terms of safety, adding CBT to standard care may reduce the risk of having an adverse event (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.72; participants = 146; studies = 2, very low-quality evidence) but appears to have no effect on long-term social functioning (MD 0.56, 95% CI -2.64 to 3.76; participants = 295; studies = 2, very low-quality evidence, nor on long-term quality of life (MD -3.60, 95% CI -11.32 to 4.12; participants = 71; study = 1, very low-quality evidence). It also has no effect on long-term satisfaction with treatment (measured as 'leaving the study early') (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.12; participants = 1945; studies = 19, moderate-quality evidence)., Authors' conclusions, Relative to standard care alone, adding CBT to standard care appears to have no effect on long-term risk of relapse. A very small proportion of the available evidence indicated CBT plus standard care may improve long term global state and may reduce the risk of adverse events. Whether adding CBT to standard care leads to clinically important improvement in patients' long-term mental state, quality of life, and social function remains unclear. Satisfaction with care (measured as number of people leaving the study early) was no higher for participants receiving CBT compared to participants receiving standard care. It should be noted that although much research has been carried out in this area, the quality of evidence available is poor - mostly low or very low quality and we still cannot make firm conclusions until more high quality data are available.","Christopher Jones, David Hacker, Jun Xia, Alan Meaden, Claire B Irving, Sai Zhao, Jue Chen, Chunhu Shi (#year#).

1433,"This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:, The primary objectives are to summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking cessation attempts, and address the following two questions:, How do modes of delivery, person delivering the intervention, and the behavioural and motivational components of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compare with each other in achieving abstinence at follow-up of six months or longer?, Do the effects of behavioural interventions vary by other characteristics, including population, setting, and length of intervention?, The secondary objective of this review is to summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms of comparative costs and cost-effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary.","Jamie Hartmann-Boyce, Thomas R Fanshawe, Nicola Lindson, Jonathan Livingstone-Banks, M.

1434,"Background, Therapist-delivered trauma-focused psychological therapies are an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These have become the accepted first-line treatments for the disorder. Despite the established evidence-base for these therapies, they are not always widely available or accessible. Many barriers limit treatment uptake, such as the limited number of qualified therapists to deliver the interventions, cost, and compliance issues, such as time off work, childcare, and transportation, associated with the need to attend weekly appointments. Delivering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the Internet is an effective and acceptable alternative to therapist-delivered treatments for anxiety and depression. However, fewer Internet-based therapies have been developed and evaluated for PTSD, and uncertainty surrounds the efficacy of Internet-based cognitive and behavioural therapy (I-C/BT) for PTSD., Objectives, To assess the effects of I-C/BT for PTSD in adults., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialised Register (CCMDCTR) to June 2016 and identified four studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The CCMDCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) from MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We also searched online clinical trial registries and reference lists of included studies, and contacted researchers in the field to identify additional and ongoing studies. We ran an update search on 1 March 2018, and identified four additional completed studies, which we added to the analyses along with two that were previously awaiting classification., Selection criteria, We searched for RCTs of I-C/BT compared to face-to-face or Internet-based psychological treatment, psychoeducation, wait list or care as usual. We included studies of adults (aged over 16 years or over), in which at least 70% of the participants met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)., Data collection and analysis, We entered data into Review Manager 5 software. We analysed categorical outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We pooled data with a fixed-effect meta-analysis, except where heterogeneity was present, in which case we used a random-effects model. Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias; any conflicts were discussed with a third author, with the aim of reaching a unanimous decision., Main results, We included 10 studies with 720 participants in the review. Eight of the studies compared I-C/BT delivered with therapist guidance to a wait list control. Two studies compared guided I-C/BT with I-non-C/BT. There was considerable heterogeneity among the included studies., Authors' conclusions, While the review found some beneficial effects of I-C/BT for PTSD, the quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of included trials. Further work is required to: establish non-inferiority to current first-line interventions, explore mechanisms of change, establish optimal levels of guidance, explore cost-effectiveness, measure adverse events, and determine predictors of efficacy and dropout.","Catrin Lewis, Neil P Roberts, Andrew Bethell, Lindsay Robertson, Jonathan I Bisson (#year#).

1435,"Background, Problem alcohol use is common among people who use illicit drugs (PWID) and is associated with adverse health outcomes. It is also an important factor contributing to a poor prognosis among drug users with hepatitis C virus (HCV) as it impacts on progression to hepatic cirrhosis or opioid overdose in PWID., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to reduce alcohol consumption in PWID (users of opioids and stimulants)., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, from inception up to August 2017, and the reference lists of eligible articles. We also searched: 1) conference proceedings (online archives only) of the Society for the Study of Addiction, International Harm Reduction Association, International Conference on Alcohol Harm Reduction and American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence; and 2) online registers of clinical trials: Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, Center Watch and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions with other psychosocial treatment, or treatment as usual, in adult PWIDs (aged at least 18 years) with concurrent problem alcohol use., Data collection and analysis, We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane., Main results, We included seven trials (825 participants). We judged the majority of the trials to have a high or unclear risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, We found low to very low-quality evidence to suggest that there is no difference in effectiveness between different types of psychosocial interventions to reduce alcohol consumption among people who use illicit drugs, and that brief interventions are not superior to assessment-only or to treatment as usual. No firm conclusions can be made because of the paucity of the data and the low quality of the retrieved studies.","Jan Klimas, Christopher Fairgrieve, Helen Tobin, Catherine-Anne Field, SM Clodagh O'Gorman, Liam G Glynn, Eamon Keenan, Jean Saunders, Gerard Bury, Colum Dunne, Walter Cullen (#year#).

1436,"Background, Neuropathic pain is thought to arise from damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Its prevalence is increasing in line with many chronic disorders such as diabetes. All treatments have limited effectiveness. Given the evidence regarding psychological treatment for distress and disability in people with various chronic pain conditions, we were interested to investigate whether psychological treatments have any effects for those with chronic neuropathic pain., Objectives, To assess the effects of psychological treatments on pain experience, disability, mood, and health-care use in adults with chronic neuropathic pain., Search methods, We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in any language in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, from database inception to March 2015., Selection criteria, Full publications of RCTs on psychological interventions for neuropathic pain. Trials had to have lasted at least three months, had at least 20 participants in each arm at the end of treatment, and compared a psychological intervention with any active or inactive intervention., Data collection and analysis, We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane., Main results, Two small studies (enrolling a total of 105 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One was a standard cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) programme for 61 people with pain from spinal cord injury, followed up for three months, and compared with a waiting list. The other was weekly group psychotherapy for 44 people with burning mouth syndrome, compared with a daily placebo tablet. The overall risk of bias was high in both trials., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy and safety of psychological interventions for chronic neuropathic pain. The two available studies show no benefit of treatment over either waiting list or placebo control groups.","Christopher Eccleston, Leslie Hearn, Amanda C Williams (#year#).

1437,"Background, Fibromyalgia is a clinically defined chronic condition of unknown etiology characterised by chronic widespread pain, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and fatigue. Many patients report high disability levels and poor quality of life. Drug therapy aims to reduce key symptoms, especially pain, and improve quality of life. The tetracyclic antidepressant, mirtazapine, may help by increasing serotonin and noradrenaline in the central nervous system (CNS)., Objectives, To assess the efficacy, tolerability and safety of the tetracyclic antidepressant, mirtazapine, compared with placebo or other active drug(s) in the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, the US National Institutes of Health, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for published and ongoing trials, and examined reference lists of reviewed articles, to 9 July 2018., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any formulation of mirtazapine against placebo, or any other active treatment of fibromyalgia, in adults., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, outcomes of efficacy, tolerability and safety, examined issues of study quality, and assessed risk of bias, resolving discrepancies by discussion. Primary outcomes were participant-reported pain relief (at least 50% or 30% pain reduction), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC; much or very much improved), safety (serious adverse events), and tolerability (adverse event withdrawal). Other outcomes were health-related quality of life (HRQoL) improved by 20% or more, fatigue, sleep problems, mean pain intensity, negative mood and particular adverse events. We used a random-effects model to calculate risk difference (RD), standardised mean difference (SMD), and numbers needed to treat. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table., Main results, Three studies with 606 participants compared mirtazapine with placebo (but not other drugs) over seven to 13 weeks. Two studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in six or seven of eight domains. We judged the evidence for all outcomes to be low- or very low-quality because of poor study quality, indirectness, imprecision, risk of publication bias, and sometimes low numbers of events., Authors' conclusions, Studies demonstrated no benefit of mirtazapine over placebo for pain relief of 50% or greater, PGIC, improvement of HRQoL of 20% or greater, or reduction of fatigue or negative mood. Clinically-relevant benefits were shown for pain relief of 30% or greater, reduction of mean pain intensity, and sleep problems. Somnolence, weight gain, and elevated alanine aminotransferase were more frequent with mirtazapine than placebo. The quality of evidence was low or very low, with two of three studies of questionable quality and issues over indirectness and risk of publication bias. On balance, any potential benefits of mirtazapine in fibromyalgia were outweighed by its potential harms, though, a small minority of people with fibromyalgia might experience substantial symptom relief without clinically-relevant adverse events.","Patrick Welsch, Kathrin Bernardy, Sheena Derry, Andrew R Moore, Winfried Hauser (#year#).

1438,"Background, Short-stay units are hospital units that provide short-term care for selected patients. Studies have indicated that short-stay units might reduce admission rates, time of hospital stays, hospital readmissions and expenditure without compromising the quality of care. Short-stay units are often defined by a target patient category, a target function, and a target time frame. Hypothetically, short-stay units could be established as part of any department, but this review focuses on short-stay units that provide care for participants with internal medicine diseases and conditions., Objectives, To assess beneficial and harmful effects of short-stay unit hospitalisation compared with usual care in people with internal medicine diseases and conditions., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trials registers up to 13 December 2017 together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We also searched several grey literature sources and performed a forward citation search for included studies., Selection criteria, We included randomised trials and cluster-randomised trials, comparing hospitalisation in a short-stay unit with usual care (hospitalisation in a traditional hospital ward or other services). We defined a short-stay unit to be a hospital ward where the targeted length of stay in hospital for patients was five days or less. We included both multipurpose and specialised short-stay units. Participants were adults admitted to hospital with an internal medicine disease or condition. We excluded surgical, obstetric, psychiatric, gynaecological, and ambulatory participants. Trials were included irrespective of publication status, date, and language., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each included trial. We measured intervention effect sizes by meta-analyses for two primary outcomes, mortality and serious adverse events, and one secondary outcome, hospital readmission. We narratively reported the following important outcomes: quality of life, activities of daily living, non-serious adverse events, and costs. We used risk ratio differences of 15% for mortality and of 20% for serious adverse events for minimal relevant clinical consideration. We rated the certainty of the evidence and the strength of recommendations of the outcomes using the GRADE approach., Main results, We included 19 records reporting on 14 randomised trials with a total of 2872 participants. One trial was ongoing. Thirteen trials evaluated short-stay unit hospitalisation for six specific conditions (acute decompensated heart failure (one trial), asthma (one trial), atrial fibrillation (one trial), chest pain (seven trials), syncope (two trials), and transient ischaemic attack (one trial)) and one trial investigated participants presenting with miscellaneous internal medicine disease and conditions. The components of the intervention differed among the trials as dictated by the trial participants' condition. All included trials were at high risk of bias., Authors' conclusions, Overall, the quantity and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Consequently, it is uncertain whether there are any beneficial or harmful effects of short-stay unit hospitalisation for adults with internal medicine diseases and conditions - more trials comparing the effects of short-stay units with usual care are needed. Such trials ought to be conducted with low risk of bias and low risks of random errors to improve the overall confidence in the evidence.","Camilla Strom, Jakob S Stefansson, Louise Maria Fabritius, Lars S Rasmussen, Thomas A Schmidt, Janus C Jakobsen (#year#).

1439,"Background, Transcranial magnetic stimulation can either excite or inhibit cortical areas of the brain, depending on whether the speed of the repetitive stimulation is applied at high or low frequencies. It has been used for physiological studies and it has also been proposed as a treatment for depression., Objectives, To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulationfor treating depression., Search methods, An electronic search was performed including the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group trials register (last searched June 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE (1966-2001), EMBASE (1974-2001), PsycLIT (1980-2001), and bibliographies from reviewed articles. Unpublished data and grey literature were searched through personal communications with researchers., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials assessing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression., Data collection and analysis, All reviewers independently extracted the information and verified it by cross-checking. Disagreements were resolved through discussion., Continuous data: When similar studies were grouped, the overall standardised mean difference was calculated under a fixed effect model weighted by the inverse variance method with 95% confidence intervals. (In the presence of statistical heterogeneity, a random effects model was to be used.), Main results, Sixteen trials were included in the review and fourteen contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis. Most comparisons did not show differences between rTMS and other interventions. No difference was seen between rTMS and sham TMS using the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, except for one time period (after two weeks of treatment) for left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency; and also for right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and low frequency, both in favour of rTMS and both using the Hamilton scale. Comparison of rTMS (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency) with electroconvulsive therapy showed no difference except for psychotic patients after two weeks treatment, using the Hamilton scale, which indicated that electroconvulsive therapy was more effective than rTMS., Authors' conclusions, The information in this review suggests that there is no strong evidence for benefit from using transcranial magnetic stimulation to treat depression, although the small sample sizes do not exclude the possibility of benefit.","Luis Jose Rodriguez-Martin, Manuel Jose Barbanoj, TE Schlaepfer, SC Susana Clos, V Perez, J Kulisevsky, A Gironell (#year#).

1440,"Background, Given the significant impact epilepsy can have on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals with epilepsy and their families, there is great clinical interest in evidence-based psychological treatments, aimed at enhancing psychological well-being in people with epilepsy. A review of the current evidence was needed to assess the effects of psychological treatments for people with epilepsy on HRQoL outcomes, in order to inform future therapeutic recommendations and research designs., Objectives, To assess the effects of psychological treatments for people with epilepsy on HRQoL outcomes., Search methods, We searched the following databases on 20 September 2016, without language restrictions: Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE PsycINFO, . We screened the references from included studies and relevant reviews, and contacted researchers in the field for unpublished studies., Selection criteria, We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs for this review. HRQoL was the main outcome measure. For the operational definition of 'psychological treatments', we included a broad range of treatments that used psychological or behavioral techniques designed to improve HRQoL, seizure frequency and severity, and psychiatric comorbidities for adults and children with epilepsy, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) or an active control group., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration., Main results, We included 24 completed RCTs, with a total of 2439 participants. Eleven studies investigated psychological interventions, such as cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness-based interventions. The remaining studies were classified as educational interventions (N = 7), self-management interventions (N = 3), adherence interventions (N = 1), and mixed interventions (N = 2). Two studies investigated interventions for children and adolescents, and five studies investigated interventions for adolescents and adults. Based on satisfactory clinical and methodological homogeneity, we pooled data from six adult studies, two studies on adolescents and adults, and one on adolescents and young adults (468 participants) for HRQoL, measured with the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31). We found significant mean changes for the QOLIE-31 total score and six subscales (emotional well-being, energy and fatigue, overall QoL, seizure worry, medication effects, and cognitive functioning). The mean changes of the QOLIE-31 total score (mean improvement of 5.68 points (95% CI 3.11 to 8.24; P < 0.0001), and three subscales, emotional well-being (mean improvement of 7.03 points (95% CI 2.51 to 11.54; P = 0.002); energy and Fatigue (mean improvement of 6.90 points (95% CI 3.49 to 10.31; P < 0.0001); and overall QoL (mean improvement of 6.47 points (95% CI 2.68 to 10.25; P = 0.0008) exceeded the threshold of minimally important change (MIC), indicating a clinically meaningful post-intervention improvement of QoL. We downgraded the quality of the evidence provided by the meta-analysis because of serious risk of bias in some of the included studies. Consequentially, these results provided evidence of moderate quality that psychological treatments for adults with epilepsy may enhance overall QoL in people with epilepsy., Authors' conclusions, Implications for practice: Psychological interventions and self-management interventions improved QoL, and emotional well-being, and reduced fatigue in adults and adolescents with epilepsy. Adjunctive use of psychological treatments for adults and adolescents with epilepsy may provide additional benefits to QoL in those who incorporate patient-centered management.","Rosa Michaelis, Venus Tang, Janelle L Wagner, Avani C Modi, Curt William LaFrance Jr, Laura H Goldstein, Tobias Lundgren, Markus Reuber (#year#).

1441,"Background, Caesarean section rates are increasing globally. The factors contributing to this increase are complex, and identifying interventions to address them is challenging. Non-clinical interventions are applied independently of a clinical encounter between a health provider and a patient. Such interventions may target women, health professionals or organisations. They address the determinants of caesarean births and could have a role in reducing unnecessary caesarean sections. This review was first published in 2011. This review update will inform a new WHO guideline, and the scope of the update was informed by WHO's Guideline Development Group for this guideline., Objectives, To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non-clinical interventions intended to reduce unnecessary caesarean section., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and two trials registers in March 2018. We also searched websites of relevant organisations and reference lists of related reviews., Selection criteria, Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies and repeated measures studies were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome measures were: caesarean section, spontaneous vaginal birth and instrumental birth., Data collection and analysis, We followed standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We narratively described results of individual studies (drawing summarised evidence from single studies assessing distinct interventions)., Main results, We included 29 studies in this review (19 randomised trials, 1 controlled before-after study and 9 interrupted time series studies). Most of the studies (20 studies) were conducted in high-income countries and none took place in low-income countries. The studies enrolled a mixed population of pregnant women, including nulliparous women, multiparous women, women with a fear of childbirth, women with high levels of anxiety and women having undergone a previous caesarean section., Authors' conclusions, We evaluated a wide range of non-clinical interventions to reduce unnecessary caesarean section, mostly in high-income settings. Few interventions with moderate- or high-certainty evidence, mainly targeting healthcare professionals (implementation of guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion, implementation of guidelines combined with audit and feedback, physician education by local opinion leader) have been shown to safely reduce caesarean section rates. There are uncertainties in existing evidence related to very-low or low-certainty evidence, applicability of interventions and lack of studies, particularly around interventions targeted at women or families and healthcare organisations or facilities.","Innie Chen, Newton Opiyo, Emma Tavender, Sameh Mortazhejri, Tamara Rader, Jennifer Petkovic, Sharlini Yogasingam, Monica Taljaard, Sugandha Agarwal, Malinee Laopaiboon, Jason Wasiak, Suthit Khunpradit, Pisake Lumbiganon, Russell L Gruen, Pilar Ana Betran (#year#).

1442,"Background, This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9. Despite good evidence for the health benefits of regular exercise for people living with or beyond cancer, understanding how to promote sustainable exercise behaviour change in sedentary cancer survivors, particularly over the long term, is not as well understood. A large majority of people living with or recovering from cancer do not meet current exercise recommendations. Hence, reviewing the evidence on how to promote and sustain exercise behaviour is important for understanding the most effective strategies to ensure benefit in the patient population and identify research gaps., Objectives, To assess the effects of interventions designed to promote exercise behaviour in sedentary people living with and beyond cancer and to address the following secondary questions: Which interventions are most effective in improving aerobic fitness and skeletal muscle strength and endurance? Which interventions are most effective in improving exercise behaviour amongst patients with different cancers? Which interventions are most likely to promote long-term (12 months or longer) exercise behaviour? What frequency of contact with exercise professionals and/or healthcare professionals is associated with increased exercise behaviour? What theoretical basis is most often associated with better behavioural outcomes? What behaviour change techniques (BCTs) are most often associated with increased exercise behaviour? What adverse effects are attributed to different exercise interventions?, Search methods, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We updated our 2013 Cochrane systematic review by updating the searches of the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, PsycLIT/PsycINFO, SportDiscus and PEDro up to May 2018. We also searched the grey literature, trial registries, wrote to leading experts in the field and searched reference lists of included studies and other related recent systematic reviews., Selection criteria, We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an exercise intervention with usual care or 'waiting list' control in sedentary people over the age of 18 with a homogenous primary cancer diagnosis., Data collection and analysis, In the update, review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts to identify studies that might meet the inclusion criteria, or that could not be safely excluded without assessment of the full text (e.g. when no abstract is available). We extracted data from all eligible papers with at least two members of the author team working independently (RT, LS and RG). We coded BCTs according to the CALO-RE taxonomy. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. When possible, and if appropriate, we performed a fixed-effect meta-analysis of study outcomes. If statistical heterogeneity was noted, a meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. For continuous outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness), we extracted the final value, the standard deviation (SD) of the outcome of interest and the number of participants assessed at follow-up in each treatment arm, to estimate the standardised mean difference (SMD) between treatment arms. SMD was used, as investigators used heterogeneous methods to assess individual outcomes. If a meta-analysis was not possible or was not appropriate, we narratively synthesised studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach with the GRADE profiler., Main results, We included 23 studies in this review, involving a total of 1372 participants (an addition of 10 studies, 724 participants from the original review); 227 full texts were screened in the update and 377 full texts were screened in the original review leaving 35 publications from a total of 23 unique studies included in the review. We planned to include all cancers, but only studies involving breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies incorporated a target level of exercise that could meet current recommendations for moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (i.e.150 minutes per week); or resistance exercise (i.e. strength training exercises at least two days per week)., Authors' conclusions, Since the last version of this review, none of the new relevant studies have provided additional information to change the conclusions. We have found some improved understanding of how to encourage previously inactive cancer survivors to achieve international physical activity guidelines. Goal setting, setting of graded tasks and instruction of how to perform behaviour, feature in interventions that meet recommendations targets and report adherence of 75% or more. However, long-term follow-up data are still limited, and the majority of studies are in white women with breast cancer. There are still a considerable number of published studies with numerous and varied issues related to high risk of bias and poor reporting standards. Additionally, the meta-analyses were often graded as consisting of low- to very low-certainty evidence. A very small number of serious adverse effects were reported amongst the studies, providing reassurance exercise is safe for this population.","Rebecca R Turner, Liz Steed, Helen Quirk, Rosa U Greasley, John M Saxton, JC Stephanie Taylor, Derek J Rosario, Mohamed A Thaha, Liam Bourke (#year#).

1443,"Background, Art therapy is defined by the British Association of Art Therapists as: ""a form of psychotherapy that uses art media as its primary mode of communication. Clients who are referred to an art therapist need not have experience or skill in art. The art therapist is not primarily concerned with making an aesthetic or diagnostic assessment of the client's image. The overall aim of its practitioners is to enable a client to change and grow on a personal level through the use of art materials in a safe and facilitating environment"". Historically, drawings and paintings have been recognised as a useful part of therapeutic processes within psychiatric and psychological specialties, and this has been acknowledged within medical and neurology-based disciplines., Objectives, To review the effects of art therapy as an adjunctive treatment for dementia compared with standard care and other non-pharmacological interventions., Search methods, We identified trials from ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register - on 12 May 2014, 20 March 2015, 15 January 2016, 4 November 2016, and 4 October 2017. We also handsearched the grey literature and contacted specialists in the field and authors of relevant reviews or studies to enquire about other sources of relevant information., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials examining art therapy as an intervention for dementia., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data. We examined scales measuring cognition, affect and emotional well-being, social functioning, behaviour and quality of life., Main results, We found two studies that met the inclusion criteria, incorporating data on a total of 60 participants (from 88 randomised), in experimental groups (n = 29) and active control groups (n = 31). One study compared group art therapy with simple calculation activities over 12 weeks. The other study compared group art therapy with recreational activities over 40 weeks. It was not possible to pool the data for analysis from the included studies, due to heterogeneity in terms of differences in the interventions, control treatments and choice of outcome measures., Authors' conclusions, There is insufficient evidence about the efficacy of art therapy for people with dementia. More adequately-powered and high-quality studies using relevant outcome measures are needed.","Sunita R Deshmukh, John Holmes, Alastair Cardno (#year#).

1444,"Background, Action observation (AO) is a physical rehabilitation approach that facilitates the occurrence of neural plasticity through the activation of the mirror-neural system, promoting motor recovery in people with stroke., Objectives, To assess whether action observation enhances motor function and upper limb motor performance and cortical activation in people with stroke., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 4 September 2017), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (24 October 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to 24 October 2017), Embase (1974 to 24 October 2017) and five additional databases. We also searched trial registries and reference lists., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AO, alone or associated with physical practice in adults after stroke. The primary outcome was upper limb motor function. Secondary outcomes included dependence on activities of daily living (ADL), motor performance, cortical activation, quality of life, and adverse effects., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials according to the pre-defined inclusion criteria, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. The reviews authors contacted trial authors for clarification and missing information., Main results, We included 12 trials involving 478 individuals. A number of trials showed a high risk of bias and others an unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting. The quality of the evidence was 'low' for most of the outcomes and 'moderate' for hand function, according to the GRADE system. In most of the studies, AO was followed by some form of physical activity. Primary outcome: the impact of AO on arm function showed a small significant effect (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60; 8 studies; 314 participants; low-quality evidence); and a large significant effect (mean difference (MD) 2.90, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.66; 3 studies; 132 participants; moderate-quality evidence) on hand function. Secondary outcomes: there was a large significant effect for ADL outcome (SMD 0.86, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.61; 4 studies, 226 participants; low-quality evidence). We were unable to pool other secondary outcomes to extract the evidence. Only two studies reported adverse effects without significant adverse AO events., Authors' conclusions, We found evidence that AO is beneficial in improving upper limb motor function and dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) in people with stroke, when compared with any control group; however, we considered the quality of the evidence to be low. We considered the effect of AO on hand function to be large, but it does not appear to be clinically relevant, although we considered the quality of the evidence as moderate. As such, our confidence in the effect estimate is limited because it will likely change with future research.","RDM Lorenna Borges, BGS Aline Fernandes, Protasio Luciana Melo, Ricardo O Guerra, Tania F Campos (#year#).

1446,"Background, Work-related upper limb and neck musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the most common occupational disorders worldwide. Studies have shown that the percentage of office workers that suffer from MSDs ranges from 20 to 60 per cent. The direct and indirect costs of work-related upper limb MSDs have been reported to be high in Europe, Australia, and the United States. Although ergonomic interventions are likely to reduce the risk of office workers developing work-related upper limb and neck MSDs, the evidence is unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was last published in 2012., Objectives, To assess the effects of physical, cognitive and organisational ergonomic interventions, or combinations of those interventions for the prevention of work-related upper limb and neck MSDs among office workers., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science (Science Citation Index), SPORTDiscus, Embase, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health database, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, to 10 October 2018., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ergonomic interventions for preventing work-related upper limb or neck MSDs (or both) among office workers. We only included studies where the baseline prevalence of MSDs of the upper limb or neck, or both, was less than 25%., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We included studies with relevant data that we judged to be sufficiently homogeneous regarding the interventions and outcomes in the meta-analysis. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each comparison using the GRADE approach., Main results, We included 15 RCTs (2165 workers). We judged one study to have a low risk of bias and the remaining 14 studies to have a high risk of bias due to small numbers of participants and the potential for selection bias., Authors' conclusions, We found inconsistent evidence that the use of an arm support or an alternative mouse may or may not reduce the incidence of neck or shoulder MSDs. For other physical ergonomic interventions there is no evidence of an effect. For organisational interventions, in the form of supplementary breaks, there is very low-quality evidence of an effect on upper limb discomfort. For training and multifaceted interventions there is no evidence of an effect on upper limb pain or discomfort. Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these interventions among office workers.","CW Victor Hoe, Donna M Urquhart, Helen L Kelsall, Eva N Zamri, Malcolm R Sim (#year#).

1447,"Background, Very early mobilisation (VEM) is performed in some stroke units and recommended in some acute stroke clinical guidelines. However, it is unclear whether very early mobilisation independently improves outcome after stroke., Objectives, To determine whether very early mobilisation (started as soon as possible, and no later than 48 hours after onset of symptoms) in people with acute stroke improves recovery (primarily the proportion of independent survivors) compared with usual care., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 31 July 2017). We also systematically searched 19 electronic databases including; CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 7 in the Cochrane Library (searched July 2017), MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to August 2017), Embase Ovid (1980 to August 2017), CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to August 2017) PsycINFO Ovid (1806 to August 2017), AMED Ovid (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), SPORTDiscus EBSCO (1830 to August 2017). We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched December 2016), the Chinese medical database, Wanfangdata (searched to November 2016), and reference lists, and contacted researchers in the field., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with acute stroke, comparing an intervention group that started out-of-bed mobilisation within 48 hours of stroke, and aimed to reduce time-to-first mobilisation, with or without an increase in the amount or frequency (or both) of mobilisation activities, with usual care, where time-to-first mobilisation was commenced later., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. The primary outcome was death or poor outcome (dependency or institutionalisation) at the end of scheduled follow-up. Secondary outcomes included death, dependency, institutionalisation, activities of daily living (ADL), extended ADL, quality of life, walking ability, complications (e.g. deep vein thrombosis), patient mood, and length of hospital stay. We also analysed outcomes at three-month follow-up., Main results, We included nine RCTs with 2958 participants; one trial provided most of the information (2104 participants). The median (range) delay to starting mobilisation after stroke onset was 18.5 (13.1 to 43) hours in the VEM group and 33.3 (22.5 to 71.5) hours in the usual care group. The median difference within trials was 12.7 (4 to 45.6) hours. Other differences in intervention varied between trials; in five trials, the VEM group were also reported to have received more time in therapy, or more mobilisation activity., Authors' conclusions, VEM, which usually involved first mobilisation within 24 hours of stroke onset, did not increase the number of people who survived or made a good recovery after their stroke. VEM may have reduced the length of stay in hospital by about one day, but this was based on low-quality evidence. Based on the potential hazards reported in the single largest RCT, the sensitivity analysis of trials commencing mobilisation within 24 hours, and the NMA, there was concern that VEM commencing within 24 hours may carry an increased risk, at least in some people with stroke. Given the uncertainty around these effect estimates, more detailed research is still required.","Peter Langhorne, Janice M Collier, Patricia J Bate, NT Matthew Thuy, Julie Bernhardt (#year#).

1448,"Background, Dentistry is a profession with a high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) among practitioners, with symptoms often starting as early in the career as the student phase. Ergonomic interventions in physical, cognitive, and organisational domains have been suggested to prevent their occurrence, but evidence of their effects remains unclear., Objectives, To assess the effect of ergonomic interventions for the prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among dental care practitioners., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO ProQuest, NIOSHTIC, NIOSHTIC-2, HSELINE, CISDOC (OSH-UPDATE), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal to August 2018, without language or date restrictions., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cluster RCTs, in which participants were adults, aged 18 and older, who were engaged in the practice of dentistry. At least 75% of them had to be free from musculoskeletal pain at baseline. We only included studies that measured at least one of our primary outcomes; i.e. physician diagnosed WMSD, self-reported pain, or work functioning., Data collection and analysis, Three authors independently screened and selected 20 potentially eligible references from 946 relevant references identified from the search results. Based on the full-text screening, we included two studies, excluded 16 studies, and two are awaiting classification. Four review authors independently extracted data, and two authors assessed the risk of bias. We calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach., Main results, We included two RCTs (212 participants), one of which was a cluster-randomised trial. Adjusting for the design effect from clustering, reduced the total sample size to 210. Both studies were carried out in dental clinics and assessed ergonomic interventions in the physical domain, one by evaluating a multi-faceted ergonomic intervention, which consisted of imparting knowledge and training about ergonomics, work station modification, training and surveying ergonomics at the work station, and a regular exercise program; the other by studying the effectiveness of two different types of instrument used for scaling in preventing WMSDs. We were unable to combine the results from the two studies because of the diversity of interventions and outcomes., Authors' conclusions, There is very low-quality evidence from one study showing that a multi-faceted intervention has no clear effect on dentists' risk of WMSD in the thighs or feet when compared to no intervention over a six-month period. This was a poorly conducted study with several shortcomings and errors in statistical analysis of data. There is low-quality evidence from one study showing no clear difference in elbow pain or shoulder pain in participants using light weight, wider handled curettes or heavier and narrow handled curettes for scaling over a 16-week period.","Priti Mulimani, CW Victor Hoe, Melanie J Hayes, Joy Jose Idiculla, BL Adinegara Abas, Laxminarayan Karanth (#year#).

1449,"Background, Active mind-body movement therapies (AMBMTs), including but not limited to yoga, tai chi, and qigong, have been applied as exercise modalities for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). AMBMT strategies have been found to be more effective than usual care; however, whether AMBMT is inferior, equivalent, or superior to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in people with COPD remains to be determined., Objectives, To assess the effects of AMBMTs compared with, or in addition to, PR in the management of COPD., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and major Chinese databases, as well as trial registries from inception to July 2017. In addition, we searched references of primary studies and review articles. We updated this search in July 2018 but have not yet incorporated these results., Selection criteria, We included (1) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing AMBMT (i.e. controlled breathing and/or focused meditation/attention interventions for which patients must actively move their joints and muscles for at least four weeks with no minimum intervention frequency) versus PR (any inpatient or outpatient, community-based or home-based rehabilitation programme lasting at least four weeks, with no minimum intervention frequency, that included conventional exercise training with or without education or psychological support) and (2) RCTs comparing AMBMT + PR versus PR alone in people with COPD. Two independent review authors screened and selected studies for inclusion., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors if necessary to ask them to provide missing data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) using a random-effects model., Main results, We included in the meta-analysis 10 studies with 762 participants across one or more comparisons. The sample size of included studies ranged from 11 to 206 participants. Nine out of 10 studies involving all levels of COPD severity were conducted in China with adults from 55 to 88 years of age, a higher proportion of whom were male (78%). Nine out of 10 studies provided tai chi and/or qigong programmes as AMBMT, and one study provided yoga. Overall, the term 'PR' has been uncritically applied in the vast majority of studies, which limits comparison of AMBMT and PR. For example, eight out of 10 studies considered walking training as equal to PR and used this as conventional exercise training within PR. Overall study quality for main comparisons was moderate to very low mainly owing to imprecision, indirectness (exercise component inconsistent with recommendations), and risk of bias issues. The primary outcomes for our review were quality of life, dyspnoea, and serious adverse events., Authors' conclusions, Given the quality of available evidence, the effects of AMBMT versus PR or of AMBMT added to PR versus PR alone in people with stable COPD remain inconclusive. Evidence of low quality suggests better disease-specific QoL with AMBMT versus PR in people with stable COPD, and evidence of very low quality suggests no differences in dyspnoea between AMBMT and PR. Evidence of moderate quality shows that AMBMT added to PR does not result in improved disease-specific QoL, and evidence of very low quality suggests that AMBMT added to PR may lead to better generic QoL versus PR alone. Future studies with adequate descriptions of conventional exercise training (i.e. information on duration, intensity, and progression) delivered by trained professionals with a comprehensive understanding of respiratory physiology, exercise science, and the pathology of COPD are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding treatment outcomes with AMBMT versus PR or AMBMT added to PR versus PR alone for patients with COPD.","McCusky Louis Gendron, Andre Nyberg, Didier Saey, Francois Maltais, Yves Lacasse (#year#).

The objectives are as follows:, To assess advocacy interventions for intimate partner abuse in women, in terms of which interventions work for whom, why and in what circumstances. Our strategic objective reflects our higher-order (realist) question (), with four more specific descriptive questions as subcomponents and foci in our initial exploration of the data. We will determine all answers (as much as possible) from existing evidence., Research questions, How do the key mechanisms associated with the delivery or use of complex interventions that include advocacy as a component interact with contextual influences, and with one another, to explain the successes, failures and partial successes of advocacy as an intervention?, What are the active ingredients of advocacy interventions?, What are the important moderators or contexts that determine whether the different mechanisms produce their intended outcomes?, To what extent do the views and experiences of women who have used advocacy services match the intervention's aims and outcomes?, How do organisational and system factors influence implementation of advocacy interventions?, These questions may change as the realist review progresses. We will consider active ingredients, impact and outcomes in relation to qualitatively and quantitatively measured effects., Strategic objectives, Our strategic objectives are to explain successes, failures, partial successes and small effect sizes in published, empirical studies of advocacy interventions delivered in different settings, and, in particular, to explain mechanisms of effect in heterogeneous, complex, advocacy-containing interventions. This will enable us to make clear decisions on which studies should be aggregated or synthesised in future reviews, as well as how to interpret the evidence in future reviews of advocacy interventions for abused women. It will also enable researchers and developers to design more effective advocacy interventions in the future, determine which outcomes to include, and improve their reporting and evaluation.

Schizophrenia can occur as an isolated episode, or as a recurring cycle of remission and relapse, and is associated with impairment in psychosocial and occupational functioning., Objectives, To examine the effects of occupational therapy delivered by occupational therapists compared to occupational therapy delivered by any other person for people with schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (including trial registers) on 4 November 2016 and 26 July 2018., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials evaluating the functional or clinical outcomes of occupational therapy, or both, for people with schizophrenia delivered by occupational therapists compared with occupational therapy for people with schizophrenia delivered by anyone other than occupational therapists., Data collection and analysis, Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and appraised study quality., Main results, The search yielded 1633 records. Of these, we retrieved 17 full-text reports (14 studies) for further scrutiny, which we subsequently excluded as they did not meet our inclusion criteria., Authors' conclusions, Currently there are no randomised controlled trials comparing delivery of occupational therapy for people diagnosed with schizophrenia by occupational therapists with delivery of similar interventions by anyone other than occupational therapists. Research studies employing methodologically robust trial designs are needed to establish whether or not there are better outcomes for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia with occupational therapy that is delivered by trained occupational therapists.","Karen Morris, Graeme Reid, Sally Spencer (#year#).

1452,"Background, Engagement in multiple risk behaviours can have adverse consequences for health during childhood, during adolescence, and later in life, yet little is known about the impact of different types of interventions that target multiple risk behaviours in children and young people, or the differential impact of universal versus targeted approaches. Findings from systematic reviews have been mixed, and effects of these interventions have not been quantitatively estimated., Objectives, To examine the effects of interventions implemented up to 18 years of age for the primary or secondary prevention of multiple risk behaviours among young people., Search methods, We searched 11 databases (Australian Education Index; British Education Index; Campbell Library; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; Embase; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); International Bibliography of the Social Sciences; MEDLINE; PsycINFO; and Sociological Abstracts) on three occasions (2012, 2015, and 14 November 2016)). We conducted handsearches of reference lists, contacted experts in the field, conducted citation searches, and searched websites of relevant organisations., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster RCTs, which aimed to address at least two risk behaviours. Participants were children and young people up to 18 years of age and/or parents, guardians, or carers, as long as the intervention aimed to address involvement in multiple risk behaviours among children and young people up to 18 years of age. However, studies could include outcome data on children > 18 years of age at the time of follow-up. Specifically,we included studies with outcomes collected from those eight to 25 years of age. Further, we included only studies with a combined intervention and follow-up period of six months or longer. We excluded interventions aimed at individuals with clinically diagnosed disorders along with clinical interventions. We categorised interventions according to whether they were conducted at the individual level; the family level; or the school level., Data collection and analysis, We identified a total of 34,680 titles, screened 27,691 articles and assessed 424 full-text articles for eligibility. Two or more review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias., Main results, We included in the review a total of 70 eligible studies, of which a substantial proportion were universal school-based studies (n = 28; 40%). Most studies were conducted in the USA (n = 55; 79%). On average, studies aimed to prevent four of the primary behaviours. Behaviours that were most frequently addressed included alcohol use (n = 55), drug use (n = 53), and/or antisocial behaviour (n = 53), followed by tobacco use (n = 42). No studies aimed to prevent self-harm or gambling alongside other behaviours., Authors' conclusions, Available evidence is strongest for universal school-based interventions that target multiple- risk behaviours, demonstrating that they may be effective in preventing engagement in tobacco use, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and antisocial behaviour, and in improving physical activity among young people, but not in preventing other risk behaviours. Results of this review do not provide strong evidence of benefit for family- or individual-level interventions across the risk behaviours studied. However, poor reporting and concerns around the quality of evidence highlight the need for high-quality multiple- risk behaviour intervention studies to further strengthen the evidence base in this field.","Georgina MacArthur, Deborah M Caldwell, James Redmore, Sarah H Watkins, Ruth Kipping, James White, Catherine Chittleborough, Rebecca Langford, Vanessa Er, Raghu Lingam, Keryn Pasch, David Gunnell, Matthew Hickman, Rona Campbell (#year#).

1453,"Background, People living in humanitarian settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are exposed to a constellation of stressors that make them vulnerable to developing mental disorders. Mental disorders with a higher prevalence in these settings include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive, anxiety, somatoform (e.g. medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS)), and related disorders. A range of psychological therapies are used to manage symptoms of mental disorders in this population., Objectives, To compare the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies versus control conditions (wait list, treatment as usual, attention placebo, psychological placebo, or no treatment) aimed at treating people with mental disorders (PTSD and major depressive, anxiety, somatoform, and related disorders) living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), and PsycINFO (OVID), with results incorporated from searches to 3 February 2016. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any unpublished or ongoing studies. We checked the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies versus control conditions (including no treatment, usual care, wait list, attention placebo, and psychological placebo) to treat adults and children with mental disorders living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises., Data collection and analysis, We used standard Cochrane procedures for collecting data and evaluating risk of bias. We calculated standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous data, using a random-effects model. We analysed data at endpoint (zero to four weeks after therapy); at medium term (one to four months after therapy); and at long term (six months or longer). GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was used to assess the quality of evidence for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and withdrawal outcomes., Main results, We included 36 studies (33 RCTs) with a total of 3523 participants. Included studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Asia. Studies were implemented in response to armed conflicts; disasters triggered by natural hazards; and other types of humanitarian crises. Together, the 33 RCTs compared eight psychological treatments against a control comparator., Authors' conclusions, There is low quality evidence that psychological therapies have large or moderate effects in reducing PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in adults living in humanitarian settings in LMICs. By one to four month and six month follow-up assessments treatment effects were smaller. Fewer trials were focused on children and adolescents and they provide very low quality evidence of a beneficial effect of psychological therapies in reducing PTSD symptoms at endpoint. Confidence in these findings is influenced by the risk of bias in the studies and by substantial levels of heterogeneity. More research evidence is needed, particularly for children and adolescents over longer periods of follow-up.","Marianna Purgato, Chiara Gastaldon, Davide Papola, Mark van Ommeren, Corrado Barbui, Wietse A Tol (#year#).

1454,"Background, Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes which is characterised by deterioration in cognitive, behavioural, social and emotional functions. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect to treat many of the syndrome's features. Less research has been directed towards non-pharmacological treatments. In this review, we examined the evidence for effects of music-based interventions., Objectives, To assess the effects of music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia on emotional well-being including quality of life, mood disturbance or negative affect, behavioural problems, social behaviour and cognition at the end of therapy and four or more weeks after the end of treatment., Search methods, We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) on 19 June 2017 using the terms: music therapy, music, singing, sing, auditory stimulation. Additional searches were carried out on 19 June 2017 in the major healthcare databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS; and in trial registers and grey literature sources., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials of music-based therapeutic interventions (at least five sessions) for people with dementia that measured any of our outcomes of interest. Control groups either received usual care or other activities with or without music., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors worked independently to screen the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and then to extract data and assess methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data using random-effects models., Main results, We included 22 studies with 1097 randomised participants. Twenty-one studies with 890 participants contributed data to meta-analyses. Participants in the studies had dementia of varying degrees of severity, and all were resident in institutions. Seven studies delivered an individual music intervention; the other studies delivered the intervention to groups of participants. Most interventions involved both active and receptive musical elements. The methodological quality of the studies varied. All were at high risk of performance bias and some were at high risk of detection or other bias., Authors' conclusions, Providing people with dementia who are in institutional care with at least five sessions of a music-based therapeutic intervention probably reduces depressive symptoms and improves overall behavioural problems at the end of treatment. It may also improve emotional well-being and quality of life and reduce anxiety, but may have little or no effect on agitation or aggression or on cognition.

1456,"Background, Falls in care facilities and hospitals are common events that cause considerable morbidity and mortality for older people. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and updated in 2012., Objectives, To assess the effects of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in older people in care facilities and hospitals., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (August 2017); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2017, Issue 8); and MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers to August 2017., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing falls in older people in residential or nursing care facilities, or hospitals., Data collection and analysis, One review author screened abstracts; two review authors screened full-text articles for inclusion. Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We calculated rate ratios (RaR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for rate of falls and risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs for outcomes such as risk of falling (number of people falling). We pooled results where appropriate. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence., Main results, Thirty-five new trials (77,869 participants) were included in this update. Overall, we included 95 trials (138,164 participants), 71 (40,374 participants; mean age 84 years; 75% women) in care facilities and 24 (97,790 participants; mean age 78 years; 52% women) in hospitals. The majority of trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, mostly relating to lack of blinding. With few exceptions, the quality of evidence for individual interventions in either setting was generally rated as low or very low. Risk of fracture and adverse events were generally poorly reported and, where reported, the evidence was very low-quality, which means that we are uncertain of the estimates. Only the falls outcomes for the main comparisons are reported here., Authors' conclusions, In care facilities: we are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls and it may make little or no difference to the risk of falling. General medication review may make little or no difference to the rate of falls or risk of falling. Vitamin D supplementation probably reduces the rate of falls but not risk of falling. We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls; they may make little or no difference to the risk of falling.","Ian D Cameron, Suzanne M Dyer, Claire E Panagoda, Geoffrey R Murray, Keith D Hill, Robert G Cumming, Ngaire Kerse (#year#).

1458,"Background, Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice that originated in India and is currently accepted in the Western world as a form of relaxation and exercise. It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia to determine the efficacy of yoga delivered as a package of care versus standard care., Objectives, To examine the effects of yoga as a package of care versus standard care., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (latest 30 March 2017) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSS, AMED, PsychINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register., Selection criteria, All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia comparing yoga as a package of care with standard-care control., Data collection and analysis, The review authors independently selected studies, quality rated these, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk difference (RD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its CI. We employed mixed-effect and fixed-effect models for analysis. We examined heterogeneity (I(superscript 2) technique), assessed risk of bias for included studies, and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)., Main results, Three studies are included in this review. All outcomes were short term (less than eight weeks). Useable data were reported for two outcomes only; leaving the study early and quality of life. There was some evidence in favour of the yoga package for quality of life endpoint scores (1 RCT, n=80, MD 22.93 CI 19.74 to 26.12, low-quality evidence). Leaving the study early data were equivocal between the treatment groups (3 RCTs, n=193, RD 0.06 CI -0.01 to 0.13, medium-quality evidence, high heterogeneity). Overall, this review has an inordinate number of missing key outcomes, which included mental and global state, social functioning, physical health, adverse effects and costs of care., Authors' conclusions, A small number of small studies were included in this review and these lacked many key outcomes. The sparse data means we cannot state with any degree of certainty if yoga delivered as a package of care is beneficial in comparison to standard care.","Julie Broderick, Davy Vancampfort (#year#).

1459,"Background, Antidepressants are a first-line treatment for adults with moderate to severe major depression. However, many people prescribed antidepressants for depression don't respond fully to such medication, and little evidence is available to inform the most appropriate 'next step' treatment for such patients, who may be referred to as having treatment-resistant depression (TRD). National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance suggests that the 'next step' for those who do not respond to antidepressants may include a change in the dose or type of antidepressant medication, the addition of another medication, or the start of psychotherapy. Different types of psychotherapies may be used for TRD; evidence on these treatments is available but has not been collated to date., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of psychotherapies for adults with TRD., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (until May 2016), along with CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO via OVID (until 16 May 2017). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. There were no date or language restrictions., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with participants aged 18 to 74 years diagnosed with unipolar depression that had not responded to minimum four weeks of antidepressant treatment at a recommended dose. We excluded studies of drug intolerance. Acceptable diagnoses of unipolar depression were based onthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) or earlier versions, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10, Feighner criteria, or Research Diagnostic Criteria. We included the following comparisons., Data collection and analysis, We extracted data, assessed risk of bias in duplicate, and resolved disagreements through discussion or consultation with a third person. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses when appropriate. We summarised continuous outcomes using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), and dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs)., Main results, We included six trials (n = 698; most participants were women approximately 40 years of age). All studies evaluated psychotherapy plus usual care (with antidepressants) versus usual care (with antidepressants). Three studies addressed the addition of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) to usual care (n = 522), and one each evaluated intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy (ISTDP) (n = 60), interpersonal therapy (IPT) (n = 34), or group dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) (n = 19) as the intervention. Most studies were small (except one trial of CBT was large), and all studies were at high risk of detection bias for the main outcome of self-reported depressive symptoms., Authors' conclusions, Moderate-quality evidence shows that psychotherapy added to usual care (with antidepressants) is beneficial for depressive symptoms and for response and remission rates over the short term for patients with TRD. Medium- and long-term effects seem similarly beneficial, although most evidence was derived from a single large trial. Psychotherapy added to usual care seems as acceptable as usual care alone.","Sharea Ijaz, Philippa Davies, Catherine J Williams, David Kessler, Glyn Lewis, Nicola Wiles (#year#).

1461,"Background, Poor interprofessional collaboration (IPC) can adversely affect the delivery of health services and patient care. Interventions that address IPC problems have the potential to improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes., Objectives, To assess the impact of practice-based interventions designed to improve interprofessional collaboration (IPC) amongst health and social care professionals, compared to usual care or to an alternative intervention, on at least one of the following primary outcomes: patient health outcomes, clinical process or efficiency outcomes or secondary outcomes (collaborative behaviour)., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL (2015, issue 11), MEDLINE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to November 2015. We handsearched relevant interprofessional journals to November 2015, and reviewed the reference lists of the included studies., Selection criteria, We included randomised trials of practice-based IPC interventions involving health and social care professionals compared to usual care or to an alternative intervention., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of each potentially relevant study. We extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias of each study. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis of study outcomes, given the small number of included studies and their heterogeneity in clinical settings, interventions and outcomes. Consequently, we summarised the study data and presented the results in a narrative format to report study methods, outcomes, impact and certainty of the evidence., Main results, We included nine studies in total (6540 participants); six cluster-randomised trials and three individual randomised trials (1 study randomised clinicians, 1 randomised patients, and 1 randomised clinicians and patients). All studies were conducted in high-income countries (Australia, Belgium, Sweden, UK and USA) across primary, secondary, tertiary and community care settings and had a follow-up of up to 12 months. Eight studies compared an IPC intervention with usual care and evaluated the effects of different practice-based IPC interventions: externally facilitated interprofessional activities (e.g. team action planning; 4 studies), interprofessional rounds (2 studies), interprofessional meetings (1 study), and interprofessional checklists (1 study). One study compared one type of interprofessional meeting with another type of interprofessional meeting. We assessed four studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and an equal number of studies to be at high risk of detection bias., Authors' conclusions, Given that the certainty of evidence from the included studies was judged to be low to very low, there is not sufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions on the effects of IPC interventions. Neverthess, due to the difficulties health professionals encounter when collaborating in clinical practice, it is encouraging that research on the number of interventions to improve IPC has increased since this review was last updated. While this field is developing, further rigorous, mixed-method studies are required. Future studies should focus on longer acclimatisation periods before evaluating newly implemented IPC interventions, and use longer follow-up to generate a more informed understanding of the effects of IPC on clinical practice.","Scott Reeves, Ferruccio Pelone, Reema Harrison, Joanne Goldman, Merrick Zwarenstein (#year#).

1463,"Background, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is the most frequently used medication to treat it. Several studies have investigated the benefits of methylphenidate, showing possible favourable effects on ADHD symptoms, but the true magnitude of the effect is unknown. Concerning adverse events associated with the treatment, our systematic review of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated no increase in serious adverse events, but a high proportion of participants suffered a range of non-serious adverse events., Objectives, To assess the adverse events associated with methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD in non-randomised studies., Search methods, In January 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 12 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies., Selection criteria, We included non-randomised study designs. These comprised comparative and non-comparative cohort studies, patient-control studies, patient reports/series and cross-sectional studies of methylphenidate administered at any dosage or formulation. We also included methylphenidate groups from RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD as well as data from follow-up periods in RCTs. Participants had to have an ADHD diagnosis (from the 3rd to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the 9th or 10th edition of theInternational Classification of Diseaseswith or without comorbid diagnoses. We required that at least 75% of participants had a normal intellectual capacity (intelligence quotient of more than 70 points) and were aged below 20 years. We excluded studies that used another ADHD drug as a co-intervention., Data collection and analysis, Fourteen review authors selected studies independently. Two review authors assessed risk of bias independently using the ROBINS-I tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions. All review authors extracted data. We defined serious adverse events according to the International Committee of Harmonization as any lethal, life-threatening or life-changing event. We considered all other adverse events to be non-serious adverse events and conducted meta-analyses of data from comparative studies. We calculated meta-analytic estimates of prevalence from non-comparative cohorts studies and synthesised data from patient reports/series qualitatively. We investigated heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses, and we also conducted sensitivity analyses., Main results, We included a total of 260 studies: 7 comparative cohort studies, 6 of which compared 968 patients who were exposed to methylphenidate to 166 controls, and 1 which assessed 1224 patients that were exposed or not exposed to methylphenidate during different time periods; 4 patient-control studies (53,192 exposed to methylphenidate and 19,906 controls); 177 non-comparative cohort studies (2,207,751 participants); 2 cross-sectional studies (96 participants) and 70 patient reports/series (206 participants). Participants' ages ranged from 3 years to 20 years. Risk of bias in the included comparative studies ranged from moderate to critical, with most studies showing critical risk of bias. We evaluated all non-comparative studies at critical risk of bias. The GRADE quality rating of the evidence was very low., Authors' conclusions, Our findings suggest that methylphenidate may be associated with a number of serious adverse events as well as a large number of non-serious adverse events in children and adolescents, which often lead to withdrawal of methylphenidate. Our certainty in the evidence is very low, and accordingly, it is not possible to accurately estimate the actual risk of adverse events. It might be higher than reported here.","Jakob Ole Storebo, Nadia Pedersen, Erica Ramstad, Laerke Maja Kielsholm, Sofie Signe Nielsen, Helle B Krogh, Carlos R Moreira-Maia, Frederik L Magnusson, Mathilde Holmskov, Trine Gerner, Maria Skoog, Susanne Rosendal, Camilla Groth, Donna Gillies, Kirsten Buch Rasmussen, Dorothy Gauci, Morris Zwi, Richard Kirubakaran, Sasja J Hakonsen, Lise Aagaard, Erik Simonsen, Christian Gluud (#year#).

1465,"Background, Many people with schizophrenia do not respond to an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, one treatment strategy could be to increase the antipsychotic dose; and another strategy could be to switch to a different antipsychotic drug., Objectives, To examine the efficacy of increasing the antipsychotic dose versus switching the antipsychotic drug in the treatment of non-responsive people with schizophrenia., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (10 June 2014, 6 October 2015, and 30 March 2017). We examined references of all included studies for further trials., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing increasing the antipsychotic dose versus switching to a different antipsychotic drug for people with schizophrenia who have not responded to their initial antipsychotic treatment., Data collection and analysis, At least two review authors independently extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table., Main results, We include one RCT with relevant data on 29 participants in this review. The trial had a parallel design and was double-blind, but blinding procedures were not described. The trial included people who were non-responsive to fluphenazine 20 mg/day administered for 4 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to continuing treatment with fluphenazine 20 mg/day, increasing the dose to fluphenazine 80 mg/day or switching to haloperidol 20 mg/day for four additional weeks. Data were reported only for 47 out of 58 initially randomised participants. The trial was published in 1993. The fact that only one RCT with a small sample size (N = 29) was included in the analysis limits the quality of the evidence. Overall, no clear difference was found between groups in terms of the three available outcomes: global state (number of participants with clinically relevant response (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.17 to 15.99, very low quality evidence); general mental state (endpoint score, BPRS total) (MD 2.00, 95% CI -4.20 to 8.20, very low quality evidence); and negative symptoms (endpoint score, SANS) (MD 3.40, 95% CI -12.56 to 19.36). No data were reported for leaving the study early, adverse effects, time in hospital, quality of life, satisfaction with care and functioning., Authors' conclusions, There is extremely limited evidence and no clear conclusions can be drawn.

1466,"Background, Many people with schizophrenia do not reach a satisfactory clinical response with a standard dose of an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, clinicians face the dilemma of increasing the antipsychotic dose in order to enhance antipsychotic efficacy., Objectives, To examine the efficacy of increasing antipsychotic dose compared to keeping the same dose in the treatment of people with schizophrenia who have not responded (as defined in the individual studies) to an initial antipsychotic drug trial. We also examine the adverse effects associated with such a procedure., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (10 June 2014, 6 October 2015, and 30 March 2017). We examined references of all included studies for further trials., Selection criteria, All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reporting useable data, comparing increasing the antipsychotic dose rather than maintaining the original dose for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment., Data collection and analysis, At least two review authors independently extracted data We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their 95% CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table., Main results, Ten relevant RCTs with 675 participants are included in this review. All trials were double blind except one single blind. All studies had a run-in phase to confirm they did not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. The trials were published between 1980 and 2016. In most studies the methods of randomisation, allocation and blinding were poorly reported. In addition sample sizes were often small, limiting the overall quality of the evidence. Overall, no clear difference was found between groups in terms of the number of participants who showed clinically relevant response (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.40, 9 RCTs, N = 533, low-quality evidence), or left the study early due to adverse effects (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.52 to 5.07, very low quality evidence), or due to any reason (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.90, 5 RCTs, N = 353, low-quality evidence). Similarly, no clear difference was found in general mental state as measured by PANSS total score change (MD -1.44, 95% CI -6.85 to 3.97, 3 RCTs, N = 258, very low quality evidence). At least one adverse effect was equivocal between groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.50, 2 RCTs, N = 191, very low quality evidence). Data were not reported for time in hospital or quality-of-life outcomes. Finally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not show any effect on the primary outcome but these analyses were clearly underpowered., Authors' conclusions, Current data do not show any clear differences between increasing or maintaining the antipsychotic dose for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Adverse effect reporting was limited and poor. There is an urgent need for further trials in order to determine the optional treatment strategy in such cases.","Myrto T Samara, Elisabeth Klupp, Bartosz Helfer, Philipp H Rothe, Johannes Schneider-Thoma, Stefan Leucht (#year#).

1467,"Background, Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem characterized by recidivism, and medical and psychosocial complications. The co-occurrence of major depression in people entering treatment for alcohol dependence is common, and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality, which negatively influences treatment outcomes., Objectives, To assess the benefits and risks of antidepressants for the treatment of people with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register (via CRSLive), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to July 2017. We also searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via ClinicalTrials.gov () and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ()., Selection criteria, Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials comparing antidepressants alone or in association with other drugs or psychosocial interventions (or both) versus placebo, no treatment, and other pharmacological or psychosocial interventions., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane., Main results, We included 33 studies in the review (2242 participants). Antidepressants were compared to placebo (22 studies), psychotherapy (two studies), other medications (four studies), or other antidepressants (five studies). The mean duration of the trials was 9.9 weeks (range 3 to 26 weeks). Eighteen studies took place in the USA, 12 in Europe, two in Turkey, and one in Australia. The antidepressant included in most of the trials was sertraline; other medications were amitriptyline, citalopram, desipramine, doxepin, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine, mianserin, mirtazepine, nefazodone, paroxetine, tianeptine, venlafaxine, and viloxazine. Eighteen studies were conducted in an outpatient setting, nine in an inpatient setting, and six in both settings. Psychosocial treatment was provided in 18 studies. There was high heterogeneity in the selection of outcomes and the rating systems used for diagnosis and outcome assessment., Authors' conclusions, We found low-quality evidence supporting the clinical use of antidepressants in the treatment of people with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence. Antidepressants had positive effects on certain relevant outcomes related to depression and alcohol use but not on other relevant outcomes. Moreover, most of these positive effects were no longer significant when studies with high risk of bias were excluded. Results were limited by the large number of studies showing high or unclear risk of bias and the low number of studies comparing one antidepressant to another or antidepressants to other medication. In people with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence, the risk of developing adverse effects appeared to be minimal, especially for the newer classes of antidepressants (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). According to these results, in people with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence, antidepressants may be useful for the treatment of depression, alcohol dependence, or both, although the clinical relevance may be modest.","Roberta Agabio, Emanuela Trogu, Paolo Pier Pani (#year#).

1469,"Background, Excessive drinking is a significant cause of mortality, morbidity and social problems in many countries. Brief interventions aim to reduce alcohol consumption and related harm in hazardous and harmful drinkers who are not actively seeking help for alcohol problems. Interventions usually take the form of a conversation with a primary care provider and may include feedback on the person's alcohol use, information about potential harms and benefits of reducing intake, and advice on how to reduce consumption. Discussion informs the development of a personal plan to help reduce consumption. Brief interventions can also include behaviour change or motivationally-focused counselling., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of screening and brief alcohol intervention to reduce excessive alcohol consumption in hazardous or harmful drinkers in general practice or emergency care settings., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and 12 other bibliographic databases to September 2017. We searched Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (to December 2003, after which the database was discontinued), trials registries, and websites. We carried out handsearching and checked reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of brief interventions to reduce hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people attending general practice, emergency care or other primary care settings for reasons other than alcohol treatment. The comparison group was no or minimal intervention, where a measure of alcohol consumption was reported. 'Brief intervention' was defined as a conversation comprising five or fewer sessions of brief advice or brief lifestyle counselling and a total duration of less than 60 minutes. Any more was considered an extended intervention. Digital interventions were not included in this review., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We carried out subgroup analyses where possible to investigate the impact of factors such as gender, age, setting (general practice versus emergency care), treatment exposure and baseline consumption., Main results, We included 69 studies that randomised a total of 33,642 participants. Of these, 42 studies were added for this update (24,057 participants). Most interventions were delivered in general practice (38 studies, 55%) or emergency care (27 studies, 39%) settings. Most studies (61 studies, 88%) compared brief intervention to minimal or no intervention. Extended interventions were compared with brief (4 studies, 6%), minimal or no intervention (7 studies, 10%). Few studies targeted particular age groups: adolescents or young adults (6 studies, 9%) and older adults (4 studies, 6%). Mean baseline alcohol consumption was 244 g/week (30.5 standard UK units) among the studies that reported these data. Main sources of bias were attrition and lack of provider or participant blinding. The primary meta-analysis included 34 studies (15,197 participants) and provided moderate-quality evidence that participants who received brief intervention consumed less alcohol than minimal or no intervention participants after one year (mean difference (MD) -20 g/week, 95% confidence interval (CI) -28 to -12). There was substantial heterogeneity among studies (I[superscript digit two] = 73%). A subgroup analysis by gender demonstrated that both men and women reduced alcohol consumption after receiving a brief intervention., Authors' conclusions, We found moderate-quality evidence that brief interventions can reduce alcohol consumption in hazardous and harmful drinkers compared to minimal or no intervention. Longer counselling duration probably has little additional effect. Future studies should focus on identifying the components of interventions which are most closely associated with effectiveness.","FS Eileen Kaner, Fiona R Beyer, Colin Muirhead, Fiona Campbell, Elizabeth D Pienaar, Nicolas Bertholet, Jean B Daeppen, John B Saunders, Bernard Burnand (#year#).

1472,"Background, Exposure to light plays a crucial role in biological processes, influencing mood and alertness. Daytime workers may be exposed to insufficient or inappropriate light during daytime, leading to mood disturbances and decreases in levels of alertness., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness and safety of lighting interventions to improve alertness and mood in daytime workers., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization trials portal up to January 2018., Selection criteria, We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and non-randomised controlled before-after trials (CBAs) that employed a cross-over or parallel-group design, focusing on any type of lighting interventions applied for daytime workers., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened references in two stages, extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to pool data from different questionnaires and scales assessing the same outcome across different studies. We combined clinically homogeneous studies in a meta-analysis. We used the GRADE system to rate quality of evidence., Main results, The search yielded 2844 references. After screening titles and abstracts, we considered 34 full text articles for inclusion. We scrutinised reports against the eligibility criteria, resulting in the inclusion of five studies (three RCTs and two CBAs) with 282 participants altogether. These studies evaluated four types of comparisons: cool-white light, technically known as high correlated colour temperature (CCT) light versus standard illumination; different proportions of indirect and direct light; individually applied blue-enriched light versus no treatment; and individually applied morning bright light versus afternoon bright light for subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder., Authors' conclusions, There is very low-quality evidence based on two CBA studies that high CCT light may improve alertness, but not mood, in daytime workers. There is very low-quality evidence based on one CBA study that high CCT light may also cause less irritability, eye discomfort and headache than standard illumination. There is low-quality evidence based on one RCT that different proportions of direct and indirect light in the workplace do not affect alertness or mood. There is very low-quality evidence based on one RCT that individually applied blue-enriched light improves both alertness and mood. There is low-quality evidence based on one RCT that individually administered bright light during the afternoon is as effective as morning exposure for improving alertness and mood in subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder.","Daniela V Pachito, Alan L Eckeli, Ahmed S Desouky, Mark A Corbett, Timo Partonen, MW Shantha Rajaratnam, Rachel Riera (#year#).

1473,"Background, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental condition characterised by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, along with deficits in executive function, emotional regulation and motivation. The persistence of ADHD in adulthood is a serious clinical problem., Objectives, To assess the effects of cognitive-behavioural-based therapy for ADHD in adults., Search methods, In June 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases and three trials registries. We also checked reference lists, handsearched congress abstracts, and contacted experts and researchers in the field., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating any form of CBT for adults with ADHD, either as a monotherapy or in conjunction with another treatment, versus one of the following: unspecific control conditions (comprising supportive psychotherapies, no treatment or waiting list) or other specific interventions., Data collection and analysis, We used the standard methodological procedures suggested by Cochrane., Main results, We included 14 RCTs (700 participants), 13 of which were conducted in the northern hemisphere and 1 in Australia., Authors' conclusions, There is low-quality evidence that cognitive-behavioural-based treatments may be beneficial for treating adults with ADHD in the short term. Reductions in core symptoms of ADHD were fairly consistent across the different comparisons: in CBT plus pharmacotherapy versus pharmacotherapy alone and in CBT versus waiting list. There is low-quality evidence that CBT may also improve common secondary disturbances in adults with ADHD, such as depression and anxiety. However, the paucity of long-term follow-up data, the heterogeneous nature of the measured outcomes, and the limited geographical location (northern hemisphere and Australia) limit the generalisability of the results. None of the included studies reported severe adverse events, but five participants receiving different modalities of CBT described some type of adverse event, such as distress and anxiety.","Luis Pablo Lopez, Manuel Fernando Torrente, Agustin Ciapponi, Graciela Alicia Lischinsky, Marcelo Cetkovich-Bakmas, Ignacio Juan Rojas, Marina Romano, Facundo F Manes (#year#).

1476,"Background, Construction workers are frequently exposed to various types of injury-inducing hazards. There are a number of injury prevention interventions, yet their effectiveness is uncertain., Objectives, To assess the effects of interventions for preventing injuries in construction workers., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's specialised register, CENTRAL (issue 3), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO up to April 2017. The searches were not restricted by language or publication status. We also handsearched the reference lists of relevant papers and reviews., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after (CBA) studies and interrupted time-series (ITS) of all types of interventions for preventing fatal and non-fatal injuries among workers at construction sites., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed their risk of bias. For ITS studies, we re-analysed the studies and used an initial effect, measured as the change in injury rate in the year after the intervention, as well as a sustained effect, measured as the change in time trend before and after the intervention., Main results, Seventeen studies (14 ITS and 3 CBA studies) met the inclusion criteria in this updated version of the review. The ITS studies evaluated the effects of: introducing or changing regulations that laid down safety and health requirements for the construction sites (nine studies), a safety campaign (two studies), a drug-free workplace programme (one study), a training programme (one study), and safety inspections (one study) on fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries. One CBA study evaluated the introduction of occupational health services such as risk assessment and health surveillance, one evaluated a training programme and one evaluated the effect of a subsidy for upgrading to safer scaffoldings. The overall risk of bias of most of the included studies was high, as it was uncertain for the ITS studies whether the intervention was independent from other changes and thus could be regarded as the main reason of change in the outcome. Therefore, we rated the quality of the evidence as very low for all comparisons., Authors' conclusions, The vast majority of interventions to adopt safety measures recommended by standard texts on safety, consultants and safety courses have not been adequately evaluated. There is very low-quality evidence that introducing regulations as such may or may not result in a decrease in fatal and non-fatal injuries. There is also very low-quality evidence that regionally oriented safety campaigns, training, inspections or the introduction of occupational health services may not reduce non-fatal injuries in construction companies. There is very low-quality evidence that company-oriented safety interventions such as a multifaceted safety campaign, a multifaceted drug workplace programme and subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings may reduce non-fatal injuries among construction workers. More studies, preferably cluster-randomised controlled trials, are needed to evaluate different strategies to increase the employers' and workers' adherence to the safety measures prescribed by regulation.","Henk F van der Molen, Prativa Basnet, LT Peter Hoonakker, Marika M Lehtola, Jorma Lappalainen, HW Monique Frings-Dresen, Roger Haslam, Jos H Verbeek (#year#).

1477,"Background, 'Standard Precautions' refers to a system of actions, such as using personal protective equipment or adhering to safe handling of needles, that healthcare workers take to reduce the spread of germs in healthcare settings such as hospitals and nursing homes., Objectives, To assess the effectiveness of interventions that target healthcare workers to improve adherence to Standard Precautions in patient care., Search methods, We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, two other databases, and two trials registers. We applied no language restrictions. The date of the most recent search was 14 February 2017., Selection criteria, We included randomised trials of individuals, cluster-randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time-series studies that evaluated any intervention to improve adherence to Standard Precautions by any healthcare worker with responsibility for patient care in any hospital, long-term care or community setting, or artificial setting, such as a classroom or a learning laboratory., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data from eligible trials, and assessed risk of bias for each included study, using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Because of substantial heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures, meta-analysis was not warranted. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of evidence and have presented results narratively in 'Summary of findings' tables., Main results, We included eight studies with a total of 673 participants; three studies were conducted in Asia, two in Europe, two in North America, and one in Australia. Five studies were randomised trials, two were cluster-randomised trials, and one was a non-randomised trial. Three studies compared different educational approaches versus no education, one study compared education with visualisation of respiratory particle dispersion versus education alone, two studies compared education with additional infection control support versus no intervention, one study compared peer evaluation versus no intervention, and one study evaluated use of a checklist and coloured cues. We considered all studies to be at high risk of bias with different risks. All eight studies used different measures to assess healthcare workers' adherence to Standard Precautions. Three studies also assessed healthcare workers' knowledge, and one measured rates of colonisation with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among residents and staff of long-term care facilities. Because of heterogeneity in interventions and outcome measures, we did not conduct a meta-analysis., Authors' conclusions, Considerable variation in interventions and in outcome measures used, along with high risk of bias and variability in the certainty of evidence, makes it difficult to draw conclusions about effectiveness of the interventions. This review underlines the need to conduct more robust studies evaluating similar types of interventions and using similar outcome measures.","Donna Moralejo, Regina El Dib, Rafaela A Prata, Pasqual Barretti, Ione Correa (#year#).

1478,"Background, Antipsychotic agents are often used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with dementia although there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of their long-term use for this indication and concern that they may cause harm, including higher mortality. When behavioural strategies have failed and treatment with antipsychotic drugs is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw them have been recommended in guidelines. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia may be reluctant to stop antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS., Objectives, To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia and NPS in primary care or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older participants with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on participants' behaviour and assess safety., Search methods, We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), theCochrane LibraryMEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources up to 11 January 2018., Selection criteria, We included all randomised, controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia who had been treated with an antipsychotic drug for at least three months., Data collection and analysis, We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach., Main results, We included 10 studies involving 632 participants. One new trial (19 participants) was added for this update., Authors' conclusions, There is low-quality evidence that antipsychotics may be successfully discontinued in older people with dementia and NPS who have been taking antipsychotics for at least three months, and that discontinuation may have little or no important effect on behavioural and psychological symptoms. This is consistent with the observation that most behavioural complications of dementia are intermittent and often do not persist for longer than three months. Discontinuation may have little or no effect on overall cognitive function. Discontinuation may make no difference to adverse events and quality of life. Based on the trials in this review, we are uncertain whether discontinuation of antipsychotics leads to a decrease in mortality.","Ellen Van Leeuwen, Mirko Petrovic, Mieke L van Driel, IM An De Sutter, Robert Vander Stichele, Tom Declercq, Thierry Christiaens (#year#).

1582,"Background: Depression is a commonly occurring disorder linked to diminished role functioning and quality of life. The development of treatments that overcome barriers to accessing treatment remains an important area of clinical research as most people delay or do not receive treatment at an appropriate time. The workplace is an ideal setting to roll-out an intervention, particularly given the substantial psychological benefits associated with remaining in the workforce. Mobile health (mhealth) interventions utilising smartphone applications (apps) offer novel solutions to disseminating evidence based programs, however few apps have undergone rigorous testing. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone app designed to treat depressive symptoms in workers. Methods: The present study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT), comparing the effectiveness of the intervention to that of an attention control. The primary outcome measured will be reduced depressive symptoms at 3 months. Secondary outcomes such as wellbeing and work performance will also be measured. Employees from a range of industries will be recruited via a mixture of targeted social media advertising and Industry partners. Participants will be included if they present with likely current depression at baseline. Following baseline assessment (administered within the app), participants will be randomised to receive one of two versions of the Headgear application: 1) Intervention (a 30-day mental health intervention focusing on behavioural activation and mindfulness), or 2) attention control app (mood monitoring for 30 days). Participants will be blinded to their allocation. Analyses will be conducted within an intention to treat framework using mixed modelling. Discussion: The results of this trial will provide valuable information about the effectiveness of mhealth interventions in the treatment of depressive symptoms in a workplace context.","Johnston DA Deady M (2018//).

1583,"BACKGROUND: Up to 160,000 people incur traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year in the UK. TBI can have profound effects on many areas of human functioning, including participation in work. There is limited evidence of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation (VR) after injury to promote early return to work (RTW) following TBI., OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a definitive, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early, specialist VR plus usual care (UC) compared with UC alone on work retention 12 months post TBI., DESIGN: A multicentre, feasibility, parallel-group RCT with a feasibility economic evaluation and an embedded mixed-methods process evaluation. Randomisation was by remote computer-generated allocation., SETTING: Three NHS major trauma centres (MTCs) in England., PARTICIPANTS: Adults with TBI admitted for > 48 hours and working or studying prior to injury., INTERVENTIONS: Early specialist TBI VR delivered by occupational therapists (OTs) in the community using a case co-ordination model., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported RTW 12 months post randomisation, mood, functional ability, participation, work self-efficacy, quality of life and work ability. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment and retention rates. Follow-up was by postal questionnaires in two centres and face to face in one centre. Those collecting data were blind to treatment allocation., RESULTS: Out of 102 target participants, 78 were recruited (39 randomised to each arm), representing 39% of those eligible and 5% of those screened. Approximately 2.2 patients were recruited per site per month. Of those, 56% had mild injuries, 18% had moderate injuries and 26% had severe injuries. A total of 32 out of 45 nominated carers were recruited. A total of 52 out of 78 (67%) TBI participants responded at 12 months (UC, n = 23; intervention, n = 29), completing 90% of the work questions; 21 out of 23 (91%) UC respondents and 20 out of 29 (69%) intervention participants returned to work at 12 months. Two participants disengaged from the intervention. Face-to-face follow-up was no more effective than postal follow-up. RTW was most strongly related to social participation and work self-efficacy. It is feasible to assess the cost-effectiveness of VR. Intervention was delivered as intended and valued by participants. Factors likely to affect a definitive trial include deploying experienced OTs, no clear TBI definition or TBI registers, and repatriation of more severe TBI from MTCs, affecting recruitment of those most likely to benefit/least likely to drop out., LIMITATIONS: Target recruitment was not reached, but mechanisms to achieve this in future studies were identified. Retention was lower than expected, particularly in UC, potentially biasing estimates of the 12-month RTW rate., CONCLUSIONS: This study met most feasibility objectives. The intervention was delivered with high fidelity. When objectives were not met, strategies to ensure feasibility of a full trial were identified. Future work should test two-stage recruitment and include resources to recruit from 'spokes'. A broader measure covering work ability, self-efficacy and participation may be a more sensitive outcome., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN38581822., FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 22, No. 33.

Intervention wards comprised two medicines for older people (MOPs) wards and two medical/surgical wards. Control wards were both MOPs., PARTICIPANTS: Data collected from 627 patients and 178 staff., EXCLUSION CRITERIA: reverse barrier nursed, critically ill, palliative or non-English speaking. All other patients and all nursing staff and Health Care Assistant HCAs were invited to participant, agency and bank staff were excluded., INTERVENTION: CLECC, a workplace intervention focused on developing sustainable leadership and work-team practices to support the delivery of compassionate care., CONTROL: No educational activity., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary-Quality of Interaction Schedule (QuIS) for observed staff-patient interactions. Secondary-patient-reported evaluations of emotional care in hospital (PEECH); nurse-reported empathy (Jefferson Scale of Empathy)., RESULTS: Trial proceeded as per protocol, randomisation was acceptable. Some but not all blinding strategies were successful. QuIS observations achieved 93% recruitment rate with 25% of patient sample cognitively impaired. At follow-up there were more total positive (78% vs 74%) and less total negative (8% vs 11%) QuIS ratings for intervention wards versus control wards. Sixty-three per cent of intervention ward patients scored lowest (ie, more negative) scores on PEECH connection subscale, versus 79% of control. This was not a statistically significant difference. No statistically significant differences in nursing empathy were observed., CONCLUSIONS: Use of experimental methods is feasible.

1587,"BACKGROUND: Large volumes of sitting time have been associated with multiple health risks. To reduce sitting time of office workers working for a Dutch insurance company, the Dynamic Work intervention was developed. The primary objective of this paper is to describe the study protocol of the Dynamic Work study, which aims to evaluate if this multicomponent intervention is (cost-)effective in reducing total sitting time on the short-term ([almost equal to]3 months) and longer-term ([almost equal to]12 months) compared to usual practice. METHODS/DESIGN: This two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will recruit 250 desk-based office workers working at different locations of an insurance company in the Netherlands. After baseline measurements, departments will be matched in pairs and each pair will be randomly assigned to the control or intervention condition. The multicomponent intervention contains organizational (i.e. face to face session with the head of the department), work environmental (i.e. the introduction of sit-stand desks and cycling workstations), and individual elements (i.e. counselling and activity/sitting tracker with a self-help program booklet). The counselling involves two group intervention sessions and four on-site department consultations with an occupational physiotherapist. Sitting time (primary outcome), upright time and step counts will be assessed objectively using the activPAL activity monitor at baseline, short-term (approximately 3 months) and longer-term (12 months). Other outcomes will include: self-reported lifestyle behaviours, anthropometrics, work-related outcomes (i.e. absenteeism, presenteeism, work performance, work-related stress), health-related outcomes (i.e. vitality, musculoskeletal symptoms, need for recovery, quality of life), and costs from both company and societal perspective. The study will include economic and process evaluations. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the longer-term (cost-) effectiveness of a multicomponent workplace intervention aimed at reducing sitting time in comparison with usual practice. Furthermore, the process evaluation will provide insights in factors associated with successful implementation of this intervention.

1589,"We investigated whether a mindfulness meditation program delivered via a smartphone application could improve psychological well-being, reduce job strain, and reduce ambulatory blood pressure during the workday. Participants were 238 healthy employees from two large United Kingdom companies that were randomized to a mindfulness meditation practice app or a wait-list control condition. The app offered 45 prerecorded 10- to 20-min guided audio meditations. Participants were asked to complete one meditation per day. Psychosocial measures and blood pressure throughout one working day were measured at baseline and eight weeks later; a follow-up survey was also emailed to participants 16 weeks after the intervention start. Usage data showed that during the 8-week intervention period, participants randomized to the intervention completed an average of 17 meditation sessions (range 0-45 sessions). The intervention group reported significant improvement in well-being, distress, job strain, and perceptions of workplace social support compared to the control group. In addition, the intervention group had a marginally significant decrease in self-measured workday systolic blood pressure from pre- to post-intervention. Sustained positive effects in the intervention group were found for well-being and job strain at the 16-week follow-up assessment.

1590,"BACKGROUND: WOPAP is a theoretically-grounded workplace physical activity intervention that aims to reduce work-related burnout and to improve vigor at work and other work-related outcomes. Using a randomized controlled trial, we investigate whether a 10-week program including two Nordic walking sessions per week is effective in improving employee well-being at work, in comparison with another attractive leisure activity (Theatre condition) or a waiting list control condition. The design of the study makes it possible to test the effect on burnout and vigor of the instructor's style during physical activity (i.e., traditional vs. need-supportive style). Finally, this study is also interested in several possible psychological (i.e., detachment, relaxation, mastery, control, relatedness, and positive affects experiences) and physiological (i.e., cardiorespiratory fitness) mechanisms through which the practice of physical activity in the intervention could influence burnout and vigor. METHODS: Employees of the authors' University (N = 140) will be recruited via email, leaflets, and posters. Participants will be randomized to one of the four arms of the trial: (1) Physical Activity Traditional Style, (2) Physical Activity Need-Supportive Style, (3) Theatre condition, and (4) Waiting List Control. The experimental phase will last 10 weeks, followed by a six-month follow-up. During the ten weeks of the intervention, all groups - except the waiting list control - will carry out two activity sessions per week. Primary outcomes are burnout and vigor, secondary outcomes are work motivation, job satisfaction, work performance and work ability. These variables will be assessed before and after the intervention, and at three and six months after the end of the intervention. Moreover, burnout, vigor, needs satisfaction at work and psychological mediators will be assessed weekly throughout the intervention period.

1591,"BACKGROUND: Call agents spend ~ 90% of their working day seated, which may negatively impact health, productivity, and wellbeing. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of a multi-component workplace intervention targeting increased activity and decreased prolonged sitting in the contact centre setting prior to a full-scale effectiveness trial. METHODS: An 8-week non-randomised pre-post feasibility study was conducted. Using a mixed methods approach, focus groups and interviews were thematically analysed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of key study phases, and provide context to agents' process evaluation and survey responses. The multi-component intervention, conducted in a single call centre, included height-adjustable workstations, emails, education and training sessions, and support from team leaders and a workplace champion. RESULTS: Six (of 20) team leaders were recruited, with 17 of 84 call agents (78% female, 39.3 +/- 11.9 years) completing baseline assessments and 13 completing follow-up. High workload influenced recruitment. Call agents perceived assessments as acceptable, though strategies are needed to enhance fidelity. Education sessions, height-adjustable workstations and emails were perceived as the most effective components; however, height-adjustable hot-desks were not perceived as feasible in this setting. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified unique, pragmatic considerations for conducting a multi-level, multi-component PA and SB intervention and associated evaluation in highly sedentary call agents in the challenging contact centre setting. The intervention was largely perceived positively, with call agents and team leaders describing numerous perceived positive effects on behavioural, health and work-related outcomes. Findings will be of value to researchers attempting to intervene in contact centres and will be used by the current authors to design a subsequent trial.","Murphy RC Morris AS (2019//).

1592,"Psycho-traumatic disorders are a disabling condition whose epidemiological data vary according to the country but also the populations studied and the measuring instruments used. The estimated prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appeared to be increasing in recent years, and this appears to be due, among other things, to the improvement of the standardized evaluation procedure. The survey ""Mental Health in General Population"", conducted in metropolitan France between 1999 and 2003 on more than 36,000 people estimated its instantaneous prevalence (last month) of a full PTSD was 0.7% in the SMPG overall sample, with almost equal frequency between men (45%) and women (55%). This figure is close to that reported in a European population for the ESEMeD study. A very significant psychiatric comorbidity was found in subjects with PTSD, particularly with mood disorders, other anxiety disorders and addictive behaviors. The link with the suicidal risk was clearly established, which is the gravity of this pathology., The most important publications are made by American teams who have identified and evaluated the treatment of this pathology among veterans of the various wars led by the country., Barrois defines traumatic neurosis as ""a group of psychological disorders that arise after a longer or shorter latency, following a very intense emotional shock""., Post-traumatic stress disorder is defined by the ICD-10 classification as a ""delayed or prolonged"" response to a stressful situation or event (short or long-term) that would provoke distress symptoms in anyone ., According to the American classification of the DSM-V, the diagnosis of PTSD is strictly established according to different criteria. Exposure to a traumatic event (""the person has been exposed, witnessed or confronted with an event or events that have involved death or death, or serious injury or threat to their physical integrity or 'others'), and reacting to it with a feeling of intense fear, helplessness or horror (criterion A). The event is constantly relived, manifested by at least one symptom of the repetition syndrome (criterion B) that can be repetitive and invasive memories of the event (including images, thoughts, perceptions), repetitive and painful dreams of the event, the impression or sudden acts ""as if"" the traumatic event recurred, an intense psychological distress when exposed to internal or external stimuli resembling an aspect of the trauma, a physiological reactivity during exposure to internal or external stimuli resembling or symbolizing an aspect of the trauma. Criterion C requires persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with trauma and blunting of general responsiveness (not present before trauma)., Criterion D refers to the impairment of cognition and mood associated with one or more traumatic events manifested by at least two symptoms, including dissociative amnesia, persistent and exaggerated negative self-perceptions of others, and world, a clear reduction of interest in important activities, a feeling of detachment and a persistent inability to feel positive emotions. There are also symptoms of neurovegetative activation, with at least two symptoms (criterion E) among sleep difficulties, irritability or anger, difficulty concentrating, hyper vigilance, startled reactions exaggerated. Criterion F concerns the duration of symptoms B, C and D which must exceed one month. The problem results in clinically significant distress or dysfunction at the social, occupational or other important operational level (criterion G). Criterion H eliminates that these symptoms are not due to the consumption of a substance (drug or alcohol) or another condition., Despite this awareness of the functional impact of these psycho traumatic disorders, this pathology has remained under-identified both by health professionals and the general public and subsequently insufficiently treated, particularly in Tunisia. Several therapeutic protocols are proposed. The share of antidepressant treatments (yet first-line treatment in all international guidelines) is only 30% and the remaining 70% includes anxiolytics, hypnotics and herbal medicine. Several meta-analyzes have evaluated the efficacy of different families of antidepressants, but scientific research remains very poor in the field of herbal medicine.","NCT03724448 (2018//).

1593,"In the last few decades, the world has seen a significant increase in the occurrence of occupational diseases related to Burnout Syndrome (professional exhaustion) and stress in educators. These disorders affect mental health and teaching activity. In this way, they need to develop socio-emotional skills to cope with the psychosocial stressors related to the school environment. Currently, mindfulness-based therapies have been recommended to help educators acquire emotional self-control, and to improve self-esteem, metacognition, attention, resilience and affectivity, in addition to better the social skills needed in the school milieu. A few published studies indicate that mindfulness practices also reduce some inflammation- and stress- related molecules such as cortisol, receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (RIPK2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] (TNF-[alpha]) and epigenetic-regulation related histone deacetilases (HDAC). These indicator molecules can be measured in blood. The World Health Organisation (WHO-2013) recommends the worldwide implementation of strategies for the promotion of mental health, which are particularly aimed at preventing occupational diseases. The main objective of the proposed research project is to elaborate a program of Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion - educators (MBHP - educa) to be applied to a population of Brazilian public school educators. The efficacy of the program will be evaluated by cognitive testing. Blood tests for the above-mentioned stress-related molecules will be performed. The goal of developing the MBHP - educa Program is to promote and ameliorate the health care of public school teachers. Developing such a research proposal will contribute to debate and implement public health policies focussed on promoting the health of public school teachers in Brazil.","NCT03839030 (2019//).

1594,"Context: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) or vascular dementia is widely considered to be the second-most-common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, accounting for 20% of cases. Little is known about the effectiveness of breath qigong for seniors suffering from VCI or dementia., Objectives: For seniors with VCI, the study aimed to compare the benefits of qigong practice, cognitive training, and qigong practice + cognitive training in improving cognitive function, memory, executive function, and daily problem-solving ability., Design: The study was a randomized, controlled pilot study that used a prospective design with repeated measures., Setting: The study took place at the Tianjin Medical University General Hospital (Tianjin, China)., Participants: Participants were 93 patients with VCI at a clinic at the hospital., Intervention: The participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) qigong practice, an intervention group; (2) cognitive training, a positive control group; or (3) a combination of qigong practice and cognitive training, an intervention group. Participants received the treatments for 3 mo., Outcome Measures: All outcome measures were undertaken at baseline and postintervention. The measures included (1) the Montreal cognitive assessment, (2) the Loewenstein occupational therapy cognitive assessment, and (3) the Barthel activities of daily living index., Results: All 3 groups showed significant improvements in general cognitive function, memory, executive function, and daily problem-solving ability (P < .05)., Conclusion: Qigong practice is an easy and convenient exercise performed at no cost and has the potential to improve the cognitive functions of older adults with mild VCI.","Wan C Niu Y (2019//).

1595,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal pain (MSP) is the leading cause of years lived with disability. In consequence, to reduce MSP and its associated sickness absence is a major challenge. Previous interventions have been developed to reduce MSP and improve return to work of workers with MSP, but combined approaches and exhaustive evaluation are needed. The objective of the INTEVAL_Spain project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention in the workplace to prevent and manage MSP in nursing staff., METHODS: The study is designed as a two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial with a late intervention control group. The hospital units are the clusters of randomization and participants are nurses and aides. An evidence-based multi-component intervention was designed combining participatory ergonomics, case management and health promotion. Both the intervention and the control groups receive occupational health care as usual. Data are collected at baseline, and after six and 12 months. The primary outcomes are prevalence of MSP and incidence and duration of sickness absence due to MSP. Secondary outcomes are work role functioning and organizational preventive culture. The intervention process will be assessed through quantitative indicators of recruitment, context, reach, dose supplied, dose received, fidelity and satisfaction, and qualitative approaches including discussion groups of participants and experts. The economic evaluation will include cost-effectiveness and cost-utility, calculated from the societal and the National Health System perspectives., DISCUSSION: Workplace health programs are one of the best options for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. The main feature of this study is its multifaceted, multidisciplinary and de-medicalized intervention, which encompasses three evidence-based interventions and covers all three levels of prevention, which have not been previously unified in a single intervention. Also, it includes a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the intervention process, health results, and economic impact.

1596,"PURPOSE: A multifaceted workplace intervention consisting of participatory ergonomics, physical training, and cognitive-behavioural training (CBT) has shown effectiveness for reducing low back pain (LBP). However, the mechanisms of action underlying these intervention components are not well understood., METHODS: This was a mediation analysis of a cluster-randomised controlled trial of a multifaceted intervention in 420 workers in elderly care. Mediation analysis was carried out via structural equation modelling. Potential mediators investigated were: fear-avoidance beliefs, perceived muscle strength, use of assistive devices at work and perceived physical exertion at work. LBP outcomes assessed were: days with LBP, LBP intensity and days with bothersome LBP., RESULTS: There were no significant indirect effects of the intervention on LBP outcomes. There were significant effects of the intervention on both fear-avoidance measures [[beta] = - 0.63, 95% CI (1.23, 0.03); [beta] = - 1.03, 95% CI (- 1.70, - 0.34)] and the use of assistive devices [[beta] = - 0.55, 95% CI (- 1.04, - 0.05)], but not on perceived muscle strength [[beta] = - 0.18, 95% CI (- 0.50, 0.13)] or physical exertion [[beta] = - 0.05, 95% CI (- 0.40, 0.31)]. The only potential mediator with a significant effect on LBP outcomes was physical exertion, which had a significant effect on LBP intensity [[beta] = 0.14, 95% CI (0.04, 0.23)]., CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted intervention consisting of participatory ergonomics, physical training, and CBT was able to decrease fear-avoidance beliefs and increase use of assistive devices in the workplace. However, these changes did not explain the effect of any of the intervention components on days with LBP, LBP intensity and days with bothersome LBP.","Boyle E Stevens ML (2019//).

1597,"Twenty-five adults between the ages of 18 to 50 years with DSM-5 defined MDD or BDI/II, in a depressive episode will be enrolled. Enrollment into the study is voluntary. Eligible participants will provide written informed consent. Participants will be enrolled from the outpatient Mood Disorders Psychopharmacology Unit (MDPU), University Health Network (UHN), University of Toronto., The MDPU case report form will gather information on the participant's course of illness variables. Conventional pharmacological treatments for MDD and BD will be permitted., Participants will be excluded if they are receiving insulin and/or oral hypoglycemiants; have been diagnosed with possible or probable Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or any other dementia; have a history of neurological disorder, or evidence of neurologic or other physical illness that could produce cognitive deterioration; have substance use disorder within 3 months before screening or a positive baseline toxicology screen; have a clinically unstable general medical illness; are pregnant or breastfeeding; have MRI contraindications., The ongoing provision of care is not contingent on enrollment and/or completion of the study protocol. Furthermore, there will be ongoing communication with the participant's primary care provider in regards to their participation in this study., This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. The initial visit entails the provision of detailed study information to the patient and obtainment of written informed consent from the participant. The participant will then meet a research team member at a later date for a screening visit. This study requires a total of 2 visits., Screening and Baseline Assessment: Subjects will first meet with a staff psychiatrist for a clinical consultation. After obtaining consent and if inclusion criteria are met, a medical comorbidity questionnaire will be administered to screen for concurrent and lifetime medical conditions. Participant's demographic characteristics and current medications, as well as lifetime psychotropic medications received will be recorded. The investigators will also assess dietary intake with the short food frequency questionnaire (SFFQ); smoking, by questioning number of cigarettes smoked per day, age when smoking stated, and quit date, if applicable, to calculate a smoking pack-year history; physical activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ); and alcohol and/or substance abuse with the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). In addition, the investigators will assess demographics, socioeconomic status, medical history, and family psychiatric history; childhood trauma history with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) will also be assessed. Participants will also be asked to complete an MRI screening questionnaire to ensure that they have no contraindications. The following self-reported measures will be carried out: Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression (PDQ-D), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), UCLA life Stress (Episodic), DeJong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). Participants will be required to complete a urine drug screen. Female participants will be asked to do blood work to confirm they are not pregnant., Physiological Assessment: Anthropometric (i.e. BMI, waist-hip ratio) and metabolic measurements (i.e. fasting glucose, fasting insulin, glycated hemoglobin, lipids and HOMA-IR) will be completed at each study visit., Behavioral assessment: These tasks are simple, user-friendly tools that provide an opportunity, when used in conjunction with the most widely used questionnaires, to gain novel insights on reward behaviors in mood disorders., 1. The primary behavioral measurement will be effort-based decision-making, assessed using      the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), which will be done in a fMRI paradigm., 2. Assessments will include the validated anhedonia scale Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale      (SHPS), and the mood questionnaires Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS),      and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) during each study visit., Neural Circuits Assessment: A promising tool to study the effect of insulin on CNS is intranasal insulin, which is delivered directly into the brain, without relevant effects on peripheral glucose. A single dose of intranasal insulin has been shown to influence brain activation, increasing regional perfusion and functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the PFC. Acute administration of intranasal in randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over designs has been previously used to determine regional responses to insulin in the resting-state or during tasks., After screening and baseline assessment, participants will receive a crossover treatment assignment of either insulin or diluent followed by an MRI scan, with a washout period of 1 week. Therefore, participants will receive a total of 2 MRI scans throughout the course of the study- one following the first treatment, and one following the second treatment. The subsample will be enriched for the presence of self-reported anhedonia, using a score of greater than 2 on the SHPS as a cut-off, which provides the best discrimination between ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" level of hedonic tone. This subsample will also have equal representation of normal weight and obese participants. Imaging procedures will be done in collaboration with the Toronto Neuroimaging Facility (ToNI). ToNI is a shared research center, dedicated to research and teaching in human neuroimaging at the University of Toronto, run by the Department of Psychology., To proxy insulin activity within pre-selected brain regions, the investigators will use a provocation paradigm, involving the administration of exogenous intranasal insulin, based on the published work of other research groups. Activation of brain regions will be assessed during the resting state and task-based reward paradigm (i.e. EEfRT), following an intranasal administration of either 160 units of intranasal insulin or diluent (insulin and placebo will be prepared as nasal sprays), in a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over design. A hypothesis-driven region of interest approach will be used to investigate initially the striatum and the medial PFC (mPFC). Willingness to make effort for rewards will be measured with the EEfRT., Imaging procedures will be started with a safety monitoring for glucose and cardiovascular vital signs. An insulin/placebo spray will be administered intranasally and, within 30 min, fMRI measurement will be performed. Venous blood samples, for determination of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, will be obtained at the time of the insulin/placebo spray administration and immediately after the scan. The 2 scans for each individuals will be acquired on the same scanner. Subjects will be scanned using a 3.0-Tesla Signa HDx scanner with an 8-channel phased-array receiver coil (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) consisting of a structural and functional neuroimaging, comprising:, 1.

1598,"This study will examine the feasibility and efficacy of lifestyle medicine for the enhancement of psychological wellness in police officers. The integrative lifestyle intervention is based on the ""Healthy Body Healthy Mind (HBHM)"" programme developed by the University of Melbourne. It includes lifestyle psychoeducation, physical activity, nutrition and diet, relaxation/ mindfulness, and sleep. These components are weaved with psychological elements such as stress management, cognitive restructuring, motivational interviewing, and goal setting strategies that are led by clinical psychologists. While lifestyle medicine has been recognised for centuries a a mean to improve physical health, the field of lifestyle medicine in the context of mental health is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence demonstrating the efficacy of individual components of lifestyle medicine (e.g. diet, physical activities, and sleep) on mood and stress management. With a well-researched lifestyle medicine programme adopted from Australia, the research team of the Chinese University of Hong Kong has customised the intervention protocol to fit the Chinese culture, and has conducted a pilot trial to test the protocol across different communities and work populations. The investigators aim to examine the effectiveness of an integration of multiple lifestyle adjustments on psychological wellness from a holistic body-mind perspective. Acknowledging that police officers are one of hte work populations with stressful work nature, it is in a hope that lifestyle medicine would be effective to facilitate stress coping and enhance the psychological wellness of police officers in the long run.","NCT03925792 (2019//).

1599,"Sufficient physical activity and a good cardiorespiratory fitness level (CRF) are central in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. However, many people remain inactive, partly because current exercise recommendations fail to address important barriers to exercise. A novel exercise protocol has previously been developed called 'reduced-exertion high-intensity interval training' (REHIT), which can remove several common perceived barriers to exercise. REHIT 1) improves CRF and other key CVD risk factors, 2) is genuinely time-efficient (total time-commitment of just 2x10 min per week), 3) is well-tolerated, manageable, and not associated with negative affective responses, and 4) can be done in the workplace, in work-clothes and without a need to shower afterwards. To date, this intervention has only been investigated in a lab-setting. Therefore, in the present randomised controlled trial, the 'real-world' effectiveness of REHIT in improving maximal aerobic capacity (V̇O2max; a key risk factors of CVD) will be investigated in a workplace setting. Participants' attitudes and psychological responses to REHIT will be assessed to evaluate the likelihood of successful implementation. In 2 study centres, a total of up to n=50 physically inactive male and female office workers will be recruited to perform 6 weeks of unsupervised, computer-guided, office-based REHIT (n=25) or act as a control (n=25).","NCT03941145 (2019//).

1600,"Background Work problems are common in people with inflammatory arthritis (IA). In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 33% stop working within two years and 50% within 10 years. Work difficulties include: pain (particularly hand pain); fatigue; unadapted work environments, equipment and work schedules; poor work self-efficacy (i.e. lack of confidence about working); job strain; limited use of self-management strategies; and limited support from employers and work colleagues. Two USA trials of brief (3 hours) job retention vocational rehabilitation (VR) identified job loss was postponed by modifying such factors. A UK proof-of-principle trial (n=32) identified 10 hours (minimum) of VR reduced work instability. VR is not routinely available in the NHS and Rheumatology departments. It is unclear from the evidence if brief VR provided by therapists is effective and cost-effective in the UK., Aims, 1. Assess if there is a difference in work presenteeism between people with RA,      undifferentiated IA (UIA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who receive either: usual care,      written work self-help information plus brief VR (WORKWELL) provided by a therapist      trained in providing VR; or usual care and written work self-help information only      (WP1)., 2. To assess if there are differences in self-reported work instability, work, activity      limitations, work productivity, absenteeism, work status, work self-efficacy, health      status, NHS and societal costs between people receiving WORKWELL or written work      self-help information only (WP1), 3. To assess the cost-effectiveness of WORKWELL from the perspective of: the NHS using      health-related quality of life as the primary outcome; the employer using presenteeism      as the primary outcome; and the employer using health-related quality of life as the      primary outcome and including presenteeism as a cost. (WP5), 4. To update and evaluate a VR programme for occupational therapists and physiotherapists      to help them keep people with RA, IA or PsA in work (WP2)., 5. To measure fidelity to the WORKWELL intervention (WP3)., 6. To understand the social and structural context in which the intervention is delivered      and to identify factors which may influence the quality of implementation (WP3)., 7. Investigate contextual factors influencing participants' presenteeism (WP4)., Design A pragmatic, multi-centre individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effects of brief VR (intervention) with written self-help advice only (control). Cost-effectiveness and process evaluations will also be conducted., Methodology Employed people with RA/ UIA/ PsA who have concerns about being able to continue to work in future due to arthritis, will be consented into the study. They will complete a baseline questionnaire (hard copy or online according to participant preference) and will then be randomly allocated in equal numbers, stratified by participants' job skill levels, to either intervention or control groups. Participants (in both groups) will be mailed a self-help work information pack. Participants' in the intervention group will be referred to receive the WORKWELL intervention from a trained occupational therapist/ physiotherapist. The Lancashire Clinical Trials Unit (CTU: University of Central Lancashire) will contact participants monthly by text/ e-mail/ telephone to identify numbers of days on sick leave. Six months after completing the baseline questionnaire, participants will complete a short postal/online questionnaire including presenteeism, productivity health status measures and resource data. At 12 months, participants will complete a third postal/online questionnaire with most of the measures collected at baseline. Two sub-samples from the intervention group will be interviewed: employed participants about their views of VR; and any unemployed/ retired due to ill-health participants about factors contributing to job loss., Planned Sample Size 240 people will be recruited from 18 sites. On completion of the trial, qualitative interviews will be completed with 15 employed participants and up to 7 (if any) unemployed / early retired through ill-health from the intervention group. WORKWELL participants' line managers/employers will also be interviewed (where possible: n=10). WORKWELL Therapists and their line managers will also be interviewed (one each from each site, or less if data saturation is reached (n=18 for each)., Analyses Statistical analyses will investigate differences in outcomes at 12 months after baseline between intervention and control groups using mixed effects linear, logistic or ordinal logistic regression modelling, adjusted for baseline values and stratification variables (as applicable). The primary outcome is the summed score of the Combined Work Activities Limitations Scale -Work Limitations Questionnaire-25 (a measure of work presenteeism) at 12 months after baseline assessment. The health economic analysis will be conducted from the UK National Health Service (NHS) and employer perspectives. Interviews will be thematically analysed.

1601,"PURPOSE: To examine the effectiveness of an intervention in the workplace designed to reduce job insecurity among employees affected by organizational change. METHODS: Supervisors were randomly allocated to an intervention (IG) or waiting-list-control group (CG) and the intervention was administered over a period of 3 months, comprising six group sessions. N = 103 supervisors and their team members (mean age 41.80 +/- 9.60 years, 60.19% male) provided data prior to (t0) and 3 months post-intervention (t1) by means of questionnaires and hair samples. Job insecurity (COPSOQ), mental health (HADS) and somatic health (GBB, hair cortisol concentration) were measured. RESULTS: Job insecurity was reduced to a marginally significant degree in the IG compared to the CG at t1 (B = - 5.78, p = .06, CI [- 11.73, 0.17]). Differential effects for supervisors and team members were not found. No effects on health could be observed overall in the IG, but supervisors in the IG reported a significant decrease in exhaustion tendency (B = - 0.92, p = 0.01, CI [- 1.64, - 0.20]) and a non-significant trend towards higher levels of anxiety (B = 2.98, p = 0.10, CI [- 0.57, 6.54]) compared to team members. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide some evidence for the effectiveness of an intervention that aimed at reducing job insecurity during organizational change. Health-related effects were observed in supervisors but not in team members. Further intervention studies are needed to add to the current knowledge base.","(2018//).

1602,"This randomized controlled trial involved the development and evaluation of a supervisor support training intervention in the civilian workforce called VSST: Veteran-Supportive Supervisor Training. A theoretically based intervention in the workplace is critical to ensuring a smooth transition for service members and their families to civilian life, leading to improved psychological and physical health and improved work outcomes among service members. Thirty-five organizations were recruited and randomized to the VSST training program or a waitlist control group. Within those organizations, 497 current or former (post 9/11) service member employees were asked to complete baseline and 3- and 9-month follow-up surveys covering work, family, and health domains. The computerized 1-hr training, and the behavior tracking that followed were completed by 928 supervisors from the participating organizations. Intervention training effects were evaluated using an intent-to-treat approach, comparing outcomes for service members who were in organizations assigned to the training group versus those who were in organizations assigned to the control group. Moderation effects revealed the intervention was effective for employees who reported higher levels of supervisor and coworker support at baseline, demonstrating the importance of the organizational context and trainee readiness. The results did not show evidence of direct effects of the intervention on health and work outcomes. Qualitative data from supervisors who took the training also demonstrated the benefits of the training. This study affirms and adds to the literature on the positive effects of organizational programs that train supervisors to provide social support, thereby improving health and work outcomes of employees who receive more support.

The trial examined the efficacy of Emyna in reducing symptoms of depression (primary outcome) and anxiety as well as improving quality of life. METHODS: Participants (N = 200) with epilepsy, a diagnosis of a depressive disorder, and at least moderate depressive symptoms were randomized to Emyna or care as usual. At baseline and after 3, 6, and 9 months, participants were invited to complete online questionnaires. The primary outcome was improvement of depressive symptoms at 3 months. RESULTS: Relative to the control group, intervention group participants experienced significantly greater improvements in depression, anxiety, stress, social-occupational impairment, and epilepsy-related quality of life, in both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses. In ITT analyses, effects of medium magnitude were observed, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (Cohen d = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25-0.82, P < 0.001) and the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (d = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.23-0.79, P < 0.01). At 3 months, intervention group participants also reported fewer illness-related days off work and fewer days hospitalized over the preceding months, compared to control group participants (P  0.30). SIGNIFICANCE: These findings showed that Emyna, used adjunctively to usual care, could help improve mental health, social-occupational functioning, and quality of life among PwE. The program provides an additional treatment option that could produce clinically relevant symptom reductions and reduce key cost drivers (ie, hospitalization rates and illness-related inability to work).","Weiss M Meyer B (2019//).

1604,"This randomized controlled trial involved the development and evaluation of a supervisor support training intervention in the civilian workforce called VSST: Veteran-Supportive Supervisor Training. A theoretically based intervention in the workplace is critical to ensuring a smooth transition for service members and their families to civilian life, leading to improved psychological and physical health and improved work outcomes among service members. Thirty-five organizations were recruited and randomized to the VSST training program or a waitlist control group. Within those organizations, 497 current or former (post 9/11) service member employees were asked to complete baseline and 3- and 9-month follow-up surveys covering work, family, and health domains. The computerized 1-hr training, and the behavior tracking that followed were completed by 928 supervisors from the participating organizations. Intervention training effects were evaluated using an intent-to-treat approach, comparing outcomes for service members who were in organizations assigned to the training group versus those who were in organizations assigned to the control group. Moderation effects revealed the intervention was effective for employees who reported higher levels of supervisor and coworker support at baseline, demonstrating the importance of the organizational context and trainee readiness. The results did not show evidence of direct effects of the intervention on health and work outcomes. Qualitative data from supervisors who took the training also demonstrated the benefits of the training. This study affirms and adds to the literature on the positive effects of organizational programs that train supervisors to provide social support, thereby improving health and work outcomes of employees who receive more support.

1605,"Although calls for intervention designs are numerous within the organizational literature and increasing efforts are being made to conduct rigorous randomized controlled trials, existing studies have rarely evaluated the long-term sustainability of workplace health intervention outcomes, or mechanisms of this process. This is especially the case with regard to objective and subjective sleep outcomes. We hypothesized that a work-family intervention would increase both self-reported and objective actigraphic measures of sleep quantity and sleep quality at 6 and 18 months post-baseline in a sample of information technology workers from a U.S. Fortune 500 company. Significant intervention effects were found on objective actigraphic total sleep time and self-reported sleep insufficiency at the 6- and 18-month follow-up, with no significant decay occurring over time. However, no significant intervention effects were found for objective actigraphic wake after sleep onset or self-reported insomnia symptoms. A significant indirect effect was found for the effect of the intervention on objective actigraphic total sleep time through the proximal intervention target of 6-month control over work schedule and subsequent more distal 12-month family time adequacy. These results highlight the value of long-term occupational health intervention research, while also highlighting the utility of this work-family intervention with respect to some aspects of sleep.

1606,"BACKGROUND: Nationwide, emergency response systems depend on 9-1-1 telecommunicators to prioritize, triage, and dispatch assistance to those in distress. 9-1-1 call center telecommunicators (TCs) are challenged by acute and chronic workplace stressors: tense interactions with citizen callers in crisis; overtime; shift-work; ever-changing technologies; and negative work culture, including co-worker conflict. This workforce is also subject to routine exposures to secondary traumatization while handling calls involving emergency situations and while making time urgent, high stake decisions over the phone. Our study aims to test the effectiveness of a multi-part intervention to reduce stress in 9-1-1 TCs through an online mindfulness training and a toolkit containing workplace stressor reduction resources., METHODS/DESIGN: The study employs a randomized controlled trial design with three data collection points. The multi-part intervention includes an individual-level online mindfulness training and a call center-level organizational stress reduction toolkit. 160 TCs will be recruited from 9-1-1 call centers, complete a baseline survey at enrollment, and are randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. Intervention group participants will start a 7-week online mindfulness training developed in-house and tailored to 9-1-1 TCs and their call center environment; control participants will be ""waitlisted"" and start the training after the study period ends. Following the intervention group's completion of the mindfulness training, all participants complete a second survey. Next, the online toolkit with call-center wide stress reduction resources is made available to managers of all participating call centers. After 3 months, a third survey will be completed by all participants. The primary outcome is 9-1-1 TCs' self-reported symptoms of stress at three time points as measured by the C-SOSI (Calgary Symptoms of Stress Inventory). Secondary outcomes will include: perceptions of social work environment (measured by metrics of social support and network conflict); mindfulness; and perceptions of social work environment and mindfulness as mediators of stress reduction., DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an online mindfulness training and call center-wide stress reduction toolkit in reducing self-reported stress in 9-1-1 TCs. The results of this study will add to the growing body of research on worksite stress reduction programs., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Registration Number: NCT02961621 Registered on November 7, 2016 (retrospectively registered).","Lilly M Meischke H (2018//).

1607,"Addressing the stigma of mental illness and its effect in the workplace is a contemporary issue in occupational health. The role of leaders is a vital but relatively unexplored dimension of this phenomenon. This study examined the effectiveness and application of an online intervention to reduce depression-related stigma in organizational leaders. A randomized controlled, ""in the field"" study was conducted with 196 leaders. Participants completed an online survey and were randomly assigned to either the experimental or wait-list control group. One week later, participants in the experimental group were given access to a brief online workplace mental health intervention and asked to complete a postsurvey, whereas the control group had to only complete the online postsurvey. Six months later, participants completed a follow-up online survey. Results revealed significant reductions in behavioral and affective depression-related stigma scores among leaders who completed the intervention, compared with the control group. These reductions were similar at 6 months. The factors that enabled or hindered training transfer from the intervention were examined through semistructured interviews with 16 of the participating leaders. Results showed that positive attitudes and high levels of knowledge are not sufficient to ensure leaders apply intervention learning in their work environments. Factors including the nature of the work environment, the collective readiness and capability of the organization to address these issues, the attitudes of others at work, and the broader political context affected the application of learning from the intervention.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of 3 interventions targeting SA of workers. Participants (n = 352; 78.4% females) of working age with current employment, and SA due to depression, anxiety disorders, or exhaustion disorder, were recruited to the study and randomized to (a) acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), (b) a workplace dialogue intervention (WDI), (c) a combination of ACT and WDI, or (d) treatment as usual (TAU). For SA days, there was a significant interaction effect for the follow-up period, in which ACT + WDI generated more SA compared with TAU. When diagnostic group was included as a moderator, participants with exhaustion disorder had less SA days in the WDI group compared with TAU. For symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress-related ill health, there were significant interaction effects for ACT and ACT + WDI, when compared with TAU, from pre- to postmeasurement (small to moderate between-groups effect sizes). Within-group effect sizes pre- to postmeasurement (Cohen's d) ranged from .55 to 1.17 (ACT), .40 to .94 (WDI), .26 to 1.13 (ACT + WI), and -.06 to .70 (TAU).

1609,"Objectives: This study investigated whether financial incentives combined with a smoking cessation group training programme organized at the workplace are effective in increasing 6-month abstinence rates in tobacco-smoking employees. Methods: In this cluster randomized trial, 61 companies with 640 participating smokers within the Netherlands were enrolled. Eligible participants were employees who were current tobacco smokers of at least 18 years old. The control arm consisted of seven 90-minute sessions of smoking cessation group training at the workplace. In addition, participants in the intervention arm received vouchers for being abstinent: at the end of the training programme ([Euro sign]50), after three months ([Euro sign]50) and after six months ([Euro sign]50). 31 companies were randomized to the intervention arm and 30 companies to the control arm. The main outcome was CO-validated continuous abstinence at 6 months. Results: All randomized participants were included in the analyses. After the smoking cessation programme, abstinence rates in the intervention group were significantly higher (81.8%) than in the control group (72.0%) (AOR 1.96, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.40, p = 0.018). After three months, quit rates were 52.3% in the intervention group and 41.2% in the control group (AOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.38, p = 0.011). After 6 months, the difference in quit rates between intervention and control group increased to 44.4% versus 24.8% (AOR 2.58, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.83, p < 0.001).

1610,"OBJECTIVES: To assess: (i) whether changes in the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) were greater for multicomponent inpatient rehabilitation vs outpatient cognitive behavioural therapy, and (ii) whether baseline scores and changes (pre- to post-intervention) in FABQ were associated with future work-participation. METHODS: Individuals sick-listed for 2-12 months were randomized to inpatient multicomponent rehabilitation (3.5 weeks or 4+4 days) or outpatient cognitive behavioural therapy (6 sessions/6 weeks). RESULTS: A total of 334 subjects were included. There were no significant differences on FABQ between the in- and out-patient programmes during follow-up. Participants with consistently low scores on the work subscale had more work-participation days, followed by those who reduced their scores. Participants who increased, or had consistently high scores had the least workdays. For the physical activity subscale, the associations were weaker. FABQ-work scores at baseline were associated with number of work-participation days for both musculoskeletal and psychological diagnoses, and more strongly for the latter group. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that FABQ could be a useful prognostic tool for individuals on sick leave due to musculoskeletal or psychological disorders. There was no evidence that inpatient occupational rehabilitation reduces FABQ scores more than outpatient cognitive behavioural therapy.","Gismervik SO Aasdahl L (2019//).

1611,"Weight-control is a major public health focus for preventing multiple obesity-related health conditions. While clinic-based intensive lifestyle interventions are successful, low-socioeconomic-status (SES) populations, which have a higher burden of obesity, are difficult to reach; thus, the workplace offers a useful setting to target low-SES workers. The current paper presents the design of a study testing a workplace intervention aimed at low-SES employees. Partnering with a large healthcare system and affiliated university, this project will test an innovative multi-level intervention (""Working for You"") adapted from existing group- and individual-level intervention models to promote healthy weight among low-wage workers. The individual-level component is an interactive obesity treatment approach (iOTA) program that involves assessment of behavior risks, collaborative goal-setting with a health coach, and interactive SMS text-messages for ongoing support and self-monitoring. This mHealth intervention is embedded in the group-level component, a workplace participatory program that involves worker teams engaged in the design and implementation of interventions to change their workplace environments. These nested interventions are being tested in a group-randomized trial among 22 work groups (~1000 total workers, ~300 workers with obesity). The primary outcome will be program effects on weight at 2-year follow-up, compared to control, and the secondary outcomes will be effects on diet and physical activity; iOTA adherence, process measures, and work environment/support will also be examined. This pragmatic clinical trial will test scalable interventions that can be translated to other work settings to reduce obesity and related health risks among low-SES workers.

This test in its third edition has been revised by Martin for appropriate use in an adult population, with scores compared against the highest age group of scores (i.e. 18y 00-18y 11m) (Martin, 2006). There are seven subtests of eighteen stimuli figures each, which assess seven key areas of visual perception. Each subscale consisting of eighteen figures including two example items and sixteen test items are arranged in order of increasing complexity (see App. A). The test is largely an untimed instrument with the exception of subtests for visual memory and visual sequential memory being allocated a five second presentation time per item. Response time is however not restricted for any of the items., The Dynamic Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment instrument designed to assess the cognitive abilities and learning potential of children from ages 6 to 12 years via a dynamic mediation testing process. DOTCA-Ch, a criterion-referenced assessment, was designed to fill this need. Originally based on the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA), an assessment for adults with neuropsychological deficits, the DOTCA-Ch represents an adapted and modified format that is appropriate for use with school-age children. The DOTCA-Ch battery consists of 22 subtests in 5 cognitive domains: Orientation, Spatial Perception, Praxis, Visuomotor Construction, and Thinking Operations. Construct validity was supported by comparing children with traumatic brain injury and learning disabilities to typically developing children, and ecological validity of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder by comparing performance on the DOTCA-Ch to the School Function Assessment. Results of the intraclass correlation coefficients analysis revealed very high reliability coefficients for all cognitive domains, ranging from .87 to .99., The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) assesses problem behaviors associated with executive function. The form consists of 86 brief descriptions of behavior problems, the frequency of which teachers and parents are asked to rate as occurring either never, sometimes, or often. Responses are aggregated to form eight subscales (Inhibit, shift, emotional control, initiate, working memory, plan/organize, organization of materials and monitor scale). Examples of test items from each subscale are shown in the Appendix C and D. T-scores are calculated for each measure. The scales showed high internal consistency on the BRIEF (a=.80-.90) for both Teachers and Parents form. The moderate test-retest reliabilities for teachers BRIEF (.90-.92) and for the parent BRIEF (.80-.83). Interrater reliability of the teachers BRIEF is reported as .17-.28, and of the parents BRIEF as .32-.34. Both tools are reported to have evidenced for content of the items, convergence and divergence of their scores with other measures.","NCT03906097 (2019//).

Based on the occupational profiles of patients, the requests of patients and caregivers were reflected, the goal activities were selected, and the occupational therapy was designed(total intervention 12 times = TAP program design 1 time + visiting the home 9 time + teletherapy 2 times). The intervention was performed by visiting the home of patients total of 9 times, twice a week, and 60 minutes per session. Participants were educated on the daily lives of dementia patients and the work simplification and environmental modification were performed. In fact, by performing goal activities with patients, the therapist expedited the performance through various methods such as verbal or sensory cues, feedback, and modeling. In order to make the goal activities as habits, repetitive training was conducted and training of caregivers for the home-based program was performed. When visiting occupational therapy was not performed, the home-based program was executed. In order to make the goal activities as habits, self-training was performed.

1626,"INTERVENTION: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapeutic treatment based on an information processing model of trauma to alleviate the distress associated with traumatic memories. During EMDR the client is instructed to attend to the traumatic event in brief doses while simultaneously tracking the therapist's fingers with their eyes. The bilateral brain stimulation is thought to activate the brain's information processing pathways, enabling more adaptive associations to be made. Over time this leads to processing of traumatic events into long-term memory. As a result, people are able to recall the traumatic event/s  but are no longer so distressed by them; affective distress is relieved, negative beliefs are reformulated, and physiological arousal is reduced., The therapy will constitute 9 sessions of therapy with weekly sessions of one hour in length, the first session being a joint case conceptualisation agreed by therapist and participant, the next 8 sessions being active therapy., EMDR is well established as an effective treatment with a strong evidence base. EMDR and Trauma focused CBT are the two therapies recommended by the NICE Guidelines and the World Health Organisation for the treatment of PTSD, with a course of eight to 12 individual sessions being the most common forms of treatment. EMDR's use in the treatment of PTSD use is supported by a wide range of practice guidelines and meta-analyses., We will monitor our participant's views on acceptability of the intervention using the Treatment Acceptability/Adherence Scale.

1630,"INTERVENTION: Randomised Controlled Trial of DBT Interventions for Young People with Emotion Dysregulation, - Arm 1: 8-week intervention, - Arm 2: 16-week intervention, Intervention Description:, This is a study of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) interventions for young people (aged 16-25 years). Participants in this study will be randomly allocated to a 16-week or 8-week Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)-informed program. The 8-week group will receive weekly 90-minute DBT-informed skills training, in a group setting (approx. 10 people). The 16-week groups will receive an intensive DBT-informed intervention (including weekly 90-minute group skills training sessions, weekly 50-minute individual counselling, and optional phone counselling with a DBT practitioner 12 hours per day). Both DBT interventions will be delivered by qualified mental health practitioners, certified in DBT, who are working at Headspace, Southport. , Rationale:, Previous research has predominantly examined the efficacy of DBT in reducing self-harming or suicidal tendencies, emotion regulation and BPD symptoms in adult populations, revealing support in a range of therapeutic settings (Groves, Backer, Van den Bosch & Miller, 2011; Stoffers et al., 2012). Success of the therapy with adult populations has prompted its adaptation to youth populations, but empirical research on DBT for youth is more limited. While much of the research on adolescents/young adult populations is quasi-experimental, research to date presents promising findings., Participants:, The young people in this will be referred to Headspace Southport by local clinicians. Referred young people will be screened by the research team, via telephone, before being randomised to a DBT group (16 week or 8 week). To be included, participants must meet a certain level of symptoms of emotion dysregulation and borderline personality disorder. , 16-week DBT program, Physical and informational Materials used: , o participant information sheet, o diary cards, o Online surveys at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks (using qualtrics)., o Fidelity checklists for group and individual sessions, o Attendance sheets for group and individual sessions, o DBT Training manual/group skills weekly-plan for DBT providers, o DBT-relevant handouts given to participants during DBT group- skills sessions and individual DBT counselling sessions, for the purposes activities or self-learning. , Note: The material delivered to participants during DBT group skills sessions was created by the lead clinician on the project, a senior social worker at headspace Southport, trained in DBT. The materials were created, based on the guidelines set out by DBT founder, Marsha Linehan in her book ""DBT Skills Training Manual - Second Edition"" (Linehan, 2015). See reference list in ""public notes"" section for citation. While the DBT group skills sessions closely followed the Linehan's DBT manual, the sessions also contained some activities (e.g. mindfulness activities), that were added by the lead clinician, based on clinical experience. All DBT practitioners followed the same structure set out by the lead clinician, for each DBT group skills session. The same manual was used by DBT clinicians to guide their individual DBT counselling sessions, with clients in the 16-week group. , Procedures:, Pre-commitment work: Part of the full DBT program is pre-commitment work. To include this component of DBT in the RCT, we will randomise participants to their group (8-week or 16-week) just over two weeks before their first DBT session.

The scale being used in this experiment uses a dichotomous (true/ false) scoring procedure to identify personality traits indicative of a personality disorder. The subscale for borderline personality disorder will be used., ;  Emotion Regulation, ;, ; - Measured using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) (Gratz, ;  & Roemer, 2004): The DERS was designed to be a comprehensive measure of emotional dysregulation. This is achieved by tapping into the emotional dimensions of; awareness and understanding of emotion, acceptance of emotions, ability to engage in goal directed behaviour whilst refraining from detrimental behaviours when experiencing negative emotions and access to effective emotion regulation strategies. The DERS achieves this by using a five point Likert scale ranging from 1 ""almost never"" to 5 ""almost always"". The final score of the DERS provides insight into how the respondent regulates their emotions, their awareness of their own emotional state and their ability to control their emotions., ;, SECONDARY OUTCOME:  Functioning, ;, ; - Measured using the Multidimensional Assessment of Adolescent Functioning (MAFS) (Wardenaar, Johanna, Wigman, et. al., 2013): The MAFS is a 23 item scale, designed to measure everyday functioning in adolescents. The is achieved by use of three separate subscales that tap into: family-related functioning, peer-related functioning and general functioning. The MAFS uses a four point Likert scale that ranges from 1 ""not at all/ rarely"" to 4 ""always/ almost always"".  The subscales each provide a separate snapshot into a different domain of functioning and when brought together produce simple yet effective evaluation of the respondents general functioning., ;   Mindfulness, ; - Measured using the 5 Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire - Short Form (FFMQ-SF; Bohlmeijer et al., 2011): The FFMQ-SF is a 24-item scale, found to be highly reliable and valid, assessing different aspects of mindfulness.   Anxiety, ;, ; - Measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) (Lovibond et al., 1995): The DASS has been designed to measure the magnitude of three significant emotional states; depression, anxiety and stress. This is achieved by use of a four point Likert scale that ranges from 0 ""did not apply to me at all"" to 3 ""applied to me very much or most of the time"". The resulting score provides feedback about how the respondents functioning over the past week and how each of these negative emotions has been effecting them.

The questionnaire has been validated with various populations including adolescents (Bernstein et al., 2003)., ;  Coping Skills, ;, ; - Measured using the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) (Endler & Parker, 1990): The CISS has been designed to measure task, emotional and avoidance-orientated coping styles. Respondents are asked to rate their coping styles on a five point Likert scale ranging from 1 ""not at all"" to 5 ""very much"". The three styles of coping reflect the different ways employed by individuals when handling stressful situations and provide insight into whether they react to stress well or poorly., ;  Depression, ;, ; - Measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) (Lovibond et al., 1995): The DASS has been designed to measure the magnitude of three significant emotional states; depression, anxiety and stress.

Details of the allocated groups were then sent to participants by email by independent NHS CCG staff to ensure allocation concealment. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, 1987; Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999) is a newer type of cognitive behaviour therapy, specifically designed to improve psychological flexibility (PF). The intervention will be based on an existing standardised ACT protocol designed for workplace settings described by Flaxman and Bond (2006; see also Flaxman & Bond, 2010a; Flaxman et al., 2013). Participants will be invited to attend four two-hour group sessions. The four-week workshop will be delivered to 10 -15 participants and will occur on four consecutive weeks. It will be facilitated by three experienced mindfulness teachers who are either on the national register or who comply with the Good Practice Guidelines.  Within the workshop, participants will be introduced to different techniques that are designed to: (1) increase their awareness of how they manage unwanted thoughts and emotions; (2) equip them with mindfulness skills (3); help them to clarify their own personal values and to enact behaviours that are consistent with these values. To do this the intervention will also include two of ACT's well-known metaphors (passengers on the bus and the polygraph metaphor (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999)). Participants will be invited to follow-up homework activities. Trainers will be supervised by an expert Clinical Psychologist (CG).

Two occupational therapists from 20 UK hospitals will receive training in the Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation (ESSVR). ESSVR seeks to lessen the impact of stroke by assessing the patient's role as a worker and finding acceptable strategies to overcome problems. ESSVR is individually tailored to participants' needs, starting within eight weeks of stroke, with dose and intensity as needed.  The Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation (ESSVR) model (intervention) will be compared to a usual care (control) group:  Intervention group:  ESSVR will be delivered by a stroke specialist occupational therapist (OT) who is trained to assess the impact of the stroke on the participant and their job; coordinate appropriate support from NHS, employer and other stakeholders; negotiate workplace adjustments, monitor return to work and explore alternatives where current work is not feasible or cannot be sustained. It will be tailored to individual needs.  Usual care (UC) group: Usual NHS rehabilitation provided by usual care team. This may involve outpatient/community physio-, speech- or occupational- therapy, psychology, medical follow-up.

GPs may also prescribe medications for LBP and/or make referrals to other services that can offer other recommended treatments such as exercise programmes, manual therapy or psychological and/or pain management programmes. With regard to pharmacotherapy, recommendations are for NSAIDs or weak opioids only if NSAIDs are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective. Paracetamol is not recommended, neither is the routine use of opioids for LBP. Antidepressants (SSRIs or Tricyclics) are not recommended for LBP.

1638,"Addressing the stigma of mental illness and its effect in the workplace is a contemporary issue in occupational health. The role of leaders is a vital but relatively unexplored dimension of this phenomenon. This study examined the effectiveness and application of an online intervention to reduce depression-related stigma in organizational leaders. A randomized controlled, ""in the field"" study was conducted with 196 leaders. Participants completed an online survey and were randomly assigned to either the experimental or wait-list control group. One week later, participants in the experimental group were given access to a brief online workplace mental health intervention and asked to complete a postsurvey, whereas the control group had to only complete the online postsurvey. Six months later, participants completed a follow-up online survey. Results revealed significant reductions in behavioral and affective depression-related stigma scores among leaders who completed the intervention, compared with the control group. These reductions were similar at 6 months. The factors that enabled or hindered training transfer from the intervention were examined through semistructured interviews with 16 of the participating leaders. Results showed that positive attitudes and high levels of knowledge are not sufficient to ensure leaders apply intervention learning in their work environments. Factors including the nature of the work environment, the collective readiness and capability of the organization to address these issues, the attitudes of others at work, and the broader political context affected the application of learning from the intervention.","Martin A Shann C (2018//).

1639,"Objectives We examined whether a cluster randomized controlled participatory organizational-level workplace intervention affected the level of unnecessary, unreasonable, and illegitimate tasks. Methods A cluster-randomized controlled trial was implemented in municipal pre-schools. The intervention used a participatory approach and aimed improving the psychosocial working environment by focusing on core tasks. The sample consisted of 41 pre-schools with 404 employees in the intervention group and 30 pre-schools with 230 employees in the control group. We measured unnecessary and unreasonable tasks at baseline and at two-year follow-up by one item on unnecessary and one item on unreasonable tasks, respectively, and combined both items into a measure of illegitimate tasks. We analyzed within- and between-groups changes in unnecessary and unreasonable tasks and in the combined measure of illegitimate tasks. Results The scores for unnecessary, unreasonable, and illegitimate tasks remained virtually unchanged in the intervention group and increased in the control group. The different development in the two groups was statistically significant for unreasonable tasks (+0.02 versus +0.13, P=0.04) and the combined measure of illegitimate tasks (+0.01 versus +0.11, P=0.04) but not for unnecessary tasks (+0.00 versus +0.08, P=0.16).

Survey questions covered sociodemographic and employment information, recognition of depression in a vignette, stigma, treatment beliefs, willingness to assist co-workers with mental health problems, help-giving and help-seeking behaviours, and intentions to seek help. Using the baseline dataset associated with the trial, the paper presents a descriptive analysis of mental health literacy and helping behaviours, comparing police station leaders and lower ranks. Results: Respondents were 806 staff, comprising 618 lower-ranked staff and 188 leaders. Almost 84% of respondents were able to correctly label the problem described in the vignette. Among those who had helped someone with a mental health problem, both lower ranks and leaders most commonly reported 'talking to the person' although leaders were more likely to facilitate professional help. Leaders' willingness to assist the person and confidence in doing so was very high, and over 80% of leaders appropriately rated police psychologists, general practitioners, psychologists, talking to a peer and contacting welfare as helpful. However, among both leaders and lower ranks with mental health problems, the proportion of those unlikely to seek professional help was greater than those who were likely to seek it. Conclusion: Knowledge about evidence-based interventions for depression was lower in this police sample than surveys in the general population, pointing to the need for education and training to improve mental health literacy. Such education should also aim to overcome barriers to professional help-seeking. Interventions that aim to improve mental health literacy and help-seeking behaviour appear to be suitable targets for better protecting police member mental health.","Milner AJ Reavley NJ (2018//).

1641,"BACKGROUND: The literature is replete with evidence regarding the impact of psychological distress in the workplace. Traditionally, worksite interventions to enhance mental health have been carried out in groups. This study aimed to implement a brief individual program in the workplace through the combination of Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for Public Administration employees. METHOD: One hundred and six public employees from a Spanish city council completed pretest measures and forty-three met the inclusion criteria. The participants[spacing acute] scores on distress, burnout, psychological flexibility, depression, anxiety and stress were examined in a pretest-posttest design with a waiting list control group and random assignment. Thirty-eight employees completed the intervention (FACT group= 19; Waiting list control group= 19). The intervention lasted three individual sessions using a protocol with the processes of FAP and ACT, resulting in a protocol named FACT. RESULTS: The FACT group showed statistically significant improvements in distress, burnout, psychological flexibility and anxiety compared with the waiting list control group. CONCLUSION: These results provide a breakthrough and initial support for the inclusion of FAP in the workplace along with the integration with brief ACT in individual sessions to improve employees&rsquo; mental health.","Valero-Aguayo L Macias J (2019//).

1642,"Overview: Repetitive exposure to high levels of critical incidents, the need to respond promptly with precision and accuracy, and high expectations of optimal performance all contribute to high levels of stress among police officers, physicians, and military personnel. Chronic stress has been shown to adversely affect physical and mental health and has been linked to diminished performance. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have demonstrated effectiveness in minimizing the damaging consequences of chronic stress among high-stress populations. An important factor influencing MBI outcomes is treatment adherence. Adherence data are important because they elucidate the extent to which adhering to an intervention influences the outcomes of interest. Several studies have documented that participants who endorse more (duration and frequency) mindfulness practice are more likely to have better outcomes. This symposium will present data on the relationship between objective adherence to formal mindfulness practice and healthrelated outcomes in separate randomized controlled trial MBIs among samples of law enforcement officers, physicians, military veterans, and stressed older adults. All of the studies used iMINDr, a custom software application developed for iPod Touch, that objectively tracks home formal mindfulness practice adherence. Additionally, the relationship between self-reported informal mindfulness practice and health-related outcomes will be presented. Participants in the studies exhibited improvement across several healthrelated outcomes following the MBI when compared to waitlist controls. Participants generally reported that iMINDr was acceptable and easy to use. Among highstress populations, different relationships among objective formal mindfulness practice, informal mindfulness practice, and MBI outcomes, including increased resilience and reduced anger and aggression, emerged. The impact of mindfulness practice adherence on MBI outcomes will be discussed as well as preferred practices among these highly stressed populations. Developing culturally sensitive delivery models that increase practice adherence within these populations will also be explored. Rationale: An important and especially salient factor influencing MBI outcomes is adherence to treatment. Adherence data are important because they elucidate the extent to which adhering to an intervention influences the outcomes of interest. Adherence to mindfulness practice is usually assessed through self-report, which limits the accuracy of these findings. Exploring new methods of objectively measuring adherence is critical to our understanding of these practices. In addition to objective assessment of adherence, future research should investigate culturally sensitive delivery models that foster greater mindfulness practice adherence among diverse populations. Objectives: The aim is to discuss the benefits and obstacles of objectively tracking home mindfulness practice adherence; examine the relationships between objective adherence to formal mindfulness practice, informal mindfulness practice, and health-related outcomes following MBI among law enforcement officers, physicians, military veterans, and stressed older adults; learn about the preferred mindfulness practices as well as perceived supports and barriers to practice among highly stressed populations; and explore culturally sensitive delivery models that foster out of session adherence to mindfulness practice.","Wahbeh H Christopher M (2018//).

1643,"Objectives Using an employer's perspective, this study aimed to compare the immediate and longer-term impact of workplace ergonomics and neck-specific exercise versus ergonomics and health promotion information on health-related productivity among a general population of office workers and those with neck pain. Methods A prospective one-year cluster randomized trial was conducted. Participants received an individualized workstation ergonomics intervention, combined with 12 weeks of either workplace neck-specific exercises or health promotion information. Health-related productivity at baseline, post-intervention and 12-months was measured with the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using multilevel mixed models. Results We recruited 763 office workers from 14 organizations and allocated them to 100 clusters. For the general population of office workers, monetized productivity loss at 12 months [AU$1464 (standard deviation [SD] 1318) versus AU$1563 (SD=1039); P=0.023]; and presenteeism at 12 months [2.0 (SD 1.2) versus 2.4 (SD 1.4); P=0.007] was lower in the exercise group compared to those in the health promotion information group. For office workers with neck pain, exercise participants had lower sickness absenteeism at 12 months compared to health promotion information participants [0.7 days (SD 1.0) versus 1.4 days (SD 3.1); P=0.012], despite a short-term increase in sickness absenteeism post-intervention compared to baseline for the exercise group [1.2 days (SD 2.2) versus 0.6 days (SD 0.9); P<0.001]. Conclusion A workplace intervention combining ergonomics and neck-specific exercise offers possible benefits for sickness presenteeism and health-related productivity loss among a general population of office workers and sickness absenteeism for office workers with neck pain in the longer-term.","Comans T Pereira M (2019//).

1644,"BACKGROUND: A growing body of research suggests that resilience training can play a pivotal role in creating mentally healthy workplaces, particularly with regard to protecting the long-term well-being of workers. Emerging research describes positive outcomes from various types of resilience training programs (RTPs) among different occupational groups. One specific group of workers that may benefit from this form of proactive resilience training is first responders. Given the nature of their work, first responders are frequently exposed to stressful circumstances and potentially traumatic events, which may impact their overall resilience and well-being over time. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether a mindfulness-based RTP (the Resilience@Work [RAW] Mindfulness Program) delivered via the internet can effectively enhance resilience among a group of high-risk workers. METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) comprising 24 Primary Fire and Rescue and Hazmat stations within New South Wales. Overall, 12 stations were assigned to the 6-session RAW Mindfulness Program and 12 stations were assigned to the control condition. A total of 143 active full-time firefighters enrolled in the study. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, immediately post training, and at 6-month follow-up. Measurements examined change in both adaptive and bounce-back resilience as well as several secondary outcomes examining resilience resources and acceptance and mindfulness skills. RESULTS: Mixed-model repeated measures analysis found that the overall test of group-by-time interaction was significant (P=.008), with the intervention group increasing in adaptive resilience over time. However, no significant differences were found between the intervention group and the control group in terms of change in bounce-back resilience (P=.09). At 6-month follow-up, the group receiving the RAW intervention had an average increase in their resilience score of 1.3, equating to a moderate-to-large effect size compared with the control group of 0.73 (95% CI 0.38-1.06). Per-protocol analysis found that compared with the control group, the greatest improvements in adaptive resilience were observed among those who completed most of the RAW program, that is, 5 to 6 sessions (P=.002). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this RCT suggest that mindfulness-based resilience training delivered in an internet format can create improvements in adaptive resilience and related resources among high-risk workers, such as first responders. Despite a number of limitations, the results of this study suggest that the RAW Mindfulness Program is an effective, scalable, and practical means of delivering online resilience training in high-risk workplace settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a mindfulness-based RTP delivered entirely via the internet has been tested in the workplace.

1645,"Aim: Up to half of patients with borderline personality disorder report auditory verbal hallucinations that are phenomenologically indistinguishable from those in schizophrenia, occur early in the course of the disorder, and are enduring, distressing and disabling. In clinical practice, this symptom is widely assumed to be unresponsive to treatment with antipsychotic medication and early intervention is rarely offered. The Verbal Experiences Response in Borderline personality disorder to Aripiprazole TrIal Medication (VERBATIM) study aims to be the first controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of conventional pharmacotherapy for this symptom in this patient group. Method: VERBATIM is a 12-week, triple-blind, single-centre, parallel groups randomised controlled trial, with a 27-week follow-up period. Participants between the ages of 15 and 25 years receive either aripiprazole or placebo daily, commencing at 2 mg and increasing to 10 mg by day 15. Further dose escalations (up to 30 mg) may occur, as clinically indicated. This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12616001192471 on 30/08/2016. Results: The primary outcome is severity of auditory verbal hallucinations assessed using the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes include the severity of general psychopathology, borderline personality pathology, social and occupational functioning and change in brain resting state connectivity. The primary endpoint is week 12 and secondary endpoint is week 39. Conclusion: The results will inform treatment decisions for individuals with borderline personality disorder who present with auditory verbal hallucinations.","Betts J Chanen AM (2019//).

1646,"Purpose: As first responders who are frequently exposed to job-related trauma, law enforcement officers are at an elevated risk of adverse health outcomes. The stressful nature of policing and the substantial limitations of both tertiary and secondary prevention suggest a real need for primary prevention research on ways to increase resilience and reduce aggression. The primary objective of this study was to assess feasibility and gather preliminary outcome data on mindfulness-based resilience training (MBRT) for law enforcement officers. Results: Attendance, adherence, posttraining participant feedback, and interventionist fidelity to protocol all demonstrate feasibility of MBRT for law enforcement officers. Compared to waitlist controls, MBRT participants experienced greater reductions in salivary cortisol (AUCi), selfreported aggression, burnout, alcohol use, sleep disturbance, and increases in psychological flexibility and nonreactivity at posttraining; however, group differences were not maintained at 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: This initial randomized trial suggests MBRT is a feasible intervention, and a larger fully powered randomized Controlled trial is warranted. Outcome data suggest that MBRT targets key physiological, psychological, and health risk factors in law enforcement officers, consistent with the potential to improve officer health and public safety. However, follow-up training or ""booster"" sessions may be needed to maintain training gains.","Goerling SR Hunsinger M (2018//).

Enhancing self-management is the core of this intervention and also a new approach compared to earlier efforts to promote work capacity.","NCT03748394 (2018//).

1648,"Law enforcement officers (LEOs) are exposed to significant stressors, elevating their risk for aggression and excessive use of force. Such dysfunctional stress reactivity can lead to devastating consequences for their community, including unjustified shootings, severe beatings, and fatal chokings. It can also lead to serious consequences for the LEOs, including elevated incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout, alcohol misuse, depression, and suicide. A recent meta-analysis of LEO stress reduction programs found little evidence to demonstrate that such approaches are effective, highlighting the urgent need for preventive interventions targeting the stress inherent to policing. Mindfulness training is a promising approach with high-stress populations that has been shown effective in reducing stress and increasing resilience. In a recent pilot feasibility study (R21AT008854), the study team established initial feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to procedures in a single-site RCT assessing Mindfulness-Based Resilience Training (MBRT), a preventive intervention designed to improve LEO mental health and resilience, and reduce aggression and excessive use of force. The R21 data suggest physiological mechanisms and potential clinical benefit in a sample of LEOs. Relative to waitlist control, MBRT participants showed improvements in stress reactivity, aggression, burnout, occupational stress, sleep disturbance, and psychological flexibility. Implemented at two sites, the proposed study is designed to establish optimal protocols and procedures for a future full-scale, multi-site trial assessing effects of MBRT versus an attention control (Stress Management Education) and a no-intervention control, on physiological, behavioral, and psychological outcomes. To prepare for this future clinical trial, this study will: a) enhance efficiency of recruitment, engagement and retention; b) optimize lab, assessment, and data management procedures; c) optimize intervention training and ensure fidelity to intervention protocols; and d) assess participant experience and optimize outcome measures across sites. The long-term objective of this line of research is to develop an intervention that will reduce violence and increase resilience among LEOs, as well as yield significant benefits for communities and residents they serve.","NCT03784846 (2018//).

Patients selected for the study, are centrally randomized (randomization is performed at the Sant'Andrea Hospital) to receive BCG induction treatment according to the standard protocol (an instillation once a week for six weeks) with Immucyst (81 mg Connaught strain BCG). Patients in group two received BCG treatment with the same protocol with a 40 mg mitomycin instillation the day before ., Adverse Events All the adverse events that will occur in the study will be recorded in the case report form (CRF)., An adverse event (AE) is defined as a harmful clinical event occurring in a patient or a human volunteer involved in a clinical experimentation who received a drug that does not necessarily have a relationship with the treatment given. It is considered AE any medical occurrence including undesirable signs or symptoms or abnormal lab finding., A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE that, independently from the dosage of the drug used, had one of the following characteristic:, 1. Results in death, 2. It's life threatening (i.e. the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event;      it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were      more severe), 3. It's cause of hospital admission or increase the time of hospitalization, 4. It's cause of congenital abnormalities at birth, 5. It's cause of disability or severe and long lasting inability Treatment Emergent Adverse      Events (TEAE) is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the      treatments or any event already present that worsens in the either intensity or      frequency following exposure to the treatments., A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is the term used to refer to an adverse event that occurs in a clinical trial subject, which is assessed as being unexpected, serious and as having a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship with the study drug. It is defined as an untoward and unintended response to a study drug, at any dose, which is not listed in the product information, and meets one of the above mentioned serious characteristics., Generally AEs are collected after signing the informed consent form and could be related or unrelated to the study drug., For any AE/SAE recorded during the study a causal relationship with the drug used will be assessed as follows:, -  Very likely: the AE/SAE is temporally associated to the drug administration, cannot be      explained by other clinical conditions and/or concomitant treatments, disappears with      drug withdrawal and recurs after drug reintroduction;, -  Likely: the AE/SAE is temporally associated to the drug administration, cannot be      explained by other clinical conditions and/or concomitant treatments, disappears with      the drug withdrawal. There is no information on drug reintroduction;, -  Possible: the AE/SAE is temporally associated to the drug administration, cannot be      explained by other clinical conditions and/or concomitant treatments, disappears with      drug. There is no information available on the drug withdrawal and reintroduction;, -  Doubtful: the AE/SAE could be temporally associated to the drug administration, but can      be explained by other clinical conditions and/or concomitant treatments;, -  Not correlated: the AE/SAE is not temporally associated to the drug administration      and/or can be explained by other clinical conditions and/or concomitant treatments., -  An AE/SAE with causal relationship very likely, likely possible with the drug is      considered correlated with it and is defined Adverse Reaction (ADR)., World Health Organization (WHO) defines ADR as ""a response to a drug which is noxious & unintended and which occurs at doses normally used for prophylaxis diagnosis or therapy of a disease or for modification of a physiological function""., The difference between AE and ADR is that AE event does not imply causality but not for ADR, a causal rule is suspected., An ADR unexpected is defined an ADR that for nature and severity is not listed in the product information (Reference Safety Information (RSI)/Investigator's Brochure (IB))., Toxicity evaluation Urine culture is performed 3 days before each bladder instillation to check urine sterility (mandatory before the first course, optional before the following instillations). Treatment related adverse events are recorded by the patients on a diary., Outcome analysis: adverse events are self-recorded by the patients after each instillation and classified by the investigator according to a classification grid considering account duration and intensity as proposed by Saint et al. Thus, toxicity is classified as systemic or local and class I (mild) up to class III (severe). The baseline symptoms are also assessed. Local toxicity included bacterial cystitis, BCG induced cystitis, frequency, macroscopic hematuria and ""other"". Bacterial cystitis is defined as the occurrence of culture proven (not BCG) bacterial cystitis. Irritative bladder symptoms with negative urine culture are classified as BCG induced (chemical) cystitis. ""Other"" local side effects include granulomatous prostatitis, epididymitis, ureteral obstruction and contracted bladder. Systemic side effects are classified as fever (>=39 [degrees]C), influenza like symptoms including general malaise and chills, BCG induced lung infection, liver toxicity, and BCG sepsis. Skin rash, arthralgia and arthritis are classified as possible allergic reactions. Based on the severity of adverse events experienced by the patient, one of the investigator, who is blind to the given therapy, decides whether the next instillation is to be done, postponed, deleted or whether the patient should receive specific anti-tuberculosis therapy. Dose reduction is not allowed in either group. Patients will also complete flow-volume charts for three days after BCG instillations and two questionaries to assess urinary symptoms and patient's perception of bladder pain as the chronic prostatitis symptoms index (NIH-CPSI) and the pelvic pain and urgency/frequency questionaire (PUF). The efficacy of both treatments is assessed at 3, 6,9,12 months with flexible cystoscopy, urinary cytology and bladder biopsy if needed., STATISTYCAL ANALYSIS Using type I error, and a power of 2.5% and 81% respectively, and by proposing the hypothesis that Immucyst induced a recurrence in about 60% of cases (EORTC risk score 10) and its combination with mitomycin decreases this percent by 30%, it was calculated that 66 subjects per group were necessary to detect this difference using the adjusted chi-square method and Statistical Solution calculator. Student's T test was used for continuous variables. Two-sided p values were calculated.","NCT03790384 (2018//).

1650,"This is a pilot prospective, randomized, interventional controlled clinical trial. Our study at the NICoE site will specifically target active or retired SMs who are OIF/OEF/OND veterans of any age and either gender who meet criteria for PTSD and have a lifetime history of mTBI. Comorbid PTSD and mTBI is highly prevalent in SMs and veterans of the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and having both diagnoses is associated with significantly greater symptom severity than either PTSD or mTBI alone (Brenner et al., 2010). TBI, the great majority of which is mTBI, is one of the most challenging, significant, and costly problems facing the DoD, and inhibiting readiness, whether in times of war or peace. Currently, no therapy has yet been proven efficacious in reducing persistent symptoms after TBI. Many patients with PTSD, particularly when it is combat-related, still suffer from substantial residual symptoms even after undergoing evidence-based psychotherapy (Watts et al., 2013; Bradley et al., 2001; Bison et al., 2007) and many even maintain their PTSD diagnosis (Steenkamp et al., 2015). The novel elements of 3MDR may prove to be particularly beneficial for those with both PTSD and a history of mTBI. If our approach is proven effective, there will be a sizeable population for whom this treatment could be provided, translating into both individual and DoD-wide benefit. Both TBI and PTSD have become signature wounds of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and pose significant health concerns for many military personnel. Currently, no intervention has yet been proven efficacious in reducing long-term symptoms of TBI. Furthermore, individuals with PTSD often have persistent symptoms even after completing validated treatments., The proposed research has the potential to have a significant positive impact on the care of individuals with both PTSD and mTBI. As previously stated, 3MDR combines emotional exposure, dual-task processing, attenuation of working memory resources, and physical activity. Physical activity may be particularly beneficial in enhancing blood flow to the brain and facilitating production of beneficial factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In addition, participants have the opportunity to demonstrate to themselves that they can actively overcome their avoidance by approaching and walking toward, or deliberately confronting, representations of their own traumatic memories. This approach may be particularly useful or of interest to veterans and SMs, who are accustomed to being physically active, may be less inclined to turn to pharmacotherapy than others with PTSD, and also have had high dropout rates and greater resistance to established, more traditional therapies. This relatively short treatment approach could have tremendous implications for improvement in symptoms as well as quality of life in individuals with PTSD and mTBI. Prior to any other study procedures, written informed consent will be obtained from each participant by the principal investigator (PI) or another study staff member trained by the PI to obtain informed consent. The PI will then complete a medical history and a series of questionnaires, to include a review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, to ensure that each participant is eligible to be enrolled in the study. A random number table will be used to randomly assign participants to either the eye movement (EM+) or no eye movement (EM-) group., Table 1, Weeks Months 0, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 3 6 Consent X, 3MDR Preparatory Sessions, X X X, 3MDR CAREN Sessions, X X X X X X, Wrap-up Session, X, Post-Therapy Follow-Up, X X, Intervention All participants will complete 10 treatment sessions (three preparatory sessions, six 3MDR sessions and one concluding session; see Table 1), led by a therapist who has been completed training in the conduct of this form of therapy, with the only difference between the intervention groups being the presence (EM+) or absence (EM-) of the eye movement component. Dr. Eric Vermetten, head of research at the Military Mental Health unit of the Netherlands Ministry of Defense, and one of the developers of the 3MDR system, will conduct the training of all study therapists, will ensure that they are fully prepared to carry out the treatment protocol using the study manual he wrote, and he will provide regular supervision for the study therapists throughout the conduct of the study., Preparatory Session 1: Research personnel will explain the upcoming 3MDR therapy sessions. Participants will be asked to identify 14 photographs, as well as two songs. The photographs may be digital, hard copy, or downloaded from the internet, and should be related to or reminiscent of the participant's traumatic experience. Each of the two songs are selected for specific purposes and will be played in their entirety during each of the 3MDR sessions. The first song is intended to bring them back to the time in which the trauma occurred; for example, for a service member with combat-related PTSD, this might be a song that they listened to a lot during their deployment. This will be played at the start of the 3MDR session while the participant walks at a comfortable pace through a virtual environment, before any of their pictures are displayed. The second song, on the other hand, is specifically chosen in order to bring them back to the present time, to remind them they are safe and are in the present moment., Preparatory Session 2: The participant will share their photographs and music selections with the therapist. If the participant has difficulty identifying a sufficient number of appropriate photographs, the therapist will work with the participant during this session to identify why they may not have been able to come up with a sufficient number, and to help them find suitable options. This could include conducting online searches for publicly available pictures, including such options as Google Maps images of the area in which their trauma occurred. Sometimes, difficulty in the selection of pictures is a manifestation of the avoidance of any reminders of the traumatic, which is a cardinal feature of PTSD. The therapist may at this time explore the avoidance, if it is perceived to be a significant factor, and help the participant to work through and overcome it to a sufficient degree to identify suitable pictures to use in the treatment sessions. While the selection of songs does not usually pose as significant a challenge, the therapist will also review the participant's song selections, discuss why they were chosen, and try to ensure that the songs selected are suitable to take the participant back to the trauma, and then bring them back to the present and help them differentiate past from present, respectively. The therapist will then guide the participant to arrange their photographs according to their subjective units of distress (SUDS; Wolp,1969). The SUDS is a verbal self-report rating of subjective distress on a scale from 0-10, with 0 indicating no distress, and 10 representing maximum distress. The SUDS scale will be explained verbally to the participant and is not given via pencil and paper format. This will be used to rank the pictures for use during 3MDR treatment., Preparatory Session 3: Participants will be introduced to, and familiarized with, the CAREN system (e.g., standing, shifting weight, and walking) located at the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE). Participants will be fitted by the engineer with a safety harness that will be worn for the entirety of each session that a participant is on the CAREN platform. In this session, a series of introductory applications will be used to familiarize the participant with the CAREN, which will take less than five minutes to perform. A short practice 3MDR session with a non-affecting photograph (e.g., a flower) will be conducted., 3MDR Sessions 1-6: A 3MDR trained therapist, as well as a CAREN engineer, will be present at every 3MDR therapy session., Since sessions only include level treadmill walking, the platform will be disengaged with the bridge extended, as opposed to being separated from the main floor and set up to enable left-right and forward-backward shifts from the horizontal. This will minimize equipment noise and facilitate the communication between the therapist and participant. For participant monitoring and objective data collection, heart rate and kinematic data will be collected. A chest strap heart rate monitor will be worn by the participant throughout the session (Polar Electro Inc., Woodbury, NY; Zephyr Performance Systems, Annapolis, MD). Reflective motion capture markers will be placed on the participant's head, torso, and legs to measure biomechanics collected via motion capture cameras (Motion Analysis Inc., Santa Rosa, CA) that surround the CAREN., Participants will then be fitted with an adjustable safety harness that fits comfortably over the shoulders. There is a risk of skin chafing if there is a lot of movement and the harness is not fitted properly. Each participant will be asked if they are comfortable throughout the study to mitigate this risk. The safety harness will be slipped into the safety support on the CAREN, which allows the participant to walk freely on the treadmill, but it does not allow them to walk off the platform. There is also a safety bar in front of the participant. The therapist will stand next to the participant during the session, on the edge of the platform but not on the treadmill. Up to seven pictures will be selected based on the participant's SUDS scores and/or themes agreed upon for each session. Pictures may be repeated during a session, reducing the number of pictures used for some sessions; this will be at the discretion of the treating therapist., Each session has three phases: warm-up, intervention, and cool-down. The participant's preferred walking speed will be used to start the warm-up phase (2-5 min) and can be adjusted as needed. During this phase, the participant will virtually walk along an outdoor pathway toward a door while their chosen opening song plays to bring them back to a time of their trigger, as verbal guidance from their therapist prepares them for the intervention phase., The CAREN system will be operated by a Biomedical Engineer, Sarah Kruger, who has been operating CAREN systems since 2007, and is certified by Motekforce Link. Motekforce Link is the manufacturer of the CAREN system. Motekforce Link provides CAREN operators with training and also verifies competencies required for system operation., During utilization, the system is operated by a certified CAREN Operator and per protocol, at no time will the system be operated with less than two staff members in the room., System checks are run daily by the CAREN Operator. All equipment is calibrated and maintained. Personnel from Motekforce Link visit annually to verify that everything is working properly and make any changes that are necessary., In the intervention phase (50-55 min), the participant passes through an initial hallway leading to an open door that in turn leads them down a second hallway to approach their first picture, while being guided by the therapist with regard to what to do at each stage. The picture appears in the distance, but gradually becomes larger as they get closer to it, until it fills their field of vision. As soon as the participant is able to see the picture clearly, the therapist will request that they provide a detailed description of what the picture represents to them, and will then go on to ask the participant about their related memories and feelings. The therapist will verbally repeat key feelings and phrases that seem to carry particular meaning and resonance for the participant, so the CAREN engineer can type these words into the computer to have them appear superimposed over the picture (stage 1)., For those in the EM+ intervention group, the EM component will start after the participant has confirmed there are no more new feelings or words to be identified with the picture, and the therapist has asked the participant to read each of these words aloud, after which the engineer will remove the words from the screen but retain the picture. At this point a red ball will start at the left edge of the screen, and will move across the screen fairly rapidly from left to right, and upon reaching the right edge of the screen, a 2-digit number will appear superimposed on the red ball in white font (stage 2). The ball will then reverse course, passing from right to left, and the number will change as the ball meets the opposite edge of the screen. The ball will continue to move back and forth and the number will change every time the ball meets either edge of the screen. The participant will be asked to track the ball and call out the numbers displayed on the ball. After approximately 60 seconds, the distractor stimulus (ball image) is removed and a SUDS score is reported by the participant and recorded by the CAREN operator (stage 3). The participant will then walk out of the virtual hallway and onto an outdoor pathway that will lead them to another set of hallways, leading in turn to another picture, and the stages are repeated. There will be no exposure to the distractor stimulus (red ball) for those in the EM- intervention group., After the last picture, the final phase of treatment (cool-down) begins (2-5 min). The session concludes with a piece of music, chosen by the participant to bring them back to the present time, typically a current favorite song of theirs. This music will be used to assist the participant in returning back to the present moment, while the therapist simultaneously provides them with positive feedback regarding their performance during the session, with a goal of achieving a significantly reduced SUDS score, which is reassessed at the end of the song., Following the session, the CAREN operator will remove the safety harness from the participant. Participants will also be able to stop the session at any time if they feel ill or any motion sickness. A therapist-led discussion (approximately 15 minutes) with the participant will then occur in a private room; open questions will be used to elicit how the session was for the participant, and to discuss the purpose of re-experiencing to the participant in this setting. Notes made by the therapist will be stored, identified by study code and session number only, stored in password-protected files on a CAC-requiring computer. The study therapist will ensure the participant has completely returned to the present moment, has a reduced SUDS, and has ideally been able to attach a positive meaning to the 3MDR session. Participants will be asked to write their experiences and reflections down following each session in a diary format. All sessions will be recorded and a report summarizing the behavioral response to the intervention will be produced., Concluding Session: Participants will provide their perception of how beneficial the treatment was, and if the current state of their symptoms will be discussed, with a focus on to what degree they have or have not improved compared to prior to their participation in the study., Participants will return to the laboratory to complete follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months. If participants are unable to return to the laboratory (i.e., no longer in the area), they will be contacted via phone, and the study questionnaires will be completed telephonically.","NCT03796936 (2019//).  3MDR to Treat PTSD With mTBI (3MDR) Clinical Trial of 3MDR to Treat PTSD With mTBI, With and Without Eye Movement (3MDR), #volume#(#issue#),  #Pages#",0,,1338
1651,"Approach: Employees will be given study flyers describing the study and encouraged to call a project hotline to evaluate their study eligibility. Eligible participants will be scheduled for an in-person study baseline and neuroimaging appointment at Carnegie Mellon University where they will provide written informed consent, complete baseline survey measures, provide several drops of blood via a finger prick (Dried Blood Spot (DBS) samples), and complete a 60-minute neuroimaging scan. After completing baseline measures participants will be instructed on how to download and use the Headspace smartphone app, and will be randomly assigned to one of the two programs. Participants will be asked to complete a 7- minute end-of-day daily diary measure each day during the treatment period, which will measure stress, affect, sleep, and workplace perceptions (a text message link will be sent an hour before the participant's standard bedtime each day). The project team will monitor treatment adherence (participants who do not complete a daily practice session will be called and reminded the following day). In the week following the end of the treatment period, participants will be scheduled to come back to Carnegie Mellon for a post-treatment appointment where they will complete the same measures as at baseline (survey measures, DBS, and neuroimaging). Participants will then be debriefed, compensated, and dismissed. Approximately two months after participants complete the 30-day program, we will call them for a 15-minute follow-up call. During this call, participants will answer a few questionnaire items and a brief program evaluation., Interventions: Participants will be asked to complete one lesson daily for 30- days on the Headspace app; the first ten lessons will be 10 minutes long, the next ten will be 15 minutes long, and the final ten will be 20 minutes long. The mindfulness program will consist of the standard base program offered in Headspace. The Recharge program will consist of problem solving and stress management instruction., Setting and Participants: David Creswell's Health and Human Performance Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University will direct this study.

1652,"Background: Low-wage workers suffer disproportionately high rates of chronic disease and are important targets for workplace health and safety interventions. Child care centers offer an ideal opportunity to reach some of the lowest paid workers, but these settings have been ignored in workplace intervention studies. Methods: Caring and Reaching for Health (CARE) is a cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating efficacy of a multi-level, workplace-based intervention set in child care centers that promotes physical activity and other health behaviors among staff. Centers are randomized (1:1) into the Healthy Lifestyles (intervention) or the Healthy Finances (attention control) program. Healthy Lifestyles is delivered over six months including a kick-off event and three 8-week health campaigns (magazines, goal setting, behavior monitoring, tailored feedback, prompts, center displays, director coaching). The primary outcome is minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA); secondary outcomes are health behaviors (diet, smoking, sleep, stress), physical assessments (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, fitness), and workplace supports for health and safety. Results: In total, 56 centers and 553 participants have been recruited and randomized. Participants are predominately female (96.7%) and either Non-Hispanic African American (51.6%) or Non-Hispanic White (36.7%). Most participants (63.4%) are obese. They accumulate 17.4 (+/-14.2) minutes/day of MVPA and consume 1.3 (+/-1.4) and 1.3 (+/-0.8) servings/day of fruits and vegetables, respectively. Also, 14.2% are smokers; they report 6.4 (+/-1.4) hours/night of sleep; and 34.9% are high risk for depression. Conclusions: Baseline data demonstrate several serious health risks, confirming the importance of workplace interventions in child care.","Vaughn AE Ward DS (2018//).

1653,"Objective: Work disability rates are high among people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal conditions. Effective disability preventive programs are needed. We examined the efficacy of a modified vocational rehabilitation approach delivered by trained occupational therapists and physical therapists on work limitation and work loss over 2 years among people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal conditions. Methods: Eligibility criteria for this single-blind, parallel-arm randomized trial included ages 21-65 years, 15 or more hours/week employment, a self-reported doctor-diagnosed rheumatic or musculoskeletal condition, and concern about staying employed. The intervention consisted of a 1.5-hour meeting, an action plan, written materials on employment supports, and telephone calls at 3 weeks and 3 months. Control group participants received the written materials. The primary outcome was the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) output job demand subscale. The secondary outcome was work loss. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed. Results: Between October 2011 and January 2014, 652 individuals were assessed for eligibility. A total of 287 participants were randomized: 143 intervention and 144 control participants. In total, 264 participants (92%) completed 2-year data collection. There was no difference in the mean +/- SD WLQ change scores from baseline to 2-year followup (-8.6 +/- 1.9 intervention versus -8.3 +/- 2.2 control; P = 0.93). Of the 36 participants who experienced permanent work loss at 2 years, 11 (8%) were intervention participants and 25 (18%) control participants (P = 0.03). Conclusion: The intervention did not have an effect on work limitations but reduced work loss. The intervention can be delivered by trained rehabilitation therapists.","LaValley MP Keysor JJ (2018//).

1654,"We investigated whether a mindfulness meditation program delivered via a smartphone application could improve psychological well-being, reduce job strain, and reduce ambulatory blood pressure during the workday. Participants were 238 healthy employees from two large United Kingdom companies that were randomized to a mindfulness meditation practice app or a wait-list control condition. The app offered 45 prerecorded 10- to 20-min guided audio meditations. Participants were asked to complete one meditation per day. Psychosocial measures and blood pressure throughout one working day were measured at baseline and eight weeks later; a follow-up survey was also emailed to participants 16 weeks after the intervention start. Usage data showed that during the 8-week intervention period, participants randomized to the intervention completed an average of 17 meditation sessions (range 0-45 sessions). The intervention group reported significant improvement in well-being, distress, job strain, and perceptions of workplace social support compared to the control group. In addition, the intervention group had a marginally significant decrease in self-measured workday systolic blood pressure from pre- to postintervention. Sustained positive effects in the intervention group were found for well-being and job strain at the 16-week follow-up assessment. This trial suggests that short guided mindfulness meditations delivered via smartphone and practiced multiple times per week can improve outcomes related to work stress and well-being, with potentially lasting effects.","Crosswell AD Bostock S (2018//).

1655,"Although calls for intervention designs are numerous within the organizational literature and increasing efforts are being made to conduct rigorous randomized controlled trials, existing studies have rarely evaluated the long-term sustainability of workplace health intervention outcomes, or mechanisms of this process. This is especially the case with regard to objective and subjective sleep outcomes. We hypothesized that a work-family intervention would increase both self-reported and objective actigraphic measures of sleep quantity and sleep quality at 6 and 18 months post-baseline in a sample of information technology workers from a U.S. Fortune 500 company. Significant intervention effects were found on objective actigraphic total sleep time and self-reported sleep insufficiency at the 6- and 18-month follow-up, with no significant decay occurring over time. However, no significant intervention effects were found for objective actigraphic wake after sleep onset or self-reported insomnia symptoms. A significant indirect effect was found for the effect of the intervention on objective actigraphic total sleep time through the proximal intervention target of 6-month control over work schedule and subsequent more distal 12-month family time adequacy. These results highlight the value of long-term occupational health intervention research, while also highlighting the utility of this work-family intervention with respect to some aspects of sleep.","Hammer LB Crain TL (2018//).

1656,"Introduction: The ubiquitous smartphone technology and societal pressures of constant connection have increased at an accelerated pace during the past decade, resulting in an always-on society. All too often, this has led to the belief that sleep is a dispensable luxury. The price is huge, as sleep deficiencies of many kinds have reached the level of a pandemic, affecting health, mood, life expectancy, and performance. However, we can use technology to undo the damages caused by technology itself. To test the above, Aetna initiated a randomized controlled trial to validate the efficacy of a mobile CBTI solution for improving sleep quality, workplace productivity, and quality of life in a commercial business population. Methods: 500 employees were recruited and surveyed for Insomnia using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Workplace Productivity and Impairment (WPAI), and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). Participants were stratified to sleep scores and randomly assigned to intervention/waiting list groups. The intervention consisted of a mobile application (SleepRate) and digital assessment for Insomnia based on both subjective and measured sleep data over seven nights, followed by weekly cycles of personalized, adaptive digital guidance relying on accepted protocols of CBTI. A second survey was administered at week 6, and the final survey at week 12. Results: Of the 250 who received the application, 183 completed a baseline sleep assessment, and 83 completed 3 weeks of digital therapy with an weekly average of 5 tracked nights. At the end of 12 weeks, PSQI scores were 68% lower compared to the control group (P = 0.00), improving 4.8 points from baseline. Workplace presenteeism was 49.4% lower than for the control (P=0.00), and the HRQOL indicated 4.8 Healthy Days (P=0.00) per month were added to application users. Daytime sleepiness and sleep satisfaction also improved significantly. Conclusion: The availability of digital health technology allows people to diminish their sleep deficiencies in the comfort of their own home, leading to greater workplace productivity and quality of life.","Niejadlik K Baharav A (2018//).

1657,"Background: Outpatient fatigue management education by occupational therapists in persons with MS (pwMS) is efficient, but no program is available for the inpatient setting. To close this gap an inpatient energy management education (IEME) was developed. Aim: To evaluate the feasibility of a RCT study-protocol and to explore the effect of IEME on self-efficacy and fatigue Methods: Design: RCT. Sampling: Persons with MS-related fatigue during a three-week inpatient rehabilitation at Rehabilitation Centre Valens. Interventions: Six IEME or progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) group sessions as part of a personalized rehabilitation program. Data-collection: Evaluation of recruitment and assessment procedures, drop-out and follow-up rate, treatment fidelity, compliance with therapy and six telephone-interviews with IEME-participants after returning home. Outcomes were fatigue impact, self-efficacy, quality of life and occupational performance at baseline, discharge and 16 weeks follow-up. Results: Between July and November 2017, 47/83 pwMS were included and randomized (IEME:24/PMR:23). Reasons for discontinued participation were preliminary discharge and insufficient energy for the strenuous rehabilitation program (IEME:2/ PMR:4). Treatment fidelity was high and 89% of all tasks were completed. SF 36 at discharge (T1) was not suitable as questions relate to everyday situations in the usual environment not fitting with changed routines during inpatient-stay. At T1 there were no differences in fatigue between groups, but a significant difference in self-efficacy applying energy conservation strategies, and a reduced demand for individual OT-sessions in the IEME group. At the follow-up, participants at home reported the exchange in the IEME groups as being positive, they were more aware of energy management and had introduced changes in daily routine. Data analysis from the 4-month follow-up until March 2018 will depict the effect of IEME on self-efficacy in everyday life. Conclusion: The feasibility of the study protocol was confirmed and preliminary effects of IEME are promising.","Kool J Weise A (2018//).

1658,"Background.- Cognitive deficits are a core feature in psychiatric disorders. Two studies were performed to further analyse cognitive dysfunction and its remediation in affective disorders. Methods.- Study I - 43 remitted bipolar patients and 40 healthy controls were assessed with a neurocognitive test battery. In a randomised controlled trial, patients were assigned to addon cognitive psychoeducational group therapy (CPEGT) over 14 weeks or to treatment-as-usual. A 12-month follow-up was performed. Study II - 90 probands each with major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia and healthy controls were included. A German version of the SCIP (Purdon, 2005) was first validated and then used. 50 patients each with MDD and schizophrenia were tested before and after a combination therapy with drugs and cognitive remediation. Results.- Study I - Compared to healthy controls, bipolar patients showed lower performance in executive function and sustained attention. CPEGT and attention predicted occupational functioning. Verbal memory recall was found to be a predictor for symptom severity. Study II - Schizophrenic patients showed significant cognitive impairment compared to healthy probands. Patients with MDD showed an intermediate degree of impairment. In addition, the SCIP was able to detect an improvement in cognitive function in both MDD and schizophrenia patients after cognitive remediation. Conclusions.- Bipolar patients benefit from CPEGT in the domain of occupational life. Deficits in sustained attention have an impact on occupational impairment. The SCIP in its German version is able to detect cognitive dysfunction and effects of cognitive remediation in MDD patients.","Maihofer E Sachs G (2018//).

1659,"Objectives: Patients with spastic hemiparesis after stroke often exhibit limited shoulder movement. The purpose of this study was compared the effectiveness of static progressive shoulder splinting (JAS Joint Active Systems) with traditional neurophysiological approaches (PNF, Vojta). Methods: In this pilot trial, we enrolled adults at least 1year after stroke. A volunteer sample of 23 patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group A or control group B. Intervention includes 4 weeks of intensive institutional treatment and then 4 weeks of home based self rehabiliation treatment. In addition, the experimental group received static progressive stretching 2 times per day for 30 minutes, 2 times 30sec series of repeated active shoulder flexion and abduction efforts at maximal speed and aerobic activities. The control group recieved 30 minutes of individual physiotherapy, 30 minutes of occupational therapy and robotic rehabilitation. Assessment performed at the start, 4 and 8 week. The primary outcome, measures by blinded assessor, was change of external rotation passive range of motion (PROM). Secondary outcome were changes in spasticity (Tardieu scale) and AROM. Results: In comparison of the experimental (n=10) with the control subject (n=13) PROM (Graph 1) and AROM (Graph 2) of shoulder external rotation was significantly different in both groups F(2,42)=7.68, p=0.001, F(2,42)=3.51, p=0.039. Post-hoc analysis showed significant difference between input and subsequent measurements (p < 0.001 in both cases) in the experimental group.

1660,"Combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most common psychological health condition in military service members and veterans who have deployed to the combat theater since September 11, 2001. One of the highest research priorities for the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs is to develop and evaluate the most efficient and efficacious treatments possible for combat-related PTSD. However, the treatment of combat-related PTSD in military service members and veterans has been significantly more challenging than the treatment of PTSD in civilians. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated large posttreatment effect sizes for PTSD in civilian populations. However, recent randomized clinical trials of service members and veterans have achieved lesser reductions in PTSD symptoms. These results suggest that combat-related PTSD is unique. Innovative approaches are needed to augment established evidence-based treatments with targeted interventions that address the distinctive elements of combat-related traumas. This paper describes the design, methodology, and protocol of a randomized clinical trial to compare two intensive prolonged exposure therapy treatments for combat-related PTSD in active duty military service members and veterans and that can be administered in an acceptable, efficient manner in this population. Both interventions include intensive daily treatment over a 3-week period and a number of treatment enhancements hypothesized to result in greater reductions in combat-related PTSD symptoms. The study is designed to advance the delivery of care for combat-related PTSD by developing and evaluating the most potent treatments possible to reduce PTSD symptomatology and improve psychological, social, and occupational functioning.","Foa EB Peterson AL (2018//).

1661,"Objective This study aimed to estimate and evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of a guided internet- and mobile-supported occupational stress-management intervention (iSMI) for employees from the employer's perspective alongside a randomized controlled trial. Methods A sample of 264 employees with elevated symptoms of perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-10 >=22) was randomly assigned either to the iSMI or a waitlist control (WLC) group with unrestricted access to treatment as usual. The iSMI consisted of seven sessions of problem-solving and emotion-regulation techniques and one booster session. Self-report data on symptoms of perceived stress and economic data were assessed at baseline, and at six months following randomization. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) with symptom-free status as the main outcome from the employer's perspective was carried out. Statistical uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping (N=5000). Results The CBA yielded a net-benefit of [Euro sign]181 [95% confidence interval (CI) -6043-1042] per participant within the first six months following randomization. CEA showed that at a willingness-to-pay ceiling of [Euro sign]0, [Euro sign]1000, [Euro sign]2000 for one additional symptom free employee yielded a 67%, 90%, and 98% probability, respectively, of the intervention being cost-effective compared to the WLC.

1662,"Aim: It is now necessary to investigate whether recovery in psychosis is possible without the use of antipsychotic medication. This study will determine (1) whether a first-episode psychosis (FEP) group receiving intensive psychosocial interventions alone can achieve symptomatic remission and functional recovery; (2) whether prolonging the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) in a sub-group according to randomisation will be associated with a poorer outcome and thereby establish whether the relationship between DUP and outcome is causative; and (3) whether neurobiological changes observed in FEP are associated with the psychotic disorder or antipsychotic medication. Baseline characteristics of participants will be presented. Methods: This study is a triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial. The primary outcome is the level of functioning measured by the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale at 6months. This study is being conducted at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, Melbourne and includes young people aged 15 to 24years with a DSM-IV psychotic disorder, a DUP less than 6months and not high risk for suicide or harm to others. Strict discontinuation criteria are being applied. Participants are also undergoing three 3-Tesla-MRI scans. Results: Ninety participants have been recruited and baseline characteristics are presented. Conclusions: Staged treatment and acceptability guidelines in early psychosis will determine whether antipsychotic medications are indicated in all young people with a FEP and whether antipsychotic medication can be safely delayed. Furthermore, the relative contribution of psychotic illness and antipsychotic medication in terms of structural brain changes will also be elucidated.

Robotic therapy is one method to recover arm function, but its research is still in its infancy. Research questions of this study is to investigate how to maximize the benefit of robotic therapy using ReoGo-J for arm hemiplegia in chronic stroke patients. Methods: Design of this study is a multi-center parallel group trial following the prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) study model. Participants and setting will be 120 chronic stroke patients (over 6 months post-stroke) will be randomly allocated to three different rehabilitation protocols. In this study, the control group will receive 20 min of standard rehabilitation (conventional occupational therapy) and 40 min of self-training (i.e., sanding, placing and stretching). The robotic therapy group will receive 20 min of standard rehabilitation and 40 min of robotic therapy using ReoGo(R)-J device. The combined therapy group will receive 40 min of robotic therapy and 20 min of constraint-induced movement therapy (protocol to improve upper-limb use in ADL suggests).

1664,"Objectives This study aimed to assess the economic credentials of a workplace-delivered intervention to reduce sitting time among desk-based workers. Methods We performed within-trial cost-efficacy analysis and long-term cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and recruited 231 desk-based workers, aged 24-65 years, across 14 worksites of one organization. Multicomponent workplace-delivered intervention was compared to usual practice. Main outcome measures including total device-measured workplace sitting time, body mass index (BMI), self-reported health-related quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life-8D, AQoL-8D), and absenteeism measured at 12 months. Results Compared to usual practice, the intervention was associated with greater cost (AU$431/person), benefits in terms of reduced workplace sitting time [-46.8 minutes/8-hour workday, 95% confidence interval (CI): -69.9- -23.7] and increased workplace standing time (42.2 minutes/8-hour workday, 95% CI 23.8-60.6). However, there were no significant benefits for BMI [0.148 kg/m2 (95% CI-1.407-1.703)], QoL-8D [-0.006 (95% CI -0.074-0.063)] and absenteeism [2.12 days (95% CI -2.01-6.26)]. The incremental cost-efficacy ratios (ICER) ranged from AU$9.94 cost/minute reduction in workplace sitting time to AU$13.37/minute reduction in overall sitting time. CEA showed the intervention contributed to higher life year (LY) gains [0.01 (95% CI 0.009-0.011)], higher health-adjusted life year (HALY) gains [0.012 (95% CI 0.0105 - 0.0135)], and higher net costs [AU$344 (95% CI $331-358)], with corresponding ICER of AU$34 443/LY and AU$28 703/HALY if the intervention effects were to be sustained for five-years. CEA results were sensitive to assumptions surrounding intervention-effect decay rate and discount rate. Conclusions The intervention was cost-effective over the lifetime of the cohort when scaled up to the national workforce and provides important evidence for policy-makers and workplaces regarding allocation of resources to reduce workplace sitting.","Flego A Gao L (2018//).

Results Compared to usual practice, the intervention was associated with greater cost (AU$431/person), benefits in terms of reduced workplace sitting time [-46.8 minutes/8-hour workday, 95% confidence interval (CI):-69.9--23.7] and increased workplace standing time (42.2 minutes/8-hour workday, 95% CI 23.8-60.6). However, there were no significant benefits for BMI [0.148 kg/m2 (95% CI-1.407-1.703)], QoL-8D [-0.006 (95% CI-0.074-0.063)] and absenteeism [2.12 days (95% CI-2.01-6.26)]. The incremental cost-efficacy ratios (ICER) ranged from AU$9.94 cost/minute reduction in workplace sitting time to AU$13.37/minute reduction in overall sitting time. CEA showed the intervention contributed to higher life year (LY) gains [0.01 (95% CI 0.009-0.011)], higher health-adjusted life year (HALY) gains [0.012 (95% CI 0.0105 - 0.0135)], and higher net costs [AU$344 (95% CI $331-358)], with corresponding ICER of AU$34 443/LY and AU$28 703/HALY if the intervention effects were to be sustained for five-years. CEA results were sensitive to assumptions surrounding intervention-effect decay rate and discount rate. Conclusions The intervention was cost-effective over the lifetime of the cohort when scaled up to the national workforce and provides important evidence for policy-makers and workplaces regarding allocation of resources to reduce workplace sitting.","Flego A Gao L (2018//).

1666,"Background: Within the field of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients report decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as a result of living with physical factors such as pain and psychological factors such as negative mood. As these factors are associated with the disease trajectory, health care utilisation, and workplace disability of patients, these factors lead to significant societal health expenses. In a recent randomised controlled trial, improvements in especially psychological functioning (e.g., depressed mood) were found by offering tailored, therapist guided cognitive behavioural therapy online.1 Although internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy holds promise for implementation and cost-reductions, scarce research is available on the cost-effectiveness of these treatments. Objectives: A cost-effectiveness study from a societal perspective was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial on a tailored and therapist-guided internet-based cognitive behavioural intervention (ICBT) for patients with elevated levels of distress, as an addition to usual care alone in order to inform stake-holders on implementation of this treatment. Methods: Data were collected at baseline/pre-intervention, 6 months/post-intervention, and three-monthly thereafter during one year follow-up. Effects were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs from a societal perspective including healthcare sector costs (including healthcare use, medication, and intervention costs), patient travel costs for healthcare use, and costs associated with loss of labour. Results: The intervention improved quality of life compared to usual care alone ([DELTA] QALYs=0.059), but also led to higher costs ([DELTA]=[Euro sign] 4.211,44), which reduced substantially when medication costs were left out of the equation ([DELTA]=[Euro sign] 1.862,72). Most (93%) of the simulated ICERS were in the north-east quadrant, suggesting a high probability that the intervention is effective in improving HRQoL, but at a greater monetary cost for society compared to usual care alone. Conclusions: A positive effect on quality-adjusted life years is seen in the intervention group compared to the control group. However, cost-ratios show that this comes at a greater cost to society. The substantial costs in this population are generated by medication costs, for which no group differences could be found. The cost-benefit ratio improves when the costs for medication are not taken into account. Based on the effects for improvement of quality of life, implementation of the intervention is recommended, yet on the side of costs, further study is warranted.","Van Beugen S Ferwerda M (2018//).

1667,"Three examples of evaluating Dutch workplace interventions will be presented. This is input for discussing the essential elements in evaluations of interventions at workplaces on outcomes for work-related diseases or injuries. i. Needle stick injuries (NSIs) are frequently reported as occupational injuries among health care workers. The objective of a cluster randomised trial was to evaluate whether the number of NSIs decreased among health care workers at risk (n=796) after introduction of injection needles with safety devices in combination with an interactive workshop in an academic hospital. This combined intervention led to the highest reduction in the number of self-reported NSIs compared to a workshop alone or no intervention. ii. Low back complaints are frequently reported as work- related diseases among bricklayers. The objective of a within-subject controlled intervention study was to evaluate whether work related risk factors and discomfort of the low back decreased among bricklayers (n=10) after introducing a scaffolding console to adjust the working height of the storage of materials in a construction company. Working with a scaffolding console resulted in a significant reduction of the frequency and duration of trunk flexion 79% and 52% respectively, and as well as discomfort of the lower back compared with bricks set out on the ground floor. iii. Occupational risks affect the health of construction workers. The objective of a non-randomised controlled trial was to evaluate whether a job-specific workers' health surveillance improved the preventive actions of construction workers (n=374) following occupational physicians recommendations. In total 73% of the workers undertook job-specific actions versus 59% in the control group, while occupational physicians provided more job-specific recommendations in the intervention group. Risk assessment, context related interventions and compliance to interventions are essential elements before and alongside the evaluation of real world preventive interventions.","Sluiter JK Van Der Molen HF (2018//).

1668,"BACKGROUND: Blood pressure is a primary cardiovascular disease risk factor. Population-wide governmental strategies aim to reduce lifestyle and dietary risk factors for hypertension, one of which is an unbalanced diet with high sodium and low potassium intakes. Nutrition interventions in the workplace are considered a promising approach in encouraging health-promoting behaviors. We developed and conducted the health promoting sodium reduction trial ""Healthful & Tasty: Sure!"" in worksites in the German-speaking part of Switzerland from May 2015 to Nov 2016, for which we present the study protocol and baseline characteristics., METHODS: Healthful & Tasty, a cluster nonrandomized single-arm trial with calibration arm, aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a combined educational and environmental intervention in the workplace in reducing employees' average daily sodium/salt intake by 15%. To this end, health and food literacy of employees and guideline compliance among the catering facility team needed to be improved. The primary outcome measure was sodium/salt intake estimated from sodium excretion in a 24-h urine sample. Secondary outcome measures included changes in the overall qualitative diet composition, blood pressure, anthropometric indices, and health and food literacy. Of eight organizations with catering facilities, seven organizations took part in the nutrition education and catering salt reduction interventions, and one organization participated as a control. Overall, 145 consenting employees were included in the staggered, one-year four-phase trial, of which 132 participated in the intervention group. In addition to catering surveys and food sampling, the trial included five follow-up health assessments including questionnaires, blood pressure measurements, anthropometrics, and sodium, potassium, and iodine intake measurements obtained from 24-h and spot urine samples, and a food record checklist. Exploratory and hypothesis generating baseline statistical analysis included 141 participants with adequate 24-h urine samples., DISCUSSION: Despite practice-driven limitations to the study design and small cluster and participant numbers, this trial has methodological strength and will provide important insights into the effectiveness of a combined educational and environmental intervention to reduce salt intake among female and male Swiss employees., TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00006790 .

1669,"Objectives: To examine the relationships between the mediation levels required in the Dynamic Lowenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment- Geriatric Version (DLOTCA-G) and the mediation levels required in the Kettle Test and Bill Payment from the Executive Function Performance Test (EFPT) both are cognitive-functional assessments. Methods: Thirty people with a mean age of 76.6 (SD=7.4) years, receiving in-patient rehabilitation after an acquired brain injury (ABI), participated. Each participant was administered with the DLOTCA-G that assesses visual and spatial perception, praxis, visuo-motor integration and thinking operations, with the Kettle Test that assesses the ability to organize and problem solving during preparation of hot drinks and with the Bill Payment. Order of assessments was randomized between participants. Spearman correlations were used for analysis. Results: Significant correlations were found between the mediation score of the thinking operations and the Kettle test (rs=.46, p<.05) and Bill Payment (rs=.61, p<.05). Correlations were found between the visuo-motor integration and praxis and Bill Payment (rs=.48, rs=.41 p<.05, respectively). The percent of participants that received same level of mediation (high, low or none) in the DLOTCA-G and the Kettle test ranged between 48.2% for praxis and 20.6% for visual perception, and in DLOTCA-G and Bill payment ranged between 62.9% for praxis and 38.5% for visual perception. Conclusions: The findings of the current study showed that different levels of mediation were required for different types of cognitive tasks. In order to plan an optimal intervention it is recommended to use dynamic cognitive tests together with dynamic cognitive-functional tests during the evaluation process of people with ABI. This will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive abilities and learning potential of the individual.","Katz N Kizony R (2018//).

1670,"High levels of psychosocial work-related stress have major implications for both the employee and the employer. Epidemiological studies consistently demonstrate associations between high work stress and worse self-reported mental and physical health, including depression, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes., Job strain, a combination of high demands and low control, is a common model used to define psychosocial stress at work. Job strain is associated with worse mental and physical health, including anxiety and depressive disorders and increased blood pressure., Past studies show the value in mindfulness applications. For example, participants who completed 25 or more meditation sessions over 8 weeks also had significantly lower self-measured systolic blood pressure over the course of one day compared to the control condition participants at the follow-up time point. This trial suggests that almost daily brief mindfulness meditations delivered via smartphone can improve outcomes related to workplace stress and well-being, with potentially lasting effects., In this study, investigators hope to determine if a stress-reduction mindfulness application is more effective than a waitlist control condition in employees who are experiencing mild to moderate levels of stress in various health and productivity-related outcomes.","NCT03695627 (2018//).

1671,"Persons with chronic pain and pharmacological treatment with opioids are often excluded from vocational rehabilitation due to their medication and the idea of their low potential for achievement of important rehabilitation outcomes.

Also, follow-up the study will be assessed at two months' post-intervention using (NSS) and (COPE) questionnaires., 9. Attrition prevention techniques:, 1. Accurate contact information of each participant will be kept separately from the      questionnaire in coding book (participant's name, phone number, and E-mail address)., 2. Participants will be reminded regularly via phones or email, to fill out the      questionnaire and to attend stress management program sessions whenever they have time      to do so., 3. the researcher's contact information will be disclosed to each participant via card to      enable participants to ask any question regarding the study during the collection period      of data., 10. stress management program: Stress Program Materials a stress management program is adapted and developed with reference to effectiveness of the existing stress management program for nurses . Also, the program is designed according to the theory of stress and coping and rational emotive behavior theory. The contents of the program will deliver through the use interactive learning methods which are enjoyable, fun, and engaging., 11. Implementation of Educational Program: The stress program will be delivered to experimental group in a six-sessions for two weeks, each session will take 2 hours (2 hours/six sessions /two weeks), the day and time of stress management workshop will be arranged with nursing manager of comprehensive health care center depending on staff availability and venue for sessions, but the workshop will be in a warm quite room with efficient light, temperature, and ventilation. There is no intervention for controlled group during workshop but they are put on a waiting-list to receive the intervention after the active treatment group does. The intervention group will receive handouts copies of the stress management program for each session at the end of the study. A certificate of appreciation will be given to participants in both groups after completing the study. Nurses stress management program will be an experiential teaching program consisting of six sessions of stress management strategies for public health centers nurses. Sessions will be as follows: Session one: overview of stress (definition, causes, effects of social and occupational life, stress management styles and techniques), Session two: relaxation technique training (deep breathing exercise and progressive relaxation techniques), Session three: cognitive restructuring, which include positive self-talk and problem solving techniques, Session four: humor therapy, this session will be focusing on practicing humor through several ways (laughter videos, laughter meditation, sharing of personal anecdotes and jokes, sharing of happiness thoughts) ,Session five: time management, and Session six: assertiveness training. The validity content of those sessions will be approved from three lecturers in of the faculty medicine and health sciences -UPM and three lecturers who are specialized in mental and psychiatric health nursing teaching in two Jordanian universities. Pilot study will be conducted on a sample of 5% Jordanian public health nurses with high levels of occupational stress who will not be involved in the current study to check about the face validity of stress program., 12. Evaluation of Educational Program: Immediately after the last session of the intervention, the participants will ask to complete the post-test questionnaires which is the same (NSS) and (COPE) questionnaires use at baseline assessment.

Planning for Data Analysis : Both descriptive and inferential statistics will be used to answer the research questions of this study. The computer program, The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 22) will be used to describe variables of the study (Demographic data, Occupational stress, and coping strategies,). Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be carried out to determine the normality of data. Normality will be checked using Skewness and Kurtosis as well as Smirnov-Kolmogrov tests. Equality of variances will be checked for all variables using Levine's test. Categorical variables will be analyzed for frequencies and percentages, while Continuous variables will be described using the central tendency measures (means, and medians), the dispersion measures (standard deviation), and interpercentile measures (P25, P50, and P75). Descriptive analysis of mean, median, SD, frequencies, percentages, and range will be used to describe the socio-demographic variables among Jordanian public health nurses. Independent-t test will be used to compare the study's variables at baseline between two groups.in addition paired-sample t test and repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on the main outcome measures over time, both within and between study groups after assessing the basic assumptions of the parametric tests; linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. The level of significance will be set at p<=0.05 and the power will be set at 80% e for statistical tests analysis. Perceived stress and coping strategies need to be statistically significant for the null hypotheses to be rejected., 14.

1673,"Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a participatory physical and psychosocial workplace intervention (known as PIPPI) on work ability and recovery among industrial workers. Methods Eligible workers were cluster-randomized into intervention (N=193) and control (N=222) groups. Intervention group members participated in three workshops where they mapped positive and negative aspects of their physical and psychosocial work environment and developed action plans addressing the highlighted issues, which were subsequently implemented by the participants. Questionnaire-based data on work ability and recovery were collected at baseline and 8-, 10- and 12-month follow-up. Data on productivity, well-being, mental health, and physical demands and resources were collected at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Results The intervention was delivered and received as planned (100% planned workshops conducted, 69% [standard deviation (SD) 7%] participation in workshops) and with a response rate of 76% (SD 8%) to the questionnaires. No significant between-group improvements for any of the outcomes were found in intention-to-treat multi-level mixed models. On the contrary, tendencies were observed for poorer recovery and reduced work ability in the intervention compared to control group. Conclusion The intervention did not improve the outcomes. This result can have several explanations, such as a regression-toward-the-mean effect or that the intervention might have put an additional burden on the workers already facing high work demands. In addition, there may have been an insufficient match between the intervention components implemented and the predetermined outcomes, and implementation may have been unsuccessful. These potential explanations need to be investigated using process evaluation data.","Wahlin-Jacobsen CD Gupta N (2018//).

1674,"BACKGROUND: Sitting (sedentary behaviour) is widespread among desk-based office workers and a high level of sedentary behaviour is a risk factor for poor health. Reducing workplace sitting time is therefore an important prevention strategy. Interventions are more likely to be effective if they are theory and evidence-based. The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) provides a framework for intervention development. This article describes the development of the Stand More AT Work (SMArT Work) intervention, which aims to reduce sitting time among National Health Service (NHS) office-based workers in Leicester, UK., METHODS: We followed the BCW guide and used the Capability, Opportunity and Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) model to conduct focus group discussions with 39 NHS office workers. With these data we used the taxonomy of Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTv1) to identify the most appropriate strategies for facilitating behaviour change in our intervention. To identify the best method for participants to self-monitor their sitting time, a sub-group of participants (n = 31) tested a number of electronic self-monitoring devices., RESULTS: From our BCW steps and the BCT-Taxonomy we identified 10 behaviour change strategies addressing environmental (e.g. provision of height adjustable desks,), organisational (e.g. senior management support, seminar), and individual level (e.g. face-to-face coaching session) barriers. The Darma cushion scored the highest for practicality and acceptability for self-monitoring sitting., CONCLUSION: The BCW guide, COM-B model and BCT-Taxonomy can be applied successfully in the context of designing a workplace intervention for reducing sitting time through standing and moving more. The intervention was developed in collaboration with office workers (a participatory approach) to ensure relevance for them and their work situation. The effectiveness of this intervention is currently being evaluated in a randomised controlled trial., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN10967042 .

1675,"BACKGROUND: Recent research has suggested that interventions at the workplace might be the most potent ingredient in return to work interventions, but few studies have investigated the different effects of workplace interventions as part of occupational rehabilitation programs. The comprehensive design described in this article includes effect (on return to work and health outcomes), and health economic evaluations of a workplace intervention added to a multicomponent rehabilitation program. Qualitative and mixed method studies will investigate sick-listed persons', rehabilitation therapists' and employers' perspectives on the usability and outcomes of the rehabilitation program and the workplace intervention. The program and intervention are provided to patients with musculoskeletal, psychological or general and unspecified diagnoses. The program is multi-component and includes Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, physical exercise, patient education and creating a plan for increased work participation., METHODS: Persons who are employed, aged from 18 to 60 years, with a current sick leave status of 50% or more and a diagnosis within the musculoskeletal, psychological or general and unspecified chapters of International Classification of Primary Care-2 (ICPC-2) will be recruited to a researcher-blinded parallel-group randomized controlled trial. All participants take part in an in-patient occupational rehabilitation program, while the intervention group also takes part in an intervention at the workplace. The effect and economic evaluation will investigate the effect of the added workplace intervention. The primary outcome measures will be time until full sustainable return to work and total number of sickness absence days in the 12 months after inclusion. Health economic evaluations will investigate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. Qualitative studies will investigate rehabilitation therapists' experiences with working towards return to work within an ACT-approach and stakeholders' experiences with the workplace intervention. A mixed methods study will combine quantitative and qualitative findings on the participants' expectations and motivation for return to work., DISCUSSION: The outline of this comprehensive study could represent an important addition to the standard designs of return to work evaluation.

1676,"BACKGROUND: Within high income countries, mental health is now the leading cause of long term sickness absence in the workplace. Managers are in a position to make changes and decisions that have a positive effect on the wellbeing of staff, the recovery of employees with mental ill health, and potentially prevent future mental health problems. However, managers report addressing workplace mental health issues as challenging. The aim of the HeadCoach trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly developed online training intervention to determine whether it is able to build managers' confidence to better support individuals within their teams who are experiencing mental ill health, and the confidence to promote manager behaviour likely to result in a more mentally healthy workplace., METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a cluster randomised control trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of HeadCoach, an online training intervention for managers with a focus on the mental health of their employees, compared to a waitlist control. The target sample is 168 managers, and their direct employees. Managers and employees will be assessed at baseline and at 4-month follow up. Managers will have an additional, intermediate assessment 6-weeks post-baseline. The primary outcome is change from baseline in managers' self-reported confidence when dealing with mental health issues within their team and promoting a mentally healthy workplace. The difference between the intervention and waitlist control groups will be assessed using linear mixed effects repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of variance (ANOVA). Secondary managerial outcomes include mental health literacy, attitudes towards mental health issues in the workplace and managerial behaviour in dealing with mental health matters with their staff. Employee outcomes will be perceived level of manager support, engagement, psychological distress, and rates of sickness absence and presenteeism., DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this will be the first RCT of a purely online training intervention developed specifically for managers that promotes confidence to both support staff experiencing mental ill health and create a mentally healthy work environment. If successful, this intervention has the potential to provide an effective and efficient method of training managers in workplace mental health and to enhance employee wellbeing., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12617000279325.","Bryan BT Gayed A (2018//).

1677,"Objectives This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a ""blended"" workplace health-promotion intervention, alongside identification of key components beneficial for future implementation strategies. Methods Within a cluster randomized controlled trial, 491 employees at increased risk of cardiovascular disease were allocated to the limited (N=217; 9 clusters) or extensive (N=274; 8 clusters) intervention. The extensive intervention consisted of motivational interviewing (MI) within the framework of a web-based health risk assessment (HRA), a blended care approach. The limited intervention received solely the web-based HRA. Occupational health physicians (N=21) within three organizations delivered the intervention. Implementation components investigated included: HRA (reach and participation), newsletters (percentage read), and MI sessions (number and quality). MI quality was determined by scoring audiotaped MI sessions, using the MI treatment integrity code. After 6 and 12 months, effects on participation in health-promotion activities and its associations with components of implementation were determined by mixed-effects models. Results Over 80% of employees participated in health-promotion activities, with an additional 8% in the extensive compared to the limited group. In the extensive intervention, those with more or better quality MI sessions were more likely to participate in health-promotion activities. Increased MI quality was associated with sustained participation. Conclusions This study suggests that participation in health-promotion activities can be increased by adding MI to a web-based approach and improving the quality of the MI delivered. Interventions with MI should include optimized delivery and quality of MI sessions.","Robroek SJ Kouwenhoven-Pasmooij TA (2018//).

Knowledge is sparse on subsequent participation in competitive work. This study aimed to investigate trajectories for (re)entry to work for predefined subgroups in a diagnostically heterogeneous sample of sick-listed participants after completing occupational rehabilitation., METHODS: A cohort of 212 participants aged 18-69 on long-term sick leave (> 8 weeks) with chronic pain, chronic fatigue and/or common mental disorders was followed for one year after completing a 31/2-week rehabilitation intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Self-reported, clinical and registry data were used to study the associations between predefined biopsychosocial predictors and trajectories for (re)entry to competitive work (>= 1 day per week on average over 8 weeks). Generalized estimating equations analysis was used to investigate trajectories., RESULTS: For all biopsychosocial subgroups (re)entry to work increased over time. Baseline employment, partial sick leave and higher expectation of return to work (RTW) predicted higher probability of having (re)entered work at any given time after discharge. The odds of increasing reentry over time (statistical interaction with time) was weaker for the group receiving the benefit work assessment allowance compared with those receiving sickness benefit (OR = 0.92, p = 0.048) or for those on partial sick leave compared with full sick leave (OR 0.77, p < 0.001), but higher for those who at baseline had reported having a poor economy versus not (OR 1.16, p = 0.010) or reduced emotional functioning compared with not (OR 1.11, p = 0.012). Health factors did not differentiate substantially between trajectories., CONCLUSIONS: Work participation after completing a transdiagnostic occupational rehabilitation intervention was investigated. Individual and system factors related to work differentiated trajectories for (re)entry to work, while individual health factors did not. Having a mental disorder did not indicate a worse prognosis for (re)entry to work following the intervention. Future trials within occupational rehabilitation are recommended to pivot their focus to work-related factors, and to lesser extent target diagnostic group.","Bjorngaard JH Hara KW (2018//).

1679,"Most working women do not meet current guidelines for physical activity (PA). A 12-week pilot study tested a workplace, peer modeling PA intervention. Inactive female employees from a health system were randomized to an attention control group (ACG; n = 26) or an intervention group (IG; n = 26). The ACG received health information. The IG participated in six group sessions with an active peer model and received an exercise prescription and PA information. Pre and post measures were PA (ActiGraph), Estimated VO2max (cycle ergometer), resting heart rate (HR), glucose and lipids, and cardiovascular risk. Using hierarchical linear modeling, no significant group by time effects were found. Although PA increased in both groups, F( df = 1) = 11.4, p = .002, the IG had greater improvements in fitness (VO2max, HR) and cardiovascular risk (total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein [LDL], calculated risk score) compared with ACG.

1680,"Occupational health nurses motivate employees to engage in healthy behaviors. Both clinicians and researchers need strong theories on which to base decisions for health programs (e.g., healthy diet) and experimental interventions (e.g., workplace walking). The self-determination theory could be useful as it includes concepts of individual autonomy, competence to perform healthy behaviors, and relationships as predictors of health behaviors and outcomes. In this article, the self-determination theory is described and evaluated using Walker and Avant's criteria. The theory is applied to a population of federal employees who smoke. By increasing employees' ability to autonomously choose smoking cessation programs, support their competence to stop smoking, and improve their relationships with both others who smoke and employee health services, smoking cessation should increase.","Barnes DM Ross BM (2018//).

1682,"PURPOSE: Sleep disturbance is common in the working population, often associated with work stress, health complaints and impaired work performance. This study evaluated a group intervention at work, based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia, and the moderating effects of burnout scores at baseline., METHODS: This is a randomized controlled intervention with a waiting list control group. Participants were employees working at least 75% of full time, reporting self-perceived regular sleep problems. Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention and at a 3-month follow-up through diaries, wrist-actigraphy and questionnaires including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ). Fifty-one participants (63% women) completed data collections., RESULTS: A multilevel mixed model showed no significant differences between groups for sleep over time, while there was a significant effect on insomnia symptoms when excluding participants working shifts (N = 11) from the analysis (p = 0.044). Moreover, a moderating effect of baseline-levels of burnout scores was observed on insomnia symptoms (p = 0.009). A post-hoc analysis showed that individuals in the intervention group with low burnout scores at baseline (SMBQ < 3.75) displayed significantly reduced ISI scores at follow-up, compared to individuals with high burnout scores at baseline (p = 0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: Group CBT for insomnia given at the workplace did not reduce sleep problems looking at the group as a whole, while it was indicated that the intervention reduced insomnia in employees with regular daytime work. The results also suggest that workplace-based group CBT may improve sleep in employees with primary insomnia if not concomitant with high burnout scores.","Soderstrom M Schiller H (2018//).

1683,"This paper explores changes in musculoskeletal pain among desk-based workers over three months of a workplace-delivered, sitting-reduction intervention. Participants (n = 153, 46% female; mean +/- SD aged 38.9 +/- 8.0 years) were cluster-randomized (n = 18 work teams) to receive an organizational change intervention, with or without an activity tracker. A modified Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire assessed pain intensity (0⁻9; none⁻worst possible) in the neck, upper and lower back, upper and lower extremities, and in total. The activPAL3 (7 days, 24 h/day protocol) measured sitting and prolonged sitting in >=30 min bouts at work. Mixed models adjusting for cluster and intervention arm examined changes in pain (n = 104), and their associations with reductions in sitting and prolonged sitting (h/10 h at work) (n = 90). Changes in pain were nonsignificant (p >= 0.05) and small for total pain (-0.06 [95% CI: -0.27, 0.16]) and for each body area (-0.26 [-0.66, 0.15] for upper back to 0.09 [-0.39, 0.56] for lower back). Sitting reduction was associated with reduced lower back pain (-0.84 [-1.44, -0.25] per hour, p = 0.005); other effects were small and non-significant. No substantial average changes in pain were seen; some improvement in lower back pain might be expected with larger sitting reductions.

1684,"BACKGROUND: Large amounts of sitting at work have been identified as an emerging occupational health risk, and findings from intervention trials have been reported. However, few such reports have examined participant-selected strategies and their relationships with behaviour change., METHODS: The Stand Up Victoria cluster-randomised controlled trial was a workplace-delivered intervention comprising organisational, environmental and individual level behaviour change strategies aimed at reducing sitting time in desk-based workers. Sit-stand workstations were provided, and participants (n = 134; intervention group only) were guided by health coaches to identify strategies for the 'Stand Up', 'Sit Less', and 'Move More' intervention targets, including how long they would stand using the workstation. Three-month workplace sitting and activity changes (activPAL3-assessed total sitting, prolonged sitting (i.e., sitting >=30 min continuously) and purposeful walking) were evaluated in relation to the number (regression analysis) and types of strategies (decision-tree analysis)., RESULTS: Over 80 different strategies were nominated by participants. Each additional strategy nominated for the 'Stand Up' intervention target (i.e. number of strategies) was associated with a reduction in prolonged sitting of 27.6 min/8-h workday (95% CI: -53.1, - 2.1, p = 0.034). Types of strategies were categorised into 13 distinct categories. Strategies that were task-based and phone-based were common across all three targets. The decision tree models did not select any specific strategy category as predicting changes in prolonged sitting ('Stand Up'), however four strategy categories were identified as important for total sitting time ('Sit Less') and three strategy categories for purposeful walking ('Moving More'). The uppermost nodes (foremost predictors) were nominating > 3 h/day of workstation standing (reducing total workplace sitting) and choosing a 'Move More' task-based strategy (purposeful walking)., CONCLUSIONS: Workers chose a wide range of strategies, with both strategy choice and strategy quantity appearing relevant to behavioural improvement. Findings support a tailored and pragmatic approach to encourage a change in sitting and activity in the workplace. Evaluating participant-selected strategies in the context of a successful intervention serves to highlight options that may prove feasible and effective in other desk-based workplace environments., TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials register ( ACTRN12611000742976 ) on 15 July 2011.","Eakin EG Stephens SK (2018//).

1685,"PURPOSE: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions aimed at reducing work-related stress indicate that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is more effective than other interventions. However, definitions of study populations are often unclear and there is a lack of interventions targeting both the individual and the workplace. The aim of this study was to determine whether a stress management intervention combining individual CBT and a workplace focus is superior to no treatment in the reduction of perceived stress and stress symptoms and time to lasting return to work (RTW) in a clinical sample., METHODS: Patients with work-related stress reactions or adjustment disorders were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 57, 84.2% female) or a control group (n = 80, 83.8% female). Subjects were followed via questionnaires and register data. The intervention contained individual CBT and the offer of a workplace meeting. We examined intervention effects by analysing group differences in score changes on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30). We also tested if intervention led to faster lasting RTW., RESULTS: Mean baseline values of PSS were 24.79 in the intervention group and 23.26 in the control group while the corresponding values for GHQ were 21.3 and 20.27, respectively. There was a significant effect of time. 10 months after baseline, both groups reported less perceived stress and improved mental health. 4 months after baseline, we found significant treatment effects for both perceived stress and mental health. The difference in mean change in PSS after 4 months was - 3.09 (- 5.47, - 0.72), while for GHQ it was - 3.91 (- 7.15, - 0.68). There were no group differences in RTW., CONCLUSIONS: The intervention led to faster reductions in perceived stress and stress symptoms amongst patients with work-related stress reactions and adjustment disorders. 6 months after the intervention ended there were no longer differences between the groups.","Carstensen O Glasscock DJ (2018//).

1686,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: The workplace holds substantial potential as an alcohol harm reduction and prevention setting. Few studies have rigorously examined strategies to reduce workplace alcohol-related harm. Hence, an in-situ 3 year trial of a comprehensive alcohol harm reduction intervention in Australian manufacturing workplaces was undertaken., DESIGN AND METHODS: Informed by a gap analysis, a multi-site trial was undertaken. Three manufacturing industry companies, located at four separate worksites, with a minimum of 100 employees were recruited through a local industry network. Based on worksite location, two worksites were allocated to the intervention group and two to the comparison group. The pre-specified primary outcome measure, risky drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, AUDIT-C) and other self-report measures were collected pre-intervention (T1), 12 months (T2) and 24 months post-intervention (T3)., RESULTS: No significant intervention effect was observed for the primary outcome measure, risky drinking. Significant intervention effects were observed for increased awareness of alcohol policy and employee assistance. At T3, the odds of intervention group participants being aware of the workplace policy and aware of employee assistance were 48.9% (95% confidence interval 29.3-88.9%) and 79.7% (11.5%, 91.8%), respectively, greater than comparison group participants., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive tailored workplace interventions can be effective in improving workplace alcohol policy awareness. This is one of few workplace alcohol trials undertaken to-date and the findings make an important contribution to the limited evidence base for workplace alcohol harm prevention initiatives.","Roche A Pidd K (2018//).

1687,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate effects of a flexible multi-component workplace intervention program for improving physical activity among Japanese white-collar employees in a cluster randomized controlled trial design., METHODS: A total of 208 worksites and nested employees were approached. Any worksite interested in a 3-month physical activity promotion intervention and white-collar workers aged 18 years or older were eligible. The worksites were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control, stratified by worksite size. The intervention worksites were offered an intervention program that allows these worksites to select intervention components from a set of options, including environmental changes. The control worksites were offered feedback and basic occupational health services. Physical activity level was measured using a self-reported questionnaire at baseline and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up., RESULTS: Three worksites (92 employees) were allocated to the intervention and five worksites (98 employees) to the control worksites. The overall physical activity level in the intervention worksites significantly increased compared with the control worksites (Coeff = 0.45, SE = 0.19, p = 0.018). For subgroup analyses, the intervention effect on the overall physical activity level was significant among medium- and large-sized worksites but not among small-sized worksites., CONCLUSION: This trial showed a significant and positive effect of the intervention program on physical activity. The program is unique because of its flexibility and feasibility. However, small worksites might receive less benefit from the program, indicating a need for further support and/or new technologies., TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (ID=UMIN000024069).","Kawakami N Watanabe K (2018//).

1688,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated in a rigorous 18-month randomized controlled trial the efficacy of an enhanced vocational intervention for helping individuals with a recent first schizophrenia episode to return to and remain in competitive work or regular schooling. METHODS: Individual Placement and Support (IPS) was adapted to meet the goals of individuals whose goals might involve either employment or schooling. IPS was combined with a Workplace Fundamentals Module (WFM) for an enhanced, outpatient, vocational intervention. Random assignment to the enhanced integrated rehabilitation program (N = 46) was contrasted with equally intensive clinical treatment at UCLA, including social skills training groups, and conventional vocational rehabilitation by state agencies (N = 23). All patients were provided case management and psychiatric services by the same clinical team and received oral atypical antipsychotic medication. RESULTS: The IPS-WFM combination led to 83% of patients participating in competitive employment or school in the first 6 months of intensive treatment, compared with 41% in the comparison group (p < 0.005). During the subsequent year, IPS-WFM continued to yield higher rates of schooling/employment (92% v. 60%, p < 0.03). Cumulative number of weeks of schooling and/or employment was also substantially greater with the IPS-WFM intervention (45 v. 26 weeks, p < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly support the efficacy of an enhanced intervention focused on recovery of participation in normative work and school settings in the initial phase of schizophrenia, suggesting potential for prevention of disability.","Subotnik KL Nuechterlein KH (2019//).

1689,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity has increased significantly worldwide within the last decade. As obesity is recognised as a contributing factor when developing various health threatening chronic diseases, prevention initiatives focusing on weight loss are becoming more important. Because of the time spent at the workplace, workplaces can be optimal arenas for weight loss programs and these programs have been effective to decrease body weight. Thus, reasons for engaging in weight loss interventions needs exploring, in order to engage more workplaces in weight loss interventions. Such information provides important knowledge that may help to inform decisions of municipalities, employers and other public health decision makers, when and if implementing weight loss interventions. The aim of this study was therefore to explore reasons for employee engagement in weight loss projects at the workplace and the incentives a municipality, a manager at a home-care centre, and a project manager have to launch such project., METHODS: A stratified case study was conducted. A representative from the municipality, the manager at a home-care centre, the project manager of the weight loss intervention and six health-care workers were interviewed at the end of a one-year weight loss intervention at the workplace. Data were analysed using Systematic Text Condensation., RESULTS: Analysis identified different views and considerations for engaging in a weight loss intervention at the workplace. For the representative of the municipality the possible economical gain of the project was in focus. The project manager and the manager of the home-care centre both reflected mainly on improvement of the healthcare workers health. For the project manager, achieving good scientific results was highlighted as well. However, the employees were influenced by several factors, such as their own health and weight loss, the pressure from the environment and their struggle for recognition., CONCLUSIONS: This study concluded that if targeting the increasing worldwide obesity problem through workplace initiated weight loss programs, the sales pitch to managements and employers have to be tailored in order to increase the participation and the motivation for the initiative., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov : NCT01015716 , registration data 14.12.2010 (Prospectively registered).","Pajevic M Christensen JR (2019//).

1690,"Objectives This study aimed to assess the economic credentials of a workplace-delivered intervention to reduce sitting time among desk-based workers. Methods We performed within-trial cost-efficacy analysis and long-term cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and recruited 231 desk-based workers, aged 24-65 years, across 14 worksites of one organization. Multicomponent workplace-delivered intervention was compared to usual practice. Main outcome measures including total device-measured workplace sitting time, body mass index (BMI), self-reported health-related quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life-8D, AQoL-8D), and absenteeism measured at 12 months. Results Compared to usual practice, the intervention was associated with greater cost (AU$431/person), benefits in terms of reduced workplace sitting time [-46.8 minutes/8-hour workday, 95% confidence interval (CI): -69.9- -23.7] and increased workplace standing time (42.2 minutes/8-hour workday, 95% CI 23.8-60.6). However, there were no significant benefits for BMI [0.148 kg/m 2(95% CI-1.407-1.703)], QoL-8D [-0.006 (95% CI -0.074-0.063)] and absenteeism [2.12 days (95% CI -2.01-6.26)]. The incremental cost-efficacy ratios (ICER) ranged from AU$9.94 cost/minute reduction in workplace sitting time to AU$13.37/minute reduction in overall sitting time. CEA showed the intervention contributed to higher life year (LY) gains [0.01 (95% CI 0.009-0.011)], higher health-adjusted life year (HALY) gains [0.012 (95% CI 0.0105 - 0.0135)], and higher net costs [AU$344 (95% CI $331-358)], with corresponding ICER of AU$34 443/LY and AU$28 703/HALY if the intervention effects were to be sustained for five-years. CEA results were sensitive to assumptions surrounding intervention-effect decay rate and discount rate.

1692,"BACKGROUND: To understand the potential influencing factors on the effectiveness of workplace health promotion interventions and examine whether workplace health culture and physical environment can mediate the relationship between workplace health promotion and intervention effectiveness., METHODS: A total of 719 participants from 10 Chinese government agencies were recruited for a prospective self-controlled trial. Questionnaires, qualitative interviews, and direct observation were used for the baseline evaluation, process evaluation, and effectiveness evaluation. Based on the results of the need assessment and risk assessment at each workplace, a two-year comprehensive health intervention was conducted by each workplace. Health outcomes including self-rated health (SRH) and mental health were measured at baseline and 24 months. Health culture was measured at 24 months. Physical environment and intervention implementation were measured at 12 months and 24 months., RESULTS: Compared with the baseline, the means of SRH and mental health increased significantly by 0.302 and 2.698, respectively. The SRH scores were different before and after intervention; furthermore, the differences varied by workplace. Health culture mediated the relationship between intervention implementation and intervention effectiveness, including SRH and mental health improvement, but physical environment did not. Physical environment quality was significantly negatively correlated with SRH improvement and mental health improvement. Under the relatively high-quality interventions with scores higher than 4.047 or 4.151 (out of 5), better health culture may led to greater SRH and mental health improvements., CONCLUSIONS: Health culture may mediate the relationship between intervention implementation and intervention effectiveness, whereas physical environment does not seem to mediate this relationship. Under relatively high-quality interventions, a better health culture may lead to more positive improvements in SRH and mental health.

1693,"Objective This study aimed to estimate and evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of a guided internet- and mobile-supported occupational stress-management intervention (iSMI) for employees from the employer's perspective alongside a randomized controlled trial. Methods A sample of 264 employees with elevated symptoms of perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-10 >=22) was randomly assigned either to the iSMI or a waitlist control (WLC) group with unrestricted access to treatment as usual. The iSMI consisted of seven sessions of problem-solving and emotion-regulation techniques and one booster session. Self-report data on symptoms of perceived stress and economic data were assessed at baseline, and at six months following randomization. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) with symptom-free status as the main outcome from the employer's perspective was carried out. Statistical uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping (N=5000). Results The CBA yielded a net-benefit of EUR181 [95% confidence interval (CI) -6043-1042] per participant within the first six months following randomization. CEA showed that at a willingness-to-pay ceiling of EUR0, EUR1000, EUR2000 for one additional symptom free employee yielded a 67%, 90%, and 98% probability, respectively, of the intervention being cost-effective compared to the WLC. Conclusion The iSMI was cost-effective when compared to WLC and even lead to cost savings within the first six months after randomization.

Methods A cluster randomized controlled trial was implemented in municipal pre-schools. The intervention used a participatory approach and aimed improving the psychosocial working environment by focusing on core tasks. The sample consisted of 41 pre-schools with 404 employees in the intervention group and 30 pre-schools with 230 employees in the control group. We measured unnecessary and unreasonable tasks at baseline and at two-year follow-up by one item on unnecessary and one item on unreasonable tasks, respectively, and combined both items into a measure of illegitimate tasks. We analyzed within- and between-groups changes in unnecessary and unreasonable tasks and in the combined measure of illegitimate tasks. Results The scores for unnecessary, unreasonable, and illegitimate tasks remained virtually unchanged in the intervention group and increased in the control group. The different development in the two groups was statistically significant for unreasonable tasks (+0.02 versus +0.13, P=0.04) and the combined measure of illegitimate tasks (+0.01 versus +0.11, P=0.04) but not for unnecessary tasks (+0.00 versus +0.08, P=0.16).

1695,"BACKGROUND: Wrist fractures are a common upper extremity injury treated by hand therapists. Fluidotherapy(R) is a high intensity heat modality consisting of a dry whirlpool of finely divided solid particles suspended in a heated air stream, the mixture having the properties of a liquid. Currently, there is a dearth of published literature supporting the use Fluidotherapy(R) to improve pain and range of motion (ROM) in wrist fracture patients. More importantly, there is no evidence for the reduction of perceived wrist pain or improved ROM after only one 15-minute bout of Fluidotherapy(R). OBJECTIVE: This pilot study was conducted to determine the effects of one 15-minute bout of performing active range of motion (AROM) exercises in Fluidotherapy(R) (EXFT) versus AROM exercises (EX) alone on pain levels and AROM in wrist fracture subjects. METHODS: Eight subjects diagnosed with a wrist fracture (distal radius fracture, distal radius/ulna fractures, or distal ulna fracture) and referred to outpatient rehabilitation/occupational therapy were recruited upon his/her initial therapy evaluation. Patients with closed reductions, open reductions, internal fixation, and/or external fixation were included as well. Subjects were randomly assigned to either the EXFT group or the EX group. A numeric pain scale (0-10) was used to assess perceived pain and AROM measurements using a goniometer were taken for pronation, supination, flexion, extension, radial deviation, and ulnar deviation immediately prior to intervention and after intervention. RESULTS: EX Group Pre-Treatment results: Pain 4.0 (+/- 1.82); Supination AROM 75.5 (+/- 10.90); Pronation AROM 75 (+/- 7.02); Flexion AROM 34.5 (+/- 9.88); Extension AROM 43.5 (+/- 8.96); Radial Deviation AROM 18.75 (+/- 9.43); Ulnar Deviation AROM 23.5 (+/- 4.36); Exercise in Fluidotherapy(R) Group Pre-Treatment results: Pain 2.5 (+/- 2.08); Supination AROM 65 (+/- 18.70); Pronation AROM 81.25 (+/- 6.29); Flexion AROM 40.25 (+/- 17.23); Extension AROM 38.5 (+/- 12.07); Radial Deviation AROM 21.25 (+/- 10.31); Ulnar Deviation AROM 26.25 (+/- 12.5); EX Group Post-Treatment results: Pain 4.5 (+/- 2.52); Supination AROM 81.75 (+/- 9.18); Pronation AROM 79 (+/- 3.46); Flexion AROM 36.25 (+/- 9.84); Extension AROM 50.5 (+/- 15.42); Radial Deviation AROM 21.5 (+/- 9.94); Ulnar Deviation AROM 23.75 (+/- 5.19); Exercise in Fluidotherapy(R) Group Pre-Treatment results: Pain 0.75 (+/- 0.98); Supination AROM 72.5 (+/- 14.43); Pronation AROM 86.25 (+/- 4.79); Flexion AROM 47.5 (+/- 15.54); Extension AROM 51.25 (+/- 8.54); Radial Deviation AROM 25.5 (+/- 12.80); Ulnar Deviation AROM 29 (+/- 8.41); There were no significant differences between EX and EXFT groups in all outcome variables except for self-reported numeric pain scores (p=0.03*) and a trend towards significance in pronation AROM (p=0.06**). Even with a small sample size (n=8) there were significant differences in self-reported pain between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The application of heat, massage, sensory stimulation, levitation, and pressure oscillations seem to provide patients pain relief and improvements in range of motion after AROM exercises in Fluidotherapy(R). This study confirms that even after one 15-minute bout of AROM exercises in Fluidotherapy(R) treatment, patients report improved pain tolerance and may be useful in pain management techniques after a wrist fracture.","NCT03649542 (2018//).

1696,"Intensive rehabilitation is recognized as an essential component to successful outcomes for post procedure recovery after a major cardio-thoracic procedure. The investigators propose a unique multi-modal rehabilitation program (MRP) that combines a step-up physical therapy protocol with neuromuscular electric stimulation (NMES), nutritional supplementation (NS), occupational therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation techniques to achieve improved functional outcomes for advanced lung disease patients requiring transplantation or ECMO-bridge to transplant. The investigators hypothesized that a progressive rehabilitation program, incorporating neuromuscular electric stimulation, strength and balance training, and nutritional supplementation with essential amino acids will reduce sarcopenia and loss of functional mobility in patients with advanced lung disease requiring transplantation or ECMO-bridge to transplant., The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a progressive rehabilitation program, which incorporates neuromuscular electric stimulation, strength and mobility training, and nutritional supplementation in ameliorating 1) the loss of muscle mass and strength, and lower extremity balance, strength and coordination, 2) time on the ventilator or ECMO, stay in the intense care unit and hospital, and 3) return home and quality of life compared to usual ICU care., The investigators propose a prospective, randomized interventional trial assessing the effectiveness of the program in decreasing adverse post-transplant outcomes compared to usual care. All advanced lung disease patients listed for transplantation or requiring ECMO cannulation will be screened for this study according to the inclusion and exclusion criterion. The patients will be randomized to either the treatment arm or usual care within 72 hours after the procedure (transplant or ECMO cannulation if patient requires ECMO-bridge to transplant). All groups of patients will undergo an initial global assessment of functional capabilities after listing for lung transplantation and then again within 72 hours after cardio-thoracic procedure (transplant or ECMO cannulation). Patients in the treatment arm will receive additional physical therapy that include: arm and leg exercises, using light weight machines, hand weights, or rubber bands, exercise machines such as portable arm or seated bikes. The treatment group will receive exercise therapy plus therapy with an electric stimulator device. This device uses weak electric impulses to involuntarily exercise the muscles (one-two sessions a day, with each session starting off at 10 minutes, then increasing to a maximum of 30 minutes). Subjects receiving the intervention will receive daily treatment using the neuromuscular electric stimulation unit. Four muscle groups (quadriceps and dorsiflexors bilaterally) will be stimulated using 3x5 inch surface electrodes (quadriceps) and 2x4 inch (dorsiflexors). In addition, patients in the experimental group will receive nutrition supplementation with essential amino acids 3 times a day in their feeding to prevent muscle breakdown and promote positive nitrogen balance. Comprehensive re-assessments are repeated on a weekly basis and the therapy will be adjusted to the patient's clinical status.","NCT03562728 (2018//).

1699,"Stress at work has shown to be an important health risk for employees. It is associated with poor mental and physical health including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal problems, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Work stress also has major implications for employers as evidence suggests that high levels of work stress predict employee burnout, turnover intent, absenteeism, and poor job performance., Mindfulness and its positive effects on a variety of outcomes, including stress reduction, have been documented in many studies. The most common definition of mindfulness is as the state of being attentive to and aware of the present moment with an attitude of openness and acceptance. Several mechanisms by which mindfulness exerts its positive effects have been proposed in the literature including cultivating the attitude of non-judgement and acceptance, ability to observe one's experiences objectively without reacting to them, and ability to be more patient and kind toward oneself. Recent evidence suggests that teaching mindfulness in the workplace not only reduces stress but also improve psychological well-being., With advances in technology, technology-based delivery of many interventions has become popular. App-based treatments for improving psychological health are becoming increasingly important due to high accessibility and cost-effectiveness of smartphone technology. Despite a great number of app-based interventions, there has been little research evaluating their efficacy. Support for the use of smartphone app-based mindfulness interventions comes from a few small studies that found these interventions to produce benefits comparable to traditional delivery methods. While app-based interventions offer a convenient alternative to traditional delivery methods as well as promising initial empirical evidence, more research is needed in order to further evaluate and promote these interventions., The proposed study has several goals. The first goal is to investigate the effects of the app-based mindfulness intervention on overall physical and psychological health (e.g., perceived stress, mindfulness, sleep quality, self-reported health, anxiety symptoms). The second goal is to examine the effect of the intervention on a variety of work-related outcomes (e.g., work stress, job satisfaction, work-related burnout). Further, the study will examine potential mindfulness mechanisms that may drive these effects (e.g., acceptance, reactivity, decentering).","NCT03652168 (2018//).

1700,"The research study for this career development plan involves the development, iterative user testing, and evaluation of an online ACT treatment program for Veterans with chronic pain. This study will determine whether a larger-scale, more definitive VACT-CP full scale efficacy trial is indicated., Phase 1: Development Phase (15 months): I will develop a detailed VACT-CP protocol for individual online treatment. Treatment techniques will be based on previously-developed ACT treatments for chronic pain, as well as additional ACT training I will obtain during the early phase of the CDA-2. During this phase, mental health and other clinical staff providing pain care at the Bedford VAMC (n = 10) will provide feedback and input on the intervention content., Phase 2: Pilot Evaluation of Intervention Components in Field-Based Iterative Usability Testing (21 months): The investigators will recruit Veterans (n=15) with chronic pain for usability testing, to assess the delivery mode, and utilize an Integrated Technology Acceptance Model to iteratively assess feasibility and usability of the VACT-CP online treatment. This portion of the project will focus on refining the delivery mode, and revising chronic pain intervention content as necessary. With my mentors, I will review the adequacy, utility of specific procedures, and intervention foci to revise the online treatment accordingly., Phase 3: Feasibility Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (30 months): The investigators will assess the feasibility and acceptability using a Stage 1b RCT pilot test comparing VACT-CP (n = 20) to a wait-list control group (n = 20), including ease of recruitment, retention in each condition, treatment receptivity, attrition and retention in each condition, sustained participation, and the assessment process. The investigators will also describe preliminary data on the impact of VACT-CP vs. the control condition on pain-related functioning related to social, occupational, and physical functioning, emotional functioning, mental health, and quality of life., PHASE 1: INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT, The goal of this phase will be to 1) adapt ACT manualized treatment of chronic pain in Veterans into an online platform using the ECA as the intervention coach, and 2) gather qualitative feedback from chronic pain providers and content experts (n = 10 - 12) on the VACT-CP system for intervention refinement and potential benefits, barriers, referral concerns, and overall thoughts on the VACT-CP system., Initial Development of the VACT-CP System, Procedure. The development of the intervention and its revision will be an iterative process over Phases 1 (Intervention Development) and 2 (Feasibility and Usability Testing) (specifications for intervention revision for Phase 2 are below) and will include: 1) reviewing existing ACT CP treatment manuals with mentors; 2) developing a preliminary online version of the intervention, with mentor input, 3) revising the intervention based on mentor and consultant feedback., Creation of the initial VACT-CP platform will include collaboration with mentors , as well as the Northeastern Personal Health Informatics team at Northeastern University led by Dr. Timothy Bickmore. Using input from this team of experts, as well as my own experience in educational technology and online course creation, I will create a basic prototype of the intervention including the main VACT-CP content components, alignment of session goals and outcomes, and the creation of a corresponding patient workbook with information on the system. This process will also include close mentorship between Drs. Kelly and Heapy to assess current ACT for CP manualized treatment, and adaption of this content to the online system., VACT-CP Treatment Content and Structure. The following components will be emphasized in VACT-CP based on previous manualized ACT-chronic pain treatment by Vowles and Sorrell Life with Chronic Pain: An Acceptance-based Approach Therapist Guide and Patient Workbook and utilizing ECA technology to create a personalized, therapeutic experience. Creation of the intervention will entail modification of the ECA image, creation of the intervention scripts and programming for the online user-experience. Participants will receive eight online modules, provided as weekly sessions that will feature an ECA (virtual therapist) as a treatment guide., Adaption to Online Platform. Treatment content for VACT-CP will be integrated into the Northeastern University platform created and maintained by the relational agent research group managed by Dr. Timothy Bickmore, which has already programmed and run several VA-specific, IRB-approved interventions. Dr. Bickmore has confirmed that both the budget and timeline for this project are appropriate, and thus feasible. This website will be available to Veterans for free for this project, and Veterans will be able to re-access the any module where they left off, or restart a module if preferred after logging out using their de-identified username and password provided by research staff. For the purposes of pilot testing with providers and Veterans, the user interface will also first be mocked-up using PowerPoint slides, and following feedback from providers will then be adapted to the current ECA online platform (Phases 1 and 2). This platform will include elements such as personalized conversations with the embodied conversation agent, starting with a mindfulness exercise at the beginning of each module, and moving through major session components. Each session will incorporate different interactive psychoeducation experiences for each session, goal setting and tracking, and finally end with weekly homework aligned with the goals of the next session., Planning for and addressing potential safety concerns online is a major concern, and consultation for the inclusion of safety procedures and information has been provided by Drs. Kelly, Heapy, and Greene. Consequently, in addition to the modules, information regarding the Veteran Crisis Hotline will be incorporated into the website with the addition of a button providing phone number information and the PI's number will be included within the website as well should a Veteran need to access clinical staff. The investigators will also assess with Veterans whether they were able to locate these resources early in the usability and pilot testing., Qualitative Provider Interviews, Procedure. A sample of 10 current mental health providers (including social workers, physicians, PACT nurses, and psychologists) who provide treatment for chronic pain at the ENRM VA will be interviewed for formative assessment of the potential benefits, concerns, and institutional VHA dissemination issues for the VACT-CP intervention, using a semi-structured interview guide and a ""think-aloud"" strategy for intervention review., Sample. Providers will be recruited from presentations and emails to Primary Care/Behavioral Staff and the Mental Health Service Line at the Bedford VAMC, and scheduled for a time for a 45 minute to one hour interview during regular work hours, though potential participants will also have the option to interview over the phone. Participants will be consented for participating in the interview and having their participation audio-recorded., Interview Guide. This interview will include open-ended questions related to palatability of the intervention, feasibility of engagement with Veterans with chronic pain, interest or potential concerns with referring Veterans to such a program, and reactions to a short walk-through of the intervention. The purpose of these questions is to gather information from valuable stakeholders and potential referral-providers on VACT-CP system to address refinement of the program, possible benefits, barriers, referral concerns, and overall thoughts on the VACT-CP system Questions for palatability are based on the ""organizational perspective"" components of the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM). Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed., Provider Interview Analyses Qualitative data analysis will use a thematic approach for the data related to the goal of ascertaining intervention palatability and feasibility and referral issues, and a narrative approach for data collected with the goal of intervention refinement. Two independent reviewers will code Section 2 of the interview transcriptions using open-ended coding. Each element will be summarized separately, and overall summary themes will be generated. Summary tables of key points will be generated, similar to previous formative assessments performed. These tables will ensure data saturation has been reached for both provider input. Two reviewers will analyze qualitative data using a modified grounded coding to identify themes using audio recordings after each interview. Intervention areas will be modified as feedback is given. Each set of interviews will take place with 3 - 4 participants, to allow for iterative adjustment of the intervention based on feedback. Number of changes needed for each intervention area will be tracked, and less intervention refinement will be anticipated by the end of the interview cycle. However, if intervention palatability is not achieved, further testing using other providers will be utilized. The generated information and themes will be utilized for development and refinement of the VACT-CP intervention, to learn from major stakeholders important areas for potential revision during intervention development., PHASE 2: FEASIBILITY AND USABILITY TESTING The goals of Phase 2 are to: 1) gain further feedback on the VACT-CP treatment by gathering information from Veterans via usability testing to; 2) assess Veteran interest, satisfaction, and usability of the online VACT-CP treatment; 3) iteratively address any technological concerns. This Phase will allow for feedback and preliminary support that the Phase 3 small-pilot RCT is merited., Given past research suggesting that similar interventions are usable and beneficial, the investigators anticipate that usability findings suggesting concerns or places for revision will not be such a strong barrier that the intervention will not be at all useful in this population. However, should Phase 2 data indicate that a small-pilot RCT is not merited, the usability information from this Phase will be utilized to inform further VACT-CP refinement until the usability bugs have been worked out and the system is ready for testing in a feasibility pilot RCT. This information will also be disseminated to inform future online chronic pain treatment development., Sample Information, Sample Size: No single participant reviewer can identify all the usability problems in a system; typically 3-5 reviewers can identify 80% of the usability problems, with diminishing returns from additional reviewers per round of testing. The investigators will conduct 3 rounds of usability testing with 4-5 Veterans per round to assess and iteratively address usability concerns (n=12-15 total)., Recruitment. Subjects will be 15 patients primarily recruited by referral from the Primary Care Behavioral Health at the ENRM VA Hospital. Eligible participants will have a current diagnosis of non-cancer chronic pain, defined as related to either Musculoskeletal pain or Joint Problems/Osteoarthritis or presence of chronic pain of at least mild to moderate severity. The investigators have decided to target joint and musculoskeletal pain as these have been shown to best respond to psychological, behavioral interventions, whereas neuropathic pain and headaches having less research supporting this. However, the investigators will not exclude for other diagnoses of pain, as this is typical and would not necessarily preclude Veterans from benefiting from the treatment., The investigators have verified that there are 2,605 Veterans who were seen over the past year (i.e., having had at least two appointments for pain) at the Bedford VA with chronic, non-cancer pain concerns, suggesting that the recruitment goal of 15 Veterans within 3 months to do a single-session usability test for Phase 2 is achievable. In addition, I will give presentations to primary care providers, social workers, and mental health clinicians at the Bedford VA to enhance recruitment. Using CPRS, Veterans meeting eligibility criteria for chronic pain seen within 12 months at the Bedford VA will also be sent letters inviting them to participate., Screening Procedures. Callers will be screened by phone. Eligible participants will be scheduled for an in-person assessment with the PI, who will confirm study eligibility and obtain informed consent. A research associate affiliated with the research study will then conduct clinician-rated assessments, and subjects will complete self-report measures., Feasibility and Usability Assessment Procedures Eligible Veterans will come to the Bedford VA to complete baseline demographic and health measures. Following baseline assessment, Veterans will be provided with an iPad that will walk them through different portions of the user interface and treatment set-up, during which time they will be asked questions and recorded as a usability interview. Specifically, different images for options of the virtual therapy guide, as well as a PowerPoint with information about the user interface will be shown. Next, Veterans will be provided with written instructions for use, and do a behavioral walk-through of how to use the online system. Patients will be given instructions on interacting with the system, and will then walk through a portion of the treatment using PowerPoint slides that will simulate the VACT-CP treatment and usability interface, and then complete the Usability Survey and SUS (see measures below). During this time, the Veterans will take part in a contextual interview wherein Veterans move through the system unguided and are observed and asked questions about their experience. After this, additional, open-ended questions will be asked regarding Veteran preferences., For purposes of feedback and iterative program development, the Veteran will only be provided with the part of the first VACT-CP session during this time. The participant will then be left in a secure, confidential room to walk through the VACT-CP system on their own, during which time their use of the system will be recorded. Approximately 4 - 5 Veterans will be recruited and participate in this usability testing at a time, with 3 different usability testing arms, in order to allow for time to iteratively address any functionality issues or concerns with the user interface. Following this walkthrough, participants will be provided with measures of demographics, usability and health information technology use, including a retrospectively worded version of the Usability Survey items (e.g., I enjoyed using the VACT-CP program) and a semi-structured qualitative exit interview. Participants will receive compensation for their in-person visit, which should take approximately 2 - 3 hours., Assessment Measures A broad range of reliable and valid measures will be used to provide an assessment of chronic pain difficulties, demographic information, and technology use, technology interest, and comfort. In addition, Veterans will be observed while interfacing with the VACT-CP system, recorded, and asked questions by the interviewer. This will consist of specific questions related to the different parts of the system the veteran interacts with (e.g., the ECA design, structure of the modules, feedback system) as well as more open-ended when not provided with specific cues (e.g., what are you trying to get to from this page, what could be better about how this page is set up, etc.) Questions will be open-ended in nature, and address the extent of any problems with accessing and using the VACT-CP treatment online, how they might perceive the usefulness or importance of VACT-CP focal areas of treatment, whether they would recommend this treatment to a fellow Veteran, and any problems or concerns they may have with using the VACT-CP program., Using this additional, open-ended interview protocol, the investigators will also inquire as whether they would be interested in using the VACT-CP treatment at home and the role of their virtual therapist in the patient's interest in the treatment, and about past strategies or tools the patient used to address their chronic pain issues and whether the VACT-CP treatment might seem more useful than prior options or strategies. Finally, participants will be asked to indicate what, if any, changes they would make to the treatment to assist in self-management of their chronic pain. This will also include assessing their interest in it complementary and alternative methods of pain management (stretching, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, etc.) to assess if it would be useful and feasible to add these options to the platform later if desired. The interview will be video recorded and coded to look for similar themes, difficulties, revisions, and strengths of the system., Intervention Revisions During Phase 2, in which Veterans will interact with the VACT-CP online treatment, the investigators will: 1) gather feedback from Veterans regarding acceptability and usefulness of the treatment, 3) gather and analyze complementary data from SUS-8, 4) address any technological issues as they arise, and 5) examine preliminary data from this phase of the study. Modifications to the treatment will be based upon: 1) acceptability and feasibility of the online treatment, and 3) qualitative feedback obtained from patients, therapist, and mentors. Individual feedback sessions at the end of phase 2 will be held to gather information for refining the treatment manual and make it acceptable to patients., The investigators anticipate that the Veteran intervention reviewers might miss bugs or other user interface problems, and anticipate that some revisions to the online system and program may need to be made for Phase 3. For instance, one potential issue that may arise might be an inability for the Veteran to read the text on the tablet screen. After receiving this information during an initial feedback round, the researchers will amend the program with a potential solutions i.e. text size or text color being altered, with the revised version then being piloted in the next round of Veteran user testing. Some usability challenges will be addressed with introductory handouts/tutorial materials/orientation to the program at the beginning of the intervention session. In addition, large organizational issues will be discussed before moving on to platform refinement., Data Management Patient files will be kept in a locked cabinet and password protected files where data will be encoded with ID numbers. IDs will be unrelated to any identifying information. Video recordings will be stored on a secure, VA approved server. The majority of data analysis will consist of qualitative and observational methods, including coding qualitative interview data and coded video files. Data will be checked for inconsistencies, omissions and errors. As only 15 subjects will participate in Phase 2, only summary quantitative statistics will be computed to describe the sample and to determine outcome on the study measures. Data gathered through qualitative interviews and quantitative measures will be housed on a VA-approved cloud-based data storage server., Data Collection and Analysis Qualitative Combined Usability and Contextual Interview. The investigators will focus on usability and feasibility to address Aim 2. During 60-75-minute usability sessions held in private, secure rooms SoCRR rooms within the Bedford VAMC, participants will assess the usability of the VACT-CP intervention using a ""think-aloud protocol"", verbalizing their thoughts as they navigate the website. After a period of exploration with the site, the research staff will use a pre-created protocol to ask Veterans to perform a series of tasks on the website (i.e., entering therapy goals, accessing the different modules, completing pre-session assessment, interacting with the virtual therapist). The usability testing space is already equipped with a computer, tablet, and a web camera. As a participant navigates the intervention website on a tablet or computer, their actions will be recorded through webcam electronically, and Dr. Reilly will observe the actions in real-time within the room, and a blinded observer/note taker. Drs. Waring and Quigley will consult on usability testing procedures., The video recordings and notes made by Dr. Reilly during user testing will be transcribed and analyzed using NVivo software available through the Bedford VAMC. A modified consensual qualitative research (CQR) approach will be utilized to code the transcribed videos, which Dr. Reilly has been trained in and utilized in past peer-reviewed publications. CQR can be particularly useful in allowing for a team of coders to identify themes arising in both structured and more open-ended interview moments. Dr. Reilly will develop an initial codebook for using in coding based on the key activities and questions in the user-testing protocol. Dr. Reilly and the research associate will then employ the codebook in identifying usability-themes within the videos, with an additional research staff identified to act as a code auditor. According to CQR, the following processes occur to allow for depth and breadth in describing the shared experiences of participants: (b) two coders utilize the initial codebook throughout the data analysis process to foster multiple perspectives; (c) consensus is researched between coders about the meaning of the data; (d) at least one auditor must check the work of the primary team of judges and minimize potential bias; and (e) domains and themes are reported in terms of the frequency of arising themes., Themes will then be categorized according to the following CQR groupings: general (include all or all but one of the cases), typical (include more than half of the cases up to the cutoff for general), and variant (at least two cases up to the cutoff for typical). Specifically, the themes generated by this qualitative data will be used to identify user performance measures, errors and difficulties, and tasks that do not meet acceptable criteria, and general trends and categories of users' behavior such as how well users can complete an assigned task on the VACT-CP system and where they are encountering problems. Using this method, the investigators will classify all general comments regarding usability as necessary to include in iterative development, while variant and typical will be discussed within the research group to decide upon potential ways to incorporate this feedback into intervention refinement., In addition, Veterans will complete a series of brief usability questionnaires following user testing and the qualitative interview. Usability Survey and SUS data will be input into REDCap, reported descriptively using SPSS software, and used to describe Veteran's general perceptions and opinions of the technology's usability, both within the controlled testing setting and for future use within their home. This feedback will then be triangulated with qualitative data, and used to iteratively refine the VACT-CP program between the three waves of user testing. The investigators will complete this process with 4-5 Veterans per round; Dr. Reilly then summarize suggested changes, obtain input from the full mentoring team, then meet with Dr. Bickmore's staff to implement potential changes. Results will be published to inform other researchers about usability findings related to format feedback, user interface, interest, and perceptions of behavioral intervention content., PHASE 3: FEASIBILITY PILOT RCT, The goals of the feasibility pilot RCT study phase are to conduct a Stage 1b RCT pilot trial to: 3a) explore relationships between Veteran traits, usability beliefs, and technology perceptions on intended and actual use of the VACT-CP system; 3b) describe differences in VACT-CP versus a wait-list control group on pre- and post-test measures of pain acceptance, pain level, pain-related functioning, and quality of life, treatment satisfaction with the VACT-CP system and ACT-related outcomes including pain acceptance, valued living and experiential avoidance; 3c) evaluative the relative feasibility and acceptability of the VACT-CP intervention procedure and waitlist control, including ease of recruitment, retention in each condition, treatment receptivity, attrition and retention in each condition, sustained participation, and the assessment process. A total of 40 Veterans will be enrolled to test the VACT-CP system within their home., Participant Selection and Recruitment, Sample Size: Based on the previous recruitment of Veterans with chronic pain at the Bedford VAMC, the investigators estimate that approximately 65% of Veterans screened for participation by research staff, recruitment letters, flyer recruitment, and referrals from PCBH staff (N=60 enrolled participants) will meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and be eligible for the pilot trial. Similar to Phase 2, the investigators will not exclude for other diagnoses of pain. Given this, the investigators will aim to recruit a total of 60 participants over fifteen months total to allow for the desired final 40 participants screened as eligible and randomized into the pilot RCT study, specifically aiming for recruiting 3-4 participants per month. Subjects for the proposed study will be recruited over the course of approximately 15 months and be screened according to their presence of chronic pain and other important., Subjects will be recruited from the Bedford VAMC, where 2,605 Veterans are currently (as of November, 2017) being seen at the Bedford VAMC for chronic, non-cancer pain concerns, suggesting that the investigators' final recruitment goal of 40 persons total enrolled (1.5% of the total Bedford population) is feasible. In addition, I will give presentations to primary care providers, social workers, and mental health clinicians at the Bedford VA to enhance recruitment. Using CPRS, Veterans meeting eligibility criteria for chronic pain seen within one month at the Bedford VA will also be sent letters inviting them to participate., Study Procedures and Assessment, Treatment Procedures. Following recruitment, a research associate not otherwise involved in the study will screen participants prior to enrollment. Veterans will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, with a research staff member utilizing and keeping the schedule. Veterans randomized to VACT-CP will receive 8 online-module based weekly sessions of treatment via personal computer or provided tablet with wireless accessibility at the Bedford VAMC. Veterans in the waitlist control will be provided with a list of common pain resources at the Bedford VAMC. The VACT-CP program will be housed on a secure web server through Northeastern University, with no Veteran private health information collected by the system., If during Phase 2 it becomes clear that more or less sessions are necessary (based on indicators previously discussed for usability and feasibility testing), the number of sessions for Phase 3 will be changed accordingly. Veterans in both conditions will complete the assessment battery (including all measures below, except for the treatment satisfaction and working alliance inventory) at baseline. In addition, the full battery will be taken at mid-point of the intervention phase (4 weeks) and at the end, immediately following the treatment (8 weeks). Veterans will be tracked in terms of their post-referral treatment engagement (e.g., enrolling in any of the pain-resource options on the handout). In addition, a research associate will call the Veteran at weeks 3 and 6 and conduct a brief safety assessment and qualitative interview with Veterans assess for potential suicidality, usability issues, and participant health and well-being.","NCT03655132 (2018//).

1701,"Background and significance. Chronic migraine (CM) is a negative evolution of migraine characterized by frequent headache attacks (>45 days/three months) with a 1-year prevalence of 3.1%. Comorbidities, lifestyle and excessive intakes of symptomatic medications (medication overuse-MO) play a role in progression into CM; altered inflammatory state (WBC, peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19) and dysfunctions in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine circuit were found in CMMO patients. To prevent CM-MO relapse, withdrawal of overused drugs and complementing pharmacological prophylaxis with behavioral treatments is indicated [5]. Withdrawal from MO and medical prophylaxis determine a 30-40% reduction in headaches frequency by 12 months, and 40-50% of patients show a reduction >=50%. Conversely, 30% of them relapse into CM-MO by 12 months: the main drivers include overuse of analgesic compared to triptans and being on medical therapy alone compared to adjuvant psychological techniques. Research demonstrated the utility of relaxation training, stress management, cognitive-behavioral therapy in migraine disorder. Parallel to this, mindfulness showed considerable promise particularly on headache-related disability, affective distress: however, to date evidence of its efficacy is limited by small trials, short follow-up periods, inadequate power and poor consideration of primary outcomes for CM research, i.e. reduction of headaches frequency. Our main hypothesis is that mindfulness might provide additional benefit, when added to medical prophylaxis alone, on both primary (i.e. an increased number of patients showing a reduction of headaches frequency >=50%) and secondary outcomes: reduction in the consumption of symptomatic medications (i.e. analgesics, triptans, opioids, ergot-derivate), reduction of disability, depression, anxiety and cutaneous allodynia, improvement in quality of life; reduction of costs, connected to both lower direct medical costs (e.g. drugs consumption and attendance to ER) and indirect costs (i.e. reduction in lost workdays and improved workplace efficiency); reduction in concentration of the markers of inflammatory pattern; reversible neuroadaptations highlighted by functional connectivity in regions of dopaminergic circuit., The study will be a Phase III; randomized, Open-Label; Monocentric study. Patients will be enrolled to detect a 20% difference between the two groups on the primary outcome (50% or more of headache reduction by 12 months). We set alpha 0.05 and power 80%, and foresee that up to 12% of patients might be lost at follow-up: therefore, we determined that 170 patients should be randomized 1:1 to the two groups. Patients will be excluded if they: have psychiatric comorbidities of psychotic area; pregnancy; comorbidity with secondary headaches (e.g. idiopathic intracranial hypertension); were submitted to withdrawal from MO at least twice in the previous two years; attended any mindfulness-based therapy. For each medication type and research arm 20 patients will be selected: thus 80 patients will be enrolled for neuroradiological investigation. The treatment consists in six 45 minutes weekly sessions. The main focus of the six session will be the following: 1) introduction and meaning; 2) Focus on breath; 3) posture and body awareness; 4) meditation of sounds; 5) Guided imagery; 6) acceptance and awareness., Our project is highly innovative as it will be the first time in which a new emerging treatment like Mindfulness is tested for its efficacy and cost-efficacy when added to standard pharmacological prophylaxis. If our hypothesis will be confirmed, then we will positively impact on: a) clinicians, that will have confirmation of another valid adjuvant treatment option; b) national health system, that will cut down the relevant costs of medication intake and indirect costs associated to reduced productivity; c) patients, that will enhance their ability to cope with headaches and improve their overall health, quality of life, work-ability and reduce their disability. Moreover, our study will address the possible impact of Mindfulness as an add-on to pharmacological prophylaxis not only on clinical data, such as headaches frequency and symptomatic medications intake, but also on biomarkers of inflammatory and functional neuroimaging patterns.","NCT03671681 (2018//).

1702,"Nearly 2.5 million individuals in the United States have opioid use disorder (OUD), with the vast majority (2 million) reporting abuse of prescription opioids. Patients with a history of substance use are particularly vulnerable to experiencing pain. Indeed, a large percentage of patients with OUD who receive the effective opioid agonist treatments (OAT) buprenorphine or methadone (MMT), report that pain preceded any use of addictive substances, and that the primary reason for starting opioid use was to reduce pain. Among methadone patients, 37-61% suffer from chronic pain that is often severe and interferes with daily activities. Similarly, in studies of chronic pain in buprenorphine patients, approximately 48% of patients report chronic pain. OAT recipients report far higher rates of chronic pain than the wider US population., Chronic pain has been associated with negative substance use outcomes in persons receiving buprenorphine for opioid detoxification and in people receiving MMT. Providers may prioritize the treatment of substance use in OUD patients, leaving the concurrent pain untreated. Lack of treatment encourages patients to use illicit opioids for pain relief. Indeed, for persons using buprenorphine, greater pain severity in a given week was significantly associated with increased likelihood of opioid use in the following week., Pain contributes to other negative outcomes. Pain is an independent risk factor for suicide including in samples of substance use disorder patients. Further, compared to MMT patients without pain, those with pain have significantly greater health problems and psychological distress. Pain, poor health, and low energy are the most commonly cited reasons that OAT patients are physically inactive. The continued physical and social problems in patients with pain influence the perception of (lack of) treatment benefits by both patients and providers., Duration of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is a key predictor of long-term abstinence and outcomes improve across a variety of domains if patients remain in care for at least one year. Although buprenorphine is a growing ambulatory treatment, retention in care remains problematic. Across practice sites and, despite variations in visit frequency, the 12-month retention rate ranges from 50-80% with the majority of treatment drop-out occurring during the first three months of treatment. Though few studies have yet examined the role of pain, pain has been found to negatively impact buprenorphine treatment retention., Studies estimate that approximately one third to one half of MMT and buprenorphine recipients suffer from depression. Several studies have reported that opioid dependent patients with chronic pain have greater depressive symptoms and a greater probability of occupational disability compared to patients with lower level or no chronic pain. Amongst MMT patients, higher psychiatric distress is associated with lower general functioning. Methadone counselors report difficulty treating patients with chronic pain due in part to these patients' co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. In the only study of antidepressant treatment for depressed persons initiating buprenorphine, the investigators found in a secondary analysis that pain is prevalent, interferes with functioning, and its severity plateaus after one month of buprenorphine. Importantly, as with chronic pain, depressive symptoms have been associated with greater likelihood of relapse to opioid use in OAT patients. The substantial overlap of pain and depression in OAT patients suggest that functioning may improve most when depression and pain are simultaneously treated in an integrated fashion that is theoretically-based., TOPPS is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that consists of three main components: 1) psychoeducation about pain, depression, opioid misuse, their interaction, and the maintaining role of avoidance; 2) coaching in being an informed, activated patient; and 3) behavioral activation with a focus on acceptance. Modern behavioral activation is idiographic and responsive to each patient's unique environment, needs, and goals. The function of a behavior is analyzed, and if the function is avoidance (e.g., of social contact, personal engagement, or physical activity), the behavior is targeted for change. Patients are taught to consider behavioral options, and to choose an option inconsistent with avoidance. There is an implicit attitude of acceptance of thoughts and feelings, as behavior is not dependent on changing thoughts and feelings. Behavior activation for depression focuses on helping patients to set goals in meaningful life areas, and then to break down long-term goals into smaller weekly goals. This process is incompatible with behavioral avoidance and instead, encourages patients to approach meaningful life goals. Barriers that arise in achieving short-term goals are addressed in treatment., TOPPS focuses on the relationship of pain, depression, opioid and other substance misuse, and functioning. It has a structured agenda, uses behavioral activation, involves explicit and ongoing psychoeducation, and includes a BHS trained extensively in the nature of pain and opioid misuse and relapse. Devised specifically for primary care patients receiving buprenorphine, TOPPS is collaborative (physician, interventionist, and patient) and focuses on depression, pain and physical symptoms in order to decrease the need to turn to substance misuse to avoid pain, increase overall functioning and to foster patient's abilities to achieve their long-term life goals.","NCT03698669 (2018//).

1703,"SunBrite is a novel, evidence-based intervention for non-accidental trauma (NAT) that has not, as yet, been implemented in any health care setting. Current programs targeting NAT vary widely, and there is insufficient research to conclude that these efforts have reduced re-admission rates(12,13). EDs primarily screen for risk factors associated with child abuse, focusing on their role in reporting and developing forensic evidence for investigations but not on risk reduction. While such efforts as embedding child protection teams in trauma programs are a starting point, much more needs to be done to develop a standard of care and empirically demonstrate efforts that reduce the risk of subsequent injury., The overlap between non-accidental trauma (NAT) and inadequate caregiver supervision provides an opportunity to identify and intervene during earlier health care visits for children at risk for severe or fatal injury. Because head injuries account for over 80% of all suspected non-accidental injuries and over 90% of fatalities in the pediatric population, this intervention specifically targets all children ages 0-2 years who present in the Phoenix Children's Hospital (PCH) ED with a diagnosed head injury of any kind not resulting from a motor vehicle collision (MVC). These injuries include, but ae not limited to, abrasions, contusions, hematoma, ischemia, fractures, swelling or bruising. In this way, SunBrite expands the scope of detection for NAT to include injuries resulting from supervisory neglect., PCH will implement the SunBrite pilot protocol in collaboration with key community partners who will be extensively involved in project design, implementation, and evaluation. In preparation for study recruitment, PCH and its partners will formalize the SunBrite process, create a curriculum, draft training tools to support the fidelity of SunBrite, finalize study materials (e.g., worksheets, data collection forms, interview scripts, consent documentation, and logic model), and conduct professional training. Once development is complete, pediatric patient families will be enrolled into the pilot program., SunBrite study will utilize a simple, randomized, prospective study design, with 221 eligible pilot study participants randomized upon triage to one of two study arms: the control arm (73 families) or the treatment arm (148 families). Families in the control group will receive treatment as usual (TAU), which includes reporting to child welfare agencies when appropriate. In the treatment group, the patient/family will receive the SunBrite protocol, whose components include a screening, a brief intervention based in motivational interviewing (MI) techniques, and referral to treatment. All abuse and neglect, no matter the study arm, will be reported in accordance with hospital policy, federal and state laws., All self-identified primary caregivers (legal guardians or parents) of children ages 0-2 who present in the PCH ED with a diagnosed intracranial injury will be automatically screened for eligibility. Caregivers will be initially screened by ED clinicians (e.g., physicians, nurse-practitioners) for eligibility based on age, injury (head), and method of injury (MOI) (non-MVC) using a standard clinical interview currently in place. All caregivers who screen positive based on these three criteria will then be deemed eligible for SunBrite. A trauma social worker will be notified by the ED that they have an eligible patient for consult. The social worker will meet the family and briefly describe the study and their eligibility. If they are willing to participate, the social worker will then obtain informed consent. All patient families will be fully consented in person in English or Spanish., The screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment will occur in the ED in the form of an abbreviated social work consultation prior to discharge. A social worker will complete an assessment for supervisory and household risks and then complete an injury risk worksheet to be used in the brief intervention. The social worker will engage caregivers in a 20- to 30-minute motivational interview (i.e., social work consult) using parent-coaching techniques for medical settings(12). In-person coaching facilitates active practice of these skills, supports further development of desired behaviors, and promotes long-term, sustainable risk mitigation., The referral-to-treatment component of SunBrite identifies risks that may require further professional intervention, such as a history of trauma, mental illness, or substance abuse. For risks that warrant longer-term treatment, social workers will make referrals to external agencies and professionals for psychiatric evaluation, medication management, medically-assisted treatment (MAT), cognitive-behavioral therapy, and PTSD treatment., Data from all participants, regardless of randomization, will be collected from patient health records. This will include patient demographics, injury characteristics, labs, imaging, consults, diagnoses, treatments, complications, and discharge notes. Patients will be followed for up to 12 months to assess study outcomes. The primary outcomes for this study are rates re-hospitalization (including frequency of hospitalization and length of stay) and return ED visits for any ICD-10 code. Secondary outcomes include complications from the indexed traumatic injury, other illnesses and conditions unrelated to trauma, and cost savings from reduced ED return visits and admissions. Based on PCH admissions data, we expect that 50% of eligible patients will return to the ED with an injury within one year of discharge. In addition to tracking all patients for 12 months post-discharge for any diagnosis at PCH, we will match our participants to the statewide database housed at the Arizona State University (ASU) Center for Health Information Research., Quantitatively, we hypothesize that the proportion of patients measured on the primary outcome (return to ED) for the experimental group will be statistically smaller than the proportion in the control group under the following assumptions of a superiority design: 1) the percentage of patients that we expect to return to the ED is approximately 50% for the control group within one year of discharge to home and 25% for the experimental group; 2) the risk of type I error is alpha=.025; 3) power=.80. These parameters require a total sample size of 134 with a sample size of 67 for each group. However, we are planning to randomize in an unequal allocation of 2:1 to the experimental arm and oversample by 10%, bringing the total sample size up to 221 (148 in the experimental arm and 73 in the control arm). This design has an advantage in early phase trials, allowing investigators to explore treatment dimensions and optimize treatment utility., We will also employ qualitative methods to provide rich feedback to enhance the implementation process and ensure project fidelity (e.g., identifying barriers and strategies to sustainability and wider dissemination). A formative evaluation of SunBrite will follow a plan, do, review, revise cycle of performance management that addresses the following intervention components: screening, staffing, brief intervention fidelity, referral, data collection, and reporting. . Quarterly advisory board meetings with community partners throughout the pilot program will provide an opportunity to update stakeholders on the pilot and receive feedback on implementation. Interviews with key stakeholders occurring at the start of the pilot, during program recruitment, and at the end of the recruitment process will provide important feedback to keep the pilot on track and achieve program goals. Voluntary interviews will assess experience with implementation and acceptability of SunBrite as implemented. Significantly, a research plan will be developed to validate SunBrite in a multi-site randomized trial., To prepare for SunBrite information dissemination statewide, PCH will facilitate ongoing development of a formalized screening tool for use in EDs and manualize the SunBrite brief intervention and referral system. We will also design a dissemination plan (including funding) for SunBrite to incorporate a telemedicine option for the brief intervention. We will also disseminate findings from the pilot nationally through speaking engagements, conferences, posters, and published papers. In coordination with our community partners, we will develop a plan to sustain SunBrite in the PCH ED and to promote dissemination to other trauma centers.","NCT03704272 (2018//).

1705,"BACKGROUND: Describing how and why an evidence-based intervention is adapted for a new population and setting using a formal evaluation and an adaptation framework can inform others seeking to modify evidence-based weight management interventions for different populations or settings. The Working for You intervention was adapted, to fit a workplace environment, from Be Fit Be Well, an evidence-based intervention that targets weight-control and hypertension in patients at an outpatient clinic. Workplace-based efforts that promote diet and activity behavior change among low-income employees have potential to address the obesity epidemic. This paper aims to explicitly describe how Be Fit Be Well was adapted for this new setting and population., METHODS: To describe and understand the worksite culture, environment, and policies that support or constrain healthy eating and activity in the target population, we used qualitative and quantitative methods including key informant interviews, focus groups, and a worker survey; these data informed intervention adaptation. We organized the adaptations made to Be Fit Be Well using an adaptation framework from implementation science., RESULTS: The adapted intervention, Working for You, maintains the theoretical premise and evidence-base underpinning Be Fit Be Well. However, it was modified in terms of the means of delivery (i.e., rather than using interactive voice response, Working for You employs automated SMS text messaging), defined as a modification to context by the adaptation framework. The adaptation framework also includes modifications to content; in this case the behavioral goals were modified for the target population based on updated science related to weight loss and to target a workplace population (e.g., a goal to avoiding free food at work)., CONCLUSIONS: If effective, this scalable and relatively inexpensive intervention can be translated to other work settings to reduce obesity and diabetes risk among low-SES workers, a group with a higher prevalence of these conditions. Using a formal evaluation and framework to guide and organize how and why an evidence-based intervention is adapted for a new population and setting can push the field of intervention research forward., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02934113 ; Received: October 12, 2016; Updated: November 7, 2017.","Strickland JR Tabak RG (2018//).

Method(s): Offices (n = 12; 89 workers) were randomized into an 8-week intervention (n = 48) incorporating organizational, individual, and environmental elements or control arm. Sitting time, physical activity, and cardiometabolic health were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Result(s): Linear mixed modelling revealed no significant change in workplace sitting time, but changes in workplace prolonged sitting time (-39 min/shift), sit-upright transitions (7.8 per shift), and stepping time (12 min/shift) at follow-up were observed, in favor of the intervention group (P <0.001). Results for cardiometabolic health markers were mixed. Conclusion(s): This short multicomponent workplace intervention was successful in reducing prolonged sitting and increasing physical activity in the workplace, although total sitting time was not reduced and the impact on cardiometabolic health was minimal.

1707,"Numerous publications have now addressed the principles of designing, analyzing, and reporting the results of stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials. In contrast, there is little research available pertaining to the design and analysis of multiarm stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials, utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of multiple experimental interventions. In this paper, we address this by explaining how the required sample size in these multiarm trials can be ascertained when data are to be analyzed using a linear mixed model. We then go on to describe how the design of such trials can be optimized to balance between minimizing the cost of the trial and minimizing some function of the covariance matrix of the treatment effect estimates. Using a recently commenced trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of sensor monitoring in an occupational therapy rehabilitation program for older persons after hip fracture as an example, we demonstrate that our designs could reduce the number of observations required for a fixed power level by up to 58%. Consequently, when logistical constraints permit the utilization of any one of a range of possible multiarm stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial designs, researchers should consider employing our approach to optimize their trials efficiency.

1708,"BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Depression with a global prevalence of over 4% is a major public health problem and is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss. There is a need to identify interventions that are relatively cost-efficient, scalable, and can be offered to many people. Treatment for depressive disorders typically includes anti-depressant medication and/or counselling and psychotherapy., Exercise as a form of treatment for depressive disorders, especially of mild-to-moderate severity, has evidence of benefit. In fact, the magnitude of the effect of exercise as a treatment for depression is reported to be comparable to conventional treatment. An umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the use of exercise to treat depressive symptoms in older adults, for example, concluded that exercise is safe and efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms in older people and it should be considered as a core intervention in the multidisciplinary treatment of depression in this age group. A meta-analysis adjusting for publication bias, concluded that ""exercise has a large and significant antidepressant effect in people with depression"". The mechanisms by which exercise decreases depressive symptoms may include biological mechanisms, such as anti-inflammatory effects or increasing neurotransmitter levels implicated in depression. Other mechanisms may include increasing self-efficacy or enhancing social interaction., Despite this strong evidence base, few studies have incorporated multiple treatment conditions in a randomized controlled trial design, and few studies appear to have assessed the effect of group CBT. In addition, few studies could be found that compared group CBT, group exercise, and wait-listing for treatment as usual conditions. This is important in further delineating the effective components of treatment for mild to moderate depression, and results have implications for service delivery and clinical recommendations in the treatment of depression within healthcare organizations in Alberta and beyond. Specifically, patients with MDD referred to Addiction and Mental Health (AMH) Clinics in Edmonton Zone may wait for weeks before receiving individual treatment. Thus, if found to be effective, group treatment conditions examined in this study may serve as an expedient treatment avenue to decrease wait-list times for patients with MDD., AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the project is to conduct a three-arm randomized controlled pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and initial efficacy of group CBT or group exercise on depression symptom scores and quality of life measures in patients with MDD. The client outcomes will be organized according to: functional variables (quality of life, employment), symptom variables (change in depressive symptoms scores), and service variables (e.g. patient compliance and retention in treatment and patient satisfaction)., Given the aim, the objectives of the project are to compare mean changes in recovery, functional outcomes, clinical symptoms, and service satisfaction variables after seven and fourteen weeks for participants in each of the three arms of the study: 1) those receiving group CBT plus wait-listed to receive TAU; 2) those receiving scheduled exercise plus wait-listed to receive TAU; and 3) those only wait-listed to receive TAU., HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize that participants enrolled in the group CBT or group exercise conditions while wait-listed to receive TAU will achieve statistically superior outcomes compared to participants only wait-listed to receive TAU on each outcome measure used. In turn, participants enrolled in group CBT plus TAU will have comparable outcomes to those enrolled in the group exercise plus TAU arm of the study., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study will be a longitudinal, prospective, parallel design, three-arm, rater-blinded randomized clinical trial with a recruitment period of six months and an observation period of 14 weeks for each participant., The research will be carried out in a municipal recreational centre as well as AMH clinics in Edmonton, a large, socio-demographically diverse city in Western Canada. Potential participants will be recruited from the AMH Intake Clinic in Edmonton. Patients with depression at intake assessment who are presumed to meet the inclusion criteria of the study will be invited to enroll in this study., To confirm the diagnosis of MDD using the DSM 5 criteria, potential participants will be sent to the ""Mood and Anxiety clinic"" or ""Urgent Clinics"" in Edmonton where they will be assessed by one of a group of psychiatrists or psychiatry residents who are independent from the study team. The psychiatrist or resident may or may not initiate, continue or adjust pharmacotherapy. The diagnosis will be communicated to the study coordinator and clinic nurse. The participants with MDD will be informed of their eligibility to participate in the study and will be considered for randomization after providing informed consent whereas patients with other diagnoses will be informed of their exclusion from the study and will be directed to receive an appropriate treatment for their condition., After diagnostic confirmation by a psychiatrist, a clinic nurse who is trained in study procedures will provide the potential participants with an information leaflet about the study and answer any related questions they may have. All potential participants who agree to take part in the study will provide written informed consent prior the completion of baseline assessment measures and randomization., At baseline, demographic and contact information will be collected. The participants' name and contact information will also be collected but only used for future communication or for arrangement of treatment, assessment and follow-up sessions., Participant's Medical Record will also be reviewed to gather information about the participant's use of health services 3 months prior to enrollment in the study and 3 months after study completion to compare pre-post service utilization and determine if participation in the intervention group impacts the clients' use of other health services in the short term. This same data can also be used for any economic analyses (i.e., cost-effectiveness) that will be conducted., All the data will be stored for a minimum of 7 years prior to destruction as per the research ethics board requirements, and research ethics board requirements pertaining to collection and storage of information will be followed., SAMPLE SIZE: As this is a pilot study, the research will utilize data that can be elicited from participants who can be enrolled within existing operational resources and time frames. The study will therefore be limited to a sample size of 120, with about 40 patients recruited into each arm of the study., RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING: Randomization will be enacted via randomly generated codes. Each study participant will receive a randomization code. Because it will not be possible for participants to be blinded, treatment allocation will be made explicit to them as soon as randomization is concluded. Outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment group allocation by not involving them in discussions about study participants and not granting them access to the database that contains the randomization code. In addition, study participants will self-complete all outcome assessments with the assessor facilitating procedural aspects if needed. Moreover, these assessors will not be involved in data analysis. After data collection is complete all data will undergo a blind review for the purposes of finalizing the planned analysis., FOLLOW UP ASSESSMENT: At 7 and 14 weeks, a blinded researcher will contact all study participants and assist them in the completion of a range of assessment tools related to the primary and secondary outcome measures. The participants who are wait-listed to receive TAU will be assessed at 7 and 14 weeks from the time they are added to the wait-list even if they are not receiving any treatment at the time of assessment., STATISTICAL METHODS: The primary goal of the statistical analysis will be to produce summary descriptive statistics for the longitudinal data, which will provide estimates for future sample size calculations and enable calculation of effect size. The data will be analyzed using repeated measures and effect size analyses, and correlational analyses will be completed between measures at each time point. The results of this study will guide the design for a future, more highly powered, study., PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: The study was designed and finalized based on feedback from patient representatives. This randomized trial also offers patients the opportunity to provide feedback via the patient satisfaction survey., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Hong Kong Amendment) and Good Clinical Practice (Canadian Guidelines). Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant. The study has received ethical clearance from Health Ethics Research Board of the University of Alberta (Ref. # Pro 00080975) and operational approval from the regional health authority (AHS # 43638). The results will be disseminated at several levels, including patients, practitioners, academics/researchers, and healthcare organizations., The investigators will plan an organizational engagement strategy to advance discussions about feasibility and effectiveness prior to the conclusion of the trial. This will help ensure the findings are a relevant part of decision-making processes in a way that is aligned with study findings as they emerge. This may facilitate planning of a larger study that is endorsed at both leadership and operational levels, so that the potential benefits of the interventions can reach patients in a more timely fashion., DISCUSSION: The results of the study will provide important information about the effectiveness of group CBT and/or group exercise in treatment of MDD. This will augment the literature in this area, and also provide practical benefits in examining if benefit can be derived from group treatment modalities. Currently, patients with MDD referred to AMH Clinics in Edmonton Zone may wait for weeks before receiving care from a health care professional in a one-to-one setting. Long wait may negatively impact patients' well-being, personal and occupational function as well as their satisfaction with care, and a group-based treatment may serve as an alternative for patients with MDD that can be more expediently accessed., The results of the pilot trial may inform the implementation of a multi-center clinical trial and provide useful information for administrators and clinicians who are interested in incorporating these interventions into existing care. The investigators expect that the pilot findings will inform and support administrative decision-making with respect to further scaling and studying the intervention within the province of Alberta and beyond., AUTHORS' CONTRIBUTIONS: The study was conceived and designed by VIOA who also contributed to drafting of the initial and final drafts of the manuscript.

1709,"Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability among active duty service members in the U.S. armed forces. Standard rehabilitative care and complementary and integrative health therapies are used for chronic pain rehabilitation. However, the optimal sequence and duration of these therapies has yet to be determined. This article describes a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) protocol being used to identify the optimal components and sequence of standard rehabilitative care and complementary and integrative health therapies for reducing pain impact and improving other patient outcomes. Active duty service members referred to Madigan Army Medical Center for treatment of chronic pain are being recruited to the Determinants of the Optimal Dose and Sequence of Functional Restoration and Integrative Therapies study. Study participants are randomized to either standard rehabilitative care (physical and occupational therapy and psychoeducation) or complementary and integrative health therapies (chiropractic, acupuncture, yoga and psychoeducation). Those participants who do not respond to the first 3weeks of treatment are randomized to receive an additional 3weeks of either (1) the alternative treatment or (2) the first-stage treatment plus the alternative treatment. This study will also determine factors associated with treatment response that can support clinical decision making, such as baseline fitness, pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, post-traumatic stress, pain self-efficacy, and biological indicators. The information gained from this research will be applicable to all integrative chronic pain rehabilitation programs throughout the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the broader rehabilitation community.

1710,"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an online-assisted, occupational therapist-delivered, cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention to promote physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). METHOD: Fifty-seven participants with KOA were randomized 2:1 to the Engage program (eight clinic-based sessions supported by online modules) or usual care. Using analysis of covariance, we estimated Engage's effect on physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index's Physical Function subscale [WOMAC-PF]) at 6 mo. RESULTS: Data were analyzed on 46 completers. Engage was associated with a small effect (eta2 = 0.01) on the WOMAC-PF. More Engage participants than controls reported much or very much improvement (45% vs. 13%; p = .03). Satisfaction was high, and 30 of 31 participants attended six sessions or more. CONCLUSION: An online-supported cognitive-behavioral program for people with KOA delivered by occupational therapists is feasible and may contribute to improved physical function.

1711,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the exercise loads and cognitive effects of a classical workplace program from that for a motor-cognitive coordination workplace intervention. METHODS: Twenty-eight (28) employed adults (women 19, men 9) participated in a motor-cognitive coordination and a classical workplace health promotion exercise intervention. Effects on attention and cognition (trail making test [TMT]) as well as exercise load (heart rate and rates of perceived exhaustion [RPE]) were assessed. RESULTS: The motor-cognitive intervention does not improve cognitive abilities (TMT-A: -4.6 +/- 2.2 seconds; TMT-B: -8.5 +/- 3.2 seconds) to a greater extent than the classical workplace health enhancement training (TMT-A: -4.6 +/- 3.1 seconds; TMT-B: -7.4 +/- 3.9 seconds) (P < 0.05). The exercise load was not different between the two interventions (maximal heart rate: 107 +/- 8 vs 111 +/- 6 bpm; RPE: 11.8 +/- 1.7 vs 11.9 +/- 1.2 points). CONCLUSIONS: The motor-cognitive workplace intervention may be adopted as an additional/alternate enhancement in terms of varied activity, and not as a compensation intervention for workplace health.

1712,"BACKGROUND: Videoconferencing-based treatments have shown great potential in increasing engagement and compliance by decreasing the barriers of time and distance. In general, employees tend to experience a lot of stress, but find it difficult to visit a clinic during office hours. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a mobile videoconference-based intervention for stress reduction and resilience enhancement in employees. METHODS: In total, 81 participants were randomly allocated to one of the three conditions: mobile videoconferencing, in-person, and self-care; of these, 72 completed the study. All participants underwent assessment via self-reported questionnaires before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention. Intervention lasted for 4 weeks and consisted of elements of cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and meditation. Changes in clinical variables regarding stress and resilience across time were compared between treatment conditions. RESULTS: There were significant condition x time effects on variables measuring perceived stress, resilience, emotional labor, and sleep, demonstrating significantly differential effects across time according to treatment condition. Moreover, there were significant effects of condition on perceived stress and occupational stress. There were no significant differences in any variable between the mobile videoconferencing and in-person conditions at 1 month after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that both mobile videoconferencing and in-person interventions were comparably effective in decreasing stress and enhancing resilience. Further studies with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up period are warranted to investigate the long-term effect of mobile videoconferencing interventions.

1713,"BACKGROUND: Accurately conceptualizing intensive care nurse work well-being is fundamental for successful engagement with workplace well-being interventions. Little is currently known about intensive care nurse work well-being. AIMS: The study aimed to identify intensive care nurses' conceptions of work well-being and ascertain whether the term 'work well-being' is prototypically organized. METHODS: Three linked studies conceptualize intensive care nurse well-being. For study one, participants listed key features of work well-being as free-text responses. Study two measured whether there was prototypical organization of these responses. Study three sought to confirm the prototypical organization of the term 'work well-being' through narrative ratings. RESULTS: A total of 82 New Zealand intensive care nurses were randomly allocated to the three studies; 65 participated. In study one (n =23), the most frequently endorsed elements included: workload (n =14), job satisfaction (n =13) and support (n =13). In study two (n =25), the highest rated elements included: feeling valued, respect, support, work-life balance and workplace culture. Elements of support, work-life balance and workload were in the top five most frequently endorsed elements and were also rated in the top 12 most central. Overall, the ratings of centrality and number of endorsements were positively correlated (r = 0.35, P < 0.05). In study three (n =17), nine participants selected the same rating across both narratives with no differentiation on the 11-point scale and were excluded from analysis. The mean score for the central narrative was 7.88 and for the peripheral narrative was 7.38. Confirmatory analyses did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Unique conceptions of work well-being were identified. Workload and work-life balance were central characteristics. Feeling valued and experiencing respect and support were considered most important.

1714,"AIM: It is now necessary to investigate whether recovery in psychosis is possible without the use of antipsychotic medication. This study will determine (1) whether a first-episode psychosis (FEP) group receiving intensive psychosocial interventions alone can achieve symptomatic remission and functional recovery; (2) whether prolonging the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) in a sub-group according to randomisation will be associated with a poorer outcome and thereby establish whether the relationship between DUP and outcome is causative; and (3) whether neurobiological changes observed in FEP are associated with the psychotic disorder or antipsychotic medication. Baseline characteristics of participants will be presented. METHODS: This study is a triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial. The primary outcome is the level of functioning measured by the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale at 6 months. This study is being conducted at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, Melbourne and includes young people aged 15 to 24 years with a DSM-IV psychotic disorder, a DUP less than 6 months and not high risk for suicide or harm to others. Strict discontinuation criteria are being applied. Participants are also undergoing three 3-Tesla-MRI scans. RESULTS: Ninety participants have been recruited and baseline characteristics are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Staged treatment and acceptability guidelines in early psychosis will determine whether antipsychotic medications are indicated in all young people with a FEP and whether antipsychotic medication can be safely delayed. Furthermore, the relative contribution of psychotic illness and antipsychotic medication in terms of structural brain changes will also be elucidated. The findings will inform clinical practice guidelines.","Francey SM O'Donoghue B (2018//).

1717,"Background--Sedentary work is hazardous. Over 80% of all US jobs are predominantly sedentary, placing full-time office workers at increased risk for cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity and mortality. Thus, there is a critical need for effective workplace physical activity interventions. MapTrek is a mobile health platform that gamifies Fitbit use for the purpose of promoting physical activity. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of MapTrek for increasing daily steps and moderate-intensity steps over 10 weeks in a sample of sedentary office workers. Methods and Results--Participants included 146 full-time sedentary office workers aged 21 to 65 who reported sitting at least 75% of their workday. Each participant received a Fitbit Zip to wear daily throughout the intervention. Participants were randomized to either a: (1) Fitbit-only group or 2) Fitbit + MapTrek group. Physical activity outcomes and intervention compliance were measured with the Fitbit activity monitor. The Fitbit + MapTrek group significantly increased daily steps (+2092 steps per day) and active minutes (+11.2 min/day) compared to the Fitbit-only arm, but, on average, participants' steps declined during the study period. Conclusions--MapTrek is an effective approach for increasing physical activity at a clinically meaningful level in sedentary office workers, but as with accelerometer use alone, the effect decreases over time.

1720,"Self-harm is defined as intentional self-poisoning or self-injury, whether or not there is evidence that the act was intended to result in death. In the past, the term used was 'attempted suicide.' However, peoples' motives for harming themselves are highly variable, a person may have more than one motive and motivation is hard to assess. In line with usual public policy in health and social care, the investigators use the term 'self-harm' describing a behaviour - avoiding the word 'deliberate' because many service users or consumers dislike its connotations., In Ontario, the number of people who present to hospital emergency departments with self-harm is difficult to accurately assess, but the best estimate is about 30,000 each year. The most common form of self-harm seen in emergency departments (around 80% of episodes) is the intentional consumption of an excess of a medicinal or toxic product, whether or not there is evidence that the act was intended to result in death. Injuries, most commonly self-cutting, form 15-20% of episodes., Two-thirds of people attending emergency departments because of self-harm are under 35 years of age. They are high users of health and social care services. Self-harm has a strong association with suicide: 7 patients per 1000 (about 1%) die by suicide in the year after attending emergency departments with a non-fatal episode (60 times the general population risk), rising to as many as 30 patients per 1000 over the next 15 years. In a recent longitudinal study conducted at the University of Toronto, ""all-cause mortality following a first episode of self-poisoning was 1107 per 100,000 person-years[horizontal ellipsis] [with] nearly half of all deaths being suicides, accidents or undetermined intent."" About a quarter of suicides are preceded by a hospital visit due to non-fatal self-harm in the previous year. It is the major identifiable risk factor for suicide. Mortality from non-suicidal causes is also high, with significantly more than the expected numbers of deaths from natural causes and from accidents. Whilst four of ten people who present with self-harm are men, they form nearly two thirds of suicides after an episode and are far more likely than women to die of premature death from other causes. The premature deaths are greatly over-represented among young people and the life years lost to the community are many., Repetition of non-fatal self-harm stands at around 20% annually and is associated with much distress and many unresolved interpersonal problems. It is likely that any reduction in repetition of self-harm will be mirrored by a fall in subsequent suicides. The Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention blueprint for a National Suicide Prevention Strategy (CASP) has identified those who have presented to hospital with non-fatal self-harm as a high risk target group to reduce suicide., People attending emergency departments after self-harm receive a variable standard of care in Ontario. Many are not assessed for psychological needs, and the little psychological therapy available is not usually covered by Ontario Health Insurance (OHIP). Local data from hospitals in Ottawa show that only 4 out of 10 men who present with intentional self-harm are seen by a mental health professional. Few are offered an evidence-based treatment aimed at reducing their risk of suicide or repeated self-harm. At present, assessment for self-harm in adults in Ontario is highly variable and there is no standard protocol for therapy. Assessment of suicide risk is currently a Required Operating Practice for Canadian Hospital accreditation; however, individuals identified as at-risk for suicide rarely receive recommended care., Specialist services offer intensive and lengthy treatment for the minority of people who self-harm diagnosed with personality disorders, such as dialectical behavior therapy or mindfulness based therapy. The evidence for the effectiveness of these specialist therapies comes almost entirely from studies in women., The investigators have received funding for a multicentre cluster randomized trial from the Ontario Strategy for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR) Support for People and Patient Oriented Research and Trials (SUPPORT) Unit funded by Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Terms Care (MOHLTC), and the Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science (MRIS), comparing the delivery of smart phone assisted problem solving therapy with treatment as usual in men who present with self-harm. The rationale for focusing on men is that most suicides are in men and previous trials have found that providing generic treatments to everyone does not work. The intervention will build on previous work by trying to extend the range and intensity of therapy. The investigators will do this by supplementing it with a sophisticated smart phone application that has already demonstrated its effectiveness in men with substance abuse disorders. The investigators will be offering an intervention specifically designed for men who self-harm, as they are hard to engage and are more likely than women to have substance abuse problems., Given the complexity of the proposed study, the investigators have separated the overarching research proposal into two parts, designated ""Protocol A"" and ""Protocol B."" Protocol A refers to a comprehensive secondary analysis the investigators will be carrying out using data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), and Protocol B refers to the active components of the intervention, those carried out with human subjects receiving six sessions of blended, problem solving therapy as opposed to routine care. The following description outlines the research protocol developed under the heading ""Protocol A."", Data collected from the ICES will be used to assess the impact of our intervention on suicides and re-presentations to hospital for self-harm, as well as providing an estimation of the intervention's economic impact on the Ontario healthcare system. This data is routinely collected and housed by ICES, and access to all outcome data has been agreed upon in advance of the study launch. Given that this component of the study focuses on the evaluation of the intervention based on routinely collected population-level data, there will be no individual participant recruitment; instead, the unit of analysis will be the individual patient, with eligibility determined by the patient's presentation at either an intervention or control site's Emergency Department for self-harm. To minimize the risk of imbalances between the study arms, allocation of a site to an intervention or control arm was completed using covariate constrained allocation, based on geographic and catchment area, the availability of onsite psychiatric services assessing Emergency Department visitors, rates of representation for self-harm, and facility size, defined by the average number of presentations for self-harm over a three year period. Dichotomous primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared according to study arm, using frequencies and percentages., The main study outcome measure for Protocol A consists of a composite measure, combining the incidence of suicide and/or representations to any Emergency Department in Ontario for self-harm in the year following the index episode of self-harm. Secondary objectives include: representation to any Emergency Department in Ontario for any reason, admission to any hospital in Ontario for any reason, hospital appointments in Ontario for any reason, primary care appointments in Ontario for any reason, mortality for reasons other than suicide, total healthcare costs, physician healthcare costs, Emergency Department health care costs, hospitalization healthcare costs, and other healthcare costs. All economic analyses will be similarly carried out with the province of Ontario considered as the population of interest. The primary composite outcome measure will be compared between the intervention and control sites using generalized linear mixed effect regression, accounting for the pre-and post-intervention measures using repeated cross-sectional analysis. Differences between the arms will be expressed as absolute and relative differences in proportions together with 95% confidence intervals. Models will account for clustering at the level of the Emergency Department and over time using random effects. Additional analyses will adjust for individual prognostic variable including age, ethnicity, pre-specified comorbidities, and repeat as compared to first-time presentations for self-harm., The investigators will conduct a cost-utility analysis from a health system's perspective using a decision analytic model. Costs associated with the intervention will be summarized over a one-year period using a micro-costing technique. This will involve identifying, costing and valuing all resources used. An incremental cost per one additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained will be estimated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. This cost-utility analysis will adhere to the best practices for conducting and reporting of health economic evaluations.","NCT03489382 (2018//).

1722,"In recent years, there has been an interest in the development of intervention programs focused on the social cognition for people with schizophrenia (Andres et al., 2001; P Penn et al. 2005). At least, five reviews and one meta-analysis have been conducted to date, which demonstrate promising results of the effectiveness of such interventions on social cognitive deficits and functional outcomes (Tan et al; 2016; Choi et al., 2009; Horan et al., 2008; Kurtz and Richardson, 2012; Statucka and Walder, 2013; Wolwer et al., 2010). Some approaches are focused on one specific domain of social cognition (""targeted"" interventions, such as the Training in Affect Recognition (TAR, Wolwer et al., 2005), and others incorporate multiple domains to create more complex, eclectic programs (""broad-based"" interventions, such as the Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT; Penn et al. 2007; Kurtz & Richardson, 2012)., TAR (Frommann et al., 2003) is one of the social cognition interventions with greater empirical support (Statucka & Walder, 2016) and has been shown to effectively attenuate facial affect recognition deficits in patients with schizophrenia (Wolwer et al. 2005; Wolwer and Frommann 2011; Sachs et al. 2012; Luckhaus et al. 2013). TAR teaches compensation strategies using errorless learning principles, positive reinforcement, feature abstraction, self-instruction and, most importantly, verbalization of characteristic features of facial affect. In a randomized controlled trial, the TAR group achieved significant improvements in facial affect recognition -in particular in recognizing sad faces- and in the quality of life domain social relationship. Furthermore, the TAR training contributed to enhancing some aspects of cognitive functioning and negative symptoms (Sachs et al, 2012). In the other hand, SCIT is a 24-session manual-based group treatment, including elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and social skills training. It is designed for those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders to improve social functioning by enhancing social cognition. Across different studies and research groups, SCIT has been also shown to improve in emotion perception, theory of mind (ToM), and social functioning (Bartholomeusz et al., 2013; Combs et al., 2007; Hasson-Ohayon, 2014; Parker et al. 2013; Penn et al., 2007; Roberts & Penn, 2009; Roberts et al. 2010; Roberts et al., 2014, 2016; Wang et al., 2013)., The efficacy of both interventions has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials compared to ""treatment as usual"", occupational therapy or cognitive remediation (Kurtz et al. 2016) but to date no study has compared the efficacy of two different social cognitive interventions (a direct comparison design). A more precise knowledge about the effect of each intervention on the 4 main domains of social cognition (affect recognition, theory of mind, attributional style and social perception) is needed, and this would enable to identify potential candidates for each program., The present work consists of a randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of two interventions based on social cognition training in outpatients with schizophrenia. The investigators sought to compare the effect of a ""targeted"" (TAR) and a ""broad-based"" (SCIT) intervention on schizophrenia patients' performance in facial affect recognition, theory of mind and attributional style. Secondarily, the investigators compare the effect on symptomatology, general cognition and functioning. The main hypothesis was that the patient group receiving TAR would exhibit a greater improvement in emotion recognition performance at the post-intervention assessment in comparison to patients receiving the SCIT, and, conversely, patients receiving SCIT would show more effect in ToM and attributional style. To assess the durability of these effects, performance in measures of social cognition, basic cognitive functioning, symptomatology and functional capacity were assessed before (T0), after treatment (T1) and 3 months later (T2)., 2. Methods, 2.1. Participants Outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (SCID-P; First et al. 1994) with stable symptoms in the range from 18 to 65 years were included into the study. Patients were recruited from 4 Mental Healt Centers in Madrid, Barcelona, Zaragoza and Teruel (Spain). All were clinically stable, without any psychiatric hospitalizations in the last 3 months, with the same antipsychotic medication during the previous 6 weeks, and no planned change in the drug regime for the next 3 months. Exclusion criteria were: 1. Disorders other than schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, according to DSM-IV diagnosis criteria; 2. Additional axis-I or axis-II diagnosis; 3. Dependence to alcohol or other drugs (except nicotine); 4. Serious somatic disorders or organic brain damage; 5. Mental retardation or difficulty speaking or understanding the Spanish language., The study was approved by the loval ethics committee and all participants gave their informed consent. Overall 100 participants were randomized either to TAR group (n = 49) or to the SCIT group (n = 51) (Consort diagram, Graphic 1)., 2.1.1. Treatment, TAR is a 12-session training on facial affect recognition over a period of 6 weeks. Treatment includes one therapist (psychiatrist or clinical psychologist) and 2 patients. It involves neuropsychological strategies, such as restitution and compensation, as well as principles of errorless learning, direct positive reinforcement, verbalization and self-instruction (Frommann et al., 2003; Wolwer et al., 2005). The program is divided into three blocks, whereas each block consists of 4 sessions: during the first block patients learn to identify and discriminate the prototypical facial signs of the six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger and surprise). The next block aims at a more holistic processing mode with fast decisions, relying on first impression, nonverbal processing and recognition of facial expressions with small intensities. The third block deals with the role of facial emotions in social, behavioral and situational context. Baseline assessments (T0=pre-treatment) were performed after enrolment to the study and post treatment assessments (T1=post-treatment) after the end of the training period (Sachs et al. 2012)., SCIT is a manual-based group intervention that is delivered in 20-24weekly, hour-long sessions. Groups include two clinicians and six to ten patients. SCIT uses a combination of psychoeducation, drill-and-repeat skill practice, strategy games, heuristic rehearsal, and homework assignments to remediate deficits and decrease biases in social cognition. Each SCIT group participant was encouraged to identify a 'practice partner', a family member or acquaintance who was willing to practice SCIT skills with the participant weekly in lieu of, or in addition to, traditional homework. SCIT clinicians attempted to reach practice partners by phone each week to check -in and provide guidance in their efforts to support SCIT participants' learning (Roberts et al. 2014).","NCT03446703 (2018//).

However, much of this research has examined the effects of scheduled group interventions, delivered in-person by instructors over the course of several weeks. Far less research has looked at the delivery method that is most common and arguably most sustainable for busy adults, namely, smart phone delivered Contemplative Applications (apps) for Well-being (CWAs).

1724,"This project aims to reduce negative health outcomes in small businesses that primarily employ high-risk Latino workers by characterizing their exposures to hazardous chemicals and assessing if a community health worker (CHW) intervention is effective at decreasing these exposures. Although preventable by definition, occupational disease and injuries are leading causes of death in the United States, with a disproportionate burden faced by Latinos. Small businesses pose a particular risk. They are more likely to employ low-wage Latino workers, and often use hazardous solvents including volatile organic chemicals that can cause asthma, cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disease; yet their workers lack access to culturally and linguistically appropriate occupational health and pollution prevention information due to economic, physical, and social barriers. CHW-led interventions and outreach in Latino communities have documented increased access to health care and health education and reduced workplace exposures among farmworkers. CHWs are an innovative method to bridge the gap between these small business communities and other stakeholders. The proposed project will capitalize on established partnerships between the University of Arizona, the Sonora Environmental Research Institute, Inc. and the El Rio Community Health Center. A community-engaged research framework will be used to complete the following specific aims: 1) quantify and identify exposures to hazardous chemicals in the two high risk small business sectors common in our target area (i.e., auto repair shops and beauty salons); 2) work collaboratively with business owners, trade groups, workers and CHWs to design an industrial hygiene - enhanced CHW intervention tailored for each small business sector; and 3) conduct a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the CHW intervention at reducing workplace exposures to volatile organic compounds and assess which factors led to successful utilization of exposure control strategies in both male and female-dominated businesses. Businesses will be randomized to either an intervention or delayed intervention group, both of which will receive incentives to participate including worksite health screenings. CHWs will work closely with business owners and employees to select and implement exposure-strategies appropriate for their worksite using a menu of complementary strategies of varying complexity and cost. This innovative project has the potential to directly reduce occupational health disparities through a CHW intervention that moves beyond providing occupational health education. The intervention will overcome current barriers by helping marginalized Latino workers and small business owners who may have limited education, literacy, and computer skills to understand the hazards associated with their work, and will empower them to have greater control over their occupational exposures, with the ultimate goal of preventing occupational disease and reducing health disparities.","NCT03455530 (2018//).

1725,"Using a randomized controlled trial design, the purpose of this study will be to examine whether combining a HAPA-based intervention, specifically action and coping planning, with a tailored text message intervention can reduce workplace sitting time by increasing frequency and length of breaks from sitting and non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) behaviours (i.e., standing, light-intensity physical activity) among office-working adults. A secondary purpose will be to examine the effects of the intervention on participants' action planning, coping planning and action control regarding reducing their workplace sitting time, as well as self-rated work performance and health-related outcomes (i.e., role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, and energy/fatigue). Another secondary objective will be to determine if action and coping planning and action control towards reducing workplace sitting time are related to actual break behaviour, time spent standing, and time spent in light-intensity physical activity., If successful, participants in the intervention group (sedentary intervention group) will report greater break frequency and break duration, time spent standing, and time spent in light-intensity physical activity, compared to participants in the control group (no treatment). In addition, it is hypothesized that participants in the intervention group will report greater action and coping planning and action control towards reducing workplace sitting time, as well as improved work- and health-related outcomes., This study will employ a prospective, 2-group, repeated measures, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Participants will be full-time adult, office workers primarily recruited from large businesses and office spaces., Potential participants (estimated enrolment: 112) will be recruited by Andrew Scott Rollo, Principal Investigator, for this study. Relevant contacts/liaisons and/or senior executives (i.e., Head of Human Resources, President, Chief Executive Officer, Office Manager) at potential businesses of interest will be sought out via publically available sources (e.g., London Chamber of Commerce Business Directory, company websites, etc.) and contacted via email. The email will include a letter of information (LOI) and recruitment poster and request the individual's assistance with recruitment. For each business/office, if the individual accepts the invitation and informs the researchers that he/she is willing to aid with the recruitment process, the individual will then be asked to email all full-time employees in their respective office/business and offer them the opportunity to participate. In this recruitment email, the recruitment poster and Letter of Information will be provided. Participants will be instructed to contact the researcher via email and/or phone if they wish to participate or receive additional details prior to making a decision as to whether to participate. A second recruitment approach will involve recruiting full-time adult, office workers through recruitment posters distributed through social media (i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn) and public advertisements (i.e., transit stations, newspapers). The study will also be advertised through emails sent out to various faculties at Western University. Recruitment posters and LOIs will be posted on social media and in public spaces. As stated previous, office-workers interested in the study will be instructed to contact the researcher via email and/or phone to sign up for study participation., At this point of contact, an email response will be sent to any interested individual. Adult office-workers who choose to take part in this study will receive a link via email that directs them to the Letter of Information, Informed Consent, and questionnaire for assessment of baseline measurements, which will be administered through a third party website called SoSci (online survey service). Participants will be assured that participation in this study is voluntary, that they are free to discontinue and withdraw from the study at any time, and that they may choose to skip any questions that they do not wish to answer without any effect on their employment status/work conditions. In other words, refusing to participate, refusing to answer any questions or withdrawing from the study will not impact their employment beyond potentially not receiving benefits associated with study participation. After viewing the Letter of Information and indicating that they consent to participate in the study (by clicking ""I agree"" on the survey), participants will be asked to complete a brief demographics questionnaire, followed by a questionnaire for baseline assessment of primary and secondary outcomes. In the initial email response sent to potential participants, participants randomized into the intervention group will also be asked to provide a day and time (within 3 days of completing the baseline assessment) that they would be available to schedule the behavioural counselling session they will receive., Upon completion of the Baseline assessment and prior to intervention delivery, all participants will be randomized, using computer-generated randomized stratification, into either a 6-week HAPA-treatment (SB-related planning + text messages intervention) or waitlisted control (no treatment) condition. For those in the treatment group, the study objective will be to reduce workplace sitting time by increasing non-sedentary or NEAT behaviours (i.e., increasing break frequency to a break every 30-45 minutes, with each break having a duration of 2-4 minutes, and increasing their time spent standing and engaged in light-intensity PA. Participants randomly assigned to the control group will receive no information or intervention of any kind and will only be asked to complete the outcome questionnaires., At the agreed upon and scheduled time, the researcher will deliver the intervention (i.e., implement the appropriate HAPA-based behavioural counselling session involving action and coping planning) either in person OR electronically via phone and an online presentation website (www.zoho.com). The method of delivery will entirely depend on the participant's availability, preference, and whether they live within driving distance of the investigator. To ensure equal numbers of local and remote participants in both conditions, two computer-generated random number lists will be created by the lead investigator using an online research randomization program. Participants will be asked to complete a second informed consent (written informed consent) at this time., The one-on-one counseling sessions will be delivered by the principal investigator to ensure standardization between participants. During the counseling session, the researcher will first ask if the participant has any strategies that he/she would like to try or think would be effective. As much as possible, strategies will be kept as original and specific to the participant's lifestyle as possible, while still fulfilling the study objectives. Upon creation of each strategy, the researcher will ask the participant if they think that the strategy they came up with is realistic. The number of strategies will also be personalized depending on how the participant's baseline measures compare to the objectives of their treatment group. This will be done in order to attenuate for any neglected/unused strategies by those with larger differences between baseline and objective values. Similarly, coping strategies will be created alongside each strategy in order to boost the adherence to the developed strategies. When an action plan strategy is developed, the researcher will ask the participant ""what are some challenges you foresee with executing this strategy?"", followed by ""what do you think is something we can do in order to overcome this/these challenges?"" This will be done in order to keep the coping strategies personalized to the participant's lifestyle. Overall, the behavioral counseling sessions will take between 20-30 minutes to complete and both groups will receive equal contact time. Participants will be given the form with their action plan and coping strategies and told to display it somewhere prominent so they will be reminded of the strategies. The principal investigator will conduct the planning interventions in a non-interfering manner by providing brief instructions and then remaining available to answer any questions., At this point, participants in the intervention group will then be entered into a contact list on the text-messaging website called ""Oh Don't Forget."" ""Oh Don't Forget,"" is a Web-based application that works through ""Recess Mobile"" to send messages from a computer to mobile phone numbers that are programmed into the application. All participants will begin receiving tailored text messages the day after receiving their one-on-one counseling session. Every participant will receive the same daily texts as each other participant in their group, with times varying slightly depending on their schedule. As planning is an ongoing process, participants will be reminded (via text message) to formulate another set of action and coping plans at the beginning of weeks 3 and 5. Upon completion of the intervention period at 6 weeks, participants will be notified that they will no longer be receiving text messages and that the study is completed., After the initial behavioural counseling session, participants will be told they will receive a link to a questionnaire (assessment of primary and secondary outcomes) in their email every 2 weeks, for the next 6 weeks (i.e., weeks 2, 4, and 6), and to complete the questionnaire the day they receive it. Participants will also be told that 2 weeks following the end of the 6-week intervention, there will be a follow-up questionnaire (week 8), which they will receive and be asked to complete. All primary and secondary outcome questionnaires will be completed online and administered through a third party website called SoSci (online survey service). Participants will also be reminded via text to complete these. Primary outcomes including frequency of breaks, length of breaks, and NEAT behaviours at work (i.e., standing, light-intensity PA) will be assessed using subjective, self-report approaches. Secondary analyses will be performed to examine effects of the intervention on theoretical determinants of behaviour change (i.e., action planning, coping planning, action control), as well as participants' perceived work-related outcomes (i.e., self-rated work performance) and health-related outcomes (i.e., role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, and energy/fatigue). All primary outcomes will be assessed at four time points (baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks), and again at a two-week follow-up (8 weeks). Action and coping planning and action control towards reducing workplace sitting time will be assessed at the same time points. Secondary outcome variables (i.e., perceived work- and health-related outcomes) will be assessed pre- (baseline) and post-intervention (6 weeks).","NCT03461926 (2018//).

1727,"Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the efficacy of an unguided, self-help cognitive behavior therapy (SH-CBT) booklet on hot flush and night sweat (HFNS) problem rating, delivered in a work setting. Methods: Women aged 45 to 60 years, having 10 or more problematic HFNS a week, were recruited to a multicenter randomized controlled trial, via the occupational health/human resources departments of eight organizations. Participants were 1:1 randomized to SH-CBT or no treatment waitlist control (NTWC). The primary outcome was HFNS problem rating; secondary outcomes included HFNS frequency, work and social adjustment, sleep, mood, beliefs and behaviors, and work-related variables (absence, performance, turnover intention, and work impairment due to presenteeism). Intention-to-treat analysis was used, and between-group differences estimated using linear mixed models. Results: A total of 124 women were randomly allocated to SH-CBT (n = 60) and NTWC (n = 64). 104 (84%) were assessed for primary outcome at 6 weeks and 102 (82%) at 20 weeks. SH-CBT significantly reduced HFNS problem rating at 6 weeks (SH-CBT vs NTWC adjusted mean difference, -1.49; 95% CI, -2.11 to -0.86; P < 0.001) and at 20 weeks (-1.09; 95% CI, -1.87 to -0.31; P < 0.01). SH-CBT also significantly reduced HFNS frequency, improved work and social adjustment; sleep, menopause beliefs, HFNS beliefs/behaviors at 6 and 20 weeks; improved wellbeing and somatic symptoms and reduced work impairment due to menopause-related presenteeism at 20 weeks, compared with the NTWC. There was no difference between groups in other work-related outcomes.

1728,"Objective This study aimed to estimate and evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of a guided internet-and mobile-supported occupational stress-management intervention (iSMI) for employees from the employer's perspective alongside a randomized controlled trial. Methods A sample of 264 employees with elevated symptoms of perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-10 >=22) was randomly assigned either to the iSMI or a waitlist control (WLC) group with unrestricted access to treatment as usual. The iSMI consisted of seven sessions of problem-solving and emotion-regulation techniques and one booster session. Self-report data on symptoms of perceived stress and economic data were assessed at baseline, and at six months following randomization. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) with symptom-free status as the main outcome from the employer's perspective was carried out. Statistical uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping (N=5000). Results The CBA yielded a net-benefit of 181 [95% confidence interval (CI) -6043-1042] per participant within the first six months following randomization. CEA showed that at a willingness-to-pay ceiling of 0, 1000, 2000 for one additional symptom free employee yielded a 67%, 90%, and 98% probability, respectively, of the intervention being cost-effective compared to the WLC. Conclusion The iSMI was cost-effective when compared to WLC and even lead to cost savings within the first six months after randomization.

1729,"Background: Healthcare workers experience higher levels of work-related stress and higher rates of sickness absence than workers in other sectors. Psychological approaches have potential in providing healthcare workers with the knowledge and skills to recognise stress and to manage stress effectively. The strongest evidence for effectiveness in reducing stress in the workplace is for stress-management courses based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). However, research examining effects of these interventions on sickness absence (an objective indicator of stress) and compassion for others (an indicator of patient care) is limited, as is research on brief CBT stress-management courses (which may be more widely accessible) and on MBIs adapted for workplace settings. Methods/design: This protocol is for two randomised controlled trials with participant preference between the two trials and 1:1 allocation to intervention or wait-list within the preferred choice. The first trial is examining a one-day CBT stress-management workshop and the second trial an 8-session Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Life (MBCT-L) course, with both trials comparing intervention to wait-list. The primary outcome for both trials is stress post-intervention with secondary outcomes being sickness absence, compassion for others, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, wellbeing, work-related burnout, self-compassion, presenteeism, and mindfulness (MBCT-L only). Both trials aim to recruit 234 staff working in the National Health Service in the UK. Discussion: This trial will examine whether a one-day CBT stress-management workshop and an 8-session MBCT-L course are effective at reducing healthcare staff stress and other mental health outcomes compared to wait-list, and, whether these interventions are effective at reducing sickness absence and presenteeism and at enhancing wellbeing, self-compassion, mindfulness and compassion for others. Findings will help inform approaches offered to reduce healthcare staff stress and other key variables. A note of caution is that individual-level approaches should only be part of the solution to reducing healthcare staff stress within a broader focus on organisational-level interventions and support.

1730,"Background & aims: The ability to mobilize pancreatic-fat and the meaning of decreased fat in the pancreas remain controversial. We followed the dynamics of pancreatic-fat and its morphology during various long weight-loss induced lifestyle-interventions. Methods: In isolated workplace with monitored/provided lunch, we randomly assigned healthy persons with abdominal obesity or dyslipidemia for one of two 18-month equal-caloric diets: low-fat (LF) or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (Med/LC, with provided 1oz walnuts/day), with or without added moderate exercise (supervised gym membership). We used magnetic-resonance-imaging to quantify pancreatic-fat and morphology. Results: At baseline, 277 eligible participants (mean age = 48 years; 88% men; pancreatic-fat = 17.4 +/- 5.1%) had higher pancreatic-fat in men (17.7 +/- 4.9% vs 14.9 +/- 5.5% in women; p = 0.004). Following 18-month intervention (adherence = 86.3%) and moderate weight-loss (mean = -3.0 +/- 5.5 kg), pancreatic-fat decreased moderately but significantly (-0.26 +/- 2.18% units; p = 0.049). Med/LC diet induced a greater decrease in pancreatic-fat compared to LF (p = 0.043), and the combination of Med/LC diet + exercise exhibited the highest reduction (-0.69% units) as compared to LF diet without exercise (+0.12%units; p = 0.027 between groups). In multivariate regression models, after further adjusted for visceral adipose-tissue (DELTAVAT), pancreatic-fat loss associated with both decreases in pancreatic-morphology ratio (perimeter divided by area; beta = 0.361; p < 0.001) and superficial-subcutaneous adipose-tissue loss (beta = 0.242; p = 0.001), but not with changes in intrahepatic-fat (beta = -0.034; p = 0.638). Pancreatic-fat loss associated with increased intake of polyunsaturated-fat (beta = -0.137; p = 0.032), as with improved high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL; beta = -0.156; p = 0.023) and triglycerides/HDL ratio (beta = 0.162; p = 0.015), independently of DELTAVAT, but not with glycemic-control parameters (e.g. HbA1c, HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta; p > 0.2 for all). Conclusions: Pancreatic-fat loss is mainly associated with improved lipid, rather than glycemic profiles. Med/LC diet, mostly with exercise, may benefit pancreatic-fat loss. Pancreatic-morphology could serve as a biomarker of pancreatic-fat state.

1731,"Background: Within high income countries, mental health is now the leading cause of long term sickness absence in the workplace. Managers are in a position to make changes and decisions that have a positive effect on the wellbeing of staff, the recovery of employees with mental ill health, and potentially prevent future mental health problems. However, managers report addressing workplace mental health issues as challenging. The aim of the HeadCoach trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly developed online training intervention to determine whether it is able to build managers' confidence to better support individuals within their teams who are experiencing mental ill health, and the confidence to promote manager behaviour likely to result in a more mentally healthy workplace. Methods/Design: We will conduct a cluster randomised control trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of HeadCoach, an online training intervention for managers with a focus on the mental health of their employees, compared to a waitlist control. The target sample is 168 managers, and their direct employees. Managers and employees will be assessed at baseline and at 4-month follow up. Managers will have an additional, intermediate assessment 6-weeks post-baseline. The primary outcome is change from baseline in managers' self-reported confidence when dealing with mental health issues within their team and promoting a mentally healthy workplace. The difference between the intervention and waitlist control groups will be assessed using linear mixed effects repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of variance (ANOVA). Secondary managerial outcomes include mental health literacy, attitudes towards mental health issues in the workplace and managerial behaviour in dealing with mental health matters with their staff. Employee outcomes will be perceived level of manager support, engagement, psychological distress, and rates of sickness absence and presenteeism. Discussion: To our knowledge this will be the first RCT of a purely online training intervention developed specifically for managers that promotes confidence to both support staff experiencing mental ill health and create a mentally healthy work environment. If successful, this intervention has the potential to provide an effective and efficient method of training managers in workplace mental health and to enhance employee wellbeing.

1732,"Depression is increasingly being recognised as a significant mental health problem in the workplace contributing to productivity loss and economic burden to organisations. This paper reviews recently published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of universal and targeted interventions to reduce depression in the workplace. Studies were identified through searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES Full Text, and Global Health and Social Policy and Practice databases. Studies were included if they included an RCT of a workplace intervention for employees targeting depression as the primary outcome. Twentytwo published RCTs investigating interventions utilising various therapeutic approaches were identified. The cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approach is the most frequently used in the workplace, while interventions that combine different therapeutic approaches showed the most promising results. A universal intervention in the workplace that combines CBT and coping flexibility recorded the highest effect size (d=1.45 at 4 months' follow-up). Most interventions were delivered in group format and showed low attrition rates compared with other delivery formats. Although all studies reviewed were RCTs, the quality of reporting is low. Interventions using different therapeutic approaches with different modes of delivery have been used. Most of these interventions were shown to reduce depression levels among employees in the workplace, particularly those that combine more than one therapeutic approaches.

1733,"BACKGROUND: The impact of mental illness on society is far reaching and has been identified as the leading cause of sickness absence and work disability in most developed countries. By developing evidence-based solutions that are practical, affordable, and accessible, there is potential to deliver substantial economic benefits while improving the lives of individual workers. Academic and industry groups are now responding to this public health issue. A key focus is on developing practical solutions that enhance the mental health and psychological resilience of workers. A growing body of research suggests resilience training may play a pivotal role in the realm of public health and prevention, particularly with regards to protecting the long-term well-being of workers. OBJECTIVE(S): Our aim is to examine whether a mindfulness-based resilience-training program delivered via the internet is feasible and engaging to a group of high-risk workers. Additionally, we aim to measure the effect of the Resilience@Work Resilience@Work Mindfulness program on measures of resilience and related skills. METHOD(S): The current pilot study recruited 29 full-time firefighters. Participants were enrolled in the 6-session internet-based resilience-training program and were administered questionnaires prior to training and directly after the program ended. Measurements examined program feasibility, psychological resilience, experiential avoidance, and thought entanglement. RESULT(S): Participants reported greater levels of resilience after Resilience@Work training compared to baseline, with a mean increase in their overall resilience score of 1.5 (95% CI -0.25 to 3.18, t14=1.84, P=.09). Compared to baseline, participants also reported lower levels of psychological inflexibility and experiential avoidance following training, with a mean decrease of -1.8 (95% CI -3.78 to 0.20, t13=-1.94, P=.07). With regards to cognitive fusion (thought entanglement), paired-samples t tests revealed a trend towards reduction in mean scores post training (P=.12). CONCLUSION(S): This pilot study of the Resilience@Work program suggests that a mindfulness-based resilience program delivered via the Internet is feasible in a high-risk workplace setting. In addition, the firefighters using the program showed a trend toward increased resilience and psychological flexibility. Despite a number of limitations, the results of this pilot study provide some valuable insights into what form of resilience training may be viable in occupational settings particularly among those considered high risk, such as emergency workers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a mindfulness-based resilience-training program delivered wholly via the internet has been tested in the workplace.Copyright ©Sadhbh Joyce, Fiona Shand, Richard A Bryant, Tara J Lal, Samuel B Harvey.

1734,"Background and Objectives: This symposium aimed to provide clinicians with an overview of fentanyl's impact on opioid overdoses and its potential to override FDA-approved treatment agents such as buprenorphine and naltrexone, and bring attention to alternative agents to prevent abuse and overdoses with fentanyl. Currently, scientific and clinical data to guide the management of fentanyl abuse and overdose are extremely limited. The emergence of highly potent synthetic opioids (HPSO) in the context of current opioid epidemic, together with the consequent increase of overdose rates, calls for urgent intensive research. Method(s): Dr. Jane Maxwell synthesized or extracted data from databases in National Forensic Laboratory Information System, CDC/NCHS WONDER-National Vital Statistics System, DEA, Texas Poison Centers, and the Texas Department of State Health Services. Dr. John Mariani also presented epidemiological data of HPSOs use and overdoses in the United States. Fentanyl was screened in the treatment seeking populations who used heroin or other opioid painkillers, including research clinic patients enrolled since September 2017 (total number of subjects: 100) and subjects enrolled in the ongoing Naltrexone XR injection clinical Trial (total number of subjects: 37) at the Columbia University Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute. Dr. Sandra Comer reviewed the likely efficacy of clinically used doses of naltrexone and buprenorphine in blocking fentanyl abuse or overdose based largely on previous animal studies. The effect of different opioids were tested in various animal models, including but not limited to rat and rhesus monkey models. These models were run using assays measuring opioid dependency including latency to warm water tail withdrawal and IV drug self-administration. For human studies, positive and negative subjective responses were rated to compare the abuse liability in human subjects (total number of subjects: 15). The effects of buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance on the reinforcing and subjective effects of heroin in heroin-dependent individuals were measured in a 10-trial self-administration task (total number of subjects: 15). Dr. Thomas Kosten compared the serum/brain concentration of opioids and cocaine with or without the anti-drug vaccines. The concentrations of the anti-fentanyl antibodies in response to different vaccines with various combinations of adjuvants were measured in mouse models. The tail flick test and hotplate test were used to measure the sensitivity to analgesic effects of fentanyl in unvaccinated control mice (N=15) and mice vaccinated at 0, 3, and 6 weeks with the TT-FENT vaccine (N=4) in combination with adjuvants (Alum, 1500 mug and Entolimod, 1.0 mug). Blockade of opioid analgesia and respiratory depression were tested in mice and rats, respectively, with the fentanyl vaccines. Result(s): Dr. Jane Maxwell presented epidemiological data, which showed geographic variations in the prevalences of fentanyl, opioids, and stimulants based on mortality and toxicological reports across the United States. Data from Texas poison centers demonstrated that the percentage of nonmedical forms of fentanyl have increased from 2016 to 2018, and NFLIS 2008 to 2018 data showed an approximately 60-fold increase in fentanyl analogues from 2013 to 2017. Dr. Maxwell presented the identified use patterns nationwide and discussed the difficulties in identifying fentanyl mentions in datasets. Dr. John Mariani presented a clinical perspective regarding buprenorphine treatment complicated by fentanyl 164 May 2019 use and increasing street overdoses in the context of the current epidemic. Eighty percent of heroin users in New York City addiction clinics had urines positive for fentanyl. These patients were able to override the blockade from the Naltrexone XR injection, and the initiation of buprenorphine 48 to 72 hours after last use of heroin mixed with fentanyl precipitated withdrawal. As indicated by emergency medical technicians, reversing fentanyl overdoses may require repeated naloxone doses. Despite the lack of evidence-based clinical data, Dr. Mariani discussed clinical considerations and management strategies in treating these patients based on the properties of Highly Potent Synthetic Opioids. Dr. Sandra Comer demonstrated data indicating that buprenorphine was not as effective in antagonizing higher efficacy agonists such as fentanyl, which is about 50 times more potent than heroin. Theoretically, as competitive antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone can provide an effective blockade of fentanyl; however, in treatment settings, we do not know whether maintenance on buprenorphine will be as effective in treating the illicit use of fentanyl as treating other opioid use disorders. Dr. Thomas Kosten presented emerging data on an anti-fentanyl vaccine drawn from previous trials of cocaine vaccines. He demonstrated promising data on these vaccines with the new adjuvants entolimod (TLR4 agonist) and E6020 (TLR5 agonist), which could overcome the obstacles encountered in the previous vaccines. Entolimod and E6020 increased anti-drug antibody production by three and four times, respectively. In addition, entolimod generated antibodies with a fourfold higher affinity, which could potentially hold fentanyl in the bloodstream and significantly reduce the amount of fentanyl reaching the brain. An anti-fentanyl vaccine is currently tested in rodents. This anti-fentanyl vaccine could potentially prevent or reduce the leading cause of opioid overdoses. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: It may be necessary to adjust the ""civilian"" naloxone doses for overdose reversals, as the standard 2mg intranasal doses are ineffective in case of fentanyl overdoses. The pharmacokinetics of fentanyl indicates that its abuse liability is much higher than other opioids, given that its potency is 100 times that of morphine. This may be particularly important for the depot formulations of naltrexone and buprenorphine because these formulations have lower blood (and presumably brain) levels than naltrexone 50mg/day and buprenorphine 24 mg/day. Given the poor response of fentanyl overdoses to naloxone and the poor efficacy of buprenorphine for fentanyl relapse prevention, the exploration of other means to fight this leading cause of opioid overdose deaths is imperative. The anti-fentanyl vaccine is a timely and promising strategy, as the current vaccine could produce significantly greater (3-4 times) amounts of antibodies with four times higher affinity than previous vaccines tested for other addictions, which failed due to insufficient antibody production. The fentanyl vaccine can serve as a preventative measure for fentanyl overdose and abuse, and could be a useful tool to mitigate the extent of the fentanyl overdoses.","Kosten T.,Levin F.,Maxwell J.,Comer S.,Mariani J.,Yang S.F.,Joshi P.

1735,"Purpose: We endeavored to investigate whether previous findings of an association between antemortem exposure to selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) and method of suicide could be replicated. Method(s): Using the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine's toxicology database and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare's national registries of causes of death and prescriptions, 10,002 incidents of suicide were retrieved. Risks of violent suicide conferred by SSRIs, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were estimated using logistic regression. In accordance with previous work, suicide by violent means-cases-were defined as death attributable to causes designated by ICD-10 codes X70-X83 and Y20-Y33; and suicide by non-violent means-controls-by codes X60-X69 and Y10-Y19. Result(s): Our results imply that SSRI exposure confers a risk of violent suicide for shorter treatment durations; and that antemortem exposure to other substances (including illegal drugs) confounds estimates of risk. After adjustment for age, sex, and other substances, SSRIs treatment not exceeding 28 days conferred an almost fourfold risk of violent suicide (OR 3.6 [95% CI 1.9-6.8]), a finding partly in line with a recent Swedish study that employed a case-crossover design. Conclusion(s): Although risks associated with shorter treatment duration may reflect latencies to onset of therapeutic effect, it is unclear how latencies would influence the choice of suicide method, unless conditions for which SSRIs are prescribed are themselves associated with violent suicide. Finally, in the total dataset, SSRIs were not associated with an increased risk of violent suicide; however, by adjusting for other substances, we avoided the spurious conclusion that the effect of medications in this regard is protective.Copyright © 2018, The Author(s).","Forsman J.,Masterman T.,Ahlner J.,Isacsson G.,Hedstrom A.K.

1736,"Objectives: In Colorado, legalization of recreational marijuana in 2014 increased public access to marijuana and might also have led to an increase in emergency department (ED) visits. We examined the validity of using syndromic surveillance data to detect marijuana-associated ED visits by comparing the performance of surveillance queries with physician-reviewed medical records. Method(s): We developed queries of combinations of marijuana-specific International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes or keywords. We applied these queries to ED visit data submitted through the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE) syndromic surveillance system at 3 hospitals during 2016-2017. One physician reviewed the medical records of ED visits identified by >=1 query and calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) of each query. We defined cases of acute adverse effects of marijuana (AAEM) as determined by the ED provider's clinical impression during the visit. Result(s): Of 44 942 total ED visits, ESSENCE queries detected 453 (1%) as potential AAEM cases; a review of 422 (93%) medical records identified 188 (45%) true AAEM cases. Queries using ICD-10 diagnostic codes or keywords in the triage note identified all true AAEM cases; PPV varied by hospital from 36% to 64%. Of the 188 true AAEM cases, 109 (58%) were among men and 178 (95%) reported intentional use of marijuana. Compared with noncases of AAEM, cases were significantly more likely to be among non-Colorado residents than among Colorado residents and were significantly more likely to report edible marijuana use rather than smoked marijuana use (P <.001). Conclusion(s): ICD-10 diagnostic codes and triage note keyword queries in ESSENCE, validated by medical record review, can be used to track ED visits for AAEM.Copyright © 2019, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.","Marx G.E.,Chen Y.,Askenazi M.,Albanese B.A. (2019//).

1737,"OBJECTIVE: Traffic incidents occurring on roadways require the coordinated effort of multiple responder and recovery entities, including communications, law enforcement, fire and rescue, emergency medical services, hazardous materials, transportation agencies, and towing and recovery. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify and characterize transportation incident management (TIM)-related occupational fatalities; (2) assess concordance of surveillance data sources in identifying TIM occupations, driver vs. pedestrian status, and occupational fatality incident location; and (3) determine and compare U.S. occupational fatality rates for TIM industries. METHOD(S): The Kentucky Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) program analyzed 2005-2016 TIM occupational fatality data using multiple data sources: death certificate data, Collision Report Analysis for Safer Highways (CRASH) data, and media reports, among others. Literal text analysis was performed on FACE data, and a multiple linear regression model and SAS proc sgpanel were used to estimate and visualize the U.S. TIM occupational mortality trend lines and confidence bounds. RESULT(S): There were 29 TIM fatalities from 2005 to 2015 in Kentucky; 41% of decedents were in the police protection occupation, and 21% each were in the fire protection and motor vehicle towing industries. Over one half of the TIM decedents were performing work activities as pedestrians when they died. Media reports identified the majority of the occupational fatalities as TIM related (28 of 29 TIM-related deaths); the use of death certificates as the sole surveillance data source only identified 17 of the 29 deaths as TIM related, and the use of CRASH data only identified 4 of the 29 deaths as TIM related. Injury scenario text analysis showed that law enforcement vehicle pursuit, towing and recovery vehicle loading, and disabled vehicle response were particular high-risk activities that led to TIM deaths. Using U.S. data, the motor vehicle towing industry had a significantly higher risk for occupational mortality compared to the fire protection and police protection industries. CONCLUSION(S): Multiple data sources are needed to comprehensively identify TIM fatalities and to examine the circumstances surrounding TIM fatalities, because no one data source in itself was adequate and undercounted the total number of TIM fatalities. The motor vehicle towing industry, in particular, is at elevated risk for occupational mortality, and targeted mandatory TIM training for the motor vehicle towing industry should be considered. In addition, enhanced law enforcement roadside safety training during vehicle pursuit and apprehension of suspects is recommended.","Bunn T.L.,Slavova S.,Chandler M.,Hanner N.,Singleton M. (2018//).

1738,"Objectives: Despite a policy of zero tolerance towards workplace violence (WPV) in Australian public hospital EDs, the incidence of WPV continues to increase. The aim of this study was to characterise security responses to WPV within an adult level 4 ED. Method(s): A retrospective single-centre review of episodes of WPV perpetrated by adults occurring within the ED was conducted between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015. Cases were identified using a prospectively recorded security register that records all events of security personnel attendance. The presence of police officers on initial presentation was the primary exposure variable. Result(s): There were 1853 violent episodes committed by 1224 patients requiring security intervention during the study period, with half the episodes (n = 916; 49%) involving perpetrators who had committed at least two or more violent acts during the study period. Most cases (n = 1057, 57%; 95% CI: 55-59) occurred in the absence of police presence. Only 144 (7.8%) cases were managed by the presence of security personnel without physical security interventions. Conclusion(s): EDs should not rely on police response to prevent or handle violence. The finding of a high proportion of events being perpetrated by repeat offenders indicate that data sharing between EDs for identification of perpetrators of WPV can be useful for prevention of future episodes. ACEM policy for WPV in EDs should encompass further details on security credentialing and preventive strategies towards minimisation of WPV in the Australian EDs.Copyright © 2018 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine","Mitra B.,Nikathil S.,Gocentas R.,Symons E.,O'Reilly G.,Olaussen A.

1739,"Objective: Brodifacoum is one of the long-acting anticoagulant rodenticides (LAARs), producing a prolonged and profound coagulopathy [1]. On 8 March 2018 the first cases of coagulopathy associated with use of synthetic cannabinoids containing brodifacoum were reported to US poison centers and state health departments. Between that date and 28 September, there have been 318 cases and 10 fatalities in 11 states [2]. The current epidemic suggests intentional contamination, but the root cause is unclear. One theory is that the addition of brodifacoum increases the high experienced by the user. We report a fatality from the use of a synthetic cannabinoid adulterated with brodifacoum. Case report: A 37-year-old male who had dyspnea and hemoptysis the previous evening was found dead by his father the next morning sitting on the couch where he had slept. He was a known chronic marijuana and synthetic cannabinoid user but was not suspected of suicidality. Blood was noted on the face and chest. Efforts by first responders to resuscitate were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead on scene. Post-mortem examination revealed pulmonary congestion with bloody, frothy sputum. The diaphragm and psoas muscles were hemorrhagic. The abdominal cavity contained approximately 1-2 liters of gross, bloody fluid with areas of the upper gastrointestinal tract showing focal hemorrhagic areas. The genitourinary tract contained frank blood and blood clots in the ureters. The bladder demonstrated areas of hemorrhage in the mucosa. Based upon similarities to recently reported cases, blood was sent to a reference lab for analysis. The synthetic cannabinoid 5F-ADB and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) metabolite were detected, along with a positive result for brodifacoum. The cause of death was hemorrhagic diathesis due to brodifacoum poisoning. Conclusion(s): A high index of suspicion of brodifacoum-related poisoning should be maintained with patients presenting with unexpected hematuria, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, and wounds that fail to stop bleeding. These patients will typically have a high or even unmeasurable prothrombin time (INR). The coagulopathy responds to high-dose oral phytonadione (vitamin K1), up to 80 mg twice daily. Therapy may be needed for months.","Aleguas A.,Pearson J.M.,Peredy T.,Swanson D. (2019//).

1740,"BACKGROUND: Web-based lifestyle interventions at the workplace have the potential to promote health and work productivity. However, the sustainability of effects is often small, which could be enhanced by adding face-to-face contacts, so-called 'blended care'. Therefore, this study evaluates the effects of a blended workplace health promotion intervention on health and work outcomes among employees with increased cardiovascular risk. METHOD(S): In this multicentre cluster-randomised controlled trial (PerfectFit), 491 workers in 18 work units from military, police, and a hospital with increased cardiovascular risk were randomised into two intervention groups. The limited intervention (n=213; 9 clusters) consisted of a web-based Health Risk Assessment with advice. In the extensive intervention (n=271; 8 clusters), coaching sessions by occupational health physicians using motivational interviewing were added. One cluster dropped out after randomisation but before any inclusion of subjects. Primary outcome was self-rated health. Secondary outcomes were body weight, body mass index (BMI), work productivity, and health behaviours. Follow-up measurements were collected at 6 and 12 months. Effect sizes were determined in mixed effects models. RESULT(S): At 12 months, the extensive intervention was not statistically different from the limited intervention for self-rated health (4.3%; 95%CI -5.3-12.8), BMI (-0.81; 95%CI -1.87-0.26) and body weight (-2.16; 95%CI -5.49-1.17). The within-group analysis showed that in the extensive intervention group body weight (-3.1 kg; 95% CI -2.0 to -4.3) was statistically significantly reduced, whereas body weight remained stable in the limited intervention group (+0.2 kg; 95% CI -1.4 to 1.8). In both randomised groups productivity loss and physical activity increased and excessive alcohol use decreased significantly at 12 months. CONCLUSION(S): There were no effects on self-rated health, body weight, and BMI. However, within the group with web-based tailored Health Risk Assessment including personalized advice body weight reduced significantly. Adding motivational coaching is promising to reduce body weight.

1741,"IMPORTANCE Overprescribing of opioids is considered a major driving force behind the opioid epidemic in the United States. Marijuana is one of the potential nonopioid alternatives that can relieve pain at a relatively lower risk of addiction and virtually no risk of overdose. Marijuana liberalization, including medical and adult-use marijuana laws, has made marijuana available to more Americans. OBJECTIVE To examine the association of state implementation of medical and adult-use marijuana laws with opioid prescribing rates and spending among Medicaid enrollees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study used a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design comparing opioid prescribing trends between states that started to implement medical and adult-use marijuana laws between 2011 and 2016 and the remaining states. This population-based study across the United States included all Medicaid fee-for-service and managed care enrollees, a high-risk population for chronic pain, opioid use disorder, and opioid overdose. EXPOSURES State implementation of medical and adult-use marijuana laws from 2011 to 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Opioid prescribing rate, measured as the number of opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid on a quarterly, per-1000-Medicaid-enrollee basis. RESULTS State implementation of medical marijuana laws was associated with a 5.88%lower rate of opioid prescribing (95%CI,-11.55% to approximately-0.21%). Moreover, the implementation of adult-use marijuana laws, which all occurred in states with existing medical marijuana laws, was associated with a 6.38%lower rate of opioid prescribing (95% CI,-12.20% to approximately-0.56%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The potential of marijuana liberalization to reduce the use and consequences of prescription opioids among Medicaid enrollees deserves consideration during the policy discussions about marijuana reform and the opioid epidemic.Copyright © 2018 American Medical Association.

1742,"This study investigates barriers to utilization of drug abuse treatment by female street sex workers in Nigeria. Twenty-seven (n = 27) street sex workers were recruited through venue-based snow-ball sampling. In-depth, individual interviews were conducted, and transcripts were subjected to thematic, inductive and data-driven analysis. Sex workers use psychoactive drugs to manage the hazards of street sex work, including guilt, stigma, and violence. While a few denied drug-related harms, doubted treatment efficacy and evinced self-efficacy in managing drug problems, the majority of sex workers recognized drug-related harms and the need for treatment. Inadequate information on services, financial and time cost of treatment, fear of police arrest, stigma and lack of male partner support posed as barriers to drug abuse treatment. Social and structural barriers to treatment utilization violate sex workers' rights to health and exacerbate drug-related harms. Findings highlight the need for changes in policy and societal perceptions of sex work, and multi-level, rights-based interventions to remove barriers to drug abuse treatment for female street sex workers.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Nelson E.-U.E.,Abikoye G.E.

1744,"Opioid use disorder and its associated mortality have become national epidemic problems. Different measures and regulations have been implemented to curb this trend, including stricter opioid prescribing practice. With the decreased access to prescription opioids, individuals with opioid use disorder have explored alternatives including loperamide, a peripheral opioid mu-receptor agonist. There are reports of increased loperamide misuse, dependence, and mortality rate in the past few years from poison control centers, medical examiners' offices, and clinical settings. Here, we report a case of loperamide use disorder, which led to the death of the patient.

1746,"Research has shown that taxi drivers are at risk for numerous health concerns, such as low back and leg pain, linked to their highly sedentary occupation, long work hours and stressors related to the job (e.g. low income, safety threats). The goal of this study was to explore occupational health risks and opportunities for health interventions with taxi drivers using community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. A mixed methods approach included first a convenience sample of 19 East African taxi drivers participating in focus group discussions. Second, a convenience sample of 75 current taxi drivers (M age=45.7years) and 25 non-driver comparison participants (M age=40.3years) were recruited to complete a structured self-reported questionnaire and objective measures of health. Health education was provided alongside the research to address common health concerns and to ensure mutual benefit and an action orientation. The focus groups described numerous health concerns that drivers attributed to their occupation, including chronic pain, sleep deprivation, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease and eye problems, as the most common. Participants offered ideas for health interventions that include workplace reform and driver education. Quantitative data indicate that 44% of drivers reported their health as 'fair' or 'poor'. Drivers were more likely to report musculoskeletal pain, less sleep, more fatigue and less physical activity as compared to non-drivers. The majority of drivers reported financial and job dissatisfaction. The research provides data to inform targeted health interventions that support the health and safety of taxi drivers.Copyright © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

1747,"Introduction: In violent deaths, forensic autopsy is often regarded as the means for making the final medical diagnosis of the cause and manner of death; however, without other corroborative evidence (e.g., suicide note, prior history of suicide attempt/intent disclosure), drug intoxication and other poisoning deaths, especially among individuals with pre-existing substance use and/or mental health problems, pose challenges in determining the intent/manner of death. Given the rapid increase in prescription and illicit drug poisoning deaths in the 50+ age group, we examined precipitating/risk factors and toxicology results associated with poisoning deaths classified as suicides compared to intent-undetermined death (UnD) among decedents aged 50+. Method(s): The National Violent Death Reporting System, 2005-2015, provided data. The 2005-2015 NVDRS contained 56,118 suicide decedents and 7,752 UnDs aged 50+. Of these 50+-year olds' deaths, poisoning deaths were 18.5% (N=10,363) of suicides and 65.7% (N=5,090) of UnDs. The present study focused on these 15,453 poisoning decedents and stratified them into three groups-suicide decedents who left a suicide note, suicide decedents who did not leave a note, and decedents classified as UnD. Following descriptive statistics using chi2 tests, multinomial logistic regression models were used to test study hypotheses (associations of intent/manner of death with precipitating/risk factors and positive toxicologies) controlling for incident year (time), state, and demographic variables. We chose suicide decedents who did not leave a suicide note as the baseline comparison group to better examine potential differences and similarities between them and UnDs. Result(s): Of all poisoning deaths, 29.4% were classified as suicide decedents who left a note, 37.7% as suicides without a note, and 32.9% as UnDs. Of all NVDRS participating states, Maryland and Utah had the highest proportions of all poisoning deaths (82.8% and 58.9%, respectively) and the highest numbers of UnDs (52.5% of all UnDs in this study). We also found that of all states, Maryland had the highest proportion of Black decedents (34.6% of both poisoning suicides and UnDs). Analysis of time trend showed that the proportions of UnD cases in 2005 and 2015 were 36.5% and 30.0%, respectively, with a generally declining trend over the 11-year period. Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that compared to suicide decedents without a note, those with a note were more likely to have been depressed and had physical health problems and other life stressors, while UnD cases were less likely to have had mental health problems and other life stressors but more likely to have had substance use and health problems. UnD cases were also more likely to be opioid (RRR=2.65, 95% CI=2.42-2.90) and cocaine (RRR=2.59, 95% CI=2.09-3.21) positive but less likely to be antidepressant positive (RRR=0.79, 95% CI=0.72-0.87). Those who left a note were older and more likely to be non-Hispanic White, but Blacks were more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic Whites to be UnDs. Gender was not a significant factor. Results from separate regression models in the highest UnD states (Maryland and Utah) and in states other than Maryland/Utah were similar. Conclusion(s): The finding that UnDs had a higher likelihood of substance use problems and positive opioid and cocaine toxicology results suggests that their substance use/abuse was largely and directly responsible for their death. We could not compare UnDs to accidental overdose deaths, as the NVDRS does not include the latter, but such research among middle-aged and older adults is needed as many UnDs may be more correctly classified as unintentional overdose deaths. The extremely high UnD rates in Maryland and Utah are also likely reflections of the opioid epidemic that has raged in these two states. The study limitations were that as data on precipitating circumstances were largely collected from decedents' informal support systems, the validity of these proxy-derived data is a concern as is incomplete/unknown data, and substantial numbers of toxicology-tested decedents had missing test results. However, the findings show that along with more accurate determination processes for intent/manner of death, substance use treatment and approaches to curbing opioid and other drug use problems are needed to prevent intentional and unintentional poisoning deaths. Racial disparities in UnDs also underscore the need for more effective approaches to prevention and curbing drug availability in communities with concentrations of low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations.Copyright © 2019","Choi N.,DiNitto D.,Marti C.N.,Choi B.

1748,"Objectives: In this study, we aim to identify and discuss the clinical and demographic characteristics of previous emergency department (ED) patient visits, at one of the only two medical centers in Staten Island, the epicenter of the opioid epidemic within Staten Island, who subsequently present to the ED with an opioid overdose. Design(s): This was a retrospective, observational study of all patients presenting to the emergency ED between July 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. Setting(s): The study was conducted at Staten Island University Hospital. The ED has a census of 120,000 patient visits per year. Patient(s): All adult patients . 18 years of age, with an ICD-9 code consistent with opioid intoxication and a history of intentional or unintentional overdose were included. Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical and demographic characteristics of previous ED patient visits who subsequently presented to the ED with an opioid overdose. Result(s): One hundred and twenty-four subjects with a median age of 30 years [interquartile range, 24-40] were reviewed. Eighty-seven (70 percent) were males. Fifty-five subjects were admitted, 68 discharged, and one death. Patients were not more likely to present at any specific time of day. The most common past medical history was anxiety (21 percent), depression (20 percent), back pain (15 percent), hypertension (14 percent), and seizure disorder (11 percent). The most common past surgical history was a prior orthopedic procedure (11 percent).

1749,"Background: Police officers experience a high degree of chronic stress. Policing ranks among the highest professions in terms of disease and accident rates. Mental health is particularly impacted, evidenced by elevated rates of burnout, anxiety and depression, and poorer quality of life than the general public. Mindfulness training has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, burnout and promote quality of life in a variety of settings, although its efficacy in this context has yet to be systematically evaluated. Therefore, this trial will investigate the efficacy of a mindfulness-based intervention versus a waitlist control in improving quality of life and reducing negative mental health symptoms in police officers. Method(s): This multicenter randomized controlled trial has three assessment points: baseline, post-intervention, and six-month follow-up. Active police officers (n=160) will be randomized to Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion (MBHP) or waitlist control group at two Brazilian major cities: Porto Alegre and Sao Paulo. The primary outcomes are burnout symptoms and quality of life. Consistent with the MBHP conceptual model, assessed secondary outcomes include perceived stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, and the potential mechanisms of resilience, mindfulness, decentering, self-compassion, spirituality, and religiosity.

1750,"Background: Studies have examined utilization of health care services by civilian children with chronic conditions but not utilization among child dependents of military personnel. Objective(s): To identify children with chronic conditions among military members and retirees and examine their health care utilization and its association with type of condition. Method(s): We derived our sample from child dependents ages birth to 18 years of military personnel with health care enrollment in FY2011. We defined chronic conditions based on diagnoses and repeated specialty care visits. We accrued one year of health care utilization for each child starting with the date of first diagnosis that qualified (i.e., 2 + visits). Health care utilization measures were any inpatient stay; number of outpatient visits (excluding emergency department [ED] visits), ED visits, and number of psychotropic and non-psychotropic prescriptions. Result(s): Conditions with the highest prevalence were ADHD/conduct disorders (41.2%), other behavioral health (BH) disorders (30.4%), asthma (25.3%) and arthritis (23.8%). Boys and children ages 6-18 were more likely to have BH conditions. Twelve percent had inpatient stays, 63% used the ED, and mean ED visits was 4.6. The mean outpatient visits was 27.9. Utilization was consistently higher for children with both BH and physical health (PH) conditions, children under age 5 (except for number of psychotropic prescriptions), and those enrolled in the military's Extended Health Care Options (ECHO) program.

1752,"Objective: To describe injection-related HIV risk behaviors preimplementation and postimplementation of an emergency syringe services program (SSP) in Scott County, Indiana, after an HIV outbreak among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Design(s): Mixed methods retrospective pre-post intervention analysis. Method(s): We analyzed routine SSP program data collected at first and most recent visit among clients with $2 visits, $7 days apart from April 4 to August 30, 2015, to quantify changes in injection-related risk behaviors. We also analyzed qualitative data collected from 56 PWID recruited in Scott County to understand factors contributing to these behaviors. Result(s): SSP clients included in our analysis (n = 148, 62% of all SSP clients) reported significant (P, 0.001) reductions over a median 10 weeks (range 1-23) in syringe sharing to inject (18%-2%) and divide drugs (19%-4%), sharing other injection equipment (eg, cookers) (24%-5%), and number of uses of the same syringe [2 (interquartile range: 1-4) to 1 (interquartile range: 1-1)]. Qualitative study participants described access to sterile syringes and safer injection education through the SSP, as explanatory factors for these reductions. Injection frequency findings were mixed, but overall suggested no change. The number of syringes returned by SSP clients increased from 0 at first visit to median 57. All qualitative study participants reported using sharps containers provided by the SSP.

1753,"BACKGROUND: A growing body of research suggests that resilience training can play a pivotal role in creating mentally healthy workplaces, particularly with regard to protecting the long-term well-being of workers. Emerging research describes positive outcomes from various types of resilience training programs (RTPs) among different occupational groups. One specific group of workers that may benefit from this form of proactive resilience training is first responders. Given the nature of their work, first responders are frequently exposed to stressful circumstances and potentially traumatic events, which may impact their overall resilience and well-being over time. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to examine whether a mindfulness-based RTP (the Resilience@Work [RAW] Mindfulness Program) delivered via the internet can effectively enhance resilience among a group of high-risk workers. METHOD(S): We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) comprising 24 Primary Fire and Rescue and Hazmat stations within New South Wales. Overall, 12 stations were assigned to the 6-session RAW Mindfulness Program and 12 stations were assigned to the control condition. A total of 143 active full-time firefighters enrolled in the study. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, immediately post training, and at 6-month follow-up. Measurements examined change in both adaptive and bounce-back resilience as well as several secondary outcomes examining resilience resources and acceptance and mindfulness skills. RESULT(S): Mixed-model repeated measures analysis found that the overall test of group-by-time interaction was significant (P=.008), with the intervention group increasing in adaptive resilience over time. However, no significant differences were found between the intervention group and the control group in terms of change in bounce-back resilience (P=.09). At 6-month follow-up, the group receiving the RAW intervention had an average increase in their resilience score of 1.3, equating to a moderate-to-large effect size compared with the control group of 0.73 (95% CI 0.38-1.06). Per-protocol analysis found that compared with the control group, the greatest improvements in adaptive resilience were observed among those who completed most of the RAW program, that is, 5 to 6 sessions (P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): The results of this RCT suggest that mindfulness-based resilience training delivered in an internet format can create improvements in adaptive resilience and related resources among high-risk workers, such as first responders. Despite a number of limitations, the results of this study suggest that the RAW Mindfulness Program is an effective, scalable, and practical means of delivering online resilience training in high-risk workplace settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a mindfulness-based RTP delivered entirely via the internet has been tested in the workplace.

1754,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of psychoactive substances is constantly increasing in developing countries, and all professional sectors are concerned. Taxi drivers are a particular target because of the dangerousness and complexity of their work. However, few studies have investigated toxic habits in this population. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the use and misuse of addictive substances in taxi drivers and to appreciate poly-consumptions according to socio-demographic and occupational characteristics. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional study took place in five big cities during the second quarter of 2014, and was conducted amongst 2,927 taxi drivers who went through official, obligatory control areas on a daily basis. The questionnaire covered socio-demographic and occupational characteristics, toxic habits (tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and others psychotropic substances). The misuse was assessed by specific tests: Fagerstrom test for tobacco smoking, Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) and DETA (Diminuer, Entourage, Trop, Alcool) test for alcohol. RESULT(S): The prevalence of consumption was 36.6% for smoking tobacco, 18.4% for cannabis, and 10.5% for alcohol. Amongst consumers, the prevalence of dependence or misuse was 36.6% for smoking tobacco, 37.2% for cannabis and 56.5% for alcohol. Fifty point three percent had no toxic habit, 35 % had one toxic habit, 11.5% had two toxic habits, 2.7% had three toxic habits and 0.6% had four toxic habits. The most frequent associations were tobacco-alcohol (6.8%) and tobacco-cannabis (4.1%). CONCLUSION(S): The elaboration of the prevention approach needs a cooperative spirit. It will be more accepted and applied if all taxi drivers, their representatives and road safety officers are involved in its preparation.","Laraqui O.,Laraqui S.,Manar N.,Ghailan T.,Hammouda R.,Deschamps F.,Laraqui C.E.H.

1755,"Objectives Cannabis allergy has mainly been described following recreational use but some cases also point to cannabis sensitisation as a result of occupational exposure. As a consequence, little is known on the prevalence and clinical phenotype of occupational cannabis allergy. Therefore, this study aims to explore the allergy-associated health risks of occupational cannabis exposure in Belgian police force personnel. Methods 81 participants, active in the police force, reporting regular occupational cannabis exposure during the past 12 months, were included. History was combined with a standardised questionnaire on allergies and cannabis exposure.Basophil activation tests (BATs) with a crude cannabis extract and rCan s 3 were performed. In addition, specific (s)IgE rCan s 3 as well as sIgE to house dust mite, six pollen and three mould allergens were quantified. Results Although 42% of the participants reported respiratory and/or cutaneous symptoms on occupational cannabis exposure, all cannabis diagnostics were entirely negative, except one symptomatic case demonstrating a borderline result. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between the groups with and without symptoms on cannabis exposure in terms of allergenic sensitisations. Conclusions The origins of the reported respiratory and cutaneous symptoms during cannabis exposure remain elusive but are probably due to non-immune reactions. It should be noted that the study was volunteer-based possibly reflecting an excessive number of symptomatic individuals. Nevertheless, as only one participant reported using fully protective gear, much improvement is needed for reducing the number of symptoms reported on duty, independent of their origin.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.","Decuyper I.I.,Van Gasse A.,Faber M.A.,Mertens C.,Elst J.,Rihs H.-P.,Sabato V.,Lapeere H.,Hagendorens M.,Bridts C.,De Clerck L.,Ebo D.

1756,"Purpose: As first responders who are frequently exposed to job-related trauma, law enforcement officers are at an elevated risk of adverse health outcomes. The stressful nature of policing and the substantial limitations of both tertiary and secondary prevention suggest a real need for primary prevention research on ways to increase resilience and reduce aggression. The primary objective of this study was to assess feasibility and gather preliminary outcome data on mindfulness-based resilience training (MBRT) for law enforcement officers. Result(s): Attendance, adherence, posttraining participant feedback, and interventionist fidelity to protocol all demonstrate feasibility of MBRT for law enforcement officers. Compared to waitlist controls, MBRT participants experienced greater reductions in salivary cortisol (AUCi), selfreported aggression, burnout, alcohol use, sleep disturbance, and increases in psychological flexibility and nonreactivity at posttraining; however, group differences were not maintained at 3-month follow-up. Conclusion(s): This initial randomized trial suggests MBRT is a feasible intervention, and a larger fully powered randomized Controlled trial is warranted. Outcome data suggest that MBRT targets key physiological, psychological, and health risk factors in law enforcement officers, consistent with the potential to improve officer health and public safety. However, follow-up training or ""booster"" sessions may be needed to maintain training gains.","Hunsinger M.,Goerling S.R.,Bowen C.,Gross J.,Pruessner M.,Christopher (2018//).

1757,"Emergency medical service (EMS) personnel are highly skilled health care professionals who often provide lifesaving clinical care to patients. Paradoxically, they may be repeatedly exposed to a unique set of occupational hazards that could endanger their own health. This cross-sectional study sought to examine the relation between resiliency and musculoskeletal injuries (MSIs) and between resiliency and lost workdays due to MSIs, and explore whether age modifies these associations. Multivariable Poisson main effects regression models showed that resiliency had a protective effect against MSIs, but not lost workdays. In the unadjusted regression model to evaluate the relation between resiliency and age, results suggested that no differences in distributions existed between younger and older EMS personnel and resiliency. However, given the same unit increase in resiliency, findings from multivariable Poisson interaction regression models indicated that older workers had a higher prevalence of MSIs and lost workdays than younger workers. Results from main effects models may reflect diverging routes on a pathophysiological pathway, in which resiliency acts as a prognostic factor for MSIs but not lost workdays. Findings might also indicate the association between resiliency, and MSIs and lost workdays varies by age. Relevance to industry: The largest growth of labor in the US is expected to occur in the oldest segments of the population. While older workers may offer more experience and show similar resiliency to younger workers, they might be more vulnerable to individual risk factors and occupational exposures. If management wants to retain older workers as assets, they should design the work environment to match the capabilities of all workers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Dropkin J.,Power P.,Rasul R.,Moline J.,Kim H.

1758,"In the biomedical paradigm all symptoms and limitations are ascribed to discrete pathophysiology. However, a biopsychosocial health model that accounts for the important influence of mind-set and circumstances on illness may be preferable in the vast majority of cases. Some of the shortcomings of the biomedical model include an overreliance on tests and treatments. One major issue of the biomedical model is the raging epidemic of opioid misuse and opioid related overdose deaths as previously reported in North America. Emblematic of these issues is a 56-year-old male that had surgery for a rupture of the distal biceps in our clinic with psychosocial aspects of the illness that were underappreciated by the care team and had disastrous opioidcentric attempts at pain control leading to threats to hospital staff, and finally resulting in forcible removal by hospital security from the ward and national police from the hospital. One might argue that there is no higher priority than rejecting the biomedical model, understanding illness is its full complexity, and learning from the world's mistakes so that we don't repeat them.

However, it is unclear how employee lifestyle behaviours, health characteristics and well-being may differ within a broader occupational sector. Aim(s): To investigate the health characteristics, lifestyle behaviours and well-being of three Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) occupational groups that differ in shift work and occupational demands: operational firefighters (FF), emergency control (EC) and administrative support (AS) workers. Method(s): Data were obtained via an online survey using previously validated questionnaires to assess health characteristics, lifestyle behaviours and perceived well-being. Differences between groups were explored, controlling for confounding variables, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) methods. Effect sizes are reported where appropriate to demonstrate clinical significance. Result(s): Four thousand five hundred and sixty-four FRS personnel volunteered, with 3333 (73%) completing the survey out of a total workforce of 60000 (8%). FF reported the lowest prevalence of chronic medical conditions (10%), compared with AS (21%) and EC (19%) workers. Total physical activity (PA) was 66% higher among FF compared with EC and AS workers. Components of sleep and self-rated health were independent predictors of well-being irrespective of FRS role. Conclusion(s): FF reported the highest levels of PA and highest perceptions of well-being, and the lowest prevalence of obesity and chronic medical conditions, compared with other FRS occupational groups.

1760,"INTRODUCTION Trauma centers reported illicit amphetamine use in approximately 10% of trauma admissions in the previous decade. From experience at a trauma center located in a southwestern metropolis, our perception is that illicit amphetamine use is on the rise and that these patients utilize in-hospital resources beyond what would be expected for their injuries. The purposes of this study were to document the incidence of illicit amphetamine use among our trauma patients and to evaluate its impact on resource utilization. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 7 consecutive years of data (starting July 2010) from our institution's trauma registry. Toxicology screenings were used to categorize patients into one of three groups: illicit amphetamine, other drugs, or drug-free. Adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used to predict hospital cost, length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and ventilation between drug groups. Models were conducted with combined injury severity (Injury Severity Score [ISS]) and then repeated for ISS of less than 9, ISS 9 to 15, and ISS 16 or greater. RESULTS Eight thousand five hundred eighty-nine patients were categorized into the following three toxicology groups: 1,255 (14.6%) illicit amphetamine, 2,214 (25.8%) other drugs, and 5,120 (59.6%) drug-free. Illicit amphetamine use increased threefold over the course of the study (from 7.85% to 25.0% of annual trauma admissions). Adjusted linear models demonstrated that illicit amphetamine among patients with ISS of less than 9 was associated with 4.6% increase in hospital cost (p = 0.019) and 7.4% increase in length of stay (p = 0.043). Logistic models revealed significantly increased odds of ventilation across all ISS groups and increased odds of intensive care unit admission when all ISS groups were combined (p = 0.001) and within the group with ISS of less than 9 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Hospital resource utilization of amphetamine patients with minor injuries is significant. Trauma centers with similar epidemic growth in proportion of amphetamine patients face a potentially significant resource strain relative to other centers.

1761,"Objective: To assess depression literacy, help-seeking and help-offering to others in members of the police force in the state of Victoria, Australia. Method(s): All staff in police stations involved in a cluster randomised controlled trial of an integrated workplace mental health intervention were invited to participate. Survey questions covered sociodemographic and employment information, recognition of depression in a vignette, stigma, treatment beliefs, willingness to assist co-workers with mental health problems, help-giving and help-seeking behaviours, and intentions to seek help. Using the baseline dataset associated with the trial, the paper presents a descriptive analysis of mental health literacy and helping behaviours, comparing police station leaders and lower ranks. Result(s): Respondents were 806 staff, comprising 618 lower-ranked staff and 188 leaders. Almost 84% of respondents were able to correctly label the problem described in the vignette. Among those who had helped someone with a mental health problem, both lower ranks and leaders most commonly reported 'talking to the person' although leaders were more likely to facilitate professional help. Leaders' willingness to assist the person and confidence in doing so was very high, and over 80% of leaders appropriately rated police psychologists, general practitioners, psychologists, talking to a peer and contacting welfare as helpful. However, among both leaders and lower ranks with mental health problems, the proportion of those unlikely to seek professional help was greater than those who were likely to seek it. Conclusion(s): Knowledge about evidence-based interventions for depression was lower in this police sample than surveys in the general population, pointing to the need for education and training to improve mental health literacy. Such education should also aim to overcome barriers to professional help-seeking. Interventions that aim to improve mental health literacy and help-seeking behaviour appear to be suitable targets for better protecting police member mental health.Copyright © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2018.","Reavley N.J.,Milner A.J.,Martin A.,Too L.S.,Papas A.,Witt K.,Keegel T.,LaMontagne A.D.

1762,"Background: The risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection among health care workers (HCWs) is higher than as noted among workers in the general population. The prevalence and risk factors of TB infection among HCWs were assessed in a tertiary hospital in South Korea, resulting in a conclusion of an intermediate TB burden within the country. Method(s): This cross-sectional study enrolled HCWs who underwent a QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) test to detect the presence of a latent TB infection (LTBI), in patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in South Korea in 2017. The departments of the hospital were divided into TB-related and TB-unrelated departments, which were based on the risk of exposure to TB patients. In this sense, the risk factors for LTBI, including current working in the TB-related departments, were analyzed. Result(s): In this case, a total of 499 HCWs (54 doctors, 365 nurses and 80 paramedical personnel) were enrolled in this study. The median age of the subjects was 31 years (range, 20-67 years), 428 (85.8%) were female, and 208 (41.7%) were working in the TB-related departments. The prevalence of LTBI was 15.8% based on the QFT-GIT. Additionally, the prevalence of experience of exposure to pre-treatment TB patents was higher among HCWs working in the TB-related departments, than among HCWs working in the TB-unrelated departments (78.8% vs. 61.9%, p<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of LTBI between the two groups (17.3% vs. 14.8%, p=0.458). On a review of the multivariate analysis, only the factor of age was independently associated with an increased risk of LTBI (p=0.006). Conclusion(s): Broadly speaking, the factor of age was associated with an increased risk of LTBI among the HCWs in South Korea. However, those workers current working in the TB-related departments was not associated with an increased risk of LTBI.Copyright © 2018 The Korean Academy of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases.","Park J.S.

1763,"Background: Novel psychoactive substances (NPS) have become popular for recreational use. Among NPS, synthetic cathinones are frequently used for their psychoactive and euphoric properties . N-ethyl pentylone (ephylone) was synthetized for the first time in 1969 but only recently found in drug seizures in the USA and Europe in 2016. It has probably become a cheap substitute for stimulants as methamphetamine and cocaine. To date there are very few published reports involving this synthetic cathinone. Ephylone blood levels were detected in specimens collected for death investigation cases and for drugged driving cases in a recent study. Two other lethal cases were recently published in 2017. We describe a laboratory confirmed case where acute psycosis developed after ephylone repeated sniffing, bought as cocaine. Case-report: A 29-year-old health worker with past history of depression, during his night shift in hospital became agitated with visual hallucinations, delirium, mydriasis and nausea. At the emergency room (ER) admission tachycardia 100 pulse/min with normal arterial pressure 130/80mmHg and O2 saturation 99% on room air were registered. On the electrocardiogram non-specific ST alteration was observed without troponin increase. Laboratory evaluation showed neutrophil leukocytosis (9.53 10-9/l) and mild rhabdomyolysis (CPK 1069U/l) with positive ecstasy in urinary drug of abuse first level essay. The patient was initially treated with lorazepam 4mg im and, after 45 min, sedated with midazolam 5mg iv. Four hours later the patient was again agitated and needed lorazepam 5mg po, delorazepam 5mg iv and lastly midazolam 5mg iv with an improvement of the clinical picture. He was admitted in the psychiatric unit and discharged after 4 d asymptomatic with normal electrocardiogram and routine laboratory exams. He declared he has bought 2 g of the substance sold as cocaine and sniffed that for the 3 d prior ER admission. Mild paranoid symptoms were present the day before the acute psycosis. Laboratory analysis performed by GC-MS at second level on urine sampled at ER admission revealed the presence of ephylone and did not confirm the presence of ecstasy and any other drugs. Ephylone was found also in the urine sampled 4 d after the ER admission. Case discussion: N-Ethyl Pentylone is a substituted cathinone with psycostimulant effects. Its identification was first reported to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in January 2016 by Slovenia in a forensic case. As other cathinones, psychiatric and neurotoxic effects are reported after ephylone use but due to its novelty very little is known regarding its toxicological effects on human users, making management and clinical prognosis difficult. Ephylone was quantitatively confirmed in oral fluid specimens collected from dance music festival attendees after ingestion of ""Molly"", in conjuction with other subtsances of abuse. Conclusion(s): Our case report underlines the acute neurological and psychiatric effects after repeated use of ephylone alone, sold as cocaine, and the false-positive urine first level essay for ecstasy.","Gallo M.,Giampreti A.,Butera R.,Eleftheriou G.,Faraoni L.,Bedussi F.,Papa P.,Di Tuccio M.,Margutti E.,Colombi R.,Romano G.,Bacis G.

1764,"Background: Amidst the roaring crescendo of the American opiate epidemic, abuse of progressively potent opiates is trending through the nation. Fentanyl and its analogues increasingly account for opioid-related deaths due to their high potency. As the tides of law enforcement begin to sweep control over commonplace opiates, novel agents and counterfeit compounds have cropped up to meet street demand; these novel formulations are sold to illicit users, who are generally unaware of these formulary variations. Furanylfentanyl is one such drug, which mimics the extremely potent fentanyl, belonging to the class of novel psychoactive substances. U-47700 is a second synthetic agent, belonging to the class of benzamides. These agents are extremely potent, generally requiring four times the usual dose of Narcan for reversal. We report three deaths, two with confirmed exposure to furanylfentanyl and U-47700, and one with confirmed exposure to furanylfentanyl, U-47700 and acetylfentanyl. These cases present a timely illustration and definitive evidence of the dramatic and hidden toxicity of these novel formulations. These cases have exciting implications to toxicological exposure management, law enforcement, and national health. Case reports: The first case is a 24-year-old male found unresponsive and non-resuscitatable after snorting what appeared to be PercocetVR . Chemical analysis of tablets and drug paraphernalia obtained from the scene tested positive for furanylfentanyl, U-47700, cocaine, and alprazolam. No autopsy was performed, but postmortem blood testing revealed furanylfentanyl (2.8 ng/ml), U-47700 (76 ng/ml), benzoylecgonine, alprazolam, THC, and Gabapentin. The second case is a 20-year-old male with a history of substance, found unresponsive in full rigor. Evidence from the scene suggests the subject snorted pills appearing to be oxycodone. These counterfeit pills tested positive for furanylfentanyl, U-47700, and acetylfentanyl. Postmortem blood testing resulted positive for furanylfentanyl, U-47700, and acetylfentanyl. The third case is a 21-year-old female with substance use disorder (SUD) found on the bathroom floor by her boyfriend after snorting what appeared to be oxycodone. She was intubated and attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. Drug paraphernalia seized by police was subjected to DEA chemical analysis, which resulted positive for furanylfentanyl and U-47700. Postmortem peripheral blood testing resulted positive for furanylfentanyl and U-47700. The cause of death was determined to be opioid toxicity in all three cases. Discussion(s): As opioid-involved deaths continue to increase in the United States, fentanyl, its analogues, and other synthetic opiods have both overtly and surreptitiously seeped into the illicit drug market. Due to the greater potency of these synthetic opioids, the risk of respiratory depression and death is higher than with more common opioids, and treatment of overdose requires much higher doses of reversal agents. Conclusion(s): We report three opiod-induced deaths from counterfeit pills with scene and postmortem confirmation of synthetic opioids. Clearly, furanylfentanyl, acetylfentanyl, and U-47700 are novel but increasingly pervasive synthetic opioids that are of great public concern, with a higher risk of respiratory depression and death. These considerations have important implications to EMS and emergency personnel, law enforcement, and public health and safety.","Billington M.,Hail S. (2018//).

1765,"Background: Over the past 25 years, the United States has experienced sporadic epidemics of accidental overdose and death from heroin substitution or adulteration with fentanyl/fentanyl analogues. A spike in mortality was noted in Wayne County Michigan, July 2016-February 2017 shortly after carfentanil was first detected in Michigan. Carfentanil is an especially potent mu opioid agonist fentanyl analogue previously used as a veterinary tranquilizing agent. It is reportedly 100 times more potent than fentanyl and 10,000 times more potent than morphine. We hypothesized carfentanil was the cause of the mortality spike and determined that certain areas of Wayne County have higher mortality rates than others. Method(s): We partnered with the Wayne County Medical Examiners and obtained records of those who died of accidental non-pharmaceutical opioid overdoses from July 2015 to July 2017. We recorded basic demographics, locations of death, and all opioid toxicology results and excluded those who died in hospitals. We utilized geolocation software to identify areas with the highest mortality. Result(s): We identified a total of 645 people who died of nonpharmaceutical opioid overdoses. Of those, carfentanil was detected in 129 (20% of cases). During the mortality spike from July 2015 to February 2017, we noted carfentanil was detected in 114 of 419 cases (average 27%; range 6.4-45.2%). Majority of decedents were male (65%) and white (63%) with an average age of 43. We found the substances most frequently detected with carfentanil included morphine (57%), 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) (38%), fentanyl (43%), norfentanyl (33%), THC (34%), and cocaine (29%). Furthermore, we located two areas of the county with highest mortality rates and created a heat map with the results. Conclusion(s): Carfentanil was highly associated with excess mortality noted during the period from July 2016 to February 2017 in Wayne County, Michigan. In mid-February, China's National Narcotics Control Commission announced a ban on a number of fentanyl analogues, including carfentanil. This announcement paralleled the end of the mortality spike and suggests source control via origin country regulation efforts is effective. Finally, geographical analysis of medical examiner data can identify high risk areas that can be targeted for interventions by health departments, EMS, and law enforcement.","King A.,Foley D.,Arfken C.,Aaron C.,Sung L.,Hlavaty L.

1766,"Background: Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and particularly Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) have reached epidemic proportions over the past 15 years and continue to grow unabated. Previous studies have demonstrated that SUD significantly increases the probability of using an Emergency Department (ED) for medical and psychiatric services. Accordingly, drug of abuse (DOA) testing by enzyme immunoassay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) are routinely ordered in the ED. However, there is limited literature describing DOA test utilization and detection patterns, specifically among adult ED visits. To this end, we present a 16 month retrospective review detailing ordering and detection characteristics, turn-around-time (TAT), analytic performance metrics, and incidence of analyte co-detection for ED patients. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of all urine DOA orders at a single tertiary, level I trauma center. Specimen order, collection, accession, and final verify dates were reviewed for calculation of TAT. DOA screen assays and results were correlated with associated confirmatory testing to allow for calculation of true and false positive rates and co-detection patterns for confirmatory testing was reviewed. Result(s): Between January 2017 and March 2018, 24,114 urine specimens were screened for DOA. Ten thousand seven hundred and sixty-one were ordered for ED patients, of which 38% were negative (n=4094), 33% were positive for a single analyte (n=3589), and 29% were positive for multiple analytes (n=3078). Benzodiazepines and cannabinoids were the two most commonly detected analytes, with detection rates of 30% and 25% of positive specimens respectively. High incidence codetection patterns included combinations of benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, or opiates. Reflex confirmatory testing was available for cocaine, methadone, opiates, and oxycodone, and was ordered on 28% of DOA screens. Subgroup analysis on positive DOA screens which underwent reflex testing by GCMS demonstrated a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97.2%. Lastly, the median TAT from the time of collection to final result verify was 62 min for DOA screening and 8 days 16 h for confirmatory testing. Conclusion(s): In this study, we presented test utilization data, TAT, analytic performance metrics, and detection patterns for DOA testing on patients in the ED. Our data indicate that DOA testing is common at a tertiary level I trauma center, with an average of 22 DOA screens ordered per day. Benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates demonstrated a high incidence of detection, which was similarly reflected in the total distribution of co-detection patterns, suggesting that polysubstance use patterns may be related to isolated illicit substance use. In addition, the analytic performance of screening assays demonstrates high PPV for analytes with confirmatory reflex testing. Lastly, DOA testing continues to have a long TAT, particularly for confirmatory testing, as treatment decisions are likely made prior to final verification of results.","Durant T.,Bunch D.,El-Khoury J.,Schulz W.,Tomassoni A.

1767,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers are exposed to work related stresses that significantly increase their risk of burnout., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare burnout and work related stress levels in three categories of health professionals: physiotherapists, speech therapists and occupational therapists., METHODS: A convenience sample of 391 health professionals participated, including 210 physiotherapists, 101 speech therapists and 80 occupational therapists. We collected general socio-demographic information and administered the standardized Italian version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Management Standards Indicator Tool., RESULTS: We found the proportion of professionals with high-risk scores in the three dimensions of the MBI to be as follows: Emotional Exhaustion 32%, Depersonalisation 13% and Personal Accomplishment 9%. Overall, 14% of participants were at high risk of burnout. No significant differences were found between the three professional categories. Five subscales of the HSE were associated with burnout: Control (p < 0.01), Management support (p < 0.01), Relationship (p < 0.05), Role (p < 0.01), and Change (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Like all health care workers, rehabilitation professionals are at a high risk of burnout. There are common mechanisms underlying burnout in the different professional groups investigated. Further research in occupational health in rehabilitation settings is needed to prevent burnout.","Bruschini M.,Carli A.,Burla F. (2018//).

1768,"Background: Transport for London (TfL) Occupational Health Dept identified musculoskeletal (MSK) problems as matters of concern in train operating staff on 3 of the underground lines (JNP). These issues were contentious and the subject of continued discussion between the management of TfL, train operators, Unions and other stakeholders. The Bone and Joint Research Group (BJRG) were invited to undertake work to provide insight into the MSK health issues of train operators from a neutral perspective. Objective(s): To assess the problems and issues relating to the musculoskeletal health of train operators. Method(s): A steering committee was created with representatives from the train operators, the Unions, TfL managers and other stakeholders. Participants were recruited to 6 focus groups. Separate focus groups were held for operators, managers and for other stakeholders. The groups were asked to discuss the status of their own MSK health, the impact of work on their MSK health, the support they receive from their employer and others, barriers and facilitators to maintaining MSK health, the role of managers in improving MSK health in the workplace and what interventions would improve MSK health. The focus groups were recorded transcribed and analysed using Thematic Analysis. The findings informed a survey of JNP train operators. The survey was co-produced and endorsed by the BJRG, TfL and the Unions and circulated to train operators. The survey included questions on demographics, lifestyle, work role, posture training, MSK problems, actions taken and ideas on how MSK risks could be managed and MSK health protected and improved. Result(s): 20% of train operators (338) completed the survey. Respondents reflected the demographic profile of the total JNP train operators. 72% reported not receiving adequate posture training. 74% experienced MSK pain, either currently or in the past. Of these 52% were currently in pain. The average number of months in pain was 59. Lower back, neck and shoulders were the most frequently reported sites of pain. 74% said the pain was caused by or worsened by work. An average of 7 days of work was lost per year due to MSK problems. 44% had not told their manager. Most respondents said their MSK health could be improved by improvements to their seating and cab ergonomics. Participants acknowledged that it is an individual's responsibility to look after their own MSK health and suggested ways to do this. These included changing position when driving, stretching, improved posture, employing good manual handling techniques, exercising outside of work and eating healthily. Conclusion(s): MSK problems are a significant issue among JNP train operators and structural problems are perceived to be the main cause. Operators are aware of their own role in maintaining their MSK health both at work and at home. The study illustrates that it is possible to work effectively and collaboratively with a range of workplace stakeholders to achieve a common goal of improved MSK health. The active involvement of all stakeholders throughout the process and the engagement of a neutral research organisation increased 'buy-in' and gave credibility to the project. The findings are currently being considered by the steering committee to produce a series of recommendations at the policy, operational and individual level to protect the MSK health of train operators.","Erwin J.,Howarth J.,Chauhan L.,Webster A.,Woolf A.

1769,"Introduction This paper examines the major health threats and risks to employees in Ghana and some West African countries amidst the rapidly growing mining, metals, oil and gas industries. It looks at the role of key stakeholders, particularly academic health institutions in the evidenced-based management of occupational health to improve the health, productivity and performance of the working population. Methods The paper was developed from extensive literature review and interview of some industry leaders to understand some historical trends of employee occupational health promotion and protection indices and the current situation of occupational health and hygiene standards in the sub-region. Results Clearly, the present West African employee (local and expatriate) are heavily burdened with diverse kinds of health threats, both from the workplace and non-work-related sources. The threats and associated risks were noted to be hugely skewed towards infectious diseases and occupational health hazards origins. That notwithstanding, non-communicable diseases challenges, like mental health, hypertension, diabetes, cancers and musculoskeletal disorders had prominent place in the workplace health hazards and risks matrix. Discussion Academic health institutions in West Africa, despite having major roles to play in defining and managing occupational health hazards, were noted not to be actively engaged. Training of competent professionals to run workplace wellness, occupational health and hygiene programs in high-risk workplaces in developing countries, research to have evidence based problem definitions and efficient alternative solution pathways with maximum health outcome are all some of the roles falling in the domain of academic health institutions. Legislation and occupational standards development cannot be achieved without credible research evidence support - this was noted to be a huge gap in the West-Africa sub-Region. The way forward was identified as; key stakeholders working together using a systemic and systematic approach to progressively define and address workplace health problems to improve occupational health outcome. I am currently and IFAD medical advisor and have been in this role for the past 7 months as consultant. Prior to assuming this position, I was a UN volunteer as a medical officer providing occupational health, primary health and emergency medical services to the UN staff deployed in North Korea. This I did for 18 months with no salary, but only basic allowance to support my basic living allowance. Before moving to North Korea, I served in a similar capacity for 10 years in Ghana, DR Congo and Lebanon with basic remuneration. I am optimistic that, this provided valuable services to contribute to the identified and shared gap (by ICOH and ILO) of far less that 10% of developing countries employees receiving occupational health services consistent with workplace risks and hazards they face. It is out of this enormous amount of occupational health experience that I present this paper. Finally, my strive to attain the highest competence in occupational health made me register for MPH (Occupational and Environmental health) in Tulane University School of Public health and Tropical Medicine. New Orleans, USA. This is costing me over US$ 50,000.00. With this financial commitment already made, I would grately appreciate the requested waiver support to attend this all important ICOH 2018 Congress. My sharing of my over 10 years of occupational health experience in 5 different countries and 4 continents in the would add a rich flavour to the program.","Etteh H. (2018//).

1770,"Guidelines for prevention of occupationally-acquired tuberculosis developed by the CDC in the 1990s onwards established the primary prevention triad of administrative, environmental and personal protective practices, augmented by secondary prevention measures such as screening for and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection and active disease in health care workers. More recently, a refocusing on the administrative level as 'Find (patient) cases Actively, Separate temporarily and Treat effectively' (FAST) has been advocated. The difficulty of applying all of these measures in low resource high tuberculosis burden settings, where most cases of occupational tuberculosis occur, was recognised by the WHO in the late 1990s. WHO modified its guidelines to apply to settings characterised by undiagnosed tuberculosis in all parts of the health system, HIV-TB co-occurrence, limitations on staff and other resources for triage, isolation, environmental controls and respirators, delays in diagnosis and in treatment of patients and shortage of drug sensitivity testing. Secondary prevention is similarly limited by shortage of skills, particularly in occupational health, and constrained by staff fears regarding lack of confidentiality and job security. Competition for management attention and resources, with attendant fragmentation of effort, add to the problem. Health care workers activists have recently called for advocacy pressure on governments and health authorities to take seriously the need to prevent transmission of tuberculosis in health care facilities, particularly in the face of rising drug resistant tuberculosis and cooccurrent HIV. This includes an occupational health approach capable of encompassing the whole spectrum of prevention. It would give weight to primary prevention appropriate to low resource settings, but also include surveillance of occupational tuberculosis, co-management of HIV and TB, protection of students, provision of effective treatment, strengthening of worker rights in the form of income, leave and job protection, stigma reduction while promoting self-disclosure, and compensation for those permanently affected.","Ehrlich R.I.

1771,"Background: Migrant women are over-represented in the sex industry, and migrant sex workers experience disproportionate health inequities, including those related to health access, HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and violence. Despite calls for occupational sex work interventions situated in labour rights frameworks, there remains a paucity of evidence pertaining to migrant sex workers' needs and realities, particularly within Mexico and Central America. This study investigated migrant sex workers' narratives regarding the ways in which structural features of work environments shape vulnerability and agency related to HIV/STI prevention and violence at the Guatemala-Mexico border. Method(s): Drawing on theoretical perspectives on risk environments and structural determinants of HIV in sex work, we analyzed in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic fieldwork conducted with 39 migrant sex workers in indoor work environments between 2012 and 2015 in Tecun Uman, Guatemala. Result(s): Participant narratives revealed the following intersecting themes to be most closely linked to safety and agency to engage in HIV/STI prevention: physical features of indoor work environments (e.g., physical layout of venue, proximity to peers and third parties); social norms and practices for alcohol use within the workplace; the existence and nature of management practices and policies on health and safety practices; and economic influences relating to control over earnings and clients. Across work environments, health and safety were greatly shaped by human rights concerns stemming from workplace interactions with police, immigration authorities, and health authorities. Conclusion(s): Physical isolation, establishment norms promoting alcohol use, restricted economic agency, and human rights violations related to sex work policies and immigration enforcement were found to exacerbate risks. However, some establishment policies and practices promoted 'enabling environments' for health and safety, supporting HIV/STI prevention, economic agency, and protection from violence and exploitation; these practices and policies were especially crucial for recent migrants. Policy reforms and structural workplace interventions tailored to migrant sex workers' needs are recommended to promote improved working conditions and migrant sex workers' health, safety, and human rights.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).","Goldenberg S.M.,Rocha Jimenez T.,Brouwer K.C.,Morales Miranda S.,Silverman J.G.

1772,"Purpose Identified Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) and/or patterns of aberrant drug use have reached epidemic proportions throughout the United States (1). Pain and SUDs are frequently co-occurring clinical conditions with the potential for misuse of prescribed medications or use of alternative, nonprescribed drugs to manage pain (2). Treatment for patients with or at risk for SUDs can be very challenging, in part, because providers may not know which drugs a patient is consuming. For example, patients may not fully disclose their substance use or lack of adherence to treatment (3). Further, clandestine drug manufacturing and substitutions can further complicate the landscape, as the patients themselves may not be fully aware of what drugs they are using. Heroin laced with illicit fentanyl remains a critical example of this phenomenon (4). With these gaps in knowledge, a keen understanding of drug use patterns within a region is critical to providing adequate patient care. There is a wealth of information on drug use patterns using survey and overdose data (5, 6). Unfortunately, reliance on these sources can provide a skewed perspective for physicians and counselors by relying on outdated information or extreme toxic levels of use rather than day-to-day shifts in use. We examined the feasibility of using current laboratory data to provide insight into drug use patterns across one state. This clinical data, including geospatial mapping and drug trends over time, provides insight into regional variation and can provide a model of decision support for providers hoping to identify what drugs are accessible to their patients. Methods Laboratory data, representing an estimated 1.8 million tests results over one year (March 2016-2017), was obtained from a private diagnostic laboratory located in Burlington VT. A total of over 9,000 unique patients were included, representing approximately 80% of the zip codes across the state. The data spans rural (population <5000 people), suburban (population: 5,000 to 10,000 people) and urban (population >10,000 people). By estimates by Medicare/Medicaid claims data, this is estimated to represent approximately 75% of urine drug testing across the state. Analysis of data was performed using Excel, Anaconda python and Pandas software. Graphics and geospatial mapping were generated using Geopandas, matplotlib and Excel software. The research is characterized as Not Human Subjects Research by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Vermont. The primary objective of this descriptive study was to understand whether or not patterns in use of different substances could be seen across the state and across time. Immunoassay technology has been used to generate the laboratory results. Results Through evaluation by geospatial mapping, geographic variation in drug use is observed across the state with eastern regions demonstrating higher rates of positive tests for heroin and fentanyl than western regions. In contrast, opioid and oxycodone use demonstrated little variability across the state. Benzodiazepines and an alcohol metabolite (EtG) demonstrate strikingly similar geographic patterns to one another, supporting the validity of the model. Some drugs of lower abuse potential, such as tapentadol, tramadol, and carisoprodol, did not display enough positive values to warrant conclusions using this model. Evaluating trends in use over time demonstrated that positive results for general opioids (including morphine, codeine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone) and oxycodone decreased over the year, corresponding to anticipated changing legislation in the state at that time. Non-opioid analytes evaluated did not change over the same time course. Conclusions Use of laboratory data can provide another avenue into understanding drug prevalence across a region. This information can supplement current analysis of existent and emerging drug trends already acquired by other methods including drug seizure data, emergency department overdose rates, forensic findings and patient-provider surveys. Further work beyond this descriptive analysis is necessary to validate this model in comparison to other data sources.","Warrington J.,Warrington G. (2018//).

1774,"Poisoning is a worldwide problem that involves individuals of all ages and a range of chemicals. In this study, fatal poisoning cases that occurred in the Federal District of Brazil (DF) from 2009 to 2013 were described using information from four systems, and the reasons for underreporting of each system were discussed. Data were obtained from the mortality information system (SIM), the notifiable disease information system (SINAN), the poison information center (CIT), and the forensic medicine institute (IML) of the DF. In total, 288 cases were reported to SIM, 18 to SINAN, 29 to CIT and 101 cases identified in the IML. SIM data indicated a prevalence of 2.24 cases/year/100,000 individuals in the DF, higher than the national estimation (1.36). After eliminating the 98 duplicate cases among the systems, 338 fatal unique cases were identified, from which 74.0% were reported in only one system (mainly the SIM), 23.4% in two systems, 8 cases in three systems and only 1 case was reported in the four systems. Over two thirds of the 338 fatalities involved men (67.4%), and 46.9% involved individuals aged 20-39 years. Medications were the main agent involved (49.4%), followed by pesticides (29.9%). The fatalities occurred mainly after unintentional exposure (50.8%) and suicide (47.7%, of which 53.5% involved pesticides). These results confirmed the previous hypothesis that none of the information systems could capture the whole picture of fatal poisonings in the DF. Underreporting was found in all systems, indicating the need to improve the information quality and the coordination of data reporting, so that health authorities can better understand and reduce these fatalities.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Magalhaes A.F.A.,Caldas E.D.

1775,"Background: The opioid epidemic is rapidly evolving and new tools are needed to combat drug abuse. The Maine Diversion Alert Program (DAP) is an informational resource that facilitates communication about drug arrests between the criminal justice and healthcare fields. The objectives of this report were to: (1) describe the illegal and prescription pharmaceuticals reported to the DAP; (2) determine if the drugs implicated in arrests changed from the first to latter half of 2016; (3) identify the demographic and other characteristics of arrestees; and (4) outline the strengths and limitations of the DAP for other areas considering implementing similar programs. Methods: The arrests (N = 2,368, 31.4% female, mean age = 33.7, SD = 9.9, Min = 18, Max = 71.5) reported to the DAP were examined. Drugs were classified by Drug Enforcement Administration Schedule (I-V, non-controlled prescription) and into families (opioids, stimulants, sedatives, hallucinogens, and other). A comparison between the first and second half of 2016 and arrest by county was completed. Results: Arrests involved 2,957 substances (drugs and paraphernalia). Most arrests (80.6%) involved a single drug. One-third (33.2%) of arrests involved illicit drugs (i.e. Schedule I) and three-fifths (59.8%) were for controlled prescription medical drugs (i.e. Schedule II-V), and a minority (6.8%) involved non-controlled prescription drugs (e.g. gabapentin, bupropion). Opioids (e.g. heroin, buprenorphine, and oxycodone) accounted for over-half (51.3%) of arrests followed by stimulants (29.0%, e.g. cocaine), and sedatives (7.6%). Arrests for oxycodone significantly decreased (51.9%) and alprazolam increased (89.3%) during 2016. Arrestees for non-controlled prescription drugs were older than arrestees for illegal drugs. Arrests, correcting for population, were most common in more urban (e.g. Androscoggin and Cumberland) counties. Conclusions: Opioids (illicit and prescription) account for over half of all arrests. However, arrests for oxycodone decreased while arrests for benzodiazepines, and especially alprazolam, increased in 2016. The DAP is a novel source of information for healthcare decisions and can empirically inform law enforcement about drug misuse and addiction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Piper B.J.,Suarez M.J.,Piserchio J.P.,Shah D.T.,Simoyan O.M.,McCall K.L.,Desrosiers C.E.,Nichols S.D.

This exploratory study investigated personal exposure to BTEX through environmental air and urine samples collected from 50 male workers at a major oil distribution company in Iran. Airborne BTEX exposures were evaluated over 8 h periods during work-shift by using personal passive samplers. Urinary BTEX levels were determined using solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography mass spectrometry for separation and detection. Mean exposure to ambient concentrations of benzene differed by workers' job type: tanker loading workers (5390 mug/m3), tank-gauging workers (830 mug/m3), drivers (81.9 mug/m3), firefighters (71.2 mug/m3) and office workers (19.8 mug/m3). Exposure across job type was similarly stratified across all personal exposures to BTEX measured in air samples with maximum concentrations found for tanker loading workers. Average exposures concentrations of BTEX measured in urine were 11.83 ppb benzene, 1.87 ppb toluene, 0.43 ppb ethylebenzene, and 3.76 ppb xylene. Personal air exposure to benzene was found to be positively associated with benzene concentrations measured in urine; however, a relationship was not observed to the other BTEX compounds. Urinary exposure profiles are a potentially useful, noninvasive, and rapid method for assessing exposure to benzene in a developing and relatively remote production region.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Heibati B.,Godri Pollitt K.J.,Charati J.Y.,Ducatman A.,Shokrzadeh M.,Karimi A.,Mohammadyan M.

1777,"Most patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (severe mental illness, SMI) are not violent in their lifetimes, however, a minority of patients are violent at some points in the course of their illness. As the illness appears relatively early in life, and typically runs a chronic course, the number of violent incidents caused by patients can be considerable in some cases. Due to the stigma toward SMI, the media often emphasize reporting of these incidents, which fuel the stigma even more. Although violent behavior is a common cause of concern for patients, their families and clinicians, it is not often discussed in scientific meetings. The purpose of this symposium is to bring this relatively neglected, but very important topic into the spotlight in SIRS, in order to summarize the latest evidence for clinicians and researchers, and to foster new work on reducing these risks of violence. Dr. Weiser will present an overview of the prevalence of violent behavior in patients with SMI, and will present a population-based, case-control study from Israel, showing increased rates of violent crime in patients with SMI, particularly in female patients and patients who abuse drugs. Secondary analyses will show increased rates of violent behaviour in siblings of patients as well. Dr. Fazel will present a systematic review on the prognostic (or predictive) accuracy of structured ways to assess violence risk in patients with severe mental illness, and present new work on a scalable and potentially useful predictive model of violent behaviour based on 75,000 patients in Sweden. Dr. Nijman will present a model based on patient, ward and staff variables focused on the causes and triggers of aggressive behavior on (locked) psychiatric wards. Based on this model, a number of preventive measures can be formulated. At the patient level, the administration of anti-psychotic medication is used to reduce the negative cognitive schemes and delusional thoughts that are depicted in the center of the model. A more novel intervention at the patient level may be the additional administration of nutritional supplements with (among others) high levels of omega 3 fatty acids. The results of two Dutch studies on this topic will be briefly presented in the lecture, among which a RCT on the effects of the use of nutritional supplements on aggressiveness. On the staff level, the use of short-term (daily) risks assessments by the ward nursing staff, among others by means of the six item BrOset Violence Checklist (BVC), has been found to reduce aggressiveness as well as the use of coercive measures on psychiatric wards in two cluster randomized RCTs. On the ward level, studies indicate that aggression on psychiatric wards can be reduced by preventing overcrowding on psychiatric wards, and by providing more space and privacy to the patients. Dr. Torrey will present data on rates of re-arrest in patients with SMI, showing that the average five-year re-arrest rate is approximately 40% for those released from psychiatric hospitals and 60% for those released from jails or prisons, and will present comparison data from other countries. He will then present data on the effect of extended conditional release, Forensic Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) teams, and Psychiatric Security Review Boards on re-arrest rates.","Weiser M.

1778,"OBJECTIVE: Traffic incidents occurring on roadways require the coordinated effort of multiple responder and recovery entities, including communications, law enforcement, fire and rescue, emergency medical services, hazardous materials, transportation agencies, and towing and recovery. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify and characterize transportation incident management (TIM)-related occupational fatalities; (2) assess concordance of surveillance data sources in identifying TIM occupations, driver vs. pedestrian status, and occupational fatality incident location; and (3) determine and compare U.S. occupational fatality rates for TIM industries., METHODS: The Kentucky Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) program analyzed 2005-2016 TIM occupational fatality data using multiple data sources: death certificate data, Collision Report Analysis for Safer Highways (CRASH) data, and media reports, among others. Literal text analysis was performed on FACE data, and a multiple linear regression model and SAS proc sgpanel were used to estimate and visualize the U.S. TIM occupational mortality trend lines and confidence bounds., RESULTS: There were 29 TIM fatalities from 2005 to 2015 in Kentucky; 41% of decedents were in the police protection occupation, and 21% each were in the fire protection and motor vehicle towing industries. Over one half of the TIM decedents were performing work activities as pedestrians when they died. Media reports identified the majority of the occupational fatalities as TIM related (28 of 29 TIM-related deaths); the use of death certificates as the sole surveillance data source only identified 17 of the 29 deaths as TIM related, and the use of CRASH data only identified 4 of the 29 deaths as TIM related. Injury scenario text analysis showed that law enforcement vehicle pursuit, towing and recovery vehicle loading, and disabled vehicle response were particular high-risk activities that led to TIM deaths. Using U.S. data, the motor vehicle towing industry had a significantly higher risk for occupational mortality compared to the fire protection and police protection industries., CONCLUSIONS: Multiple data sources are needed to comprehensively identify TIM fatalities and to examine the circumstances surrounding TIM fatalities, because no one data source in itself was adequate and undercounted the total number of TIM fatalities. The motor vehicle towing industry, in particular, is at elevated risk for occupational mortality, and targeted mandatory TIM training for the motor vehicle towing industry should be considered. In addition, enhanced law enforcement roadside safety training during vehicle pursuit and apprehension of suspects is recommended.","T L Bunn, S Slavova, M Chandler, N Hanner, M Singleton (2018//).

1779,"OBJECTIVES: Despite a policy of zero tolerance towards workplace violence (WPV) in Australian public hospital EDs, the incidence of WPV continues to increase. The aim of this study was to characterise security responses to WPV within an adult level 4 ED., METHODS: A retrospective single-centre review of episodes of WPV perpetrated by adults occurring within the ED was conducted between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015. Cases were identified using a prospectively recorded security register that records all events of security personnel attendance. The presence of police officers on initial presentation was the primary exposure variable., RESULTS: There were 1853 violent episodes committed by 1224 patients requiring security intervention during the study period, with half the episodes (n = 916; 49%) involving perpetrators who had committed at least two or more violent acts during the study period. Most cases (n = 1057, 57%; 95% CI: 55-59) occurred in the absence of police presence. Only 144 (7.8%) cases were managed by the presence of security personnel without physical security interventions., CONCLUSIONS: EDs should not rely on police response to prevent or handle violence. The finding of a high proportion of events being perpetrated by repeat offenders indicate that data sharing between EDs for identification of perpetrators of WPV can be useful for prevention of future episodes. ACEM policy for WPV in EDs should encompass further details on security credentialing and preventive strategies towards minimisation of WPV in the Australian EDs.

1780,"BACKGROUND: Call agents spend ~ 90% of their working day seated, which may negatively impact health, productivity, and wellbeing. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of a multi-component workplace intervention targeting increased activity and decreased prolonged sitting in the contact centre setting prior to a full-scale effectiveness trial., METHODS: An 8-week non-randomised pre-post feasibility study was conducted. Using a mixed methods approach, focus groups and interviews were thematically analysed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of key study phases, and provide context to agents' process evaluation and survey responses. The multi-component intervention, conducted in a single call centre, included height-adjustable workstations, emails, education and training sessions, and support from team leaders and a workplace champion., RESULTS: Six (of 20) team leaders were recruited, with 17 of 84 call agents (78% female, 39.3 +/- 11.9 years) completing baseline assessments and 13 completing follow-up. High workload influenced recruitment. Call agents perceived assessments as acceptable, though strategies are needed to enhance fidelity. Education sessions, height-adjustable workstations and emails were perceived as the most effective components; however, height-adjustable hot-desks were not perceived as feasible in this setting., CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified unique, pragmatic considerations for conducting a multi-level, multi-component PA and SB intervention and associated evaluation in highly sedentary call agents in the challenging contact centre setting. The intervention was largely perceived positively, with call agents and team leaders describing numerous perceived positive effects on behavioural, health and work-related outcomes.

1781,"PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to (1) determine the association between diet quality using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and cardiometabolic risk in a British working population and (2) identify employee characteristics associated with reporting a poorer quality dietary pattern., METHODS: British police employees enrolled (2007-2012) into the Airwave Health Monitoring Study (n = 5527) were included for sex-specific cross-sectional analyses. Dietary intakes were measured using 7-day food records. DASH score was calculated to determine diet quality. Logistic regression evaluated associations between (1) diet quality and increased cardiometabolic risk (defined as >= 3 risk markers: dyslipidaemia, elevated blood pressure, waist circumference, CRP or HbA1c), and (2) poor diet quality (lowest fifth of DASH score distribution) and employee characteristics., RESULTS: Employees recording a poor diet quality had greater odds (OR) of increased cardiometabolic risk independent of established risk factors (demographic, lifestyle and occupational) and BMI: men OR 1.50 (95% CI 1.12-2.00), women: OR 1.84 (95% CI 1.19-2.97) compared to the healthiest diet group. Characteristics associated with reporting a poor quality diet were employment in Scotland vs. England: men OR 1.88 (95% CI 1.53-2.32), women: OR 1.49 (95% CI 1.11-2.00), longer working hours (>= 49 vs. <=40 h) men: OR 1.53 (95% CI 1.21-1.92) women: OR 1.53 (95% CI 1.12-2.09). For men, job strain (high vs. low) was associated with reporting a poor diet quality OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.30-2.12)., CONCLUSIONS: The general population disparities in diet quality between England and Scotland were reflected in British police employees.

1782,"The primary objective of this study was to assess feasibility and gather preliminary outcome data on Mindfulness-Based Resilience Training (MBRT) for law enforcement officers. Participants (n=61) were randomized to either an 8-week MBRT course or a no intervention control group. Self-report and physiological data were collected at baseline, post-training, and three months following intervention completion. Attendance, adherence, post-training participant feedback, and interventionist fidelity to protocol all demonstrated feasibility of MBRT for law enforcement officers. Compared to no intervention controls, MBRT participants experienced greater reductions in salivary cortisol, self-reported aggression, organizational stress, burnout, sleep disturbance, and reported increases in psychological flexibility and non-reactivity at post-training; however, group differences were not maintained at three-month follow-up. This initial randomized trial suggests MBRT is a feasible intervention. Outcome data suggest MBRT targets key physiological, psychological, and health risk factors in law enforcement officers, consistent with the potential to improve officer health and public safety. However, follow-up training or ""booster"" sessions may be needed to maintain training gains. A fully powered longitudinal randomized trial is warranted. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

1783,"INTRODUCTION: Achieving adequate pain control for rib fractures remains challenging; prescription of alternatives to narcotics is imperative to curtail the current opioid epidemic. Although gabapentin has shown promise following elective thoracic procedures, its efficacy in patients with rib fractures remains unstudied. We hypothesized that gabapentin, as compared to placebo, would both improve acute pain control and decrease narcotic use among critically ill patients with rib fractures., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients admitted to the trauma surgery service from November 2016 - November 2017 at an urban, Level I trauma center with one or more rib fractures were randomized to either gabapentin 300mg thrice daily or placebo for one month following their injury. Daily numeric pain scores, opioid consumption, oxygen requirement, respiratory rate, and incentive spirometry recordings during the index admission, as well as and one-month quality of life survey data were abstracted., RESULTS: Forty patients were randomized. The groups were well matched with respect to age, gender, prior narcotic use, tobacco use, and prior respiratory disease. Although the median RibScore did not differ between groups, the gabapentin group had a higher median number of ribs fractured as compared to the placebo group (7 vs. 5, respectively). Degree of pulmonary contusion and injury severity score were similar between groups. Use of loco-regional anesthetic modalities did not differ between groups. Daily numeric pain scores, opioid consumption, oxygen requirement, respiratory rate, and incentive spirometry recordings were similar between both groups. No benefit was observed when adding gabapentin to a multi-modal analgesic regimen for rib fractures. There were no instances of pneumonia, respiratory failure, or mortality in either group. Hospital and intensive care unit length of stay were similar between groups. Both overall and chest-specific quality of life was equivalent between groups at one month follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: In this group of critically ill patients with rib fractures, gabapentin did not improve acute outcomes for up to one month of treatment.

1784,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of psychoactive substances is constantly increasing in developing countries, and all professional sectors are concerned. Taxi drivers are a particular target because of the dangerousness and complexity of their work. However, few studies have investigated toxic habits in this population., OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the use and misuse of addictive substances in taxi drivers and to appreciate poly-consumptions according to socio-demographic and occupational characteristics., METHODS: This cross-sectional study took place in five big cities during the second quarter of 2014, and was conducted amongst 2,927 taxi drivers who went through official, obligatory control areas on a daily basis. The questionnaire covered socio-demographic and occupational characteristics, toxic habits (tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and others psychotropic substances). The misuse was assessed by specific tests: Fagerstrom test for tobacco smoking, Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) and DETA (Diminuer, Entourage, Trop, Alcool) test for alcohol., RESULTS: The prevalence of consumption was 36.6% for smoking tobacco, 18.4% for cannabis, and 10.5% for alcohol. Amongst consumers, the prevalence of dependence or misuse was 36.6% for smoking tobacco, 37.2% for cannabis and 56.5% for alcohol. Fifty point three percent had no toxic habit, 35 % had one toxic habit, 11.5% had two toxic habits, 2.7% had three toxic habits and 0.6% had four toxic habits. The most frequent associations were tobacco-alcohol (6.8%) and tobacco-cannabis (4.1%)., CONCLUSIONS: The elaboration of the prevention approach needs a cooperative spirit. It will be more accepted and applied if all taxi drivers, their representatives and road safety officers are involved in its preparation.","Omar Laraqui, Salwa Laraqui, Nadia Manar, Tarik Ghailan, Reda Hammouda, Frederic Deschamps, Chakib El Houssine Laraqui (2018//).

We collected general socio-demographic information and administered the standardized Italian version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Management Standards Indicator Tool., RESULTS: We found the proportion of professionals with high-risk scores in the three dimensions of the MBI to be as follows: Emotional Exhaustion 32%, Depersonalisation 13% and Personal Accomplishment 9%. Overall, 14% of participants were at high risk of burnout. No significant differences were found between the three professional categories. Five subscales of the HSE were associated with burnout: Control (p < 0.01), Management support (p < 0.01), Relationship (p < 0.05), Role (p < 0.01), and Change (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Like all health care workers, rehabilitation professionals are at a high risk of burnout.

1786,"BACKGROUND: Migrant women are over-represented in the sex industry, and migrant sex workers experience disproportionate health inequities, including those related to health access, HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and violence. Despite calls for occupational sex work interventions situated in labour rights frameworks, there remains a paucity of evidence pertaining to migrant sex workers' needs and realities, particularly within Mexico and Central America. This study investigated migrant sex workers' narratives regarding the ways in which structural features of work environments shape vulnerability and agency related to HIV/STI prevention and violence at the Guatemala-Mexico border., METHODS: Drawing on theoretical perspectives on risk environments and structural determinants of HIV in sex work, we analyzed in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic fieldwork conducted with 39 migrant sex workers in indoor work environments between 2012 and 2015 in Tecun Uman, Guatemala., RESULTS: Participant narratives revealed the following intersecting themes to be most closely linked to safety and agency to engage in HIV/STI prevention: physical features of indoor work environments (e.g., physical layout of venue, proximity to peers and third parties); social norms and practices for alcohol use within the workplace; the existence and nature of management practices and policies on health and safety practices; and economic influences relating to control over earnings and clients. Across work environments, health and safety were greatly shaped by human rights concerns stemming from workplace interactions with police, immigration authorities, and health authorities., CONCLUSIONS: Physical isolation, establishment norms promoting alcohol use, restricted economic agency, and human rights violations related to sex work policies and immigration enforcement were found to exacerbate risks. However, some establishment policies and practices promoted 'enabling environments' for health and safety, supporting HIV/STI prevention, economic agency, and protection from violence and exploitation; these practices and policies were especially crucial for recent migrants. Policy reforms and structural workplace interventions tailored to migrant sex workers' needs are recommended to promote improved working conditions and migrant sex workers' health, safety, and human rights.","Shira M Goldenberg, Teresita Rocha Jimenez, Kimberly C Brouwer, Sonia Morales Miranda, Jay G Silverman (2018//).

1788,"This dissertation examines cardiovascular health (CVH) among Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers. CVH is defined by the American Heart Association (AHA) as the simultaneous presence of seven ideal factors; smoking status, body mass index, physical activity, healthy diet score, total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose. Cardiovascular diseases comprise the top causes of death in the United States, and because of this, the AHA has set forth a 2020 Impact Goal to improve the CVH of those in the United States by 20% while reducing mortality from cardiovascular events by 20%. The first aim of this dissertation was to compare overall CVH, and its individual components, between nationally-certified EMS professionals and the general population. Overall ideal CVH and ideal component CVH was found to be higher in EMS when compared to the general population. Specifically, EMS professionals were more likely to have ideal levels of physical activity, diet, cholesterol and fasting blood glucose. The second aim of this dissertation was to identify associations between work-life characteristics and CVH among EMS professionals. Some work-life characteristics were identified to be associated with ideal CVH. It was noted that as the number of EMS organizations at which the provider performed EMS work increased, overall CVH ii decreased. Those providers working in aeromedical services and those who reported conducting patient care had higher prevalence of ideal CVH when compared to other types of agency types and services. Lastly, those providers who were more highly satisfied with their main EMS job had a higher prevalence of ideal CVH when compared to those that were dissatisfied. The third aim of this dissertation was to identify associations between CVH and absenteeism among EMS professionals. A higher prevalence of workplace absenteeism was observed among first responders when compared to estimates from the general working population. Females self-reported a higher number of missed workdays when compared to males and as age increased, an increase in number of missed workdays and a decrease in ideal CVH was observed. Those individuals who were married reported fewer missed workdays and higher ideal CVH then those of other types of marital status. With respect to work-life characteristics, those EMS professionals practicing in an advanced life support setting (Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians and paramedics) reported greater average missed workdays than those working in a basic life support setting (Emergency Medical Responders and Emergency Medical Technicians). Lastly, as typical weekly call volume increased to did the reported absenteeism. Specific characteristics that were found to be associated with both absenteeism and CVH included sex, age, marital status, certification level and typical weekly call volume. This dissertation highlights the necessity for several areas of future research in both cardiovascular disease and occupational epidemiology. First, a longitudinal assessment of CVH and research into tailored public health interventions to increase the proportion of EMS providers with all seven ideal CVH components is needed. Second, an understanding of the causal relationship between CVH and health outcomes and job performance among EMS professionals is warranted. Since stressful work conditions are thought to exacerbate cardiovascular disease risk, additional workplace interventions to mitigate the negative consequences of providing prehospital emergency care may be needed. Lastly, a detailed assessment of the causal mechanisms linking CVH with workplace absenteeism is required to expand the understanding of the relationship between the EMS profession and overall health.

1791,"Cumulative stress is associated with 'wear and tear' on both the body and brain. Allostatic load is a lifespan measurement of chronic stressors, acute stressors, and daily hassles. Allostatic overload occurs when stress becomes toxic or managing stress becomes dysregulated. Individuals in allostatic overload are at risk for a variety of cardiovascular, immunological, respiratory, and psychological diseases. Allostatic overload is a risk factor for substance abuse, difficulties managing emotions, and challenges coping with future events. Military members experience extended periods of chronic stress. Service members in the National Guard experience additional work-life balances issues within their community as first responders for disasters and emergencies, additional federal requirements performing federal operations, and difficulties reintegrating back into to their community after combat. The Army recognized that service members have been overburdened with stress. Peer lead training programs have been implemented to address stress and coping. Meditation can be practiced almost anywhere and without a lot of training. A brief mindfulness of breath exercise was introduced to a small Wisconsin National Guard population. Breath counting was used to operationalize mindfulness to determine if coping, emotions, perceived stress, life stressors, life resources, drinking motives, and mindfulness reduced monthly alcoholic drinks consumed after the intervention was introduced. Mindfulness programs have exploded over the course of the last three decades. However, challenges have arisen in the best manner to operationalize mindfulness. State mindfulness was operationalized through the practice of breath counting meditation. Although the baseline models of allostatic stress measured the number of life events, deployments, and life stressors did not predict drinking outcomes thirty days prior to the intervention, the post-intervention model was significant and overall drinking quantities decreased.

Participants were working in forensic mental health and non‐forensic acute mental health settings. The 'Attitudes towards PRN medication use survey' was used and data were collected online. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package Social Sciences, Version 22.0. Practice differences between forensic and other acute mental health settings were identified related to the use of PRN medications to manage symptoms from nicotine, alcohol and other drug withdrawal. Differences related to the useage of comfort rooms and conducting comprehensive assessments of consumers' psychiatric symptoms were also detected. Qualitative findings highlighted the need for increased accountability for the prescribing and administration of PRN medications along with more nursing education/training to use alternative first line interventions. Nurses administering PRN medications should be vigilant regarding the indications for this practice to ensure they are facilitating the consumer's recovery by reducing the use of all forms of potentially restrictive practices in the hospital setting. The reasons for using PRN medications and PRN administration rates must be continually monitored to avoid practices such as high dose antipsychotics use and antipsychotic polypharmacy to ensure the efficacy of the consumers' management plans on their health care outcomes.

1794,"Background: Physiatrists have provided humanitarian assistance in recent large-scale global natural disasters. Super Typhoon Haiyan, the deadliest and most costly typhoon in modern Philippine history, made landfall on 8 November 2013 resulting in significant humanitarian needs. Methods: Philippine Academy of Rehabilitation Medicine physiatrists conducted a project of 23 emergency basic relief and medical aid missions in response to Super Typhoon Haiyan from November 2013 to February 2014. The final mission was a medical aid mission to the inland rural community of Burauen, Leyte. Summary data were collected, collated, and tabulated; project and mission evaluation was performed. Results: During the humanitarian assistance project, 31,254 basic relief kits containing a variety of food and non-food items were distributed and medical services including consultation, treatment, and medicines were provided to 7255 patients. Of the 344 conditions evaluated in the medical aid mission to Burauen, Leyte 85 (59%) were physical and rehabilitation medicine conditions comprised of musculoskeletal (62 [73%]), neurological (17 [20%]), and dermatological (6 [7%]) diagnoses. Post-mission and project analysis resulted in recommendations and programmatic changes to strengthen response in future disasters. Physiatrists functioned as medical providers, mission team leaders, community advocates, and in other roles. Conclusions: This physiatrist-led humanitarian assistance project met critical basic relief and medical aid needs of persons impacted by Super Typhoon Haiyan, demonstrating significant roles performed by physiatrists in response to a large-scale natural disaster. Resulting disaster programing changes and recommendations may inform a more effective response by PARM mission teams in the Philippines as well as by other South-Eastern Asia teams comprising rehabilitation professionals to large-scale, regional natural disasters.

1795,"Background: Physician’s intention to prescribe drugs could potentially be used to improve targeting of alcohol interventions and enhanced disease management to patients with a high risk of severe alcohol-related harm within outpatient settings. Methods: Comparison of ten-year incidence trajectories of 13.8 million reimbursed purchases of prescription drugs among 303,057 Finnish men and women of whom 7490 ultimately died due to alcohol-related causes (Alc+), 14,954 died without alcohol involvement (Alc−), and 280,613 survived until the end of 2007. Results: 5–10 years before death, 88% of the persons with an Alc+ death had received prescription medication, and over two-thirds (69%) had at least one reimbursed purchase of drugs for the alimentary tract and metabolism, the cardiovascular system, or the nervous system. Among persons with an Alc+ death, the incidence rate (IR) for purchases of hypnotics, and sedatives was 1.38 times higher (95% confidence interval (CI):1.32,1.44) compared to those with an Alc− death, and 4.07 times higher (95%CI:3.92,4.22) compared to survivors; and the IR for purchases of anxiolytics was 1.40 times higher (95%CI:1.34,1.47) compared to those with an Alc− death, and 3.61 times higher (95%CI:3.48,3.78) compared to survivors. Conclusions: Using physician’s intention to prescribe drugs affecting the alimentary tract and metabolism, cardiovascular system and nervous system could potentially be used to flag patients who might benefit from screening, targeted interventions or enhanced disease management. In particular, patients who are to be prescribed anxiolytics, hypnotics, and sedatives, and antidepressants may benefit from enhanced interventions targeted to problem drinking.

1796,"For the profession of firefighter, traumatic stress can be viewed as an occupational hazard. In the line of duty firefighters often face high risk situations leading to exposure to traumatic or stressful events. Resulting personal difficulties are often resolved without outside help, but appropriate mental health interventions can be the best approach for more difficult situations. The project draws from contemporary research to create a treatment program for mental health clinicians working with firefighters experiencing symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The treatment program uses concepts of trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy in conjunction with EEG guided neurofeedback training and focuses on presenting materials in a manner mindful of firefighter culture. The treatment program is intended to impact symptoms through confronting avoidance thoughts and behaviors and producing prolonged healthy brain wave patterns with neurofeedback training. Five mental health consultants with relevant clinical experience were recruited to evaluate the treatment program and provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Recommendations were integrated into the final version of the treatment program based on the logical reasoning behind a suggestion, the fitness of a recommendation into the overall vision of the treatment program, the feasibility of a suggested revision, and whether a revision harmonized with the cultural considerations identified in the literature review. This program can be further evaluated by future research with firefighters experiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress as feedback by expert consultants determined the treatment program to be an efficacious treatment intervention for a population more focused on helping others than asking for help.

1797,"Sleep disturbance is related to a variety of health issues and represents a prominent occupational concern among firefighters. Two potential predictors relevant to disturbed sleep are alcohol use and distress tolerance, which refers to the perceived ability to withstand negative emotional states. Main and interactive effects of alcohol use and distress tolerance on sleep disturbance were examined, after controlling for the covariates of service years and occupational stress. Participants included 652 firefighters (93.7% male; 77.9% white; Mage = 38.4 years), of whom 23.5% screened positive for hazardous alcohol use and 48.6% for disturbed sleep. Results indicated that higher alcohol misuse and lower distress tolerance were each significantly associated with greater sleep disturbance. Distress tolerance moderated the association between alcohol misuse and sleep disturbance, and the total model accounted for 28% of variance. Results indicate that firefighters with higher levels of hazardous alcohol use and lower levels of distress tolerance may exhibit higher levels of sleep disturbance.

1798,"Background: Trauma Aid UK (previously HAP UK &Ireland) conducted three EMDR trainings in Turkey: the first was in Istanbul on 28th November 2013. Aim: The purpose of this study is to assess the needs of the Syrian Refugees for trauma services training and provision as assesses by mental health professionals who work with them. Subjects and methods: Amongst the 62 participants of two Istanbul EMDR trainings organised by HAP, 53% were Syrian. We felt it is a unique opportunity to assess the needs of Syrian refugees they are working with. We asked all the participants who are all mental health professionals to complete an Arabic translation of 'The Need for Trauma-based Services Questionnaire' in these trainings. The rest of the participants on the course were from Iraq (18%), Jordan (16%), Egypt (7%) and others from Palestine, Sudan & Libya (6%). All participants completed questionnaires. Results: The results of comparing the needs reported by Syrian mental health professionals showed higher prevalence of PTSD seen by the Syrian mental health professionals (72% compared with 56% in the clients seen by the rest of participants). Also, the Syrian mental health professionals could only meet 34% (SD = 17.1) of the needs of their client who suffer from PTSD. The unmet need for trauma therapy was reported as 100% by these professionals. Conclusions: This study highlighted the high need for trauma mental health services of the Syrian refugees as reported by mental health professionals working in the neighbouring countries. The needs of the Syrian refugees, arriving to the UK because of the very difficult situations, these refugees are coming from, may be met with EMDR therapy. EMDR can be used to help these refugees to be a productive part of the British society.

1799,"Southeast Asia contains high numbers of traumatised populations arising from either natural disasters or interpersonal violence. Consequently, the need for empirically based trauma treatments, compromised by insufficiency in appropriately trained clinicians and mental health workers, makes the situation more challenging in addressing traumatic sequelae in local populations. In response, the humanitarian/ trauma capacity building organisation, Trauma Aid Germany, trained 37 therapists in psycho-traumatology, based on EMDR Therapy, which included trauma stabilisation techniques. This research analyses the impact of Trauma Stabilisation as a sole treatment intervention for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in adults. Each client was screened for PTSD utilising the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire - pre- and post-treatment. Analysis of the data considered only those interventions focussed on trauma stabilisation, including psychoeducation. Participants receiving trauma confrontation interventions were excluded from the data. Trauma stabilisation - as a sole treatment intervention, was highly effective in alleviating PTSD diagnoses. Results demonstrate PTSD symptoms were reduced in both clinical and sub-clinical trauma groups. The data set suggests trauma stabilisation, as a sole treatment intervention, was safe, effective, efficient and sufficient treatment intervention for PTSD. Furthermore, trauma stabilisation interventions have the advantage of being safe, flexible, and adaptable to the cultural and spiritual context in which they were are applied. The research findings also have implications regarding teaching and learning and the potential utilisation of paraprofessionals, and other allied health professionals in addressing the global burden of psychological trauma.","C.
