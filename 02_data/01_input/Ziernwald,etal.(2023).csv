1,Predictors of Performance on an iPad-Based Reading Comprehension Intervention among Spanish-Speaking Dual Language Learners at Risk for Reading Comprehension Delays,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the EMBRACE Spanish support intervention for at-risk dual language learners and to determine which verbal and nonverbal characteristics of students were related to benefit from the intervention. The first study examined oral language and reading characteristics and the second study examined motor characteristics in predicting the children's outcomes on a reading comprehension intervention. Method: Fifty-six participants in 2nd-5th grade were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Spanish-support intervention, or 2) Spanish-support control. Outcome measures 1d performance on comprehension questions related to intervention texts, questions on the final narrative and expository text without strategy instruction, and difference scores on alternate forms of the Gates-MacGinitie (GMRT-4, MacGinitie, MacGinitie, Maria, & Dreyer, 2002) reading comprehension subtest administered pre- post-intervention. Multi-level hierarchical linear models were used to account for nesting of question within child within classroom. Regression models were used to examine the power of motor predictors in predicting Spanish and English language performance. Results: Results from study 1 indicated that the intervention was most effective for narrative (vs. expository) texts and easy (vs. more difficult) texts. Dual language learners (DLLs) with lower initial English reading comprehension abilities benefitted more from the intervention than those with stronger reading skills. Results: Results from Study 2 indicated that oral fine motor abilities predicted Spanish (but not English) oral language abilities in the expected direction (i.e. faster performance associated with higher language scores). The speed of /pata/ productions predicted reading comprehension during the intervention, but not in the expected direction (i.e. slower speeds associated with higher accuracy). Manual fine motor performance on tapping tasks was not related to language or reading. Conclusions: The EMBRACE intervention has promise for use with at-risk DLLs. Future research should take care to match text difficulty with child skills so as to maximize benefit from the intervention. Oral fine motor abilities were related to language abilities in DLLs, but only for the native language. Slower oral fine motor performance predicted higher accuracy on intervention questions, suggesting that EMBRACE may be particularly effective for children with weak fine motor skills.

2,Strategic Production of Predictive Inferences During Comprehension,"Although some types of inferences are mandatory for readers, predictive inferences (inferences for what will happen next) are generally considered elaborative or optional. Three experiments measuring probe word lexical decision latencies produced evidence for the online generation of predictive inferences during narrative text comprehension. Participants read passages that were designed to elicit inferences about what would happen next at a certain point in the story. Immediately following the point at which the inference was anticipated (the inference-generating sentence), a lexical decision probe word was presented that was related to the expected inference. Lexical decision latencies were shorter for probes related to the inference but only when the comprehension task encouraged prediction as a reading strategy. The results support the hypothesis that the production of predictive inferences is relatively strategy dependent.",Computer Assisted Testing; Inferences; Measures (Individuals); Prediction; reading comprehension; Reading strategies; Vocabulary,"Allbritton, David",2004.0,,1,2
3,International mindfulness instructional design (IMID): Podcasting impact on Florida Latino-American college online reading scores,"The previously untested effect of animated podcasting employed as an online reading instructional strategy was quantitatively tested on Florida Latino college student online reading comprehension. The problem addressed whether podcasting, incorporating mindfulness, as an online instructional strategy might have an effect on students' reading comprehension. Using a quasi-experimental design, students were assigned to intervention and comparison groups, each consisting of at least 30 U.S.-born male Latinos, 30 U.S.-born female Latinas, 30 foreign-born male Latinos, and 30 foreign-born female Latinas. The study's three overarching research questions asked, first, whether there would be a main effect in reading comprehension scores of podcast intervention participants as compared to non-intervention participants, regardless of their gender and ethnicity; second, if there would be an interaction between intervention and ethnicity; and third, if there would be a three way interaction between gender, ethnicity and intervention. The Online Reading Assessment (ORA), was used as the data collection instrument for participating students in both intervention and comparison groups. The ORA was chosen as it assessed the reader's ability to arrange and synopsize the writing and to interpret visual charts or other information, all study skills deemed essential for college reading. The study hoped to find a main effect in the online reading comprehension scores of Latino college students receiving the podcast intervention as compared to their peers not receiving it regardless of their gender and ethnicity, as well as a possible interaction effect between ethnicity and intervention; and a three way interaction between intervention, ethnicity and gender. The results showed no statistical main effect on the reading comprehension of online Latino students enrolled in blended and online courses in a Florida college that received this study's podcasting intervention and those who did not. However, a statistical interaction between intervention and ethnicity as well as a three-way interaction between intervention, ethnicity and gender, were shown. Consistent with prior recommendations found in the literature, this study recommended additional podcasting instructional strategy research in this newly developing medium. Given female Latina academic underperformance to male Latinos, this recommendation 1d research on interactions arising in podcasting between intervention, ethnicity and gender.

4,Supporting Reading Comprehension of At-Risk Pre-Adolescent Readers through the Use of Text-to-Speech Technology Paired with Strategic Instruction,"This research highlighted the use of text-to-speech technology and current shifts in strategy-based reading instruction in order to address the comprehension needs of struggling pre-adolescent readers. The following questions were posed: (a) Does reading comprehension of preadolescent struggling readers improve as the direct result of using text-to-speech technology to circumvent weaknesses in word decoding? and (b) What is the additive effect in the reading comprehension when question generation and use of topic sentences are paired with text-to-speech technology? This single-case research was an ABC design with multiple baselines. The project's dependent variables were (a) pre- post-standardized testing using WIAT (1992) subtests, (b) reading probes using curricular content, and (c) intervention data computed from the summarization of main ideas. Results demonstrated that using text-to-speech alone increased comprehension in all 5 participants and when combined with specific reading strategies, there was an additive treatment effect in 4 out of 5 participants.

5,Short-and long-term effects of students’ self-directed metacognitive prompts on navigation behavior and learning performance,"This study seeks to promote learning in computer-based learning environments utilizing students’ self-directed metacognitive prompts. Such prompts are based on the idea of instructing students to design their own metacognitive scaffolds and learn with them afterward. In a pre-post experimental design, students in the experimental group (n = 35) were instructed to configure their own metacognitive prompts before learning whereas students in the control group (n = 35) learned without prompts. Log file analysis of navigation behavior indicates that students who learned with their individually designed, self-directed prompts visited relevant webpages significantly more often and spent a longer time on them compared with students in the control group. Moreover, participants in the experimental group attained better transfer performance immediately after learning. The long-term effect in transfer performance was even greater in a follow-up learning session conducted after three weeks without any instructional support in either group. These results are consistent with theories of metacognition and self-regulated learning and indicate that self-directed prompts can lead to sustainable effects.

6,"Scaffolding expository history text reading: Effects on adolescents' comprehension, self-regulation, and motivation","Reading comprehension is an important predictor for academic success, yet many adolescents in secondary education face difficulties when reading their textbooks. In this quasi-experimental study, we developed a digital learning environment to scaffold students' expository text reading in seventh-grade history classrooms. Students in the experimental condition could use hints comprised of cognitive and metacognitive reading strategy instruction, whereas students in the control condition received no additional support. A comparison of posttest comprehension between conditions showed no significant differences. However, students in the experimental condition who accessed hints during history text reading performed significantly better on the posttest than students who did not use hints at all. We found no differences between conditions regarding students' self-regulated learning or motivation, but students' awareness of problem-solving reading strategies significantly increased in the experimental condition. Finally, a comparison of students with different reading levels showed that below-average readers benefitted most from digital reading practice.

7,"Second-Grade Urban Learners: Preliminary Findings for a Computer-Assisted, Culturally Relevant, Repeated Reading Intervention","This study investigated the effects of a multicomponent, supplemental intervention on the reading fluency of second-grade African-American urban students who showed reading and special education risk. The packaged intervention combined repeated readings and culturally relevant stories, delivered through a novel computer software program to enhance oral reading fluency and comprehension. A concurrent multiple probe experimental design across seven participants was used to assess intervention effects. Results showed a positive effect on both practiced and novel passages during intervention and on the 2-week and 1-month maintenance probes. Further, reading growth rates for the participants exceeded the growth rates for comparison peers on AIMSweb assessments. This study supports previous research on the beneficial effects of repeated reading strategies and computer delivered instruction. The link between fluency and comprehension was further supported in these findings. The possible relative effects of the use of culturally relevant material as well as study limitations are discussed.

8,The effects of a computer-assisted and culturally relevant repeated reading intervention on the oral reading fluency of second grade students at-risk,"This study examined the effects of a novel computer software program on the oral reading fluency and comprehension of urban second-grade students. The students scored at the 'at-risk' level on the DIBELS oral reading fluency fall benchmark assessment. A multiple baseline probe across participants design was used to determine if the repeated reading strategy using culturally relevant materials delivered through the computer software would increase participant oral reading fluency and comprehension. Oral reading fluency was measured by correct words per minute and comprehension was measured by responses to maze passages on both treatment and generalization probes. Seven second-grade students from two different schools were participants in the study and three students were tested as comparison peers. Participants were separated into four tiers and scheduled treatment according to skill level. Students in Tier 1, who showed the most deficits in correct words per minute as measured by AIMSweb, received treatment first and the remaining tiers were assigned accordingly. There were five participants (Tiers 1–3) and two comparison peers in one school and two participants (Tier 4) and one comparison peer in the other school. Comparison peers, who were closer to grade level, remained in extended baseline. Tier 1 entered into intervention when the participants' baseline data were stable. After analysis of Tier 1 responding to the CR timed readings, and analysis of baseline of the next tier, intervention began for Tier 2, and so on until all tiers were in intervention. Pre-and post-test measures were administered to all students and consisted of Woodcock Reading Mastery Test – Revised subtests of word attack, word identification, and passage comprehension. DIBELS oral reading fluency benchmark assessment data was provided by the teachers for beginning of the year and middle of the year and administered by researchers for end of the year. During baseline, treatment, and maintenance conditions, data were collected on the following dependent variables: correct words per minute on culturally relevant stories; correct responses to mazes on CR stories; number of timed readings needed to reach criteria on each culturally relevant story; correct words per minute on AIMSweb stories; and correct responses to mazes on AIMSweb stories. Treatment probes were given after each story sequence was successfully completed and generalization probes were given approximately every two to three treatment probes except when participants consistently took 2–3 sessions to finish a story, in which case they were given a generalization probe every five stories (i.e., after each set). There were a total of 24 culturally relevant stories/treatment probes and 25 generalization passages were available (between 14–20 were used for participants; 7 were used for comparison peers). Results indicate that after 7–13 weeks the packaged intervention was effective on increasing the oral reading fluency and comprehension of practiced culturally relevant passages for all participants. The intervention was also effective on increasing the oral reading fluency and comprehension on six of the participants on novel AIMSweb passages. These findings extend the research base supporting the use of repeated readings for second-grade students via computer-assisted instruction to supplement instruction. Further, the findings suggest that skill acquisition and generalization might be promoted by the use of culturally relevant materials. Limitations, directions for future research, and implications for practice are offered.

9,The contribution of text-highlighting to comprehension: A comparison of print and digital reading,"The use of digital materials in educational settings is common, despite evidence indicating that comprehension of digital text is inferior to comprehension of printed text. A potential solution to this problem is to use learning strategies for deeper text processing. Text-highlighting is a strategy known to improve comprehension of printed text; however, its contribution to digital reading comprehension is not clear. A between-subjects design was used to examine the influence of active text-highlighting on the comprehension of a college-level expository text, displayed either in print or digitally. Results for the without-highlighting condition replicated previous findings of inferior comprehension of the digital text relative to the printed one. When participants were instructed to use text-highlighting, performance improved only in the printed condition. Specifically, text-highlighting improved accuracy on questions that required inferential processing, but it did not affect performance on literal questions. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the highlighting patterns in each media did not explain the differential effect of text-highlighting on comprehension in these settings. These findings bring into question the usefulness of text-highlighting as an effective strategy for learning from digital text. Thus, emphasizing the need for more systematic research on the effectiveness of traditional learning strategies in digital contexts.

10,The effects of concept mapping and questioning on students' organization and retention of science knowledge while using interactive informational read-alouds,"According to recent assessment data, there is an urgent need to improve students’ knowledge of science. It has been suggested that the infusion of reading activities including concept mapping, questioning and interactive read-alouds can help students in learning science concepts. Little or no research has combined these methods to examine its effect on learning. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare concept mapping and questioning on students’ organization and retention of science knowledge when used with interactive informational read-alouds of science trade books. This study 1d 58 third grade students from four homogenous classes who were assigned to either a concept mapping group (experimental group) or a questioning with writing group (comparison group). With the same teacher, the school science specialist, the students completed an eight day unit regarding 'soil formation' comprised of read-alouds, discussions and reading comprehension activities. (There were no hands-on, laboratory experiments.) Students were assessed on different types of knowledge. Data were analyzed using a mixed model ANOVA design to determine both within-factors (repeated measure), to show growth, and between-factors, to determine the difference between the two groups. The concept mapping group (experimental group) performed significantly higher than the questioning with writing group (comparison) on (a) relational vocabulary assessment (measuring relational knowledge); (b) multiple-choice assessment (measuring students’ ability to identify key ideas); and (c) writing assessment (measuring students’ relational thinking, students’ ability to retain and recall key information and students’ ability to use domain knowledge). The concept mapping group maintained these gains in a delayed assessment. The groups did not differ on individual word knowledge as measured by a matching assessment. Recommendations are provided for teachers and researchers including using concept mapping in teaching science concepts to elementary students in conjunction with science text reading, as well as incorporating technology with computer-generated concept maps using Inspiration software.

11,"What Animated Illustrations Conditions Can Improve Technical Document Comprehension in Young Students? Format, Signaling and Control of the Presentation","We study the comprehension of a multimedia technical document about gear functioning by young pupils. The research is focused on the effect of three factors on the construction of a mental model: illustration format (animated versus static) signaling cues (presence versus absence) learner-control of information delivery (three rhythms of presentation: speed, slow and self-controlled). The experimental procedure, conducted with 123 children, follows three phases: pre-test, individual passation of the lesson, comprehension test, delayed post-test. The goal of the pre-test is the evaluation of prior knowledge about gears, but also the control of spatial and verbal working memory aptitude and reading performance. The results show an effect of the animated format, of signaling cues and of the rhythm on the immediate comprehension test and delayed test. For the immediate comprehension test, these effects are different according to the kind of comprehension question (recall, transfer, explanation). These effects are maintained at the delayed post-test, for the self-controlled condition and for the pupils with low prior knowledge. The factor information delivery rhythm shows an effect for the delayed post-test. Our observation device of the behaviour of the child during the lesson was specially designed to explore the reading strategies between the medias.

12,"Labette Community College, Parsons, Kansas. PLATO Evaluation Series","Labette Community College (LCC), Parsons, Kansas, a public comprehensive community college, received a 5-year Title III grant from the U.S. Department of Education to strengthen their academic programs through the implementation of computer-assisted basic skills instruction coupled with a comprehensive retention program. To study the progress being made toward Title III goals, LCC requested that PLATO conduct a preliminary evaluation of their use of the PLATO reading and writing curricula as a support for their basic writing and reading improvement classes. This report 1s an analysis of data from the fall 1999-spring 2000 academic year and fall 2000. Results of this preliminary evaluation reveal that the inclusion of computer assisted technology in the redesigned reading  and writing courses is an important component of students' success. Mandatory computer lab time was positively related to the students' success in Basic Writing I classes. With the Compass test used for pretest and posttest, students posted an average gain of nearly 56 points. Fourteen of the 19 students received passing scores on the posttest (74%). In Basic Writing II, in which computer study was optional, students posted an average gain of only 10.95 points, and the range of achievement gains was much wider. In Basic Reading I, which used PLATOs Advanced Reading Strategies and Reading for Information, students demonstrated a 46 point increase in pass rates when compared with data from fall 1999, a pass rate increase of 20% to 66%.

13,Optimal Experience and Reading Achievement in Virtual Environments among College Level Developmental Readers,"In this mixed methods study the potential for developmental readers to experience optimal experience (flow) within the multi-user virtual environment, ""Second Life,"" was examined. In an educational context, ""Second Life"" provided a space for constructivist learning, socialization, exploration, discovery and creativity. The communicative, social nature of virtual learning also allowed students to demonstrate cognitive and affective skills they had acquired through their utilization of social technologies. This applied, situated learning environment has great potential for generating situational interest, the springboard for motivation.    The purpose of this study was to determine. (a) the digital literacy skills of college-level developmental readers; (b) the differences in digital literacies between those college-level developmental reading students who used ""Second Life"" and those college- level developmental reading students who did not use ""Second Life""; (c) the relationships between optimal experience and reading achievement; (d) the behaviors exhibited by students that indicated the degree to which they were a digital native; and (e) the antecedents of flow as reported by college-level developmental reading students using ""Second Life.""    Participants were 80 students enrolled in developmental reading in the fall 2009 semester--38 participants comprised the control group, and 42 students comprised the experimental group. Research findings indicated that the participants were digitally literate. This digital literacy was demonstrated through reading activities in ""Second Life,"" where the optimal experience construct, enjoyment, led to increased reading achievement gains among the experimental group over the control group who did not use ""Second Life."" Developmental reading administrators and educators would be well-informed to capitalize on these unique learning environments with activities that require practice in collaboration, self-regulation, time management skills, and most importantly, critical reading skills.

14,Effects of timing of formative feedback in computer‐assisted learning environments,"This study examines the effects of timing of corrective formative feedback on processing text information on question‐answering. Undergraduate students read an expository text and answered questions in two attempts. Students were randomly assigned to a no feedback, immediate feedback and delayed feedback conditions. Students in the feedback conditions received feedback on the correctness of their answer after the first attempt and were informed about the right answer after the second attempt. Students were prompted to restudy the text after failing in their first attempt. However, students in the no feedback condition were just prompted to search the text. All students were tested on question‐answering, corrective probability and a post‐test cued‐recall test. Results showed that: (a) feedback reduced the initial time reading the text; (b) feedback increased performance on question answering and cued‐recall; (c) delayed feedback produced no advantages over immediate feedback. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.

All participants had the text available to search for the answer. Results indicated that high-level questions facilitated deep comprehension but not immediate performance or delayed recall of text, independently of the reading condition, and that high- and low-level questions differentially affected text-inspection patterns.

17,Enhancing digital reading performance with a collaborative reading annotation system,"As children now spend considerable time reading electronic media, digital reading skills and good reading comprehension are essential. However, many studies agree that screen-based reading leads to shallow reading, short attention spans, and poor comprehension. Therefore, this work presents a collaborative reading annotation system with a reading annotation and interactive discussion scaffold (CRAS-RAIDS) for improving reading performance in collaborative digital reading environments. This study used a quasi-experimental design. Fifty-three Grade 5 students were recruited from two classes of an elementary school in Taoyuan County, Taiwan. One class was randomly designated the experimental group used the proposed CRAS-RAIDS support for collaborative reading. The other class was designated the control group and used the traditional paper-based reading annotation method and face-to-face discussions. The two groups were then compared in terms of reading attitude, reading comprehension, and use of reading strategy in an active reading context. Analytical results show that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in direct and explicit comprehension, inferential comprehension performance, and use of reading strategy. Moreover, the experimental group, but not the control group, had a significantly improved reading attitude in the total dimensions and in the behavioral and affective sub-dimensions. Additionally, the experimental group showed positive interest and high learning satisfaction.

18,A collaborative reading annotation system with formative assessment and feedback mechanisms to promote digital reading performance,"The collaborative reading annotation system (CRAS) has been proved its success in promoting reading performance in comparison with traditional paper-based reading. However, there is still lack of an effective formative assessment and feedback mechanisms in the CRAS, which can assist learners to promote their self-regulated learning and reflection. Therefore, this study uses C4.5 decision tree to develop a CRAS with formative assessment and feedback mechanisms (CRAS-FAFM) based on four considered social network indicators, which could forecast the learners with low reading comprehension and suggest them to interact with the learners who are predicted with high reading comprehension performance and infrequently interact in the digital reading activity in order to enhance their reading comprehension through interactive discussion. Accordingly, this study intends to discuss the effects of learners who use the CRAS-FAFM and CRAS without formative assessment and feedback mechanisms (CRAS-NFAFM) on reading comprehension performance and interactive discussion. A total of 55 students from two classes of a Taiwan’s primary school participated in the experiment. One class of students was randomly assigned as the experimental group using the CRAS-FAFM to support digital reading while the remaining class was randomly assigned as the control group using the CRAS-NFAFM. Analytical results show that the average prediction accuracy rate of the developed CRAS-FAFM in identifying the learners with low reading comprehension performance is as high as 68.33%. Moreover, compared to CRAS-NFAFM, the CRAS-FAFM provides remarkable benefits in promoting the reading comprehension performance and interactive discussion on the discussion level of comparison, discussion, and analysis, particularly for the learners with low prior knowledge.

19,A web-based collaborative reading annotation system with gamification mechanisms to improve reading performance,"This study presents a web-based collaborative reading annotation system (WCRAS) with gamification mechanisms to motivate students' annotations behaviors and promote students' reading comprehension performance. The research participants were 55 fifth grade students from two classes of an elementary school in northeastern Taiwan. A quasi-experimental design was adopted to evaluate the effects of the experimental and control groups respectively using WCRAS with and without gamification mechanisms to support digital reading on students' annotation behaviors, collaborative interaction relationship, reading comprehension performance, and immersion experience. The results showed that the experimental group made significantly more annotations across almost all types of reading annotations and response annotations and had a significantly higher degree of immersive experience and social interaction than the control group. However, the difference in reading comprehension performance between the two groups has not been found. In addition, although the experimental group provided more amounts of high-quality annotations, the group did not generate more quantity of annotations related to reading comprehension aspects assessed by PIRLS. These research findings indicate that a gap between the promotion of the quantity and quality of participation and learning outcomes exists. This study is significant to address the need that designs the gamification mechanisms to encourage high-quality annotations that can effectively enhance students’ reading comprehension.

20,Facilitating English-language reading performance by a digital reading annotation system with self-regulated learning mechanisms,"Since English has been an international language, how to enhance English levels of people by useful computer assisted learning forms or tools is a critical issue in non-English speaking countries. Past studies confirmed that reading articles with annotated contents enable knowledge sharing and improve the reading comprehension of learners. However, the self-regulated learning (SRL) ability of individual learners when reading learning materials and contributing annotations becomes a key factor affecting reading performance. Thus, this work proposes a SRL mechanism combined with a digital reading annotation system (DRAS) to enhance Grade 7 students to generate rich and high-quality annotations for promoting English-language reading performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, this work adopts a quasi-experimental design to assess an experimental group and control group learners who respectively use the proposed DRAS with and without the SLR mechanisms when reading English-language texts online. Compared with the control group learners, experimental results demonstrate that the reading comprehension and reading annotation abilities of the experimental group learners were significantly improved. Analytical results also confirm that gender differences in reading comprehension and annotation ability existed when using the proposed DRAS with and without the SRL mechanisms to read English-language texts online. Experimental results also show that significant differences existed in the reading comprehension and annotation abilities of learners with good and poor SRL abilities in the experimental group. Additionally, the reading annotation ability of learners in the experimental group was significantly correlated with reading comprehension.

21,Development and evaluation of a novel e-book interface for scaffolding thinking context to learn from writing examples,"Effective reading strategies, including using graphic organizers, question answering, and considering story structures, can help students improve reading comprehension. However, these reading strategies are not fully supported by both printed books and e-books. Students who master these reading strategies can learn effectively. By contrast, students without effective reading strategies cannot grasp thinking contexts, which leads to unfavorable learning outcomes. This paper presents a novel e-book interface that features thinking maps and a question answering mechanism on the same page. The thinking maps and question answering mechanism can stimulate students to reflect on reading content, which in this study was college entrance exam compositions, and help students to more effectively understand the context of their reading content. After we developed our reading system, 61 participants were recruited for system evaluation. The results indicate that students in the treatment group acquired significantly more vocabulary and understood the story structure more competently than did students in the control group. Treatment group participants expressed that they were satisfied with the thinking maps and question answering mechanism.

22,Metacomprehension monitoring and regulation in reading comprehension,"Metacomprehension monitoring and regulation are central to self-regulated comprehension. Metacomprehension monitoring, which refers to the process of monitoring learning from text, is important for goal setting, planning and the regulation of reading strategies in reading comprehension. Lots of researches have been conducted to investigate whether metacognitive judgments are, indeed, accurate. In paired-associate learning, monitoring accuracy can be improved in a variety of ways. However, monitoring accuracy is far less impressive when the task involves reading written texts; the mean Gamma correlation is quite low. One of the purposes in this study is to investigate how to improve the accuracy of monitoring and whether or not that metacomprehension accuracy is higher for delayed-keyword group than for immediate-keyword group and no-keyword group. One of the key issues in the study of metacognition is how people use metacognitive judgments to adjust, strategize, and maximize learning, so it is important to find out that which factors can enhance the accuracy of metacomprehension monitoring and whether accurate monitoring can provide a basis for making decisions about what to restudy or how long to study. The most important issue in this study is to investigate whether superior accuracy could lead to more effective regulation of study (i.e., participants choose to reread less learned texts over better learned texts to a greater degree), and whether this could produce greater test performance. 59 college students participated in this experiment. The participants were divided into 3 groups, delayed keyword group, immediate keyword group, and no keyword group. The materials were six expository texts (from 987 to 1180 Chinese characters). Each text was followed by 12 questions (6 detail questions and 6 inference questions). Participants all read the six texts on a computer LCD monitor. Then they rated comprehension on a 1-7 scale and took a comprehension test on each text after generate keywords. All the participants were asked to select some texts for restudy, and again tested on each text. Half of these questions were the same as those given on test 1, and the others questions were new. The result showed that metacomprehension accuracy, which was operationalized as the Gamma correlation between a person’s judgment ratings and his or her criterion test performance, was higher when students wrote keywords after a delay than immediate wrote keywords and did not write keywords. The participants in the delayed keyword group were more likely to select less learned texts over better-learned texts to reread than in the immediate keyword group, and no keyword group. The importance of monitoring accuracy to control and their impacts on test were also analyzed by comparing test performance among three groups cross two texts and test2 performance for texts that were selected versus that were not selected for rereading. A substantial increase in performance across two test trials for the delayed-keyword group was found. By contrast, performance was decreased for the others groups. These results are important because they showed not only accurate monitoring was achievable, but also accurate monitoring may improve test performance via effective regulation (i.e., chose the right texts for re-study). Given our results, it seems reasonable to conclude that metacomprehension monitoring affects metacomprehension control, in turn, affects the text comprehension.

23,Designing for diversity: The role of reading strategies and interactive vocabulary in a digital reading environment for fifth-grade monolingual English and bilingual students,"This study examined the relative contribution of reading comprehension strategies and interactive vocabulary in Improving Comprehension Online (ICON), a universally designed web-based scaffolded text environment designed to improve fifth-grade monolingual English and bilingual students’ reading achievement. Seventy-five monolingual English and 31 bilingual students from six classrooms were assigned to one of three ICON conditions: reading comprehension strategies, vocabulary, or a combined version of comprehension strategies and vocabulary. Students read eight multimedia folktales and informational texts within their respective ICON condition and completed embedded activities, researcher measures of comprehension and vocabulary, and pre- and postintervention standardized reading achievement tests. ANCOVA results indicated that after controlling for initial reading achievement, there was a main effect for condition on the researcher measure of vocabulary, with the combination group and vocabulary groups both significantly outperforming the strategy group. There was also an interaction effect, with differences between monolingual and bilingual Spanish-speaking students greatest in the strategy group. There was no effect of condition on comprehension, nor was there an effect of language status on narrative comprehension. However, there was a main effect of language status on expository text comprehension and standardized vocabulary achievement, with monolingual students performing more strongly than bilingual Spanish-speaking students. The results add to a growing body of research on the design and use of scaffolded digital text for diverse learners.

24,A Comparison of Reading Response Methods to Increase Student Learning,"It is common in college courses to test students on the required readings for that course. With a rise in online education it is often the case that students are required to provide evidence of reading the material. However, there is little empirical research stating the best written means to assess that students read the materials. This study experimentally compared the effect of assigned reading summaries or study questions on student test performance. The results revealed that study questions produced higher quiz scores and higher preparation for the quiz, based on student feedback. Limitations of the study 1d a small sample size and extraneous activities that may have affected general knowledge on a topic. Results suggest that study questions focusing students on critical information in the required readings improve student learning.",Academic Achievement; Comparative Analysis; Electronic Learning; Feedback (Response); Graduate Students; Higher Education; Outcome Measures; Predictor Variables; Questioning Techniques; Reader Response; Reading; Reading Achievement; Reading Assignments; Reading Materials; Research Design; Scores,"Davis, Cheryl J.; Zane, Thomas",2016.0,,1,24
25,A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Reading Intervention Effectiveness in the Community College,"The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to determine if, when implemented at one two-year post-secondary institution, such K-12 reading comprehension strategies as concept mapping, think-aloud protocols, and Question-Answer Relationships (QAR) elicit change in COMPASS reading test scores of adult readers. Data was collected over four academic semesters at one two-year post-secondary institution. Pre- and post-test scores were compared using SPSS© software. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Interviews with community college developmental reading teachers were conducted and coded for themes emerging from the data. Data indicated that while statistical significance did not occur, the numerical difference is noteworthy. The researched developmental reading intervention strategies did improve COMPASS post-test scores for a greater percentage of students in the experimental group than those students in the control group. From these two improvements the researcher was able to conclude that the researched developmental reading intervention strategies infused into the traditional developmental curriculum caused students to improve. Interviews with community college developmental reading teachers supported and expanded these finding. Additional conclusions concerning intervention strategies, barriers to success, and the success of developmental reading courses are discussed.

26,"The effect of goal orientation on attention, learning, and metacognitive awareness","An experimental study was conducted to examine whether achievement goals affect attention, comprehension, and metacognition. One hundred and twenty undergraduate students enrolled in introductory educational psychology classes participated. Students were randomly assigned to one of four goal groups (mastery, performance approach, performance avoidance, or control group) and one of three question groups (emotions, brain, and no questions). The study was conducted in two sessions. First, students were given a reading test, and questionnaires to measure their prior knowledge and personal goals. Second, students read the text on a computer. Then they completed an interest questionnaire, a manipulation check, a post test and an interview to assess their metacognition. A 4 (Type of Goal Instruction: mastery, performance approach, performance avoidance, and control) X 3 (Type of Questions: emotion, brain, and no questions) X 3 (Type of Text Segment Information: emotion, brain, and neutral) mixed factorial design was used. Type of goal instruction and type of questions were between subject factors; type of text segment information was a within-subject factor. The dependent measures were attention, comprehension, and metacognitive awareness. Personal goal orientation, prior knowledge, and reading ability were covariates. The analyses were conducted in seven parts: (1) a series of repeated measures ANOVAs were ran as general analyses, (2) causal analyses was used to determine whether attention mediated the relationship between goals and learning, (3) Attention data were analyzed to determine when participants became aware, (4) ANOVAs were ran to examine whether there were differences among goal groups on metacognition, (5) interview data were examined to determine whether participants differed on reading strategy use after they became metacognitively aware, (6), standard regression was conducted to test whether metacognition affected the amount of time spent on salient and non-salient text information, and (7) path analysis was used to test whether metacognition was a causal mediating variable between goals and learning. Results show that the attention was a partial mediating variable between goals and learning; metacognition mediated goals and learning; a mastery goal leads to better metacognition; and metacogntion affect attention. Theoretical and educational implications of the study’s findings are discussed.

27,The impact of skim reading and navigation when reading hyperlinks on the web,"It has been shown that readers spend a great deal of time skim reading on the Web and that this type of reading can affect lexical processing of words. Across two experiments, we utilised eye tracking methodology to explore how hyperlinks and navigating webpages affect reading behaviour. In Experiment 1, participants read static Webpages either for comprehension or whilst skim reading, while in Experiment 2, participants additionally read through a navigable Web environment. Embedded target words were either hyperlinks or not and were either high-frequency or low-frequency words. Results from Experiment 1 show that while readers lexically process both linked and unlinked words when reading for comprehension, readers only fully lexically process linked words when skim reading, as was evidenced by a frequency effect that was absent for the unlinked words. They did fully lexically process both linked and unlinked words when reading for comprehension. In Experiment 2, which allowed for navigating, readers only fully lexically processed linked words compared to unlinked words, regardless of whether they were skim reading or reading for comprehension. We suggest that readers engage in an efficient reading strategy where they attempt to minimise comprehension loss while maintaining a high reading speed. Readers use hyperlinks as markers to suggest important information and use them to navigate through the text in an efficient and effective way. The task of reading on the Web causes readers to lexically process words in a markedly different way from typical reading experiments.

28,Children's Immediate Understanding of Vocabulary: Contexts and Dictionary Definitions,"This study investigates children's ability to utilize context cues (forward or backward), dictionary definitions (original or revised), or combinations of the two to understand unfamiliar words. Significant word gains were found for all treatments and reading skill levels. Revised definitions produced significantly greater gains than forward context cues, backward context cues, and original definitions. Combined treatments produced significantly greater gains than backward context cues. Advanced readers demonstrated significantly greater gains than average or below-average readers. Implications for reading research and instruction are forwarded and the construct of Immediate Understanding is defined and explored.

29,"Using an Electronic Highlighter to Eliminate the Negative Effects of Pre-Existing, Inappropriate Highlighting","The purpose of the present experiment was to determine whether using an active learning technique, electronic highlighting, can eliminate the negative effects of pre-existing, poor highlighting on reading comprehension. Participants read passages containing no highlighting, appropriate highlighting, or inappropriate highlighting. We hypothesized that the act of using an electronic highlighter could reduce or eliminate the effects of inappropriate highlighting. We measured comprehension of the passages in addition to three measures of metacomprehension: Judgment of Learning (JOL), Prediction of Knowing (POK), and confidence ratings. The results indicated that using the electronic highlighter eliminated negative effects of pre-existing, poor highlighting on both comprehension and metacomprehension.",Active Learning; College Students; Comparative Analysis; educational technology; Electronic Equipment; Learning Strategies; Metacognition; Prediction; reading comprehension; Reading strategies; Teaching Methods; United States (Southwest),"Gier, Vicki; Kreiner, David; Hudnell, Jason; Montoya, Jodi; Herring, Daniel",2011.0,,1,29
30,Improving reading to improve math,"Reading provides information across the curriculum. Thus, to the extent that fundamental (i.e., generalizable) reading comprehension strategies can be taught, the benefits should be found in multiple domains. To test this claim, children in the third and fourth grades read by simulating text content using the two-part, embodied Moved by Reading intervention. While reading six initial texts, children literally manipulated pictures on a computer screen to simulate sentence content; next, for additional texts the children imagined the manipulation of the pictures. These additional texts were in the form of mathematical story problems. Compared to a control condition, children using Moved by Reading solved more problems correctly, and this improvement is mainly attributed to a 35% reduction in the use of irrelevant numerical information in solution attempts. Thus, Moved by Reading teaches a fundamental strategy that encourages the sense-making that can aid mathematical story problem solution.

31,The impact of elaborated feedback on text comprehension within a computer-based assessment,"We investigated what impact elaborated feedback has on sixth graders' deep-level comprehension of texts within a computer-based assessment. Experiment 1 (N = 566) focused on the contents of computer-provided elaborated feedback (i.e. inference-prompts, error explanations, or monitoring-prompt) using a control-group design. Results showed that none of the feedback treatments had an effect on performance. This appeared to result from participants' low commitment to processing the feedback. Experiment 2 (N = 251) focused on the feedback presentation type by varying computer-mediated and person-mediated inference-prompts within a control-group design. Results showed that only the person-mediated inference-prompts had significant effects on performance with respect to the correction of initially false answers to comprehension questions and the performance on subsequent test questions. Findings of both experiments indicate the impact of inference-prompts on text comprehension within performance assessments, highlighting the need to explicitly account for motivational issues in feedback interventions on higher-order reading processes.

32,Engagement practices for strategy learning in concept-oriented reading instruction,"The rationale for considering engagement in the instruction of reading strategies is presented. Processes of engagement 1 the use of prior knowledge during reading, the use of cognitive strategies, and motivations for reading comprehension. All three processes are shown to contribute independently to reading comprehension in empirical studies, and thus the role of motivation is suggested to be important. The experimental effects of engagement-supporting instruction on reading comprehension are presented, with an emphasis of practices of using conceptual goals, affording student choice, and providing opportunities for text-based collaboration. The potential theoretical explanation for these instructional effects is that the instruction increases students' levels of engaged reading, which then increases reading comprehension. An example of the principles embodied in a computer-based environment is provided.

33,A Questioning Environment for Scaffolding Learners' Questioning Engagement with Academic Text: A University Case Study,"Access to the textual world of academia requires that learners are familiar with the critical open-ended questioning stance demanded by textuality. Anecdotal evidence suggests that learners registered for the Bachelor of Education Honours degree are unable to generate appropriate questions to interrogate academic text, impacting on their ability to engage effectively with academia. While ample research exists to suggest that face-to-face scaffolding can facilitate learners' access to academic text, this is often a time consuming, repetitive activity, which fails to track learners' questions over time. Given that questioning is  one of the most important learning-teaching tools available to both learner and educator, we  have created a computer-based scaffolding environment in which students are required to  generate questions to interrogate academic texts. Learners have been using this new scaffolding tool this year, and we report on preliminary findings from the study.

35,The Effects of Pre-Reading and Sharing Mechanisms on Learning with the Use of Annotations,"This study is aimed at investigating students' annotation behaviors and their effects on learning achievement with pre-reading (reading before class) exercises and Web-based sharing mechanisms. An 8-week quasi-experiment was conducted with 125 sixth-grade elementary school students. The study shows the following results. First, a significant correlation was evident between pre-reading with a Web-based annotation tool and learning achievement. Furthermore, implementing a pre-reading sharing mechanism with Web-based annotation capabilities could stimulate and help students perform more useful pre-reading by reviewing others' annotations, thereby enlarging the effectiveness of pre-reading as it relates to learning. Second, participants' pre-reading exercises with a Web-based annotation tool revealed their preparation before class as well as reflected their prior knowledge, thereby helping the instructor to prepare the lecture well in advance. In the future, more advanced mechanisms, such as self-regulation learning, will be studied to encourage students to efficiently manage learning before class.

36,Effectiveness of Selected Supplemental Reading Comprehension Interventions: Findings from Two Student Cohorts. NCEE 2010-4015,"Results after two years of using three reading comprehension curricula show gains from one program and no effects for the other two on reading comprehension for fifth-graders, according to a study released by the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance in the Institute of Education Sciences. The study focused on whether 5th grade students in disadvantaged schools could be helped in making the transition from ""learning to read"" to ""reading to learn"" by bolstering the vocabulary and comprehension skills that allow them to organize and acquire knowledge from text. Three commercially available supplemental reading comprehension curricula were used for a second year by school and teachers to teach explicit reading comprehension strategies--ReadAbout, Read for Real, and Project CRISS. The study 1d 182 teachers and 61 schools in 10 districts, with study schools within each district assigned by lottery to use one of the curricula or serve as a control group. No positive impacts of the curricula on student reading comprehension were found in the study's first year. Key findings after two years of using the curricula 1: (1) here was a positive, statistically significant impact of ReadAbout on social studies reading comprehension when teachers used it for a second year. The effect size was 0.22, which amounts to moving from the 50th percentile to the 59th percentile. This reading program teaches students comprehension skills--such as author's purpose, main idea, cause and effect, compare and contrast, summarizing and inferences--using a computer program that adapts to each student's reading level. The program also allowed for easier integration of small-group instruction and provided immediate feedback to students; (2) The impacts on fifth-grade reading comprehension were not statistically significantly different from zero for the other two other curricula, Read for Real and Project CRISS, when used by schools for a second year. (A fourth curriculum, Reading for Knowledge, was studied in the first year but was not 1d in the second cohort); and (3) Two of three teacher practices--classroom management and explicit reading strategy guidance--were positively correlated with improvements in student reading comprehension. The explicit guidance had teachers explaining text structure and modeling comprehension strategies as students practiced those strategies.",Achievement Gains; Cohort Analysis; Control Groups; Correlation; Curriculum Evaluation; Curriculum Implementation; Disadvantaged Schools; Educational Practices; Effect Size; Experimental Groups; Faculty Development; Fidelity; Followup Studies; Grade 5; Institutional Characteristics; instructional effectiveness; intervention; Observation; Pretests Posttests; reading comprehension; Reading Skills; School Support; Scores; Statistical Significance; Supplementary Reading Materials; Time Management,"James-Burdumy, Susanne; Deke, John; Lugo-Gil, Julieta; Carey, Nancy; Hershey, Alan; Gersten, Russell; Newman-Gonchar, Rebecca; Dimino, Joseph; Haymond, Kelly; Faddis, Bonnie; National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance; Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.; RG Research Group; RMC Research Corporation",2010.0,,1,36
37,Web-based training of metacognitive strategies for text comprehension: Focus on poor comprehenders,"Metacognitive reading strategies were trained and practiced using interactive Web-based tools. Twenty middle school poor reading comprehenders were trained in two metacognitive strategies using a Web-based application called 3D-Readers. The training texts were science-oriented and merged the narrative and expository genres. Results from a within-subjects design answered two main experimental questions: (1) Were greater comprehension gains demonstrated after reading experimental texts with embedded verbal (generate questions) and visual (create a model) strategies compared to control texts? (2) Did the embedded strategies affect elective rereading of the texts? The data answered both questions in the affirmative. Comprehension, as assessed with constructed answers, was significantly higher in the experimental condition, thus demonstrating the efficacy of training verbal and visual strategies in a Web-based environment. In addition, participants elected to reread more often in the experimental condition (as assessed with number of clicks to 'ScrollBack' through the text), thus demonstrating the efficacy of strategy training on text reprocessing. Interestingly, the poorer comprehenders altered their rereading behavior the most. Implications for Web-based instructional applications are discussed.

This study evaluates a Computerized Reading Program Strategy (Programa Informatizado de Leitura Estratégica-PILE) intended to improve reading comprehension of primary school students. A total of 58 students attending from the 5th to 8th grades, on average 12.52 years old, participated: 29 comprised the control group (CG) and 29 comprised the intervention group (IG). A Cloze test was used as pre- and post-measurement. PILE was administered for six weeks, totaling 19 meetings. There was significant improvement from the pre- to the post-measurements for levels of reading comprehension in both the IG and the GC. The IG experienced a greater impact from the intervention, suggesting that PILE was effective in improving reading comprehension among these students.

We used a multiple baseline design across participants to evaluate the effects of instruction on strategy application as measured through comprehension rubrics (Keene, 2006) and on comprehension-question answering as measured through researcher-developed literal and inferential comprehension questions. Results showed that participants applied comprehension strategies and improved their percentage accuracy with answering comprehension questions after being introduced to explicit strategy instruction, a mnemonic to facilitate strategy application, web-based tools, and peer collaboration to co-construct meaning from text.

40,"Breaking down the resistance and reducing the struggle: The discourse of writing, imagery, and music as a reading strategy in the standard English classroom","Teachers of standards based, College Prep English classes regularly face resistant and struggling readers who fail to engage, persevere, and comprehend curricular texts. As a result, these readers do not share in class discussions. Therefore, a class discourse was formulated upon Gee's (1996) Social Discourse theory and Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, and Cammack's (2004) New Literacies theory as well as prior classroom observations. Subsequently, the discourse was implemented to address the struggle and resistance to curricular readings. The discourse combined curricular texts with the strategic use of writing, imagery, and music in an electronic, classroom environment. The case study methodology tested four propositions that respectively maintained: using writing, imagery, and music (WIM) as a discourse would improve the resistant and struggling readers' engagement, textual stamina, comprehension, and social-emotional confidence in regard to curricular texts. The WIM discourse respectively 1d a Mosaic stage for learning the WIM Mosaic strategy and a Narrative stage for learning the WIM Narrative strategy. Nineteen participants from two College Prep English 2 classes at an affluent, Mid-Atlantic, suburban high school were divided into resistant and struggling reader groups, with two exemplars randomly selected from each group and compared to remaining group members. Each reader received explicit instruction and guided practice on how to use the Mosaic and Narrative strategies and an electronic response journal to address curricular texts and share in class discussions. For all exemplars and the majority of additional participants, data analysis revealed improved engagement, textual stamina, comprehension, and the willingness to share in discussions as a result of using the WIM discourse. Implications for teachers focus on: engagement with curricular text, extending textual stamina, cultivating non-linear comprehension, and promoting social-emotional confidence in resistant and struggling readers.

41,A Design-Based Research Investigation of a Web-Based Learning Environment Designed to Support the Reading Process,"This research study had two purposes, (a) to design and develop a Web-based learning environment that supports the use of a set of reading strategies, and (b) to investigate the impact of this Web-based learning environment on readers' ""memory"" and ""understanding"" of an instructional unit on the human heart (Dwyer & Lamberski, 1977). These purposes led to four major research goals: 1. Guide the design of a Web-based learning environment that supports the use of a set of five reading strategies: (a) ""Text-macrostructure"" or ""chunking"" strategy: Readers can chunk the instructional unit on the human heart into smaller sections by moving elements (one or more paragraphs of text and an image) that make up the instructional unit into tabs that they create in the Web-based learning environment. (b) ""Summarization"" strategy: Readers can write a summary for each section that they create. (c) ""Imagery"" strategy: Readers can select an image from a library of images that is most representative of the contents of a given section. (d) ""Reading self-assessment"" or ""comfort-meter"" strategy: Readers can mark on a scale of 1-5 how comfortable they feel with their understanding of each section of the instructional unit. (e) ""Note-taking"" strategy: Readers can take notes on an element-by-element basis--these notes are attached to the elements that make up the instructional unit. 2. Establish validity and reliability of Web-based measurement instruments that were designed to measure memory and understanding of the instructional unit on the human heart at four levels of knowledge representation--""micro-textbase,"" ""macro-textbase,"" ""micro-situation model"" and ""macro-situation model."" 3. On the basis of these measurement instruments, determine whether participants who read the instructional unit on the human heart in the Web-based learning environment developed better ""memory"" and ""understanding"" of the instructional unit when compared with participants who read the same text on a regular Web page. 4. Develop an understanding of participants' use of the five reading strategies in the Web-based learning environment and their experience in the Web-based learning environment. A design-based research framework guided a series of studies that addressed these research goals. These studies were conducted in four phases. Findings from each of the first three phases of the investigation were used to inform and update the design of the Web-based learning environment, the Web-based measurement instruments, and the research design of the subsequent phase. The investigation culminated in a large-scale quasi-experimental study. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

42,Adaptive computer software that supports reading comprehension: An exploratory analysis of instructional and design implications,"The relationship among prior knowledge, learner variables and interactive reading instruction on multimedia reading outcomes was explored. An animated agent was specially designed to provide students with interactive support for the reading and strategic processing of multimedia text. Forty-five students (aged 9-11 years) were randomly assigned to read a multimedia science lesson with interactive agent support (treatment) or with no reading support (control). Performance on three indicators of reading performance were assessed: short answer, multiple choice, and graph questions. Comparisons of pre to post test gains between the two learning conditions indicated that students reading with interactive agent support scored significantly higher on the short answer questions. A significant interaction was found between gender and the learning condition for the multiple choice questions, indicating that girls did best in the treatment condition, while boys did best in the control condition. No significant differences were found between the treatment and control on the graph interpretation questions. Additional analyses of session transcripts, interviews, observations and case studies identified several variables that were associated with more and less successful multimedia reading outcomes. In the context of these findings, specific design and instructional implications are recommended, as well as directions for future research.

43,Digital peers to help children’s text comprehension and perceptions,"Affable Reading Tutor (ART) is an online reading lesson designed for children who are starting to comprehend reading. A digital, human-like character (virtual peer) in ART serves as a peer model that demonstrates the use of the reading comprehension strategy called questioning to help improve the learners’ comprehension of expository texts. This study, with 141 boys and girls in the fourth and fifth grades in the United States, examined the effects of virtual-peer presence (presence, absence, and control) on learners’ text comprehension and also the effects of learner gender and virtual-peer attributes (human-like male, human-like female, robot still image) on learners’ perceptions of their peer and on their text comprehension. The results revealed that the virtual-peer presence group outperformed both the absence group and the control group in the immediate and delayed posttests text comprehension. There were mixed results in the impacts of learner gender and virtual-peer attributes on text comprehension. The learners’ perceptions of their agent were not differentiated by neither learner gender nor virtual-peer attributes. The findings are discussed with virtual-peer design implications.

44,Integrating new literacy instruction to support online reading comprehension: An examination of online literacy performance in 5th grade classrooms,"This quantitative study explored the effect of intervention lessons on online reading skills in fifth grade classrooms. First, it sought to examine the relationships among demographic variables including gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status and self-reported Internet use and Internet ability. Second, this study was designed to investigate which variables best predict performance on a measure of online reading. Third, the effect of lessons designed to improve online reading comprehension was explored to determine the efficacy of targeted classroom-based instruction on learned skills. Three theoretical frameworks underpinned this study: 1) a new literacies framework (Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, & Cammack, 2004), 2) transactional model (Rosenblatt, 1978), and 3) socioconitive model (Ruddell & Unrau, 2004a). The study was conducted in a Midwestern, suburban school over a 12-week time period with 443 fifth grade students. The repeated measures quasi-experimental research design allowed a quantitative investigation of online reading comprehension instruction to provide a reliable and valid assessment of the impact of online reading comprehension instruction on changes in student performance on an established measure of online reading comprehension. Additional attention to common variables known to influence outcomes in reading and technology performance (e.g., demographic variables, prior reading achievement scores) strengthened the design by allowing a more refined analysis of the isolated impact from the instructional activities. A regression analysis revealed prior achievement on norm-referenced measures of English/Language Arts as well as reported Internet use accounted for a significant amount of variance on online reading comprehension performance. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the experimental and control groups in online reading performance growth. Results from the subskill analysis show students in the experimental group demonstrated significant improvement over the control group on two of the three subskills (locating and synthesizing). No significant differences in group growth were observed for the Web evaluation task. Findings from this study indicate teachers varying in experience and Internet familiarity can effectively teach online reading in a classroom setting, and that students who received this instruction developed these skills at a greater rate. This work can inform future efforts as to how to best teach the skills and strategies of online reading.

45,MindPlay Virtual Reading Coach: Does It Affect Reading Fluency in Elementary School?,"Important strides have been made in the science of learning to read. Yet, many students still struggle to attain reading proficiency. This calls for sustained efforts to bridge theoretical insights with applied considerations about ideal pedagogy. The current study was designed to contribute to this conversation, namely by looking at the efficacy of an online reading program. The chosen reading program, referred to as MindPlay Virtual Reading Coach (MVRC), emphasizes the mastery of basic reading skills to support the development of reading fluency. Its focus on basic skills diverges from the goal of increasing reading motivation. And its focus on reading fluency, vs. broad literacy achievement, offers an alternative to already existing reading enrichment. In order to test the efficacy of MVRC, we recruited three school districts. One district provided data from elementary schools that used the MVRC program in Grades 2 to 6 (N = 2,531 total). The other two districts participated in a quasi-experimental design: Six 2nd-grade classrooms and nine 4th-grade classrooms were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) instruction as usual, (2) instruction with an alternative online reading program, and (3) instruction with MVRC. Complete data sets were available from 142 2nd-graders and 172 4th-graders. Three assessments from the MVRC screener were used: They assessed reading fluency, phonic skills, and listening vocabulary at two time points: before and after the intervention. Results show a clear advantage of MVRC on reading fluency, more so than on phonics or listening vocabulary. At the same time, teachers reported concerns with MVRC, highlighting the challenge with reading programs that emphasize basic-skills mastery over programs that seek to encourage reading.",Conventional Instruction; educational technology; elementary schools; Grade 2; Grade 3; Grade 4; Grade 5; Grade 6; intervention; Listening Skills; Mastery Learning; Online Courses; Phonics; Program Effectiveness; reading instruction; Reading motivation; Reading Programs; Reading Skills; Skill Development; Teaching Methods; Technology Uses in Education; Vocabulary,"Kloos, Heidi; Sliemers, Stephanie; Cartwright, Macey; Mano, Quintino; Stage, Scott",2019.0,,1,45
46,Changing how students process and comprehend texts with computer-based self-explanation training,"This study assessed whether and how self-explanation reading training, provided by iSTART (Interactive Strategy Training for Active Reading and Thinking), improves the effectiveness of comprehension processes. iSTART teaches students how to self-explain and which strategies will most effectively aid comprehension from moment-to-moment. We used RSAT (Reading Strategy Assessment Tool) to assess how iSTART changes the relation between important self-explanation reading strategies—bridging and elaboration—and online comprehension, and how often they are produced. College and high school students received iSTART and were administered RSAT prior to and post-training. Results from three experiments showed that iSTART primarily benefits bridging inferences when self-explaining. The frequency of bridging inferences was higher post training than prior to training, but only in the experiments involving college students. Additionally, prior to exposure to iSTART, RSAT bridging scores did not predict comprehension performance, whereas they did after iSTART, suggesting that iSTART may improve comprehension processes by teaching students how to appropriately use self-explanation to address comprehension difficulties. Finally, the results from this study suggest that RSAT may provide a valuable computer-based assessment of the effectiveness of self-explanations that could be used in conjunction with iSTART and in future research on self-explanation.

47,Promise for enhancing children's reading attitudes through peer reading: A mixed method approach,"Peer-Assisted Learning Strategies (PALS) was implemented for supplementary reading classes in a Korean elementary school. The treatment group children were exposed to PALS during 20 min sessions, 4 times a week, for 8 weeks. The impacts of PALS were investigated in 3 aspects using a mixed-methods approach: improvement in reading attitudes, reading skills, and student perceptions of the intervention. Data collection 1s reading attitude measures, standardized reading comprehension test scores, student satisfaction survey, student interviews, and student journals. The PALS group students showed significantly enhanced reading attitudes and reading skills. Consistently, qualitative data analysis also revealed affirmative influence of PALS on students’ attitudes toward reading. Finally, the findings also suggested social benefits of PALS including developing cooperative skills and friendships.

48,Facilitating critical thinking using the C-QRAC collaboration script: Enhancing science reading literacy in a computer-supported collaborative learning environment,"The criticism that reading online results in shallow reading may reflect the need for an intervention that can provide sufficient technological and pedagogical supports to socially and cognitively engage learners in critical thinking and collaboration. This study investigated the effect of facilitating critical thinking using a collaboration script modified from the Questioning, Reading, Answering, and Checking reading strategy (i.e., QRAC-the-Code; Berkeley & Riccomini, 2013) on students' science reading literacy in a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment. Participants were 76 college students (71% female) enrolled at a university in central Taiwan. Students were grouped by affinity grouping, where they self-selected their members, and were then randomly assigned to a collaborative learning condition with or without the collaboration script support. Overall, results showed that the collaboration script significantly enhanced students' reading literacy. Moreover, the effect was dependent upon gender and the format of tests. Males benefited more from the collaboration script on constructed-response items whereas females benefited more on multiple-choice items. Implications for instructional practices are drawn based on the findings of the study.

Compared to the non-treatment group, students from the intervention group considerably improved reading strategy knowledge. However, only conText improved reading comprehension.

50,Rethinking Strategy Instruction: Direct Reading Strategy Instruction versus Computer-Based Guided Practice,"There are many established reading strategy training programmes, which explicitly teach strategic and meta-cognitive knowledge to improve reading comprehension. Although instruction in strategy knowledge leads to improvements in meta-cognitive skills, the effects do not always transfer to reading comprehension. Therefore, to investigate preconditions for knowledge transfer, two different strategy training programmes were implemented in nine classes of Grade 6 students (""N"" = 148) over the course of one school year. One programme involved teacher-directed instruction of declarative meta-cognitive knowledge (""Reading Detectives""; Ruhl & Souvignier, 2006). The other aimed at improving executive meta-cognition by guided practice: students worked with a computer program based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) (""conText"") and received immediate feedback on written summaries. Although both groups improved their strategy knowledge to the same extent, the ""conText"" group showed a greater improvement in reading comprehension. These findings suggest that guided practice, which is characterised by intensive practice and individualised corrective feedback, is superior to explicitly teaching strategy knowledge.

51,Simultaneous presentation of multiple documents and text-highlighting: Online integrative processes and offline integrated understanding,"This study examined the effect of the reading environment, i.e., documents presentation and possibility of text-highlighting, on readers’ integrated understanding, as well as the interplay between the reading environment and overt reading processes (i.e., online integrative processes) in forming intertextual connections. University students (N = 126) read six partly conflicting documents presented on a large multi-touch table, which were presented simultaneously or sequentially, with or without the possibility of text-highlighting. The simultaneous presentation yielded better integrated understanding, with this effect being fully mediated by an increased likelihood to spatially organize documents during reading. Furthermore, the possibility of text-highlighting also fostered readers’ integrated understanding. Additional analyses (sequential presentation only), however, indicated that this was not the case for participants who only infrequently revisited documents. We discuss this complex interplay between the reading environment and readers’ online integrative processes in the light of the RESOLV model.

52,"Effect of hypertext highlighting on browsing, reading, and navigational performance","Reading hypertext documents is more difficult than reading traditional linear text. Text highlighting plays the role of encoding for reading comprehension and may play the roles of contextual cues and landmarks for hypertext navigation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of text highlight and organizing highlighted text into a hierarchical structure on browsing, reading, and navigation performance in a network hypertext system. A randomized experiment was conducted. Ninety participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: a reading system with text highlighting, with text highlighting and organizing highlighted text, and without any aids. Dependent variables 1d browsing performance: time spent and the length of navigational path for reading; reading performance: recall and inference scores, navigational performance: scores of landmark and route knowledge and time spent and the length of navigational path for completing nine navigational tasks. The results showed that text highlight did not improve reading and navigational performance. By contrast, organizing highlighted text yielded significantly worst performance in reading and navigation. According to the results, we propose several suggestions for the design of reading instruction and digital highlighters.

53,Learning Reading Strategies with Online Discussion,"Teachers experience difficulty demonstrating prediction strategies and leading discussions in traditional classrooms. It is also unclear whether online discussion can contribute to reading comprehension. The purpose of this study is to create an online reading system to investigate whether learners can acquire reading strategies and enhance their reading comprehension through online discussion. Because students who are simultaneously immersed in two learning practices may experience cognitive overload, this combined strategy instruction system was compared to single strategy instruction systems that allow only one learning practice at a time, either prediction or discussion. A total of 110 5th-grade students participated in this study. The results revealed that single strategy instruction was more beneficial to students' reading comprehension, and the reasons combined strategy instruction was less efficient are discussed.

54,Optimising the use of note-taking as an external cognitive aid for increasing learning,"Taking notes is of uttermost importance in academic and commercial use and success. Different techniques for note-taking utilize different cognitive processes and strategies. This experimental study examined ways to enhance cognitive performance via different note-taking techniques. By comparing performances of traditional, linear style note-taking with alternative nonlinear technique, we aimed to examine the efficiency and importance of different ways of taking notes. Twenty-six volunteer adult learners from an information management course participated in this study. Cognitive performance scores from a traditional linear note-taking group were compared with another group by using a commercially available non-linear note-taking technique. Both groups were tested in two settings: after a classroom lecture and a panel forum discussion. Tasks 1d measures on story comprehension, memory, complexity of mental representations and metacognitive skills. Data analysis revealed that the non-linear note-takers were significantly better than the linear group both in terms of the quantity and the quality of the learned material. This study demonstrates the importance of using cognitively compatible note-taking techniques. It identifies the cognitive mechanisms behind effective note-taking and knowledge representation. Using such techniques enables deeper understanding and more integrated knowledge management.

55,iSTART Therefore I Understand: But Metacognitive Supports Did Not Enhance Comprehension Gains,"iSTART is an intelligent tutoring system designed to provide self-explanation instruction and practice to improve students' comprehension of complex, challenging text. This study examined the effects of extended game-based practice within the system as well as the effects of two metacognitive supports implemented within this practice. High school stu-dents (n = 234) were either assigned to an iSTART treatment condition or a control condition. Within the iSTART condition, students were assigned to a 2x2 design in which students provided ""self-assessments"" of their performance or were transferred to Coached Practice if their performance did not reach a certain ""performance threshold."" Those receiving iSTART training produced higher self-explanation and inference-based comprehension scores. However, there were no direct effects of either metacognitive support on these learning outcomes. [This paper was published in: R. Baker & E.

56,Metacognitive overload!: Positive and negative effects of metacognitive prompts in an intelligent tutoring system,"Research suggests that promoting metacognitive awareness can increase performance in, and learning from, intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). The current work examines the effects of two metacognitive prompts within iSTART, a reading comprehension strategy ITS in which students practice writing quality self-explanations. In addition to comparing iSTART practice to a no-training control, those in the iSTART condition (n = 116) were randomly assigned to a 2 (performance threshold: off, on) × 2(self-assessment: off, on) design. The performance threshold notified students when their average self-explanation score was below an experimenter-set threshold and the self-assessment prompted students to estimate their self-explanation score on the current trial. Students who practiced with iSTART had higher posttest self-explanation scores and inference comprehension scores on a transfer test than students in the no training control, replicating previous benefits for iSTART. However, there were no effects of either metacognitive prompt on these learning outcomes. In-system self-explanation scores indicated that the metacognitive prompts were detrimental to performance relative to standard iSTART practice. This study did not find benefits of metacognitive prompts in enhancing performance during practice or after the completion of training. Such findings support the idea that improving reading comprehension strategies comes from deliberate practice with actionable feedback rather than explicit metacognitive supports.

57,Improving Adolescent Students' Reading Comprehension with iSTART,"This study examines the benefits of reading strategy training on adolescent readers' comprehension of science text. Training was provided via an automated reading strategy trainer called the Interactive Strategy Trainer for Active Reading and Thinking (iSTART), which is an interactive reading strategy trainer that utilizes animated agents to provide reading strategy instruction. Half of the participants were provided with iSTART while the others (control) were given a brief demonstration of how to self-explain text. All of the students then self-explained a text about heart disease and answered text-based and bridging-inference questions. Both iSTART training and prior knowledge of reading strategies significantly contributed to the quality of self-explanations and comprehension. Adolescents with less prior knowledge about reading strategies performed significantly better on text-based questions if they received iSTART training. Conversely, for high-strategy knowledge students, iSTART improved comprehension for bridging-inference questions. Thus, students benefitted from training regardless of their prior knowledge of strategies, but these benefits translated into different comprehension gains.

58,Differentiating literacy instruction for digital learners: The effect of multimedia think-aloud worked examples on adolescent analytical reading comprehension,"Learning by example is nothing new to the education landscape. Research into think-aloud protocols, though often used as a form of assessment rather than instruction, provided practical, content-specific literacy strategies for crafting the instructional intervention in this study. Additionally, research into worked examples---from the earliest pen-and-paper studies of algebra and statistics, to more recent multimedia studies of legal reasoning and writing---shaped the conceptual framework for the present study by detailing a series of design principles for effective multimedia worked examples. This study aimed to reimagine the face-to-face, teacher-facilitated think-aloud as a multimedia worked example, which could be leveraged for differentiated, blended instruction to support adolescent readers. The purpose of this study was to investigate how multimedia worked examples that explicitly model the reading habits of successful readers through teacher think-alouds could facilitate effective differentiated analytical reading instruction for high school English language arts students who have access to 1:1 technology. The study tested the worked examples principle on the ill-defined problem of analytical reading comprehension in the naturalistic setting of a high school English language arts classroom using the practitioner model of the think-aloud as guidance. The study considered the effect of multimedia think-aloud worked examples on analytical reading comprehension and mental effort, as well as on the student experience of studying complex passages from literary texts. In this experiment, an explanatory sequential mixed-methodology study, 34 sophomore English students were randomly assigned to either the worked examples treatment condition or the traditional instruction comparison condition. Using a classic treatment-comparison repeat measures pretest-posttest design, students' analytical reading comprehension and perceived mental effort was assessed. Later, in the qualitative phase of the study, the participant experience was described through interviews and annotations in order to more deeply understand the quantitative data collected. Quantitative data were analyzed using a series of t tests between treatment and comparison groups for each phase of the study, as well as for gain scores from the baseline assessment to each of the intervention phases and to the posttest. Statistically significant differences were found between the treatment and comparison conditions for the analytical reading comprehension dependent variable at the first phase of the intervention and at the delayed posttest. No statistically significant results were found for the mental effort dependent variable. Qualitative data were coded and analyzed for emerging themes and patterns. These data revealed that students in the treatment group 1d higher quantity and quality annotations on their passages than did students in the comparison condition. Moreover, interviews revealed that students perceived the think-aloud process as distinct from their own analytical reading process, and they expressed that the think-aloud worked example videos increased their attention to detail, depth of analysis, ease of study, level of focus, and willingness to persist in a challenging task.

59,The Impact of a Language Learning Task on Instructional Outcomes in Two Student Populations: High-Ability and Average-Ability Students,"This article examines the use of two different Spanish language learning tasks for students identified as high ability and average ability. Students were asked to read a short passage in Spanish on a computer screen and either use the glosses already provided for certain words to aid in comprehension (the control group) or create glosses for the same target words using a Spanish-English dictionary and annotation software (the experimental group). Next, they were asked to write a synopsis of the story in their own words in English and were also given an unannounced vocabulary recall test. They were retested 1 month later for vocabulary recall. High-ability students performed significantly better with the experimental task than with the control task on the vocabulary test, while average-ability learners showed no difference for recall between the two tasks. For reading comprehension, the complex nature of the experimental task seems to have created difficulties for average-ability learners, who scored substantially lower than the other groupings. Experimental average-ability students recalled significantly fewer words on the delayed recall test, as well, again suggesting a detrimental effect of the task on word retention for this group.

60,The effects of a virtual tutee system on academic reading engagement in a college classroom,"Poor student engagement with academic readings has been frequently reported in college classrooms. As an effort to improve college students’ reading engagement, researchers have developed a virtual environment in which students take on the role of tutor and teach a virtual tutee, the virtual tutee system (VTS). This research examined the effectiveness of the VTS for enhancing students’ academic reading motivation, engagement, and performance. Two groups of college students were compared: students who used the VTS and those who used an online reading guide (RG). Both quantitative and qualitative data were used to acquire a better understanding of reading motivation and engagement. The study found that students in the VTS group engaged in a deep level of cognitive processing when they completed the reading assignments. They also exhibited a higher reading performance than students in the RG group.

61,Differential effects of students' self-directed metacognitive prompts,"The present study aims at fostering learning behavior and learning outcomes in Computer-Based Learning Environments through metacognitive prompts. Thereby, two types of metacognitive prompts are compared with respect to learning behavior and learning outcomes. In a pre-post experimental design, students in experimental group 1 (N = 54) learned with predefined (fixed) metacognitive prompts whereas students in experimental group 2 (N = 54) were instructed to configure their own (self-directed) metacognitive prompts and to learn with them afterwards. Students in the control group (N = 55) received no instructional support and learned without prompts. The results show that self-directed and fixed prompts lead to less linear learning behavior than no prompts. Regarding learning outcomes, no significant main effects were found. Further, findings indicate that interactions between learner characteristics and treatment have a significant impact on learning behavior and learning outcomes. Students with lower verbal intelligence and reading competence especially seem to benefit from prompts. Hence, when prompting students, their learner characteristics should be considered. Further research should investigate further conditions and the underlying mechanisms of prompt use.

62,Interactive highlighting for just-in-time formative assessment during whole-class instruction: Effects on vocabulary learning and reading comprehension,"This article examines the effectiveness of a software that supports formative assessment in real-time of learners' vocabulary knowledge through an interactive highlighting method. Students in a classroom are given a passage on their computer screen and asked to highlight the words they do not understand. This information is summarized on the instructors screen by highlighting in red the words most highlighted, in orange the second most highlighted, and in yellow the third most highlighted, with a superscript showing the number of students who selected each word. The instructor projects this summary on a screen for the whole class and use it to guide activities on how to comprehend the passage. In Experiment 1, college students who learned with interactive highlighting in a single-session study scored higher on a vocabulary test (d = 1.14) but not on a comprehension test as compared to a control group that studied the same passage without interactive highlighting. In Experiment 2, high school students who learned with interactive highlighting across a 10-week program scored higher on a standardized reading comprehension test as compared to a control group that studied without interactive highlighting (d = 1.60 in school 1, d = 1.17 in school 2).

63,Choosing the Right Question: The Effect of Different Question Types on Multiple Text Integration,"Multiple text integration is a challenging task, but it is essential for studying and developing digital literacy, and is therefore critical to promote among students. However, the conditions that may support multiple text integration for different reader profiles have not been thoroughly studied. Therefore, based on single text research, the current study examined whether adding reading comprehension questions in-between texts would improve subsequent text integration for good versus poor readers. Another aim was to assess multiple text integration of complementary texts, where information does not conflict, but supplements, and to examine separately two components of integration: selecting the relevant information and forming inter-text links. Two experiments were carried out: in the first, 124 university students read multiple texts with or without embedded multiple-choice questions. Results showed that adding comprehension questions promoted inter-text links, but hindered references to single text ideas. In the second experiment, 59 university students read multiple texts paired with either open-ended questions or multiple-choice questions embedded between texts. Open-ended questions resulted in higher integration scores compared to multiple-choice questions only among participants with low comprehension scores. Overall, reading comprehension skills uniquely contributed to text integration.

64,Improving comprehension online: Effects of deep vocabulary instruction with bilingual and monolingual fifth graders,"This quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of an Internet-delivered universally designed depth of vocabulary intervention that targeted both English-speaking and Spanish–English-speaking students. Two hundred forty students, 49% of whom were Spanish–English bilinguals, participated in the 16-week intervention. Intervention students read eight multimedia texts with embedded instruction on 40 words and reading strategy support. Students could access all texts and activities in Spanish and English. In comparison to a control group, there were significant intervention effects on a standardized measure of vocabulary knowledge, but effects were non-significant for comprehension. Similarly, significant effects on researcher-developed measures of vocabulary depth were detected, but not for a researcher-developed measure of breadth.

65,Improving metacomprehension and calibration accuracy through embedded cognitive and metacognitive strategy prompts,"A societal shift from print-based to digital texts has afforded the ability to embed reader support within an instructional text. Numerous factors make eBooks an attractive option for colleges and universities, though undergraduates consistently reaffirm a preference for print-based materials. Given that many undergraduates arrive to college with a deficiency in reading comprehension skills and metacognitive awareness, digital text is able to offer an additional layer of support. A sample population of college undergraduates (N = 80) read an expository text on the basics of photography in the form of a fill-in field PDF. The most robust treatment (mixed) read the text, generated a summary for each page of text, and then was prompted with a metacognitive strategy self-question. The metacognitive treatment received metacognitive strategy prompts only, and the cognitive group implemented the cognitive strategy (summarization) only. A control group read the text with no embedded support. Groups were compared on measures of achievement, attitudes, cognitive load, and metacomprehension and calibration accuracy. Results indicated that a combination of embedded cognitive and metacognitive strategies in digital text improved learner achievement on high-level questions, yielded more accurate predictive calibration, and strengthened the relationship between metacomprehension and performance. Because cognitive load was reported to be significantly higher in the mixed strategy condition, the trade-off between the benefits of embedded reading support and the effects on mental demand should be investigated in more depth. This study found that providing embedded cognitive and metacognitive support in text lead to more accurate calibration and stronger metacomprehension judgments, both of which are common attributes of an academically successful learner.

66,Generative Learning Strategy Use and Self-Regulatory Prompting in Digital Text,"The digital revolution is shifting print-based textbooks to digital text, and it has afforded the opportunity to incorporate meaningful learning strategies and otherwise separate metacognitive activities directly into these texts as embedded support. A sample of 89 undergraduates read a digital, expository text on the basics of photography. The treatment prompted the reader with self-regulatory questions and embedded a generative strategy, paraphrasing, and confirmed previous research on the relationships between prior knowledge and level of self-regulation on reading comprehension. A one-way between subjects ANOVA revealed significance for the level of self-regulation on comprehension-level items and for the level of prior knowledge on recall-level items. ANOVA also indicated that the quality of paraphrasing has a significant impact on recall-level and overall performance on the posttest. Further, participants were generally positive towards the instructional materials, which suggests willingness, and in some cases, preference, to reading in a digital format while experiencing embedded, metacognitive instructional interventions. It is recommended that comprehension may be enhanced by providing deeper training on the use of the generative strategy and by increasing motivation prior to interacting with the text in order to capitalize on the unique advantages of digital materials.",Correlation; Electronic Publishing; Expository Writing; Factor analysis; information technology; Instructional Materials; Item Analysis; Learning Strategies; Metacognition; Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire; Photography; Positive Attitudes; Pretests Posttests; Prior Learning; reading comprehension; Recall (Psychology); Statistical Analysis; Student Attitudes; Student Motivation; Teaching Methods; Textbooks; Undergraduate Students; United States (Southeast),"Reid, Alan J.; Morrison, Gary M.",2014.0,,1,66

68,Increasing Text Comprehension and Graphic Note Taking Using a Partial Graphic Organizer,"In 3 quasi-experiments using intact classrooms and 1 true experiment using random assignment, students completed partially complete graphic organizers (GOs) or studied complete GOs that covered course content. The partial task led to increased overall examination performance in all experiments. Also, the authors measured students' note-taking style (linear vs. graphic) at the beginning and end of the course. In all experiments, GO note taking increased. The increases were greatest when the authors presented the partial task in a computer environment with a timed, forced-choice task. Implications for using the partial GO task in the classroom, as well as future note-taking research directions are discussed.

69,iPadegogy of Reading: Do iPads Influence Student's Reading?,"The increase in accessibility and demand for laptop computers and tablets has seen literacy in schools begin to transmogrify, due to the advances of modern digital technology. This is in part due (but not limited) to the growing need, acceptance and popularity, as the division between home use and that found in classroom learning environments is steadily diminishing. With such advances in technology also comes the evolution of the format and style of reading text. Consequently, educators are often left questioning how effective and efficient the introduction of iPads are to the engagement, comprehension and achievement of readers. Schools and institutions are faced with the issue as to whether or not the impending technology is beneficial to reading instruction and thus adapted accordingly, or accept the current method of reading instruction as being sufficient. This article outlines research undertaken by myself, a middle school teacher, in order to investigate the possible influence iPads have on student achievement and perceived learning and engagement in reading, concluding with reference to the findings from the study and implications for teachers and schools who currently, or are looking to implement iPads into the learning environment.",Accuracy; Control Groups; Electronic Learning; Experimental Groups; Foreign Countries; Handheld Devices; Influence of Technology; Learner Engagement; Middle School Teachers; Mixed Methods Research; New Zealand; reading comprehension; Reading Improvement; reading instruction; Reading strategies; Teaching Methods; Technology Uses in Education,"Roser, Monique",2017.0,,1,69
70,Alternate forms of reading comprehension strategy practice: Computer and game-based practice methods,"iSTART: the board game is a proposed adaptation of the automated, reading strategies trainer iSTART to investigate whether game-based reading strategy practice can be as effective as typical iSTART practice. The usefulness of game practice would be twofold. First, the game would provide a different form of practice than the standard practice present in iSTART. Second, the game may boost motivation for learners to practice reading strategies because of the engaging nature of games. Experiment 1 investigated the effectiveness of game practice compared to typical iSTART practice and a control game with no elements of reading strategy practice. No differences were found among practice conditions. However, accurate strategy use improved from pretest to posttest. Experiment 2 investigated the effect of practice and individual differences on reading strategy knowledge and self-explanation quality. The individual differences being assessed are reading ability and prior science knowledge. Once again, no differences were found among practice conditions, however, less skilled readers showed an increase in accurate paraphrase use after training. Overall, all participants showed improvement in their knowledge, use, and quality of reading strategies regardless of condition. These findings should be considered in light of the fact that iSTART: the board game is intended to be used as an extended practice method rather than an initial training method. Even though it does not show a difference from other conditions it was reported as enjoyable as a practice method.

71,Instruction of digital reading strategies based on eye-movements modeling examples,"During the last decade, several studies have proposed and tested different instructional methods for teaching digital reading strategies to young students. In this study, we have tested the effectiveness of a program combining eye-movements modeling examples (EMMEs) and contrasting cases to instruct ninth-grade students how to plan, evaluate, and monitor their digital reading. EMMEs are videos that display a dot representing the eye movements of a model and an oral transcription of her thoughts while answering a specific question in a hypertext. Students in the EMME condition obtain higher comprehension scores in a posttest performed 1 week after the instruction, as compared with a control group that have received a control instruction using written case examples. Students working with EMMEs also spend more time reading the main digital document, but they do not differ in terms of visits and time to relevant and irrelevant pages. Our study suggests that EMMEs can be used to foster literacy strategy instruction.

72,"Disruptive promise: The links intervention and its impact on multiple, multimodal, Internet text integration","This dissertation study presents an instructional intervention called LINKS: Learning to Integrate InterNet Knowledge Strategically. It reports evidence of the intervention's impact on two variables: (a) ninth graders' use of ten online reading and integration strategies while engaged in dyadic online inquiry on science topics in school, and (b) evidence of integration from multiple, multimodal Internet texts in their written persuasive arguments. Dyads (n = 8) were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. They completed a pretest, three practice/intervention sessions and a posttest. Groups were matched on pretest reading comprehension scores. The treatment group received LINKS, which 1d explicit instruction of strategies, modeling of strategy use during think-aloud screencasts, and guided instructional support that prompted students to engage strategies while reading. Teacher support was gradually released over three intervention sessions that lasted approximately one hour each. The control group did not receive instruction on strategies. They watched screencasts that 1d the same content as treatment screencasts, but received no modeled think aloud of strategy use. Control group participants received no instructional support during their online inquiry sessions. All participants read texts online in dyads but wrote persuasive arguments independently. When assumptions for parametric tests were met, they were used for between-groups and within-groups comparisons. Usually non-parametric Mann Whitney-U tests were used for between-groups comparisons and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used for within-groups comparisons. During intervention sessions, treatment participants were more likely than control participants to focus on the type of text and the trustworthiness of a text as they considered its relevance or utility. At posttest, however, treatment condition participants performed no differently from the control participants in terms of these critical evaluation strategies. At posttest, treatment participants were more likely than control participants to explicitly engage background knowledge during online inquiry. This was the only significant posttest difference in strategy use between the groups. In their written arguments, treatment participants were also more likely to use facts they had noted or recorded as preexisting knowledge during inquiry. Although index scores on the Trace Indicators of Integration (TII) Rubric did not differ statistically at pretest or at posttest for the groups, treatment participants did see a statistically significant improvement in their TII index scores by the second intervention session. A similar bump in performance was not observed for the control condition. At posttest, treatment participants were also more likely to 1 in their written arguments counter points gathered from websites that differed from those used to build the main argument, suggesting that LINKS may have enabled this group of students to bring together more perspectives from a broader range of Internet texts in their written arguments. A single case analysis suggests that students who are very early in their learning trajectories for multiple, multimodal Internet text integration skills may benefit considerably from LINKS. Methodologically, this dissertation also introduces a protocol for measuring trace evidence of integration in students' written arguments. Although results should be interpreted cautiously, teachers of adolescents may find that LINKS offers a promising place to start instruction for online inquiry and the construction of meaning across multiple, multimodal Internet texts.

73,Accommodating Remedial Readers in the General Education Setting: Is Listening-while-Reading Sufficient to Improve Factual and Inferential Comprehension?,"Word reading accommodations are commonly applied in the general education setting in an attempt to improve student comprehension and learning of curriculum content. This study examined the effects of listening-while-reading (LWR) and silent reading (SR) using text-to-speech assistive technology on the comprehension of 25 middle-school remedial readers. Participants were provided three grade-level passages, each with 10 comprehension questions (5 factual, 5 inferential) after SR and also after LWR using the assistive technology. Conditions were counterbalanced across participants. No significant differences were found between LWR and SR total, factual, or inferential comprehension, even after controlling for participant reading ability. Discussion focuses on implications of these findings for reading comprehension theory and school psychologists, study limitations, and directions for future inquiry.

74,Direct and indirect effects of textbook modality on adolescents' reading engagement and comprehension,"This research evaluated the affordances of iPads related to adolescent comprehension and engagement. Specific research questions were guided by a framework of reading engagement in which classroom practices are theorized to have both a direct and indirect effect on comprehension through the mediating roles of motivations and strategic interaction with text (Guthrie, Wigfield, & You, 2012). Participants consisted of 281 9th grade students from two rural Midwest high schools with one-to-one iPad initiatives. Using a between-participants experimental design, students were randomly assigned to read informational text on either an iPad or paper and completed comprehension questions and motivation questionnaires. Half of the students in each modality condition were randomly assigned to receive a review lesson on strategy use and annotation to encourage strategy use while reading. The effects of text modality and strategy review on comprehension of text, observable strategy use, and motivation variables were examined. Results revealed no differences in comprehension or motivational variables among students who read on iPads and students who read on paper. However, students who read on paper were more likely to use observable strategies while reading, with this difference decreasing among students who received a strategy review lesson. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

75,The role of automatic feedback in the summarization of narrative text,"The intent of this dissertation was two-fold: First, to investigate the impact that feedback has both during and after the write/revise cycle. And second, to test the effectiveness of an LSA-based system of automatic feedback that may lend itself to classroom use. Undergraduate participants in four between-group experimental conditions read and summarized a series of three short stories. The participants' performance was assessed throughout the three composition/revision cycles by means of their summaries, their time on task and their response to comprehension questions. Summarization was selected because it has been shown to be an important element of comprehension, as well as a useful pedagogical activity. The conditions differed in the amount of feedback available at the conclusion of each draft cycle, as well as in the medium of composition, specifically computer versus paper. Participants who used a computer produced longer written output than those who did not. Feedback led to superior summary performance, time spent on task and comprehension question response. The differing performance of the participants across the experimental conditions indicates a strong possibility that as a consequence of feedback some participants are revising their rhetorical knowledge, and this refinement transfers to improved performance on subsequent composition events. However, participants who received feedback not only produced better summaries, they also spent more time writing than those who did not. The co-occurrence of these two phenomena makes it impossible to determine whether one or the other is the causal agent. Modifications to the current design that would address this conundrum, as well as implications for classroom use, recommendations for laboratory practices, and the possibility of 'Goldilocks Feedback' are all discussed.

76,"Can you judge a book by its modality? An experimental comparison of reading and test performance across a print, electronic, or interactive introduction to psychology textbook assignment","The increasing prevalence of electronic textbooks (e-texts) in psychology courses necessitates rigorous evaluation of whether students read and learn from electronic texts as well as they do with printed texts. Some meta-analyses indicate a small but reliable advantage of printed text over electronic text on measures of reading comprehension, but recent studies examining interactive e-texts have reported no such print modality advantage. The present study was designed with both experimental control and ecological validity in mind, as college participants were recruited for a paid experiment in which they were randomly assigned to read a chapter of an introductory psychology text in one of three modalities: print book, static pdf, or interactive e-text. We gave participants 1 week to complete their reading at their own pace—wherever and whenever they chose—before administering to them a realistic test for which we created financial performance incentives. Results indicated that students completed their reading assignments in similar fashion across text modality, with the exception that highlighting was most common in the print text condition (although electronic highlighting was available and modeled for participants in the pdf and interactive e-text conditions). Analyses of test performance revealed no evidence for a print text advantage on multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, or short-answer questions. Indeed, participants were most likely to score high enough to earn a performance bonus in the interactive e-text condition.

77,The reading outcomes of adults in literacy programs: An ex post facto study,"The purpose of the quantitative, ex post facto study was to compare the reading scores of adults in literacy programs that used Instruction Targeted for TABE Success (ITTS) instructional software to the reading scores of adults in literacy programs that did not use educational technology by analyzing pre-test and post-test TABE scores of adults who participated in a structured literacy program. This study examined differences in TABE post-test scores for adult students participating in ABE literacy programs. Both groups completed pre-tests. The research questions sought to answer what significant difference, if any, there was in the reading scores of adults in the ABE literacy programs using ITTS instructional software compared to adults in the ABE literacy programs that did not use educational technology as measured by the TABE post-test including differences in the means of the reading scores of males vs females. Hypothesis testing revealed that no statistically significant differences (p<.05) existed in the difference in the means of the students reading scores who participated in ABE literacy programs or between the reading scores of males vs females. The conclusions indicated the need to examine the effect technology had on reading outcomes used in ABE literacy programs currently. The recommendation for further research 1s an investigation of appropriate interventions and instructional strategies for reading as well as the specific components of ABE literacy programs to address reading achievement on the TABE.

78,An evaluation of reading comprehension of expository text in adults with traumatic brain injury,"Purpose: This project was conducted to obtain information about reading problems of adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments and to investigate how these readers respond to reading comprehension strategy prompts integrated into digital versions of text. Method: Participants from 2 groups, adults with TBI (n = 15) and matched controls (n = 15), read 4 different 500-word expository science passages linked to either a strategy prompt condition or a no-strategy prompt condition. The participants’ reading comprehension was evaluated using sentence verification and free recall tasks. Results: The TBI and control groups exhibited significant differences on 2 of the 5 reading comprehension measures: paraphrase statements on a sentence verification task and communication units on a free recall task. Unexpected group differences were noted on the participants’ prerequisite reading skills. For the within-group comparison, participants showed significantly higher reading comprehension scores on 2 free recall measures: words per communication unit and type–token ratio. There were no significant interactions. Conclusion: The results help to elucidate the nature of reading comprehension in adults with TBI with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments and endorse further evaluation of reading comprehension strategies as a potential intervention option for these individuals. Future research is needed to better understand how individual differences influence a person’s reading and response to intervention.

80,"Learning from paper, learning from screens: Impact of screen reading and multitasking conditions on reading and writing among college students","Electronic screens on laptop and tablet computers are being used for reading text, often while multitasking. Two experimental studies with college students explored the effect of medium and opportunities to multitask on reading (Study 1) and report writing (Study 2). In study 1, participants (N = 120) read an easy and difficult passage on paper, a laptop, or tablet, while either multitasking or not multitasking. Neither multitasking nor medium impacted reading comprehension, but those who multitasked took longer to read both passages, indicating loss of efficiency with multitasking. In Study 2, participants (N = 67) were asked to synthesize source material in multiple texts to write a one-page evidence-based report. Participants read the source texts either on (1) paper, (2) computer screen without Internet or printer access, or (3) computer screen with Internet and printer access (called the 'real-world' condition). There were no differences in report quality or efficiency between those whose source materials were paper or computer. However, global report quality was significantly better when participants read source texts on a computer screen without Internet or printer access, compared with when they had Internet and printer access. Active use of paper for note-taking greatly reduced the negative impact of Internet and printer access in the real-world condition. Although participants expressed a preference for accessing information on paper, reading the texts on paper did not make a significant difference in report quality, compared with either of the two computer conditions.

81,When knowledge isn't power: The influence of prior knowledge on question generation training,"Is it possible to teach a learner to become a better question asker in as little as 25 minutes? Questions are believed to play a crucial role in a variety of cognitive faculties, including comprehension and reasoning. Available research suggests that learning how to ask good questions should be taught at an early age but all ages benefit from question generation training. Sadly, consistent with the research coming out of self-regulation, it is well documented that the ideal scenario of a curious question asker does not match reality. Students are unspectacular at monitoring their own knowledge deficits and their question generation is both infrequent and unsophisticated. Given that many teachers and school districts do not have the resources to provide individualized question training to students, the current study sought to explore the benefits of using animated pedagogical agents to teach question asking skills in a relatively short amount of time (approximately 25 minutes). Results revealed a significant difference in the quality of questions generated on the posttest as a function of condition.

82,An extensive reading strategy to promote online writing for elementary students in the 1:1 digital classroom,"The rapid development of the digital classroom has made it possible to combine extensive reading with online writing, yet research and development in this area are lacking. This study explores the impact of online writing after extensive reading in a classroom setting in China where there was one computer for each student (a 1:1 digital classroom). Thirty-nine fifth graders from an elementary school participated in the study. These students were divided into three groups with equivalent pretest score averages. Members of each group wrote Chinese compositions online after reading in one of the following three conditions in the same 1:1 digital classroom: (1) Objective-Focused Fast Extensive Reading (OFFER), an extensive reading strategy developed for and tested in this study; (2) one-size-fits-all extensive reading; (3) zero extensive reading, using only the class textbook. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using data from four sources: scores from three teacher judges, comments from those judges, comment icons from classmates, and writing speed data collected via the learning management system. The results indicated that the OFFER group showed significant superiority in writing quality and quantity compared to the other two groups. It is concluded that (1) extensive reading can be utilized not only for cultivating reading interest, but also for promoting writing, and (2) the OFFER strategy can lead to improved writing quality and fluency compared to one-size-fits-all extensive reading. Further suggestions for researchers and language teachers are proposed in the final part of the paper.

83,The effect of online summary assessment and feedback system on the summary writing on 6th graders: The LSA-based technique,"Studies on teaching of reading strategies have found that summarizing is of tremendous help to reading comprehension. However grading students’ summary writings is laborious, but given the importance of summarizing, an effective summarizing learning module is important. This study developed an automatic summary assessment and feedback system based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to provide score, concept and semantic feedback, and then investigated the effects of concept and semantic feedback on the writing of summaries by students in the sixth grade. The design involved two between-subject factors: semantic feedback (with, without) and concept feedback (with, without). 120 sixth-grade students from an elementary school were recruited for the study, and then were randomly assigned to each group. The overall results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system in improving the summary writing skills of students. The effects of semantic feedback and concept feedback were also discussed.

84,Interaction of a Vocabulary Quiz with Cognitive Instructional Strategies in First Language Learning among Japanese Undergraduates,"In response to concerns regarding effects of hyperlinked annotation on reading comprehension, this study was undertaken to compare hyperlinked annotation with student highlighting of unknown/difficult words. An online highlighting tool was used to help students reflect their prior vocabulary in a hyperlink-based annotated passage. Highlighting unknown/difficult words was expected to aid acquisition of those words, increase the reading comprehension of the passages, and decrease overall cognitive load. Japanese undergraduates (n = 80) were randomly assigned to each of following four conditions: treatment groups with and without a pretest vocabulary quiz, and control groups with and without the pretest. A Solomon four-group design was used because the pretest vocabulary quiz might provide students with time to reflect their prior knowledge and could, therefore, reduce the effect of the treatment. Results showed that highlighting unknown/difficult words in a hyperlink-based annotated passage was not effective on its own for enhancing vocabulary learning. On the other hand, the combination of a pretest vocabulary quiz and highlighting unknown/difficult words increased reading comprehension, and decreased perceived cognitive load. The vocabulary quiz was not intended to be part of the treatment but was discovered to be important as an adjunct to highlighting unknown/difficult words.",Cognitive Ability; Computer Assisted Instruction; Constructivism (Learning); Control Groups; Foreign Countries; Hypermedia; Japan (Tokyo); Japanese; Language Acquisition; Language Tests; Likert Scales; Pretests Posttests; Prior Learning; Questionnaires; Rating Scales; reading comprehension; Statistical Analysis; Teaching Methods; Undergraduate Students; Vocabulary Development,"Tomita, Kei",2016.0,,1,84
85,"Effects of Video-Based Peer Modeling on the Question Asking, Reading Motivation and Text Comprehension of Struggling Adolescent Readers","Struggling adolescent readers are distinct from others in two important ways: (1) They are ""adolescents""; and (2) they have a ""history"" of struggle with reading. Good pedagogy prescribes that effective programs ""meet students where they are."" For middle-school students, this means meeting them in adolescence. Adolescents are more concerned with social norms and more susceptible to peer influence than younger children. Additionally, the fact that these youth are still struggling after years of reading instruction suggests that their motivation to persist at reading is likely to have suffered. To fully support and engage such adolescents, reading programs must leverage social processes and 1 explicit support for motivation and strategy use. This dissertation investigated the effects of a peer modeling instructional intervention on early adolescents' question asking, reading motivation and comprehension. Videotaped peer models demonstrated the use of question asking for comprehension and motivated participants to use the strategy. Participants were 48 sixth graders who attended public schools in New York City. Eighty-five percent were classified as reading below grade level. After completing an interactive tutorial on question asking, all students read a moderately challenging, computer-based science text. While doing so, participants in the Peer Modeling condition observed same-age, similar-ability peer models asking authentic questions about the text. After reading, all participants generated their own questions, completed a short survey, and were assessed for reading comprehension. The research found that peer modeling had a positive effect on the quality of questions that students asked and their text comprehension. Participants exposed to peer modeling asked more questions that were ""not"" answered in the text and more deep-level ""I'm Confused"" questions. They better understood the solution component of the text and recalled more critical idea units. Peer modeling did not affect participants' motivation or accuracy of comprehension judgments. In contrast to previous research, the study also found that students asked numerous deep-level questions, but that these questions were not necessarily linked to greater understanding. Additionally, higher motivation was ""not"" associated with greater comprehension. These findings have implications for the design of systems to support struggling readers and for theory-building about reading comprehension.

86,The Effects of a Peer-Tutoring Strategy on Children's e-Book Reading Comprehension,"Reading competence is one of the most critical skills for children's academic success. In the study reported on here we proposed an integrated peer-tutoring strategy for reading comprehension that employs e-books for elementary school students. The effects of this strategy on children's reading comprehension were investigated using a quasi-experimental design. Three classes of 11-12-year-old students (n = 73) participated in the study for 12 weeks. Compared to the control group, students in the experimental group, who engaged in peer tutoring with e-book reading, showed significant gains in reading comprehension. Students' perceptions of the benefits of the peer-tutoring resources to their reading are discussed. The findings demonstrate that the integration of peer tutoring in e-book reading results in an effective instructional model for the enhancement of elementary school students' reading.",Achievement Tests; Books; Electronic Publishing; Elementary School Students; Foreign Countries; Grade 5; Handheld Devices; instructional effectiveness; Interaction; International Assessment; Peer Teaching; Preadolescents; Progress in International Reading Literacy Study; reading comprehension; Reading strategies; Reading Tests; reciprocal teaching; Student Attitudes; Taiwan (Taipei); Tutoring,"Tsuei, Mengping; Huang, Hsiu-Wen; Cheng, Shu-Fen",2020.0,,1,86
87,Effective teaching practices in reading for ninth-grade students in at-risk situations,"High school students in at-risk situations pose one of the greatest challenges to the educational system. Many students in at-risk situations do not possess a sufficient foundation of reading skills or strategies. Much attention has been focused on the best method to teach students in at-risk situations who are experiencing difficulties in reading. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the PLATO Reading Program on the reading achievement of ninth-grade students in at-risk situations. More specifically, the researcher was concerned with the influence of instructional strategies used in the PLATO Reading Program versus instructional strategies of the MILS Program and the TRI Program on the reading achievement of ninth-grade students in at-risk situations. Additionally, this study was designed to ascertain the influence of the variables gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and teachers' attitudes on the reading performance of ninth-grade students in at-risk situations. A Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design was used in this study. One hundred fifty-one (151) at-risk ninth-grade students attending a school district in the southern region of Texas were selected to participate in the study. The Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) examination was used to collect data. Data were treated using two parametric procedures: the One-Way Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and the One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). All hypotheses were tested at the .05 level or better. Analysis of data revealed that ninth-grade students in at-risk situations who were exposed to the Multiple Intelligences and Learning Style method had significantly higher reading scores than their peers who were exposed to the Computer-Assisted method or the Traditional Instruction method. The variables gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status did not produce a significant effect on the reading achievement scores of ninth-grade students in at-risk situations. Furthermore, the type of attitudes held by teachers of ninth-grade students in at-risk situations regarding their reading program was significant. It is recommended that educators who teach at schools with a high number of students in at-risk situations should expose these students to activities that are flexible and that fit their academic and psychological needs. Additionally, educators who are responsible for developing and implementing strategies to improve the academic performance of ninth-grade students in at-risk situation, particularly in reading, should create modules that take into account academic factors more so than demographic factors.

88,Comprehension and Writing Strategy Training Improves Performance on Content-Specific Source-Based Writing Tasks,"Source-based essays are evaluated both on the quality of the writing and the content appropriate interpretation and use of source material. Hence, composing a high-quality source-based essay (an essay written based on source material) relies on skills related to both reading (the sources) and writing (the essay) skills. As such, source-based writing must involve language comprehension and production processes. The purpose of the current study is to examine the impact of reading, writing, and blended (i.e., reading and writing) strategy training on students' performance on a content-specific, source-based essay writing task. In contrast to general source-based writing tasks, content-specific source-based writing tasks are tasks wherein writers are provided the source material on which to base their essays. Undergraduate students (n = 175) were provided with strategy instruction and practice in the context of two intelligent tutoring systems, ""Writing Pal"" and ""Interactive Strategy Training for Active Reading and Thinking"" (iSTART). Results indicated that participants in the blended strategy training condition produced higher quality source-based essays than participants in the reading comprehension-only, writing-only, or control condition, with no differences observed between the latter three conditions. Further, the benefits of this blended strategy instruction remained significant regardless of prior reading and writing skills, or time on task.

89,Examining the efficacy of using iPod Touches to deliver reading comprehension strategy instruction and to provide electronic text support on the reading comprehension performance of sixth-grade students,"Instructional use of the iPod Touch is increasing as evidenced by anecdotal reports of its efficacy as a learning tool. However, research documenting the impact of this technology has been limited. This study was based on the following research questions: (a) Does providing explicit reading comprehension strategy instruction using an iPod Touch increase students' reading comprehension outcomes based on standardized reading tests and multiple-choice probe measures when compared to a No Support comparison group? (b) Does providing different types of electronic text support increase students' reading comprehension outcomes, and if so, which type of support is most effective? (c) Does providing different levels of electronic text support influence students' attitudes toward the use of comprehension strategies as well as using an iPod Touch for this task? Participants 1d 155 sixth-grade students at a public middle school. Students were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups; (a) Notational Only support (a note-taking sheet), (b) Notational + Instructional support (embedded prompts), and (c) Notational + Instructional + Translational support (audio version of the text and prompts) and received reading comprehension strategy instruction and text support using an iPod Touch. An intact No Support (N = 61) group that did not receive instruction or text support but read the texts using an iPod Touch was used as a quasi-experimental comparison group. Two standardized reading comprehension measures were employed at pretest and posttest as well as researcher developed probe measures that were used throughout the study. An ANOVA analysis determined that no statistically significant differences existed between the groups at pretest. An ANCOVA with pretest scores as a covariate found no statistically significant differences between groups on the standardized reading comprehension measures. Because of a high level of variation among the probe measure data, including significant missing data, these results were not analyzed statistically and were reported descriptively. Students responded positively to survey questions about using the iPod Touch for summarization strategy instruction and the text supports.

90,Training and Generalization Effects of a Reading Comprehension Learning Strategy on Computer and Paper-Pencil Assessments,"Many schools use computer-based testing to measure students' progress for end-of-the-year and statewide assessments. There is little research to support whether computer-based testing accurately reflects student progress, particularly among students with learning, performance, and generalization difficulties. This article summarizes an investigation of a reading strategy on comprehension of expository and narrative text; comprehension was assessed using both paper- and computer-based tasks. Results showed that students increased their learning strategy use and reading comprehension accuracy when using the strategy on computer-based assessments with expository text. Also students generalized their strategy use to paper-pencil assessments with narrative text. Reading comprehension of narrative passages also increased. The results suggest the value of teaching a reading strategy to students who struggle with both paper-pencil and computer-based assessments of comprehension.",Accuracy; Computer Assisted Testing; Elementary School Students; Experimental Groups; Expository Writing; Generalization; intervention; Learning Strategies; reading comprehension; Reading Difficulties; Reading strategies; Teaching Methods; Test Format; United States (Southeast),"Worrell, Jamie; Duffy, Mary Lou; Brady, Michael P.; Dukes, Charles; Gonzalez-DeHass, Alyssa",2016.0,,1,90
91,Effects of an Interactive Computer-Based Reading Strategy on Student Comprehension,"The computer-based testing mode has received limited research as a task condition for elementary students as it relates to comprehension for both narrative and expository text. The majority of schools now use computer-based testing to measure students' progress for end of the year exams. Additionally, schools are also delivering state-wide assessments like the Florida Comprehension Assessment Test through computer-based testing instead of paper-pencil testing. There is little research to indicate whether computer-based assessments are an effective way to measure student progress.    This study investigated the effects of an interactive computer-based reading strategy on student comprehension for both expository and narrative passages. The intervention evaluated students' percentage of learned strategy use and comprehension accuracy for expository computer-based passages. Additionally, the intervention measured whether students generalized the learned strategy when given a paper-pencil narrative passage and whether generalization of strategy use improved comprehension accuracy. This study used an A-B-A-B design across participants, with a follow-up phase. The results from the data showed that all students made significant increases in strategy use from baseline to follow-up. Additionally, all the students had an increase in comprehension accuracy from baseline to follow-up for both computer and paper-based passages. All students were able to generalize successfully the strategy use to narrative passages, and improved their comprehension accuracy of narrative passages. The effects of the study suggest the value of teaching students the interactive computer-based reading strategy for students who struggle with passage comprehension.

92,A collaborative multimedia annotation tool for enhancing knowledge sharing in CSCL,"Knowledge sharing in computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) requires intensive social interactions among participants, typically in the form of annotations. An annotation refers to an explicit expression of knowledge that is attached to a document to reveal the conceptual meanings of an annotator’s implicit thoughts. In this research, we develop a Semantic Web and Web services-supported multimedia tool to facilitate collaborative annotation sharing in the context of CSCL. Our experimental results demonstrate that our tool can facilitate knowledge sharing and improve participating students’ reading comprehension: it helps participants to raise good questions and provide proper answers through the practice of reading, commenting, reviewing, and discussion.

93,The effect of collaborative annotation on Chinese reading level in primary schools in China,"As school networks get more available, reading instruction in a computer classroom has become more and more popular in China. Although information and communication technology (ICT) has brought about some improvements in classroom teaching, it must be admitted that the phenomenon of fast reading with low-level cognitions is threatening school children’s reading literacy. In order to address this problem, a collaborative annotation tool called Sharing Unique Reading Feeling (SURF) was developed for creating and sharing annotations. This study explored SURF-based collaborative reading instruction, and investigated the effect of collaborative annotation supported by SURF on primary school students’ Chinese reading levels with methods of equal group experiment, interview and comparative analysis. Finally, some suggestions were proposed for the development of instructional annotation tools and the implementation of current reading instruction especially in computer classrooms. Results showed that the collaborative annotation supported by SURF could promote students’ reading performance, enhance their Chinese reading levels in primary schools, and it was also helpful to develop the higher-level cognitive abilities such as analyzing, summarizing and evaluating.

94,Improving the Expository Reading Comprehension of Students with Disabilities through the Use of the RACE! Process and Class-Wide Peer Tutoring,"The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) have brought about changes in reading instruction in order to better prepare students for post-secondary education and productivity in all career fields. An important feature in the elementary (K-5) CCSS is the increased exposure to informational texts and the requirement for students to read expository selections during 50% of their reading instruction. Students with disabilities tend to be passive readers who either lack the ability to comprehend or fail to activate reading comprehension strategies to access information within textual material. Research has shown students with disabilities often fail to monitor and evaluate their understanding of expository texts. With the changes associated with the CCSS, the need for alternative strategies has come to a forefront. The current study was designed to examine the use of a technologically enhanced reading intervention aligned with CCSS curriculum to improve the overall expository reading comprehension of students with disabilities at the elementary level. This research examines the application of the Read, Ask Questions, Claim, and Evidence (RACE!) process in both peer-mediated and self-regulated conditions. Results suggest the intervention package improved the reading comprehension of students with and without disabilities and was equally successful during self-regulated use. Rates of improvement (ROI) suggest RACE! has the potential to close comprehension gaps in struggling readers.

95,Eye Tracking Indicators of Reading Approaches in Text-Picture Comprehension,"Despite numerous studies on reading and multimedia comprehension, the usage of text and picture with different reading strategies has rarely become a focus of research. The current study aims to explore whether the usage of text differs from the usage of picture when readers follow different strategies of knowledge acquisition. In a within-subjects design using eye tracking, seventeen secondary school students comprehended blended text and picture materials with three different strategies. (1) Initial coherence-formation strategy, which requires students to process text and picture unguidedly. (2) Consecutive task-oriented strategy, which requires them to gather information to answer the question (which explains the task) provided after prior experience with text and picture. (3) Initial task-oriented strategy, which requires them to comprehend text and picture to solve the task equipped with the prior information about the question from the beginning. Eye tracking data showed that text and picture play different roles in these processing conditions. (1) The results are in line with the assumption that text (rather than picture) is more likely used to construct mental models in initial coherence-formation processing of text and picture. (2) Students seem to primarily rely on the picture to answer the question after the prior experience with the material with consecutive task-oriented strategy. (3) Text and picture are both used heavily when the question is presented first, enabling students to selectively process question-relevant aspects of the material at first contact.",Accuracy; Cognitive Processes; Educational Experiments; Eye Movements; Foreign Countries; Germany; Hypothesis Testing; Illustrations; Multimedia Instruction; Multimedia Materials; problem solving; Reader Text Relationship; reading comprehension; Reading strategies; Scores; Secondary School Students; Statistical Analysis; Task Analysis; Textbooks,"Zhao, Fang; Schnotz, Wolfgang; Wagner, Inga; Gaschler, Robert",2014.0,,1,95
96,Using the Summarizing Strategy to Engage Learners: Empirical Evidence in an Immersive Virtual Reality Environment,"According to the current literature, it is unknown whether summarizing can enhance learning and engagement in an immersive environment. To fill this gap, we conducted an experimental study to investigate the potential effects of using summarizing strategy in an immersive virtual reality learning environment on comprehension, cognitive load, and intrinsic motivation. Seventy-five college students were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions formed by a 2 × 2 factorial design with the immersive environment (virtual reality vs. interactive video) as one factor and the use of the summarizing strategy (yes vs. no) as the other factor. The results indicated that (a) summarizing significantly reduced learners' perceived effort; (b) summarizing resulted in lower perceived success than not summarizing in the interactive video condition; and (c) learning from the immersive virtual reality environment led to increased interest and value.

97,Digital annotation tools and comprehension,"This quantitative, quasi-experimental study posed the question: does using a digital annotation strategy increase high school students' comprehension of expository texts? Using a repeated measures design, this study analyzes students' comprehension test scores with two different types of annotation treatments: handwritten annotations and digital annotations using Microsoft Word Track Changes. It also compares these results to a more traditional note-taking strategy, Cornell Notes. Hypothesized results predicted that students exposed to the digital annotation strategy would have increased comprehension test scores than when using handwritten annotations, or the Cornell Notes strategy. However, results show that when using handwritten annotations, students did better on comprehension tests than they did when using the other two strategies. The results also indicated no interactions between the treatment schedules and comprehension test scores. Lastly, student attitude surveys displayed that motivation is a key factor to consider when choosing an annotation strategy, as more students liked using digital annotations, even though they did not score as high in their tests of comprehension when using this strategy.

One-hundred sixty-four sixth grades students were placed in one of two conditions: PALS treatment or control. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was utilized to compare the effects of treatment between the two groups. Students in the PALS and control groups received the same amount of reading instruction during the 13 weeks of the study. The PALS group received supplemental PALS reading instruction in addition to the district curriculum while the control group used only the district reading curriculum. Quantitative data were collected from pre and post-test measures for reading comprehension (Scholastic Reading Inventory and DIBELS Daze), fluency (DIBELS ORF), and attitude toward reading (Elementary Reading Attitude Survey). Qualitative data were collected in the form of reflection posts from an online site called Kidblog, and a teacher interview protocol. Findings did not reveal any statistical difference in reading comprehension, fluency, or attitude between PALS and control groups. However, both PALS and control groups showed positive gains in comprehension and fluency over the course of the study which suggested teaching reading comprehension strategies can assist students with nonfiction texts.

A composite of classroom contextual variables consisting of instructional support for choice, importance, collaboration, and competence, accompanied by cognitive scaffolding for informational text comprehension, was provided in four‐week instructional units for 615 grade 7 students. These classroom motivational‐engagement supports were implemented within integrated literacy/history instruction in the Concept‐Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) framework. CORI increased informational text comprehension compared with traditional instruction (TI) in a switching replications experimental design. Students' perceptions of the motivational‐engagement supports were associated with increases in students' intrinsic motivation, value, perceived competence, and increased positive engagement (dedication) more markedly in CORI than in TI, according to multiple regression analyses. Results extended the evidence for the effectiveness of CORI to literacy/history subject matter and informational text comprehension among middle school students.

101,Read Naturally. What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report,"""Read Naturally"" is designed to improve reading fluency using a combination of books, audio-tapes, and computer software. This program 1s three main strategies: (1) repeated reading of English text for oral reading fluency development; (2) teacher modeling of story reading; and (3) systematic monitoring of student progress by teachers. Students work at a reading level appropriate for their achievement level, progress through the program at their own rate, and work, for the most part, on an independent basis. The ""Read Naturally"" strategy is designed to increase time spent reading by combining teacher modeling, repeated reading, and progress monitoring. One study (Denton, Anthony, Parker, & Hasbrouck, 2004) reviewed by the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) investigated the effects of a modified version of ""Read Naturally"" on an English language learner sample. Although there was random assignment to treatment groups, three students assigned to the control group were reassigned to the treatment group, and three students assigned to the treatment group were reassigned to the control group one week after the study had begun (as requested by the participating schools). The part of Denton, Anthony, Parker, and Hasbrouck (2004) that examined ""Read Naturally"" 1d 60 participants. The ""Read Naturally"" intervention group received English language pull-out tutoring during the school day in addition to their regular English instruction. The control group received only their regular English instruction. Denton and colleagues (2004) reported, and the WWC confirmed, no statistically significant differences between the intervention and comparison groups on students' reading achievement. In addition, the average effect size was small and deemed not substantively important. Therefore, the one study reviewed showed no discernible effects.

102,Microblogging through Twitter for Developing EFL Student Teachers' Critical Reading and Summarization Skills,"Currently language learning is being facilitated by social networks and microblogging, which emerged as a quite new form of communication and content sharing through which users can publish online some small pieces of digital content. This relates to connectivism, a learning theory that views learning as the process of creating connections and expanding or increasing network complexity. While writing, EFL student teachers at Assiut University Faculty of Education always presented content that was full of redundancy and excessive elaboration. In addition, they demonstrated poor critical reading skills necessary for giving clear and comprehensive summaries of the linguistic content encountered online. Therefore, the present study aims at investigating the effect of microblogging through Twitter on developing those student teachers' critical reading and summarization skills. To accomplish this aim, a review of literature was made supported with some open interviews with EFL specialists to come out with a list of those critical reading skills (3 main skills and 18 sub-skills) and another list of those summarization skills (4 main skills and 24 sub-skills) needed by EFL student teachers. Accordingly, a pre-test on those skills was administered to a group of 50 EFL student teachers (research participants). Then, a microblogging model based on Twitter was experimented with participants for 5 weeks. Finally, a post-test on critical reading and summarization skills was administered to participants, and the means of scores were compared. Results indicated statistically significant differences between the participants' means of scores in both the pre and post-administration of the two tests, and thus microblogging through Twitter was found to be effective in developing EFL student teachers' critical reading and summarization skills. Based on these results, many suggestions and recommendations were presented.",Critical Reading; Documentation; Egypt; Electronic Publishing; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Preservice Teacher Education; Preservice Teachers; Program Effectiveness; Reading Skills; Second Language Instruction; Skill Development; Social Media; Web Sites,"Abdallah, Mahmoud M.

103,The Effects of ABRACADABRA on Reading Outcomes: A Meta-Analysis of Applied Field Research,"This meta-analysis summarizes research on the effects of a comprehensive, interactive web-based software (AXXX) on the development of reading competencies among kindergarteners and elementary students. Findings from seven randomized control trials and quasi-experimental studies undertaken in a variety of contexts across Canada, Australia and Kenya were reviewed and analyzed. Comparing the experimental groups that used AXXX to the control groups exposed to regular literacy instruction, the studies produced sixty-five independent effect sizes in six outcome categories, as defined by the National Reading Panel (NRP, 2000). The average effects were: (1) Phonics: g+ = 0.150, (k = 17, N = 914), p < 0.05; (2) Phonemic Awareness: g+ = 0.323, (k = 19, N = 1550), p < 0.001; (3) Reading Fluency: g+ = 0.082, (k = 5, N = 1522), p > 0.05 (ns); (4) Reading Comprehension: g+ = 0.087, (k = 5, N = 923), p > 0.05 (ns); •Listening Comprehension: g+ = 0.430, (k = 5, N = 846), p < 0.001; and (5) Vocabulary Knowledge: g+ = 0.031, (k = 14, N = 964), p > 0.05 (ns). The random effects model non-independent weighted overall average effect was g+ = 0.191 (k = 65). All but one of the average effect size distributions were homogeneous, suggesting that the observed effects are generally representative of the impact that AXXX may have on novice readers. The paper concludes with a discussion of AXXX classroom uses including implementation fidelity and offers the implications of the findings for future research and development.",Achievement Tests; Australia; Canada; Comparative Analysis; Computer Assisted Instruction; computer software; Control Groups; Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS); Effect Size; Elementary School Students; Emergent literacy; Experimental Groups; Foreign Countries; Hong Kong; Kenya; Kindergarten; Listening Comprehension; Literature Reviews; Measures (Individuals); Meta Analysis; Phonemic Awareness; Phonics; Quasiexperimental Design; Randomized Controlled Trials; reading comprehension; Reading Fluency; reading instruction; Reading Tests; Technology Uses in Education; Vocabulary Skills; Wide Range Achievement Test; Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement; Young Children,"Abrami, Philip; Borohkovski, Eugene; Lysenko, Larysa",2015.0,,0,103
104,Hypermedia annotation presentation: The effect of location and type on the ELF learners’ achievement in reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition,"This study investigated the effect of gloss presentation in different text locations whilst participants read EFL texts in a hypermedia environment. Seventy-eight undergraduate EFL learners read and summarized seven texts and completed a vocabulary assessment. The number of propositions recalled in each summary was recorded. The data suggest that reading passages with hypermedia annotations significantly benefits passage comprehension and vocabulary (compared to reading passages with no annotations). The best performance was observed in the condition where glosses were placed after the glossed word. The study also reported large observed score mean differences for the definition gloss type of 3–5-words.

105,Hypermedia Annotation Presentation: Learners' Preferences and Effect on EFL Reading Comprehension and Vocabulary Acquisition,"This study explored whether hypermedia annotation presentation in different locations of the text facilitates EFL vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension. It also examined participants' preferences for the location of hypermedia-annotated text (at the end of the text, in the margin, at the bottom of the screen, or in a pop-up window). Data were collected from 80 intermediate adult EFL learners who read annotated texts and received support in different conditions of hypermedia annotations. A survey of prior knowledge was carried out, followed by vocabulary and reading comprehension tests, and a questionnaire. Results indicated that students who had access to hypermedia annotations outperformed their peers who used traditional glosses listed at the end of the text. There was also a positive impact for texts with hypermedia annotations located in the margin of the text. Learners also preferred hypermedia annotation presentation in the margin. Finally, no relationship was found between participants' preferences and their level of achievement.

106,Effects of multimedia annotations on incidental vocabulary learning and reading comprehension of advanced learners of English as a foreign language,"The study investigates immediate and delayed effects of different hypermedia glosses on incidental vocabulary learning and reading comprehension of advanced foreign language learners. Sixty-nine freshman TEFL students studying at a Turkish university were randomly assigned to three types of annotations: (a) definitions of words, (b) definitions coupled with associated pictures, and (c) definitions coupled with associated short videos. Subjects were asked to read an annotated text with the intention of comprehension. The data were collected through a vocabulary pre-test, a vocabulary post-test, a delayed vocabulary test as well as a reading comprehension test. In order to measure incidental vocabulary learning, subjects were not told that they were going to be given vocabulary tests. Results showed that the groups that had access to definitions along with both types of visuals had significantly higher vocabulary scores on both immediate and delayed posttests than the definition only group. However, no differences were observed on the reading comprehension test. Finally, the qualitative data revealed that hypermedia reading had positive impact on participants' attitudes towards foreign language reading and vocabulary learning.

107,Variables Predicting Foreign Language Reading Comprehension and Vocabulary Acquisition in a Linear Hypermedia Environment,"Factors predicting vocabulary learning and reading comprehension of advanced language learners of English in a linear multimedia text were investigated in the current study. Predictor variables of interest were multimedia type, reading proficiency, learning styles, topic interest and background knowledge about the topic. The outcome variables of interest were vocabulary and reading comprehension scores. Participants were 69 undergraduates enrolled at the foreign language teaching department of a Turkish university. Participants were randomly assigned to three different forms of an authentic electronic text, which differed from each other based on the type of multimedia: (a) definition of words, (b) definitions coupled with pictures, and (c) definitions coupled with short movies. The participants were given the text to read for general comprehension and were given an unannounced vocabulary test along with a reading comprehension test. Multiple regression analyses with vocabulary scores and reading scores as the criterion variables and the independent variables as the predictors served to reveal whether a relationship existed between the independent and dependent variables. Findings suggest that annotation type, reading ability, and prior topical knowledge are important variables contributing to vocabulary learning whilst reading ability and learning styles (visual score) are important variables contributing to reading comprehension in a hypermedia environment.",Cognitive Style; Correlation; Definitions; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Hypermedia; knowledge level; Multimedia Instruction; Predictor Variables; Reading Ability; reading comprehension; Reading Skills; Second Language Instruction; Second Languages; Student Interests; Turkey; Undergraduate Students; Vocabulary Development,"Akbulut, Yavuz",2007.0,,0,107
108,Teachers’ perceptions of the use of computer assisted language learning to develop children’s reading skills in English as a second language in the United Arab Emirates,"This study investigated ESL teachers’ perceptions regarding the use of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) in teaching reading to children. A random sample of 145 teachers participated in the study by completing a survey developed by the researchers. To explore the situation in depth, 16 teachers were later interviewed. Results indicated that the main purpose of using CALL with children is to help them develop reading strategies and increase their motivation. The most common strategies teachers reported using were computers to: enhance children's reading skills, support children's reading, listen to stories read aloud, recognize letter/sound relationships, and identify letters and beginning sounds of words. Teachers reported that CALL has some benefits, such as providing opportunities for active interaction and differentiated instruction. The main barriers of using CALL are the lack of resources and suitable software and hardware. The study ended with recommendations for further research and instructional improvements.

109,The Many Facets and Applications of Text Structure in Supporting Educational Trajectories of Elementary and Middle Grade Children in Content Area Reading Comprehension and Writing,"Content area reading comprehension and writing have been a challenge for children in the U.S. schools for many years as evidenced by state and national assessments. One promising solution to the problem is text structure based instruction that promotes strategic selection, encoding, retrieval, and use of information for myriads of activities within the learning environment and beyond. The text structure based instruction has been researched extensively since 1975 (Meyer, 1975; Meyer, Brandt, and Bluth 1980; Meyer, Middlemiss, Theodorou, Brezinski, McDougall, and Bartlett 2002; Meyer, Wijekumar, Middlemiss, Higley, Lei, Meier, and Spielvogel 2010; Williams, Hall, Lauer, Stafford, DeSisto, and deCani 2005; Williams, Stafford, Lauer, Hall, and Pollini 2009) and has received considerable attention with the adoption of the Common Core State Standards by many states. The goal of this panel presentation is to showcase how text structure instruction can be designed for early and upper elementary school children and middle grade students. Brief descriptions of each presentation are provided and all other sections of the structured abstract presenting information about the large scale randomized controlled efficacy trials on the web-based intelligent tutoring system for the structure strategy (ITSS). ITSS is a web-based intelligent tutoring system designed to provide modeling, practice, assessment, scaffolding, and feedback to the learner. The study also posed exploratory questions to study whether the effect of ITSS delivered instruction about the structure strategy on reading comprehension varies depending on other factors, such as gender, initial reading comprehension proficiency, and locale. Children in the ITSS classrooms at all grade levels statistically significantly outperformed the children in control classrooms on all researcher designed measures of reading comprehension (e.g., comparison main idea quality, signaling word knowledge).

110,Examining EFL Learners' Reading Comprehension: The Impact of Metacognitive Strategies Discussion and Collaborative Learning within Multimedia e-Book Dialogic Environments,"For most English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners, both reading and comprehension skills are challenging to acquire. EFL students find reading challenging due to their inability to comprehend and interpret text information, which may lead, at times, to demotivation and loss of interest. The current study intends to explore how Saudi EFL learners may better tackle reading comprehension challenges by examining the utilization of metacognitive reading strategies through discussion and extensive collaborative learning activities within a multimedia e-book dialogic environment. Accordingly, the study investigates the impact of teaching metacognitive strategy-based discussion and collaborative learning on students' application of the reading strategies. It also investigates the influence of metacognitive strategy-based discussion (MS), collaborative learning (CL), and the combined use of MS and CL on EFL learners' reading comprehension. Since an e-book dialogic environment epitomizes the main tenets of this study, the study equally explores how Saudi EFL learners perceive the effectiveness of the multimedia e-book environment on their overall reading comprehension. The participants were 115 Saudi female students at the intermediate college-level from the English Language Institution at a Saudi University. A mixed-methods quantitative-qualitative approach was employed. The findings showed impactful results for learners' application of the reading strategies after being exposed to the treatment. Significant results were found on the effect of the metacognitive strategy-based discussion on learners' reading comprehension. Collaborative learning showed a statistically significant influence on participants' reading comprehension. However, the results did not show interaction between the MS and CL on students' reading comprehension. Although teaching the MS with CL showed positive impact on students' final reading scores, more research is needed to prove the efficacy of teaching MS with CL. The qualitative findings revealed that the MS-based discussion and collaborative learning was beneficial for EFL students in improving focus on the text, use of strategies, comprehension and reading performance. Participants evaluated the multimedia e-book features of discussion board, videos, glossing and illustrations based on their effectiveness. Both advantages and disadvantage of the e-book environment are addressed and compared to the traditional face-to-face classroom. The study concludes with pedagogical implications for EFL instructors, learners, and future researchers, and also provides limitations and recommended future research recommendations.

111,The Impact of Online Reading Tasks and Reading Strategies on EFL Learners' Reading Test Scores,"Integration of technology in foreign language classes has long been a matter of interest for researchers. Yet, studies have often yielded indecisive and conflicting results. Besides, there have been few, if any, studies exploring the relationship between learners' use of metacognitive reading strategies and their performance in reading tests. The aim of this study is thus to investigate not only the impact of online reading tasks on tertiary level EFL students' test scores at a Public University in Turkey but also the role of metacognitive reading strategies they used on their test scores. A total of 51 Turkish-speaking adult learners took part in this study--25 of them were in the experimental group who were assigned online reading tasks during the term, and another 26 students were in the control group who continued reading on paper. A pre-test and a post-test, which were paper-based, were given to the two groups consisting of 20 multiple choice and lasting 30 minutes each. To detect the learners' metacognitive reading strategies, Turkish version of Mokhtari and Reichard's (2002) Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies was conducted. The pre- and post-test scores of experiment and control group and their responses to the survey were statistically analyzed through SPSS version 20.0. The results indicated that there was not a significant difference between test scores of experiment and control group after 6-week treatment. Besides, a one-way ANOVA revealed that none of the strategies was favored by the learners. As such, the results showed that online reading tasks and reading strategies did not show any effect on learners' reading comprehensions. It was implicated in the study that stakeholders should be cautioned about the use of technology in the language classroom and expectances regarding online reading tasks potential to bring about changes in reading scores.",College Students; Comparative Analysis; Computer Assisted Testing; Control Groups; Correlation; English (Second Language); Experimental Groups; Foreign Countries; Higher Education; Metacognition; Multiple Choice Tests; Pretests Posttests; Quasiexperimental Design; reading comprehension; Reading strategies; Reading Tests; Scores; Second Language Instruction; Second Language Learning; Statistical Analysis; Teaching Methods; Technology Integration; Turkey; Turkish,"Altay, Ismail Firat; Altay, Ayse",2017.0,,0,111
112,Technology-based intervention in L2 reading comprehension: Toward digital scaffolding,"Technology has created abundant resources and opportunities for language learners to enhance their reading comprehension competencies. Despite an increase in access to written input, reading comprehension has stayed challenging for many, including language learners. Digital scaffolding can contribute to improving reading comprehension skills for L2 learners. Motivated by such a premise, in this study, alternative implementations of digital scaffolding have been tested in an English as a Foreign language (EFL) context and their impacts assessed. Two digital scaffolding interventions were examined including contextual conversation (COC) and adjunct questions (AJQ). A total of 172 EFL students read two reading passages in three different conditions: COC, AJQ, and control. In COC, a conversation focused on the primary concepts of the text was 1d prior to reading the passages. In AJQ, six questions were inserted within each of the reading passages. The assessments 1d Pathfinder Network Scaling, multiple-choice questions, fill in the Blank test, familiarity question, and interest question. The results of the study provided evidence that both of the treatments were effective with statistically significant differences between the COC group and controls on most measures and statistically significant differences between the AJQ group and controls on some measures. Furthermore, Pathfinder scaling revealed both treatment groups displayed a better organization of the passage according to the graph representation. However, the COC group displayed fewer missing links than the AJQ group and the network properties of the COC were more similar to the network properties identified by experts for both passages. Additionally, the study measured the participants' overall use of reading strategies using the Survey of Reading Strategies (SORS). The findings suggested a medium use of reading strategies by the study participants. The overall findings suggest that although both interventions have potential, COC may be a more potent strategy than AJQ for EFL learners. In light of the fact that reading is a critical skill determining school success, the present study contributes to the evidence that digital scaffolding can successfully be implemented as an intervention to improve learners' reading comprehension.

113,Effect of Inclusion versus Segregation on Reading Comprehension of EFL Learners with Dyslexia: Case of Lebanon,"This study reports the relative effectiveness of the inclusion theory when the combined strategy instruction on improving the reading comprehension of narrative and expository texts for students with dyslexia is implemented. A total sample of 298 students of English as a foreign language from both public and private schools participated in the study which employed a pre-test-post-test control group design to investigate the efficacy of combined strategy instruction consisting of Graphic organizers, Visual displays, Mnemonic illustrations, Computer exercises, Prediction, Inference, Text structure awareness, Main idea identification, Summarization, and Questioning. The study concluded that combined strategy instruction in the field of the inclusion theory is more effective than regular instruction in improving reading comprehension when using narrative texts, but there's no difference, when using expository texts. There was no significant difference neither by gender nor by school types in all the grade levels under study.",Age Differences; Comparative Analysis; Dyslexia; educational technology; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; gender differences; Grade 10; Grade 7; Grade 8; Grade 9; Inclusion; Inferences; Institutional Characteristics; Lebanon; Mnemonics; Prediction; Pretests Posttests; Questioning Techniques; Randomized Controlled Trials; reading comprehension; Reading Difficulties; Scoring; Second Language Learning; Statistical Analysis; Teaching Methods; Technology Uses in Education; Visual Stimuli,"Awada, Ghada M.; Gutiérrez-Colón, Mar",2017.0,,0,113
114,Examination the Metacognitive Reading Strategies of Secondary School Sixth Grade Students,"The aim of this study is to investigate the use of metacognitive reading strategies of the sixth grade middle school students. The method of this research is survey design. Multistage cluster sampling was used to determine the sample. The sample of the study consisted of 388 students attending five public schools randomly selected. The sample of the students consisted of 200 girls; 188 are boys. The metacognitive reading questionnaire was used to determine the metacognitive reading strategies used by the students. The metacognitive reading strategies scale was applied by the researcher in the classroom environment. The survey was conducted by the researcher. The data obtained as a result of these applications were uploaded to the computer, the percentage, frequency, t test results were reached by using SPSS 20. According to the results of the study, sixth grade students frequently use pre-reading, pre- and post-metacognitive reading strategies, and less frequently recall strategies.

115,"Child-Centered Reading Intervention: See, Talk, Dictate, Read, Write!","Poor reading achievement of children in elementary schools has been one of the major concerns in education. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a child-centered reading intervention in eliminating the reading problems of a student with poor reading achievement. The research was conducted with a student having difficulty in reading. A reading intervention was designed that targeted multiple areas of reading and aimed to improve reading skills through the use of multiple strategies. This intervention is child-centered and 1s visual aids, talking, dictating, reading and writing stages. The study was performed in 35 sessions consisting of stages of a single sentence (5 sessions), two sentences (5 sessions), three sentences (20 sessions) and the text stage (5 sessions). The intervention sessions were audio-taped. These recordings and the written responses to the reading comprehension questions provided the data for analysis. The findings on the reading intervention revealed positive outcomes. The student exhibited certain improvements at the levels of reading, reading rate and reading comprehension. These results were discussed in the literature and the findings suggest that child-centered reading strategies such as talking, dictating and writing should be the main focus of instruction for students with low reading literacy achievement to enable these students to meet the demands of the curriculum.",Case Studies; Elementary School Students; Foreign Countries; Grade 4; intervention; Low Achievement; Outcomes of Education; Pretests Posttests; Program Effectiveness; Qualitative Research; Reading Aloud to Others; Reading Difficulties; Reading Fluency; Reading Improvement; reading instruction; Reading Programs; Reading Skills; Reading strategies; Student Centered Learning; Turkey; Tutoring; Verbal Communication,"Bastug, Muhammet; Demirtas, Gonca",2016.0,,0,115
116,A Quantitative Investigation into the Impacts of 1:1 iPads on Early Learners' ELA and Math Achievement,"Many parents, educators, and policy makers see great potential for leveraging tools like laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones in the classrooms of the world. Although increasing students' technology access may be associated with increased student achievement, there is little research directly investigating objective measures of student achievement. This study addresses the short-term and long-term quantitative impacts of one of the world's first school efforts to provide Kindergarten through 3rd grade classrooms with 1:1 iPad access and a range of English Language Arts (ELA) and math Apps. This report summarizes two investigations conducted during this iPad implementation. First, a 9-week pre/post randomized control trial was conducted in which 8 Kindergarten classes used literacy and numeracy apps while another 8 Kindergarten classes used their traditional (non-iPad) resources. At the end of this short implementation period, slightly stronger literacy performance gains were observed in the iPad settings. In a second longitudinal study, three years of assessment data were explored before and after the 1:1 iPad implementation in grades K to 2. Results from the longitudinal study provide emerging evidence of potential increases in ELA achievement, but no consistent results in math achievement.

117,The Impact of e-Books with Word Highlighting Features on Early Literacy Skills of Emergent Readers,"Young children increasingly encounter digital media on a daily basis (Rideout, 2013). While e-books have been shown to positively influence emergent literacy skills (Neuman & Neuman, 2014; Shamir & Korat, 2015; Takacs, Swart, & Bus, 2015), the connection between specific e-book affordances and emergent literacy skills is muddy (Glaubke, 2007; Hisrich & Blanchard, 2009). This mixed-methods study investigated the use of e-books, specifically the affordance of word highlighting, in the development of early literacy skills in emergent readers. In the quantitative portion of this study, two groups of preschool children (N = 50) in a pretest/posttest control group design listened to the same stories as e-books on iPads or as print books in a Listening Center. The word highlighting feature of the e-books did not have the expected impact on emergent literacy skills, specifically concept of word. A home survey of subject families found little screen time spent on e-books. Additional analysis found a negative correlation between the amount of time spent on digital devices at home and emergent literacy skills, calling into question parents' expectations that time spent on educational apps would improve their child's literacy skills. The qualitative portion of this study sought to give voice to the children's perceptions of reading and e-books. Overall, children found e-books on iPads to be fun and motivational but not equal to print books. The children view e-books as tools to help them read regular books. Given the positive results Shamir and Korat (2015) found using e-books to help emergent literacy skills, this study suggests that e-books will be more beneficial for emergent literacy learning if an adult jointly engages with the child to scaffold learning. This study also offers recommendations for joint media activities and suggestions to e-book designers for an Emergent Reader Mode aimed specifically at supporting emergent literacy skills.

118,Test-taking behavior of students with learning disabilities: An investigation of secondary students' performance on timed reading tests,"Students with learning disabilities (LD) tend to struggle with academic tasks that are commonly assessed on high stakes exams, potentially jeopardizing their chances for college admissions and scholarship opportunities. There has been very little research on the test-taking behaviors (i.e., reading skills, strategies, time management, etc.) of high school students with LD and with no LD (NLD). The present study assessed 776 high school students in 9th through 12th grades. Thirty-five of those students were diagnosed with LD and receiving test accommodations and 741 had no diagnosis or special services. Students were administered a computerized battery of timed reading tests and scales on test anxiety and test-taking perceptions. Results 1d the following: (1) The LD group performed less efficiently than the NLD group on all of the reading tasks (speed, comprehension, vocabulary, and decoding), spent more time reviewing comprehension questions, and searched for answers less; (2) students with LD did not perceive themselves to experience more anxiety or more difficulty in test-taking under timed conditions than the NLD group; (3) vocabulary score, reading speed, number of section switches, and decoding score were the strongest predictors of overall comprehension score; (4) students with the most success (top 15%) on the comprehension task performed better on all other reading tasks and approached the comprehension task differently than lower achieving students, perceiving themselves as less anxious and more confident in timed testing. Limitations of these findings, implications, and directions for future research are discussed.

119,Reading comprehension strategy instruction and attribution retraining for secondary students with disabilities,"This study investigated the effects of six weeks of reading comprehension strategy instruction with and without attribution retraining on the reading performance of sixty-three 7th, 8th, and 9 th grade students with learning disabilities and other high functioning disabilities. Students were stratified by class and randomly assigned to one of three treatments including reading comprehension strategy instruction, reading comprehension strategy instruction with attribution retraining, or Read Naturally. Performance was assessed on reading comprehension, meta-comprehension strategy awareness, and attributional beliefs about reading. Teachers were randomly assigned to training condition and implemented 12 thirty minute lessons during self-contained English or accelerated reading classes. Strategy instruction consisted of instruction for the strategies: (a) setting a purpose, (b) previewing text structures, (c) activating background knowledge, (d) self-questioning, (e) summarizing, and (f) strategy monitoring. Attribution training consisted of instruction in the concepts: (a) identifying self-promoting (positive) and self-defeating (negative) beliefs, (b) using positive self-talk with simple and complex scenarios, and (c) using positive self-talk to promote persistence and flexible strategy use; in addition, teacher feedback was designed to promote explicit connections between strategy use and success or failure with comprehension. The Read Naturally condition consisted of instruction using either the traditional or computerized version of the program. Statistically significant findings were found for those students receiving reading comprehension strategy instruction and reading comprehension strategy instruction with attribution retraining over those in the Read Naturally condition on recall of main idea information. In addition, there were statistically significant findings for students who received reading comprehension strategy instruction over those in the Read Naturally condition. There were not, however statistically significant effects for students in the reading comprehension plus attribution training condition, although there was a descriptive advantage in the predicted direction. Students who received attribution retraining attributed success more to internal factors (such as effort and strategy use) and less to external factors (such as luck and assistance from a teacher). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on a criterion referenced passage specific comprehension test or on attributions for reading failure. Findings are discussed with respect with respect to future research and practice.

120,Text Comprehension Strategy of Grade 11 Students,"This study which adopted the descriptive and developmental design dealt on the formulation of prototype learning activities aimed to improve Grade 11 students' performance in text comprehension, particularly focused on ""interpretative and applied levels of comprehension"", which were found to be more challenging to the students. The design of the learning activities is based on guidelines inferred from the merits of research findings. Generally, the students access both home-based ""print and electronic reading materials in English"".

The students' access to ""print materials"" (ave. freq.) is slightly higher that their access to ""electronic materials"" (ave. freq). Most of the students access ""books"" and ""magazines"" found in their homes. Among the least accessed materials at home are ""newspapers, pamphlets, and dictionaries ."" The students access a broad range of media types, which 1: ""internet, television, radio / electronic audio gadgets (for music and for news programs), and newspapers / magazines"". Mostly accessed are the ""internet"" and ""television. However, there are more students who access internet than the so-called ""traditional media"", such as ""television"", ""radio and other electronic gadgets for listening to music, ""newspapers and magazines"" and radio for listening to news.

122,The impact of combining the reading software Headsprout and Raz-Kids on comprehension and achievement in a faith-based elementary school,"Learning A-Z using components of Raz-Kids and Headsprout is a software program designed using e-books and a leveled library allowing students on the site to click on and select by difficulty, structure, and language use. Programs such as these have been established to teach students appropriate reading strategies through a technological format. The purpose of this study was to determine if technologically-based reading software can improve student reading comprehension and appropriate grade-level reading achievement. Multiple studies on this topic have been conducted over the years to evaluate the effectiveness of reading programs implemented within schools throughout the world. Many of these studies have been conducted internationally and most of the studies within the United States have centered-around public elementary schools. This research study focused on students in a faith-based elementary school. The data gathered involved inferential statistical analysis of Iowa Test of Basic Skills scores from the 2014–2015 (prior to reading software implementation) through the 2017–2018 school year. Other points of data gathered during the study involved a general quantitative analysis of Learning A-Z using components of Raz-Kids and Headsprout scores from the 2016–2017 school year through the 2018–2019 school year. The results of the study suggest that the Raz-Kids and Headsprout reading programs did not have a significant statistical impact on student reading comprehension or appropriate grade-level reading achievement. Some of the areas for consideration of future studies could 1 the behavioral impact while utilizing the reading program, the perceptions of the program on improving reading comprehension and appropriate grade-level achievement from both students and teachers, and conducting the research by tracking individual students and the impact the program has on each individual student.

123,Using Computers in the Classroom To Promote Generative Strategies for Reading Comprehension,"Reading management programs have become very popular in elementary schools. Students select a title from a prescribed reading list, then are tested for recall of facts and events in the story. Students are motivated to read as many titles as possible since they must achieve a certain score to win prizes. Although there have been reports that this increases voluntary independent reading, programs like Accelerated Reader[R] do little to increase comprehension or enhance reading instruction. Generative strategies use integration and organizational activities to increase both recall and comprehension of textual information. For this study, students were assigned two different book titles for independent reading. Using thinking maps, the students analyzed the information in the books  then used these to generate test questions for a mock Accelerated Reader test. The results show marginal differences between pre and posttest scores, however there was a significant improvement when students tested each other with their own test items. In addition, students' test items were aligned with the Levels for Thinking model used by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction for end-of-grade tests for higher level thinking. Half of the student-generated test items matched higher level thinking categories. Students were able to generate multiple choice test items, distractors, and correct answers at a high level of thinking. Three models were used to compare student-generated and criterion reference test items: Generative strategies (Wittrock), Thinking Maps (Hyerle), and  Dimensions for Thinking (Marzano).

124,Effect of digital highlighting on reading comprehension given text-to-speech technology for people with aphasia,"ABSTRACT Background Many people with aphasia have a strong desire to participate in reading activities despite persistent reading challenges. Digital reading devices and text-to-speech (TTS) technology are increasing in popularity and have the potential to help people with aphasia. Systematic investigation of modifiable TTS features provides a means of exploring this potential. Aims This study’s aim was to evaluate the effect of digital highlighting synchronised with TTS auditory and written output on reading comprehension by people with aphasia and to determine their highlighting preferences. Methods & Procedures This work was registered with clinicaltrials.gov and assigned the clinical trial registry number 01446 r prior to initiation of data collection. Twenty-five adults with aphasia read and listened to passages presented in three synchronised highlighting conditions: sentence highlighting, single word highlighting, and no highlighting. Participants answered comprehension questions, selected most and least preferred conditions, and provided feedback explaining highlighting preferences. Outcome & Results Comprehension accuracy did not vary significantly across presentation conditions, but participants preferred either single word or sentence highlighting over no highlighting. Conclusions Neither word nor sentence highlighting benefitted or hindered comprehension by people with aphasia as a group, but individual differences may occur. Clinicians should attend to personal preferences when implementing digital highlighting as a reading support strategy.

125,Guided practice in technology-based summary writing,"The computer tutor Summary Street addresses the problem of passive comprehension strategies by providing content feedback on students' written summaries. The design of this tool is motivated by the belief that articulating their understanding in their own words helps students lay the conceptual foundation to learn about new subject areas. Graphically presented feedback, based on latent semantic analysis, guides this process to ensure adequate content coverage within given length constraints and the avoidance of redundant, irrelevant, overly detailed, or plagiarized information. In this chapter, we review our experimental findings, showing not only improved summary writing when using the tool but also transfer to independent summary writing, among middle school students. Students who practiced summarizing without guidance did not perform as well. Moreover, Summary Street users also scored higher on comprehension test items that required gist-level understanding. Results of a verbal report study with college students indicated better metacognitive awareness of appropriate strategies among those who composed summaries with Summary Street. Thus, our suggestion that better macroprocessing strategies may emerge from guided practice receives support from these findings.

127,Technology-enhanced reading therapy for people with aphasia: Findings from a quasirandomized waitlist controlled study,"Purpose: This study investigated the effects of technology-enhanced reading therapy for people with reading impairments, using mainstream assistive reading technologies alongside reading strategies. Method: The study used a quasirandomized waitlist controlled design. Twenty-one people with reading impairments following stroke were randomly assigned to receive 14 hr of therapy immediately or after a 6-week delay. During therapy, participants were trained to use assistive reading technology that offered a range of features to support reading comprehension. They developed skills in using the technology independently and in applying the technology to their personal reading goals. The primary outcome measure assessed reading comprehension, using Gray Oral Reading Test–Fourth Edition (GORT-4). Secondary measures were as follows: Reading Comprehension Battery for Aphasia–Second Edition, Reading Confidence and Emotions Questionnaire, Communication Activities of Daily Living–Second Edition, Visual Analog Mood Scales, and Assessment of Living With Aphasia. Matched texts were used with the GORT-4 to compare technology-assisted and unassisted reading comprehension. Mixed analyses of variance explored change between T1 and T2, when the immediate group had received therapy but the delayed group had not, thus serving as untreated controls. Pretherapy, posttherapy, and follow-up scores on the measures were also examined for all participants. Results: GORT-4 results indicated that the immediately treated group improved significantly in technology-assisted reading following therapy, but not in unassisted reading. However, the data were not normally distributed, and secondary nonparametric analysis was not significant. The control group was unstable over the baseline, improving significantly in unassisted reading. The whole-group analysis showed significant gains in assisted (but not unassisted) reading after therapy that were maintained at follow-up. The Reading Confidence and Emotions Questionnaire results improved significantly following therapy, with good maintenance of change. Results on all other secondary measures were not significant. Conclusions: Technology-assisted reading comprehension improved following the intervention, with treatment compensating for, rather than remediating, the reading impairment. Participants’ confidence and emotions associated with reading also improved. Gains were achieved after 14 therapy sessions, using assistive technologies that are widely available and relatively affordable, meaning that this approach could be implemented in clinical practice.

130,Effective Programs for Struggling Readers: A Best-Evidence Synthesis. [Educator's Summary],"Which elementary reading approaches have been proven to help struggling readers to succeed? To find out, this review summarizes evidence on six types of programs designed to improve the reading achievement of children having difficulty in learning to read: (1) One-to-One Tutoring by Teachers (TT) such as ""Reading Recovery,"" ""Auditory Discrimination in Depth,"" ""Early Steps/Howard Street Tutoring,"" and ""Targeted Reading Intervention""; (2) One-to-One Tutoring by Paraprofessionals and Volunteers (T-Para/Volunteers) such as ""Sound Partners,"" ""SMART,"" and ""Book Buddies""; (3) Small Group Tutorials (SGT) such as ""Corrective Reading,"" ""Quick Reads,"" ""Voyager Passport,"" and ""PHAST Reading""; (4) Classroom Instructional Process Approaches (CIP): Effects for low achievers were reported for programs such as ""Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition,"" ""PALS,"" ""Direct Instruction,"" and ""Project Read""; (5) Classroom Instructional Process Programs with Tutoring (CIP+TT): Effects for low achievers were reported for ""Success for All""; and (6) Instructional Technology (IT): Effects for low achievers were reported for programs such as ""Jostens/Compass Learning,"" ""Fast ForWord,"" and ""Lexia."" Overall, 96 experimental-control comparisons met the inclusion criteria, of which 39 used random assignment to treatments, and five used randomized quasi-experiments. Effect sizes (experimental-control differences as a proportion of a standard deviation) were averaged across studies, weighting by sample size. Conclusions 1: (1) One-to-one tutoring works. Teachers are more effective as tutors than paraprofessionals or volunteers, and an emphasis on phonics greatly improves tutoring outcomes; (2) Although one-to-one phonetic tutoring for first graders is highly effective, effects last into the upper elementary grades only if classroom interventions continue past first grade; (3) Small group tutorials can be effective, but are not as effective as one-to-one instruction by teachers or paraprofessionals; (4) Classroom instructional process approaches, especially cooperative learning and structured phonetic models, have strong effects for low achievers (as well as other students); and (5) Traditional computer-assisted instruction programs have little impact on reading. These findings support the idea, central to current response-to-intervention models, that the best approach for struggling readers is to provide high-quality instruction in the first place, followed up with intensive instruction to the hopefully small number of students who continue to have difficulties despite high-quality classroom instruction.

131,Role Taking and Knowledge Building in a Blended University Course,"Role taking is an established approach for promoting social cognition. Playing a specific role within a group could lead students to exercise collective cognitive responsibility for collaborative knowledge building. Two studies explored the relationship of role taking to participation in a blended university course. Students participated in the same knowledge-building activity over three consecutive, five-week modules and enacted four roles designed in alignment with knowledge building pedagogy (Scardamalia and Bereiter 2010). In Study 1, 59 students were distributed into groups with two conditions: students who took a role in Module 2 and students who did not take a role, using Module 1 and 3 as pre and post tests. Results showed no differences in participation in Module 1, higher levels of writing and reading for role takers in Module 2, and this pattern was sustained in Module 3. Students with the Synthesizer role were the most active in terms of writing and the second most active for reading; students with the Social Tutor role were the most active for reading. In Study 2, 143 students were divided into groups with two conditions: students who took a role in Module 1 and students who did not take a role. Content analysis revealed that role takers tended to vary their contributions more than non-role takers by proposing more problems, synthesizing the discourse, reflecting on the process and organization of activity. They also assumed appropriate responsibilities for their role: the Skeptic prioritizes questioning of content, the Synthesizer emphasizes synthesizing of content, and the Social Tutor privileges maintaining of relationships. Implications of designing role taking to foster knowledge building in university blended courses are discussed.",blended learning; College Students; Content Analysis; Cooperative Learning; Instructional Design; Learning Activities; Learning Modules; Pretests Posttests; Reading Achievement; Responsibility; Role Playing; Social Cognition; Teaching Methods; Tutors; Writing Achievement,"Cesareni, Donatella; Cacciamani, Stefano; Fujita, Nobuko",2016.0,,0,131
132,"Small-Group, Computer-Assisted Tutoring to Improve Reading Outcomes for Struggling First and Second Graders","This study evaluated the relative effects of Tier II computer-assisted tutoring in small groups (Team Alphie) and one-to-one tutoring provided to struggling readers in 33 high-poverty Success for All (SFA) schools. In this year-long study, struggling readers in the Team Alphie schools were tutored in groups of 6. In the control schools, students were tutored using the standard one-to-one tutoring process used in SFA. Analyses of covariance of students' standardized reading scores indicated that the first-grade treatment group significantly outperformed the control group on all 3 reading measures, with no significant differences for second graders. Schools using Team Alphie were able to tutor many more students than the control schools. This study shows that a computer-assisted, small-group tutoring program may be at least as effective as one-to-one tutoring and serve more struggling readers. It may serve as a good example of Tier II instruction in a response to intervention (RTI) model.

133,A mobile-assisted synchronously collaborative translation–annotation system for English as a foreign language (EFL) reading comprehension,"This research introduced mobile devices into an intensive reading course and allowed functions that are usually found only in the language laboratory to be easily and flexibly utilized in the general classroom. To enhance and improve the reading comprehension of English as a foreign language (EFL) readers, a computer-assisted-language-learning (CALL) system for use on PDAs, integrating an instant translation mode, an instant translation annotation mode, and an instant multi-users shared translation annotation function was developed to support a synchronously intensive reading course in the normal classroom. Experiments were conducted to analyze the usage of the system, including the attitude and satisfaction of users. Moreover, the study determined the optimum number of users in each group for the system to work most efficiently, and for students to improve their reading comprehension. Experimental results indicated that those students who were grouped into twos, threes, and fours had significantly higher levels of comprehension than individual students, but those grouped into fives did not. Overall, on average around 70% of the students agreed that the system was useful, 75%of the students agreed that the system was easy to use, and 66%of the students perceived satisfaction with the system. The user intentions were also further analyzed in light of a path analysis method.

134,An Online Multi-User Real-Time Seamless Co-Reading System for Collaborative Group Learning,"This paper proposes an online multi-user real-time co-reading (OMURCOR) system to promote the performance of co-reading with collaborative learning. The OMURCOR system utilizes WebSocket to perform synchronization controls on co-reading to allow teachers and students to watch streaming videos together with less delay. Moreover, teachers utilize the system to synchronize control operations of videos on the student site, and the OMURCOR system can be integrated into a learning management system to strengthen students' interaction through co-reading. Unlike traditional platforms, the system supports grouping mechanisms during instruction. A survey was conducted with 104 participants. The bootstrapping square and partial least square approaches of the structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) are employed via the SmartPLS tool to explore evidence of reliability and validity of the revised TAM. Experimental results reflected that six of the seven hypotheses were supported, and the proposed system has a significant impact on students' learning effectiveness during co-reading.",Cooperative Learning; Difficulty Level; educational technology; Foreign Countries; Heterogeneous Grouping; Intention; Program Effectiveness; Reading Skills; Reading strategies; Student Attitudes; Taiwan; Teaching Methods; Technology Uses in Education; Undergraduate Students; Video Technology,"Chang, Chih-Tsan; Tsai, Cheng-Yu; Tsai, Hung-Hsu; Li, Yuen-Ju; Yu, Pao-Ta",2020.0,,0,134
135,Influence of an interactive e-book on the reading comprehension of different ethnic groups using indigenous culture as content,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether interactive e-books on indigenous culture influence the reading comprehension of learners from different cultural backgrounds. The study analyses the factors involved in learning comprehension among participants with different cultural backgrounds when reading interactive e-books on indigenous culture. The experiment was conducted over a 9-week period, and 168 students (ages 16–18) completed tests on prior knowledge, reading comprehension, reading attitude, reading motivation, cognitive strategies, and metacognitive strategies. This study determined that in reading activities using interactive e-books on indigenous culture, indigenous students achieved significantly better reading comprehension performance than Han students. Another significant difference was observed in the reading comprehension performance among Han students of different genders. Furthermore, cognitive strategies and metacognitive strategies effectively predicted the reading comprehension performance of indigenous students, while reading attitude and prior knowledge effectively predicted the reading comprehension performance of Han students.

136,The Effect of Integration of a Blended Learning and Extensive Reading Instructional Model on Thai EFL Undergraduate Students' Learner Autonomy,"To be able to read well as well as to manage one's own reading is important because it leads to the development of learner autonomy, which is necessary for learners in the 21st century. The present study investigates the effects of integration of a blended learning and extensive reading instructional model on Thai EFL undergraduate students' learner autonomy. This study employed a one-group, pre-test post-test design to collect quantitative data supplemented by the qualitative data from semi-structured interviews. The sample consisted of forty English major students who enrolled in the Reading for Text Interpretation Course at a public university in Suratthani, Thailand. The research instruments 1d the learner autonomy questionnaire and the learner autonomy interview protocol. The findings revealed that learner autonomy increased with statistical significance after the treatment. Based on the findings, it could be concluded that integration of a blended learning and extensive reading instructional model could be effectively implemented to promote learner autonomy of EFL students.",blended learning; Electronic Learning; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; instructional effectiveness; Personal Autonomy; Public Colleges; reading comprehension; reading instruction; Reading Material Selection; Reading strategies; Self Evaluation (Individuals); Self Management; Student Improvement; Student Interests; Synchronous Communication; Thailand; Undergraduate Students,"Chanthap, Naruethai; Wasanasomsithi, Punchalee",2019.0,,0,136
137,Development of EFL University Students' Vocabulary Size and Reading Comprehension Using Online Multimedia-Based Extensive Reading,"The objectives of this study were: 1) to investigate the effects of online multimedia-based extensive reading activities on students' vocabulary size; 2) to investigate the effect of online multimedia-based extensive reading activities on students' reading comprehension, and 3) to investigate the relationship between vocabulary size and reading comprehension. The population of the study was EFL students at Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University enrolling in the Reading Comprehension course, and the samples were 67 students from two classes who enrolled in the course in semester 1 of the academic year 2018. The classes were randomly assigned an experimental group and the other the controlled group. The study tools 1d pretest and posttest and the online multimedia-based extensive reading activities. The two groups undertook the same course instructions; however, the experimental group was assigned to do extensive reading activities, which 1d reading three different online news articles each week. Both groups took pretest and posttest for vocabulary size and reading comprehension. The results of the study can be summarized as follows. 1. The two groups had their posttest scores significantly higher than the pretest scores on both the vocabulary size and reading comprehension at the 0.05 level. However, comparisons between the scores of the two groups revealed no differences, neither on the pretest nor the posttest. 2. No differences were found between the pretest and the posttest scores on reading comprehension of the control group. However, the posttest scores on reading comprehension of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the pretest at the.01 level. Additionally, the experimental group had significantly higher posttest scores than the control group at the 0.01 level. 3. The regression analysis revealed the coefficients of 20.981, t-Stat of 7.604 with the p-value = 0.000. This means that the vocabulary size factor can be a predictor of the reading comprehension factor at the 95% confidence level. The findings of this study suggest that online multimedia-based extensive reading activities can significantly improve both students' vocabulary size and reading comprehension. Moreover, vocabulary size also found to be a good predictor of reading comprehension. It can be concluded from the findings that the improved vocabulary size and reading comprehension were largely due to the effect of the online multimedia-based extensive reading activities which helped expand vocabulary size. More importantly, the activities supported students' reading in terms of translation, anywhere and anytime reading, as well as ways to find more vocabulary online, etc. This type of extensive reading is regarded as an effective method for improving students' reading comprehension through the expansion of their vocabulary size, which has to be considered not only at the classroom level by the instructors, but also at the course and curriculum levels by the course and curriculum designers or developers.",College Students; Comparative Analysis; Course Descriptions; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Multimedia Instruction; News Reporting; Pretests Posttests; reading comprehension; Reading Processes; Scores; Second Language Instruction; Second Language Learning; Teaching Methods; Thailand; Translation; Vocabulary Development,"Chavangklang, Thanaset; Chavangklang, Pitchayapa; Thiamhuanok, Sirichai; Sathitdetkunchorn, Premkamon",2019.0,,0,137
138,Web-based reading annotation system with an attention‐based self‐regulated learning mechanism for promoting reading performance,"Due to the rapid development of information technology, web‐based learning has become a dominant trend. That is, learners can often learn anytime and anywhere without being restricted by time and space. Autonomic learning primarily occurs in web‐based learning environments, and self‐regulated learning (SRL) is key to autonomic learning performance. Moreover, sustained attention to web‐based learning activities can be challenging for students. Therefore, a web‐based reading annotation system with an attention‐based self‐regulated learning mechanism (ASRLM), which is based on brainwave detection, is designed to enhance the sustained attention of learners while reading annotated English texts online, and thereby promote online reading performance. In total, 126 Grade 7 students in four classes at a junior high school in New Taipei City, Taiwan, are the participants. Among the four classes, two classes are randomly distributed to the experimental group and the other two classes are randomly distributed to the control group. The experimental group utilizes the ASRLM to support their reading of annotated English texts online, whereas the control group is not supported by the ASRLM while reading annotated English texts online. Experimental results show that sustained attention and reading comprehension of the experimental group are better than those of the control group. Moreover, the web‐based reading system with ASRLM support promotes the sustained attention and reading comprehension of female learners more than those of male learners while reading annotated English texts online. Additionally, learners with high‐SRL ability in the experimental group have better sustained attention and reading comprehension than those learners with low‐SRL ability. Furthermore, the sustained attention and reading comprehension of the experimental group are strongly correlated, and the duration of sustained attention strongly predicts their reading comprehension performance.

139,Facilitating English-language learners’ oral reading fluency with digital pen technology,"Oral reading fluency is an indicator of overall reading competence. Many studies have claimed that repeated reading can promote oral reading fluency. Currently, novel Web- or computer-based reading technologies offer interactive digital materials that promote English oral reading fluency using the repeated reading strategy; however, paper-based English materials in physical classrooms are still used to train students in oral reading fluency because most students are used to learning environments with paper, pen, and face-to-face interaction. With the growth of digital pen technologies, developing an interactive learning environment that combines printed textbooks and a digital pen to support English-language classroom learning has become feasible. Thus, this work presents a digital pen and paper interaction platform (DPPIP) composed of a student-learning tier, course management tier, and teacher tutoring tier, in which digital pen technologies are integrated with printed textbooks and Moodle course management system, to support the repeated reading strategy for promoting English-language oral reading fluency, learning motivation, and learning satisfaction. Meanwhile, this work also examined whether the proposed DPPIP provides different benefits in terms of the promotion of the oral reading fluency to students with field-dependent and field-independent cognitive styles. Based on the non-equivalent control group design in the quasi-experimental research, this work recruited two junior high school classes from Taoyuan County, Taiwan, to participate in an instructional experiment. One class was randomly assigned to the experimental group, which used the DPPIP to perform the repeated reading strategy in order to enhance English-language oral reading fluency. By contrast, the other class was assigned to the control group, which adopted the traditional paired reading method to support the repeated reading strategy to improve English-language oral reading fluency. Analytical results show that applying the proposed DPPIP to support a regular English-language course in classrooms had significantly positive effects in promoting the English-language oral reading fluency, learning motivation, and learning satisfaction of junior high school students. Moreover, this DPPIP simultaneously helped the experimental group students with the field-independent and field-dependent cognitive styles accelerate their oral reading fluency. Importantly, the oral reading fluency of the experimental group students is positively correlated with the frequency which the digital pen was used.

140,Comparisons of Learner-Generated versus Instructor-Provided Multimedia Annotations,"The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of using learner-generated and instructor-provided multimedia annotations on foreign language reading comprehension and attitudes. The four research questions are: (1) what are the effects of using different multimedia annotations on reading comprehension for learners of different cognitive learning styles (field-dependent and field-independent)? (2) What are the effects of using different multimedia annotations on reading comprehension for learners with different learning abilities (higher-level and lower-level)? And (3) what are learners' attitudes toward using a multimedia annotation system? The results of this study are listed as follows: First, for reading comprehension, the learner-generated annotation group performed better than the instructor-provided group, no matter which cognitive learning style they were. Second, higher-level learners with learner-generated annotation performed better than those with instructor-provided annotation. However, the difference between lower-level learners with learner-generated annotation and those with instructor-provided annotation was not significant. Finally, learners had positive attitudes toward multimedia annotation use and thought text annotation was the most useful of the different types.

141,Extending e-book with contextual knowledge recommender for reading support on a web-based learning system,"Reading content of the Web is increasingly popular. When students read the same material, each student has a unique comprehension of the text and requires individual support from appropriate references. Most references in typical web learning systems are unorganized. Students are often required to disrupt their reading to locate references. This disruption in reading reduces learning performance. This work presents a web-based e-book learning system with an incorporated contextual knowledge recommender to assist students reading online and solve problems promptly. In this system, students can easily summarize, annotate, or enter queries in a text where questions arise. Based on a student's learning status and queries about an e-book, this system can recommend adaptive references from a knowledge repository, and locate capable classmates to answer a question. Student learning status can be analyzed based on annotations and portfolios. This knowledge repository comprises a web dictionary, discussion forum, and library of examples. Experimental results showed that students prefer accessing knowledge and joining discussions through this system to reading a conventional textbook. Most students were very willing to use this system to learn material and prepare for examinations. Furthermore, a positive correlation existed between amount of time spent using this system and exam grade.

142,Hypertext annotation: Effects of presentation formats and learner proficiency on reading comprehension and vocabulary learning in foreign languages,"This study extends current knowledge by exploring the effect of different annotation formats, namely in-text annotation, glossary annotation, and pop-up annotation, on hypertext reading comprehension in a foreign language and vocabulary acquisition across student proficiencies. User attitudes toward the annotation presentation were also investigated. Data were collected from 83 non-English-majored university students in Taiwan in a 4-week period. Each week participants read 3 passages, each with different annotation formats as a treatment condition and one passage without annotation as a control condition. Posttests of reading comprehension and vocabulary recognition followed each passage. The results indicate that, for reading comprehension, the in-text format led to the lowest performance among all types of annotation, including the control condition. The best performance was observed in the condition where annotations were presented in the pop-up format. No interaction effect between format and proficiency was detected. For vocabulary acquisition, reading passages with hypermedia annotations significantly benefit vocabulary learning for participants of medium and high proficiencies compared with the control condition. No significant differences were found among the 3 formats. The beneficial effect, however, did not extend to low-proficiency participants. Participant feedback revealed a positive attitude toward annotations. Among the 3 annotation formats, the glossary type was considered the least preferred type by participants. Findings of the research provide insights on the design and instruction for online reading.

143,Augmenting paper-based reading activity with direct access to digital materials and scaffolded questioning,"Comprehension is the goal of reading. However, students often encounter reading difficulties due to the lack of background knowledge and proper reading strategy. Unfortunately, print text provides very limited assistance to one’s reading comprehension through its static knowledge representations such as symbols, charts, and graphs. Integrating digital materials and reading strategy into paper-based reading activities may bring opportunities for learners to make meaning of the print material. In this study, QR codes were adopted in association with mobile technology to deliver supplementary materials and questions to support students’ reading. QR codes were printed on paper prints to provide direct access to digital materials and scaffolded questions. Smartphones were used to scan the printed QR codes to fetch pre-designed digital resources and scaffolded questions over the Internet. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of direct access to the digital materials prepared by the instructor using QR codes and that of scaffolded questioning in improving students’ reading comprehension. The results suggested that direct access to digital resources using QR codes does not significantly influence students’ reading comprehension; however, the reading strategy of scaffolded questioning significantly improves students’ understanding about the text. The survey showed that most students agreed that the integrated print-and-digital-material- based learning system benefits English reading comprehension but may not be as efficient as expected. The implications of the findings shed light on future improvement of the system.

144,Adolescents' constructively responsive reading strategy use in a critical Internet reading task,"The goal of this study was to examine types and patterns of reading strategies that proficient adolescent readers used while reading on the Internet. Informed by research related to reading comprehension, intertextuality, and new literacies, I drew upon the model of Constructively Responsive Reading that had evolved from print reading to Internet reading (Afflerbach & Cho, 2009; Pressley & Afflerbach, 1995). The model offered an analytical tool to construct descriptions of the complexity of use of the four general types of strategies in Internet contexts: Realizing and Constructing Potential Texts to Read, Identifying and Learning Text Content, Monitoring, and Evaluation. Seven highly proficient adolescent readers (Mean Age = 17.5) individually performed Internet reading, with a goal to create a critical question about their self- selected controversial topic across two 45-minute sessions: Open Website Searching and Focused Website Learning. I used multiple sources to triangulate complementary data to infer participants' Internet reading strategy use. Participants' think-aloud verbal reports were synchronized with their reader-computer interactions recorded in the computer. These real-time strategy data were complemented by other contextual data (e.g., pre-/post-reading interviews, participant-generated critical questions). I integrated these data into Internet Reading Strategy Matrices of the individual participants, which were analyzed, both qualitatively and quantitatively. During the entire course of data analysis, I constantly referenced the model of Constructively Responsive Reading with the four strategy categories. My data analyses afforded detailed descriptions of diverse constructively responsive reading strategies in Internet contexts and dynamic patterns of such reading strategy use. Grounded-analysis of data resulted in the identification of an array of reading strategies and many instances of strategy interplay among the four strategy categories. Chi-squared analysis of aggregated strategy data revealed the goal-directed nature of strategy use, as participants' use of these four types of strategies was associated with two different session tasks. Also, analysis of the processing chains visualizing the flow of strategy use indicated differences in the performances of Internet reading strategy use among the participants and their distinctive modes of Internet reading. Overall, my study supported the theoretical model of Constructively Responsive Reading, with empirical data that described diversity and patterns of constructively responsive reading strategies in Internet contexts. The complexity of Internet reading was discussed with regard to constructively responsive reading that coordinates different roles and functions of the four general types of strategies.

145,Exploring international ESL students' on-screen reading behaviors with two academic reading purposes,"This study explored international ESL graduate students’ on-screen reading behaviors in academic settings. Students’ on-screen reading preference, tendency, frequency and strategy were investigated and compared between two academic purposes: reading for course preparation and reading for writing papers. This study also examined possible factors affecting students’ on-screen reading behaviors, namely students’ perception of on-screen reading, computer familiarity and second language proficiency. The results showed that students had low preference and tendency toward reading academic texts on a computer screen. However, they spent more hours per week reading for academic purposes on a computer screen as comparing to reading for leisure purposes. They also were willing to read more pages on a computer screen for academic purposes than for leisure purposes. In addition, students reported using more general reading strategies when reading on a computer screen than technology-involved strategies. When comparing the students’ on-screen reading behaviors between the two purposes, the students did not differ in their preference and tendency toward on-screen reading. They, however, spent significantly longer hours on on-screen reading for writing papers than for course preparation. The students also were willing to read more pages on a computer screen for writing papers than for course preparation. In terms of strategy use, students reported using strategies more frequently when reading for writing papers than for course preparation. With regard to factors affecting students’ on-screen reading behaviors, students’ perceptions of on-screen reading had the strongest association with their on-screen reading behaviors. Moreover, students’ negative perceptions of on-screen reading seemed to influence their on-screen reading behaviors more than their positive perceptions. The second factor, students’ computer familiarity, did not seem to have a strong correlation with students’ on-screen reading behaviors. Finally, students’ second language proficiency seemed to weigh differently on their on-screen reading behaviors between the two reading purposes. Second language had a positive and significant correlation with their on-screen reading behaviors in the reading for writing papers condition, but not in reading for course preparation condition. The study also investigated students’ attitude toward reading for the two purposes. The students overall considered reading comprehension and understanding terminology as the most important values when reading for either academic purpose. However, using reading strategies and taking notes were reported as more important when reading for writing papers than for course preparation. Being able to share what they have read with others, on the other hand, was considered more important when reading for course preparation than for writing papers. Despite the different attitudes found between the two reading purposes, these differences did not seem to associate with the students’ on-screen reading behaviors. Understanding students’ on-screen reading behaviors and identifying factors affecting the behaviors may help educational practitioners better prepare international graduate students to read academic texts on a computer screen effectively. It is also important to remember that the findings of the current study need to be interpreted cautiously in consideration of the limitations of the study. Finally, this study suggested continuous research to examine students’ on-screen reading behaviors using different groups, contexts and research designs. Moreover, identifying other factors that may affect students’ on-screen reading is necessary for future research.

146,L2 Reading on the Web: Strategies for Accessing Information in Hypermedia,"This empirical study explores how L2 learners access information while reading L2 texts in a Web-based learning environment. Twenty-three second-year German students read and summarized two online texts in the netLearn program, while their use of online multimedia support resources was tracked. Multimedia resources 1d a program-internal glossary, an online bilingual dictionary, and an audio narration of the text. After reading each text, learners wrote summaries, and the summaries were scored in terms of the number of propositions recalled. The tracker noted the number of words looked up and the amount of time spent on the tasks of reading and writing. In addition, a subset of students did think aloud protocols while reading online. Selected students were interviewed after they used the program about their metacognitive reading strategies. The results from both the quantitative data (e.g., number of words looked up, time spent on tasks, and number of propositions recalled) and the qualitative data (e.g., when and why learners looked words up and whether they found the audio helpful) provide insights into how L2 learners use online textual and audio information to aid comprehension while reading.

147,What Makes Students Click: Working Memory and Look-Up Behavior,"Previous research on second language acquisition with multimedia has suggested that individual differences, including working memory capacity, play an important role in L2 vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension. In this paper, we report on a study of 13 students in a second-year German language course who read a German short story on a multimedia CD-ROM. They had access to multimedia annotations of difficult vocabulary words, and their actions were tracked while they looked up words and completed a vocabulary test and comprehension exercises. In order to assess their working memory capacity, they completed a nonword repetition test and a reading span test. Analyses suggest a relationship between phonological working memory (nonword repetition test) and the number of look-ups, with those individuals with lower verbal WM capacity looking up more words. These results suggest that students use the multimedia look-up features of the CD-ROM to compensate for working memory capacity constraints. To showcase the new multimedia capabilities of ""System"", we created screen capture movies that give readers a taste of the experimental treatment (""CyberBuch"") and the working memory tests (reading span, nonword repetition) administered in the study.

148,ICANREAD: The Effects of an Online Reading Program on Grade 1 Students' Engagement and Comprehension Strategy Use,"This pilot study explores the impact of online electronic storybooks (e-books) on the reading motivation and listening comprehension of six grade 1 students (aged 7 years) from Ontario, Canada. The researcher measured participants' perceived enjoyment of the online e-book reading experience using standardized listening comprehension tests, motivation questionnaires, behavioural observation checklists, and take-home e-book reading logs. The researchers used a scoring rubric to assess participants' oral responses to a set of embedded literal, inferential, and evaluative comprehension questions within each e-book read during the program sessions. The results from this study indicate that all of the participants increased their comprehension scores from pretest to posttest after using the online e-book reading program, enjoyed the e-book reading experience, and frequently read the online e-books at home in their free time.

150,Modeling E-Textbook Tools or Encouraging Reading from Paper: What Are the Effects on Medium Choice and Textbook Use?,"E-textbooks have become more popular with college students, but there are concerns that reading is not as effective from screens as paper. In addition, students may not take advantage of tools afforded by e-textbooks. The purpose of this study was to determine if encouraging students to read from paper or modeling e-textbook tools would be better for students in terms of reading and using their textbooks. Two instructors randomly assigned students (N = 144) to view a video and answer an essay question about either the benefits of reading from paper, how to use e-textbook tools, or general information about open educational resources (control). Findings indicated that students told about the benefits of reading from paper were not more likely to read the textbook from paper. Students across conditions generally reported using the textbooks in a similar manner, except students in the e-textbook tools condition reported more notetaking while reading than students in the paper condition. Finally, student medium preference for studying did not change based on condition.

151,Exploring changes to reading comprehension on the Internet: Paradoxes and possibilities for diverse adolescent readers,"The purpose of this sequential mixed-methods study was to investigate the extent to which new online reading proficiencies (Leu, Kinzer, Coiro & Cammack, 2004) may be required to comprehend information on the Internet. It also sought to explore the nature of online reading comprehension among three adolescent readers who read online at different levels of proficiency. First, 109 seventh-graders were selected from a stratified random sample of diverse middle school students in Connecticut and asked to complete a measure of online reading comprehension ability called Online Reading Comprehension Assessment Scenario I (ORCA-Scenario I). Standardized reading comprehension scores were also collected. Sixteen weeks later, students completed a survey of topic-specific prior knowledge and a second, parallel measure of online reading comprehension ability (ORCA-Scenario II). Results of a hierarchical regression analysis indicated performance on one measure of online reading comprehension ability accounted for a significant amount of variance in performance on a second measure of online reading comprehension ability over and above offline reading comprehension ability and a measure of topic-specific knowledge. Furthermore, there was an interaction between prior knowledge and online reading comprehension ability, such that higher levels of online reading comprehension skills may help compensate for lower levels of topic- and task-specific prior knowledge when adolescents complete online reading tasks requiring them to locate, critically evaluate, synthesize, and communicate information using the Internet. Retrospective think-aloud protocol data were also obtained from three purposefully selected focal students after they completed the second online reading session. A diachronic (Gutierrez & Stone, 2000), developmental, contrastive case study analysis of these protocols revealed two major findings. First, a developmental progression of online reading skills and strategies appeared to distinguish the three readers' performance within six observed phases of online reading. Second, developmental differences among the three readers appeared to be affected in important ways by five key dimensions of offline and online reading comprehension ability. Findings from this study may open new possibilities for theory, research, and practice to support efforts that address the needs of diverse adolescent readers in new Internet reading contexts.

152,Visual perceptual problems in reading: The effect of colour and contrast,"Previous research on visual processing has suggested that colour and contrast manipulations may benefit students with a suspected transient deficit while reading. The removal of long wavelengths (red) from the display and the removal of high to medium spatial frequencies work on different underlying mechanisms in order to balance the relative timing of the two visual processing streams. Three out of six experiments were conducted to investigate visual manipulations on reading components of rate, accuracy and comprehension. Two experiments investigated visual manipulations on reading activities related to learning to read. One experiment investigated visual on a pure perceptual task. All experiments were presented on a computer monitor and the colour and contrast of the background were manipulated. Results for the reading component experiments indicated, in general, that students with a suspected transient deficit can improve their reading through the use of colour or contrast. Their performance for comprehension during oral reading improved with a blue background, whereas their performance for comprehension during silent reading improved with low contrast. Accuracy of word reading improved with both blue and low contrast material. However, using these two manipulations together, ie., blue low contrast background, showed more conflict than assistance. Activities, with limited dynamic visual processing, that are used to develop reading showed that the performance of students with a suspected transient deficit did not differ from those students with normal transient processing and that visual manipulations made no difference to their performance. The performance on the perceptual task showed that students with a suspected transient deficit improved with the assistance of a blue background. Findings suggest that, a blue background or a low contrast background, used separately, may provide assistance for students with a suspected transient deficit on reading and perceptual tasks that require transient type processing. It was concluded that for students with a suspected transient deficit and a reading disability the use of colour and contrast can be used to augment reading strategies and assist these students to realise their full reading potential.

155,"The use of video-based instruction, performance feedback and role play in teaching caregivers of preschool aged children to use dialogic reading strategies","The benefits of dialogic reading in its ability to support children's oral language development and emergent literacy skills have been replicated using multiple training modalities including in-vivo training (e.g., Whitehurst et al., 1988), video-based training (e.g., Whitehurst et al., 1994b) and video-based training with instructor feedback (e.g., Heubner & Meltzoff, 2005). The current study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of pairing a structured performance feedback session with the Read Together Talk Together training video to teach parents to use dialogic reading strategies. Using a randomized, control group, repeated measures design with 40 caregiver-child dyads, this study sought to do the following: (1) investigate the potential benefits of pairing performance feedback and role play with video-based training in teaching parents to use dialogic reading strategies; (2) target dialogic reading training toward six specific DR prompts (e.g., evaluation, expansion, repetition, completion, recall and distancing prompts) that a previous study showed were not as amenable to change (e.g., Blom-Hoffman et al., 2006); and (3) evaluate caregiver acceptability of the training package. Results showed that pairing performance feedback with the video-based training as well as video-based training alone were effective training modalities compared to no training. This effect was demonstrated in both parents' overall ability to learn and use dialogic reading strategies as well as children's language use during shared book reading. Caregiver acceptability of the Read Together Talk Together video and the video paired with feedback were high.

156,Vocabulary Building through Read-Aloud Strategy of Primary Level Students in Pakistan,"The research, which was taken into consideration, focused on assessing the effectiveness of vocabulary building through Read-Aloud Strategy for Primary level students. The main objective of the study was intended to identify the influence of read-aloud strategy on vocabulary building which is a key to other skills like reading comprehension and speaking skills and also to identify the effect of read-aloud strategy on the overall vocabulary development of the students of primary level. To achieve the above-stated objective, a quasi-experimental design was adopted where the research process was categorized as non-equivalent control group design with pre-test and post-test evaluation. Moreover, non-randomized sampling was followed and two already existing intact groups were allocated as experimental and control group respectively. The main aim of this study was focused on determining the level of vocabulary development of the students. The students selected for this study belonged to Private School in Lahore. In addition, the experiment was followed by an intervention where vocabulary tests, both pre and posttests, were used during the experiment. The statistical analysis of the pretest and post-test results of an experimental and control group revealed that read aloud is the most appropriate teaching strategy for vocabulary building. In addition, it was also revealed that teachers use different interaction techniques for read-aloud such as, more instructional time was spent on the words which were found to be critical for story comprehension for learners. From the findings, it can be recommended that the practices should be identified which are commonly used by the primary classroom teachers as it can lead towards the development of effective instructional strategies and teacher's training programs. Moreover, it was also recommended that the teachers should focus on the instructional strategies and should give individual attention to the students in order to make sure that each student is performing.",Comparative Analysis; Elementary School Students; Foreign Countries; instructional effectiveness; intervention; Language Tests; Oral Reading; Pakistan; Pretests Posttests; Private Schools; reading comprehension; Reading strategies; Teaching Methods; Vocabulary Development,"Daud, Zarmina; Kazi, Asma Shahid; Kalsoom, Tahira",2019.0,,0,156
157,Collaborative sense-making in print and digital text environments,"This study describes the sense-making behaviors of sixth- and seventh-grade students (n = 46 dyads) as they read and discussed expository articles in print and digital formats. Most dyads approached the digital text as if it were static and linear, despite the availability of hyperlinks. Reading through (or covering) the text was the most commonly observed behavior, occurring in 89% of the coded intervals in the print condition and 76% of intervals in the digital condition. Students were observed discussing a variety of cognitive and metacognitive strategies. The most common strategies were process monitoring, summarizing, connecting, and reacting. The dyads used at least one overt sense-making strategy in about 50% of the intervals when reading the print text and about 65% of the intervals with the digital text. Previewing and progress monitoring, which serve important planning and self-regulative functions, were used more frequently in the digital condition. Regression analyses show that several collaborative behaviors were associated with text comprehension, as measured by a researcher-designed multiple choice test, in the print condition but not in the digital condition. These 1d word recognition monitoring (β = 1.84; SE = 0.90; p = .05), summarizing (β = 2.43; SE = 1.21; p = .05), and connecting (β = −5.20; SE = 2.06; p = .02) at the student level and attending to illustrations (γ = −7.08; SE = 2.17; p = .003) at the dyad level. In both conditions, prior reading achievement and prior knowledge were strong predictors of comprehension.

158,Effects of animacy and sentence type on silent reading comprehension in aphasia: An eye-tracking study,"The present study examined how healthy aging and aphasia influence the capacity for readers to generate structural predictions during online reading, and how animacy cues influence this process. Non-brain-damaged younger (n = 24) and older (n = 12) adults (Experiment 1) and individuals with aphasia (IWA; n = 11; Experiment 2) read subject relative and object relative sentences in an eye-tracking experiment. Half of the sentences 1d animate sentential subjects, and the other half 1d inanimate sentential subjects. All three groups used animacy information to mitigate effects of syntactic complexity. These effects were greater in older than younger adults. IWA were sensitive to structural frequency, with longer reading times for object relative than subject relative sentences. As in previous work, effects of structural complexity did not emerge on IWA's first pass through the sentence, but were observed when IWA reread critical segments of the sentences. Thus, IWA may adopt atypical reading strategies when they encounter low frequency or complex sentence structures, but they are able to use animacy information to reduce the processing disruptions associated with these structures.

159,Efficiency of Using a Web-Based Approach to Teach Reading Strategies to Iranian EFL Learners,"Applying new technologies with their effective potentials have changed education and, consequently, the L2 teacher role. Coping with online materials imposes the necessity of employing Web-based approaches in L2 instruction. The ability to use reading strategies in a Web-based condition needs sufficient skill which will be fulfilled if it is integrated in pedagogy. The main focus of the present study was to investigate the efficiency of teaching reading strategies in a Web-based condition to Iranian EFL learners. Thirty L2 learners at upper-intermediate level from an English institute in Isfahan were selected as the experimental group. The group received a 20-hr reading strategy training in Web-based condition. Participants were taught 4 general reading strategies which were practiced through 3 stages of cognitive theory: cognitive, associative, and autonomous proposed by Anderson (1993). The instruments 1d a pre/posttest of hypertext reading comprehension, a pre/posttraining questionnaire for assessing the participants' familiarity with general reading strategies, a pre/posttest of reading comprehension, and an attitude questionnaire towards Web-based reading strategy instruction. Findings indicated that after reading strategy program, the participants' frequent usage of each reading strategy increased significantly and, consequently, they performed better at the reading tasks in Web-based and conventional conditions. Furthermore, the group had positive attitudes towards Web-based reading strategy instruction.",Adolescents; Attitude Measures; Control Groups; educational technology; English (Second Language); Experimental Groups; Females; Foreign Countries; Hypermedia; instructional effectiveness; Iran; Pretests Posttests; Private Schools; Questionnaires; reading comprehension; reading instruction; Reading strategies; Scores; Second Language Learning; Statistical Analysis; Technology Uses in Education; Web Based Instruction,"Dehghanpour, Elham; Hashemian, Mahmood",2015.0,,0,159
160,Effects of e-textbook instructor annotations on learner performance,"With additional features and increasing cost advantages, e-textbooks are becoming a viable alternative to paper textbooks. One important feature offered by enhanced e-textbooks (e-textbooks with interactive functionality) is the ability for instructors to annotate passages with additional insights. This paper describes a pilot study that examines the effects of instructor e-textbook annotations on student learning as measured by multiple-choice and open-ended test items. Fifty-two college students in a business course were randomly assigned either a paper or an electronic version of a textbook chapter. Results show that the e-textbook group outperformed the paper textbook group on the open-ended test item, while both groups performed equally on the multiple-choice subject test. These results suggest that the instructional affordances that an interactive e-textbook provides may lead to higher-level learning.

161,Zone out No More: Mitigating Mind Wandering during Computerized Reading,"Mind wandering, defined as shifts in attention from task-related processing to task-unrelated thoughts, is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has a negative influence on performance and productivity in many contexts, including learning. We propose that next-generation learning technologies should have some mechanism to detect and respond to mind wandering in real-time. Towards this end, we developed a technology that automatically detects mind wandering from eye-gaze during learning from instructional texts. When mind wandering is detected, the technology intervenes by posing just-in-time questions and encouraging re-reading as needed. After multiple rounds of iterative refinement, we summatively compared the technology to a yoked-control in an experiment with 104 participants. The key dependent variable was performance on a post-reading comprehension assessment. Our results suggest that the technology was successful in correcting comprehension deficits attributed to mind wandering (d = 0.47 sigma) under specific conditions, thereby highlighting the potential to improve learning by ""attending to attention.""

162,Annotating digital text with phonemic cues to support decoding in struggling readers,"An advantage of digital media is the flexibility to personalize the presentation of text to an individual’s needs and embed tools that support pedagogy. The goal of this study was to develop a tablet-based reading tool, grounded in the principles of phonics-based instruction, and determine whether struggling readers could leverage this technology to decode challenging words. The tool presents a small icon below each vowel to represent its sound. Forty struggling child readers were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group to test the efficacy of the phonemic cues. We found that struggling readers could leverage the cues to improve pseudoword decoding: after two weeks of practice, the intervention group showed greater improvement than controls. This study demonstrates the potential of a text annotation, grounded in intervention research, to help children decode novel words. These results highlight the opportunity for educational technologies to support and supplement classroom instruction.

163,The impact of reading interventions on the academic achievement of middle school students,"The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of reading intervention at the middle school level with students who are performing below grade level. The purpose was also to examine the impact of demographic factors on their progress. Students who received special education services were investigated within the study. Areas of interest 1d levels of reading intervention, reading intervention on the middle school level, strategies and motivation, reading intervention programs, and learning disabilities and reading intervention. This was a study on the levels of reading intervention and the impact they have on middle school students, not only in the area of reading, but also science and social studies. The students in the study were from Grades 5--8 of a rural, low socioeconomic school in Tennessee. The factors of special education, low socioeconomic status, and levels of intervention were taken into consideration. The data used in this study were from the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP), specifically looking at the Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) scores. The TCAP scores were analyzed using a three-way MANCOVA with the pretest from each subject and grade level as the covariates. The interventions were broken down into three levels: skills, basic, and a control group. Students were placed into one of two intervention classes based upon a decoding placement test. This test determined if the students needed a basic level of intervention, which was the lower level of decoding, or the skills level of intervention, which was the higher level of decoding. The students chosen for the control group received a computer-based intervention one full week during a 6-week time period, unlike that of the two treatment groups. The two treatment groups received daily intervention for the entire length of the study. There were 313 students, 2 interventionists, 1 control group teacher, and 3 assistants who participated in this 6-month study. There was no significant difference in the area of English Language Arts, Social Studies, or Science for Grades 5--8 in terms of socioeconomic status and levels of intervention. However, there was a significant difference in the area of ELA with students receiving special education services in sixth grade, p = .047.

164,Expanding Literacy for Learners with Intellectual Disabilities: The Role of Supported eText,"A series of single-subject experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of presentational, translational, illustrative, instructional, and summarizing supports on the reading and listening comprehension of students with moderate intellectual disabilities. The specific eText supports under investigation 1d digitized voice and text-to-speech, text highlighting, video summaries, text-linked photographs, and graphic organizers. Two eText supports were found to be effective in supporting text comprehension for this population: reading the text out loud (using either recorded voice or text-to-speech), and graphic organizers. The findings also revealed the importance of providing explicit instruction in how to use eText supports.

167,Understanding Interactive CD-ROM Storybooks and Their Functions in Reading Comprehension: A Critical Review,"With dramatic changes and recent advances in multimedia, digital technologies through computers propose new ways for introducing kids to the literacy. Literacy educators have stated that traditional printed books are not sufficient and electronic books have the potential to change reading skills. As a valuable tool in educational settings new and varied forms of technology, specifically, interactive CD-ROM storybooks have been used in classroom literacy learning by students and teachers. Although, several studies indicate that interactive CD-ROM storybooks help children develop visual recognition and increase reading comprehension, the results of the experimental studies previously carried out in this area have been conflicting and often hard to interpret. Therefore, the main purposes of this review are to identify the potential benefits, functions and disadvantages of interactive storybooks and assess mixed results of previous studies related to interactive CD-ROM storybooks.

168,Audio-assisted reading with digital audiobooks for upper elementary students with reading disabilities,"Audio-assisted reading has been used as an effective instructional intervention for students with learning disabilities (Carbo, 1978; Gilbert, Williams, & McLaughlin, 1996) and with struggling readers (Chomsky, 1976; Hollingsworth, 1978; Hoskisson & Krohm, 1974; Koskinen, Blum, Bisson, Phillips, Creamer, & Baker, 2000; Rasinski, 1990). The strategy involves reading along while listening to an audio recording of a fluent model (Evans, 1997). The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of audio-assisted reading with digital audiobooks against the traditional practice of sustained silent reading in terms of reading fluency rates and reading attitude scores with upper elementary students with reading disabilities. Participants in the control group selected literature and read silently for 20-30 minute sessions, four to five times per week. Treatment group participants selected literature from a list of audiobooks and engaged in audio-assisted reading with digital audiobooks downloaded on MP3 players for the same amount of time over an eight-week implementation period. Students were assessed using the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills oral reading fluency measurements and the Elementary Reading Attitude Survey at the onset and conclusion of the study. The results showed that while both groups demonstrated growth in reading fluency, the growth of the treatment group far outweighed that of the control group. There was no significant difference in reading attitude scores. Consequently, teachers can promote increased growth in reading fluency when audio-assisted reading with digital audiobooks is implemented in the place of sustained silent reading for upper elementary students with reading disabilities.

169,Uncovering strategy profiles in young children's reading & spelling,"Young children are taught to read and spell using a range of different approaches to encourage them to form connections between spoken sound and written text, but past studies have often looked at reading and spelling strategies in isolation. In this study, the performance of 48 young children in Years 1 and 2 was assessed on experimental measures of reading and spelling to encourage the use of different strategies. Strategies were identified by video analysis and verbal self-reports. The findings revealed a strong reliance on multiple strategies as well as similar patterns of development in children's strategy choice for reading and spelling. Two separate cluster analyses revealed separate profiles, based on similar patterns of strategy use for both reading and spelling strategies, respectively and while reading and spelling profiles were strongly related, suggesting a close connection between these two sets of skills, only the spelling profiles were influenced by age.

171,Conative determinants of reading development and reading-disabled children's response to remediation,"The present study establishes the potential of several conative factors to explain reading development and response to remedial reading instruction. Conative factors are individual differences theoretically distinct from cognitive and affective constructs. A total of 211 children with confirmed difficulties in acquiring reading skills responded to a behavioural measure of volitional control and a computer-administered self-report task that measured intrinsic motivation. Parents completed a temperament questionnaire targeting effortful control as a behavioural style. Regular classroom and remedial teachers completed a questionnaire on reading motivation. A matched sample of 67 children with normally developing reading skills were enlisted to investigate development of these conative factors. The outcomes for the present study were standardized and experimental word reading tasks. Developmental differences were found between normal and reading disabled (RD) children on sense of competence for reading and attentional focusing, regardless of whether the RD children were matched with normally developing children by age or reading level. Comparisons with normative data also revealed deficits in volitional control among RD children. Individual human growth curves were formed from RD childrens' scores on reading outcomes over the course of intensive, small-group reading remediation conducted at The Hospital for Sick Children. Those measures of effortful control and intrinsic motivation found to be significantly lower in the developmental analysis were used as predictors of growth rate in word reading skill. RD children manifested one of three motivational profiles and these profiles in turn predicted rate of reading growth over the course of intervention and across multiple outcomes. In every case but one, conative factors predicted growth in reading skills, suggesting their utility in predicting remedial responsiveness. This study provides a unique window on the developmental course of intrinsic motivation and self-regulatory control strategies, across normal reading development and the course of remedial intervention for struggling readers.

172,The effect of self-explanation and strategy training on l2 reading comprehension using an intelligent tutoring system,"While research suggests that secondary language (L2) learners at postsecondary institutions face academic reading challenges, and that reading strategy training can improve primary language (L1) learners' reading comprehension, it remains a challenge to find scalable ways to deliver such training to L2 learners. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have been shown to be nearly as effective as human tutors while reaching potentially unlimited numbers of learners in a variety of subjects, including reading comprehension. However, few studies have explored the effectiveness of such systems for improving L2 learners' reading comprehension. Self-Explanation Reading Training (SERT) is an instructional model that combines self-explanation and five reading strategies (monitoring, paraphrasing, prediction, elaboration, and bridging), and has been shown to be effective. SERT has also been built into a game-based intelligent tutoring system environment called Interactive Strategy Trainer for Active Reading and Thinking —Motivationally Enhanced (iSTART-ME). Studies have demonstrated the effects of iSTART-ME in improving L1 students' reading comprehension and learning motivation, but little evidence exists for its efficacy for L2 learners. This research tested the reading strategy training effect through iSTART-ME on 34 incoming international L2 students admitted to a large public American higher institution in the Southwest. In addition to pretests, presurveys, posttests, and postsurveys, these students received three hours training within two consecutive days right before their fall semester school courses formally started. The results showed that their self-explanation quality scores, short-answer reading comprehension test scores, and learning motivation scores were significantly improved with a medium effect size. The results also suggested that students with lower self-explanation and comprehension ability benefited the most, although all students benefitted from the training. After the training, the interviewees reported that their learning with iSTART-ME was interesting and successful, expressed a desire to learn more strategies with iSTART-ME in the future, and expected to apply the strategies they learned to other subjects. This study implied that iSTART-ME, with low cost in reaching large numbers of students, effectively taught the incoming international college students reading strategies, and improved their L2 reading comprehension abilities and learning motivations.

173,The Effects of Reading Strategy Instruction via Electronic Storybooks on EFL Young Readers' Reading Performance,"The prevalence of web-based applications and the use of multimedia in school make learning and teaching through the Internet a popular method in education (Ferdig, 2005). To keep in line with the trend, the purpose of the study was to explore the effects of reading strategy instruction via electronic storybooks on EFL elementary school students' reading comprehension, their strategy use and their viewpoints toward electronic storybooks-based reading strategy instruction. Fifty-seven Taiwanese EFL fourth graders from two intact classes were chosen, and assigned as an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group received a ten-week reading strategy instruction whereas the control group did not engage in any strategy training. The experimental group were taught seven reading strategies, which were practiced in small groups. The instruments 1d one STYLE proficiency test, five reading comprehension tests, and questionnaires of strategy use and an attitude questionnaire toward e-books based reading strategy instruction. Results indicated that after reading strategy instruction, the experimental group performed better than the control group in story comprehension, but without significance. However, they significantly outperformed the control group in strategy use. Also, the experimental group had positive attitude toward e-books based reading strategy instruction.

174,Reading strategies of good and poor readers of German with different spelling abilities,"Reading and spelling abilities are thought to be highly correlated during development, and orthographic knowledge is assumed to underpin both literacy skills. Interestingly, recent studies showed that reading and spelling skills can also dissociate. The current study investigated whether spelling skills (indicating orthographic knowledge) are associated with the application of orthographic strategies during reading. We examined eye movements of 137 third- and fourth-graders who were either good or poor readers with or without a spelling deficit: 43 children with typical reading and spelling skills, 28 with isolated spelling deficits, 28 with isolated reading deficits, and 38 with combined reading and spelling deficits. Although we expected to find reduced reliance on orthographic reading processes among poor spellers, this was evident for the group with combined deficits only. Both isolated deficit groups applied sublexical and lexical processes in a similar amount to typically developing children. Our findings suggest that reading rests on orthographic strategies even if lexical representations are poor as indicated by a deficit in spelling skills. Findings also show that dysfluent reading does not result only from overreliance on decoding.

176,Effects of Multimedia Annotations on Thai EFL Readers' Words and Text Recall,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of using multimedia annotations on EFL readers' word recall and text recall and to explore which type of multimedia annotations--L1 meaning, L2 meaning, sound, and image--would have a better effect on their recall of new words and text comprehension. The participants were 78 students who enrolled in an Intermediate EFL course at a university in the north of Thailand. Five instruments--a questionnaire, a vocabulary pre-test, a computerized log-file, and two posttests: a vocabulary test and a text recall test--were used to collect data. First, the participants responded to the questionnaire and the pre-test in the classroom. One week later, they read a hypertext equipped with multimedia annotations in the computer laboratory while the log files recorded their selections of words and annotations. Immediately after that, they answered the two post-tests. Three weeks later, a vocabulary test was given to the participants again without informing in advanced. The results revealed that (1) accessing multimedia annotations led to significantly greater vocabulary recall (42%) among Thai EFL learners; (2) their retention lasted at least three weeks after being exposed to the multimedia-annotated text; (3) they recalled words with images significantly better than those with no images; (4) they recalled about 31% of the text with multimedia annotations; and (5) no significant difference was found regarding the effects of using different types of multimedia annotations on learners' word recall and text recall when compared between learners.",College Students; Documentation; English (Second Language); Flesch Kincaid Grade Level Formula; Foreign Countries; Hypermedia; Multimedia Instruction; Pretests Posttests; Questionnaires; reading comprehension; Recall (Psychology); Retention (Psychology); Second Language Instruction; Statistical Analysis; Technology Uses in Education; Thailand; Vocabulary Development,"Gasigijtamrong, Jenjit",2013.0,,0,176
177,"The effects of a computer assisted reading program on the oral reading fluency and comprehension of at-risk, urban first grade students","The current investigation studied the effects of a computer software program of the oral reading fluency and comprehension of eight, first grade students. These students were identified as being either 'at-risk' or 'some-risk' for reading failure on the DIBELS oral reading fluency winter benchmark assessment. A multiple probe design was used to determine if the Read Naturally software edition would increase the ORF, as measure as correct words per minute, on treatment and generalization probes. Also measured were the percentage of comprehension questions answered correctly on treatment probes and word retell on both treatment and generalization probes. The Read Naturally software edition consisted of a repeated reading sequence activity that the participants engaged in on a laptop computer. The sequence consisted of seven components: key words, one-minute cold reading, read along, practice reading, comprehension quiz, and pass timing. Treatment sessions lasted approximately thirty minutes and were conducted three to four times per week, for between 14 and 16 weeks. Pretest and posttest measure were collected to determine if the participants' scores on these test would increase following the completion of the intervention. The results of the intervention demonstrated the effectiveness of the Read Naturally program on the OFR and comprehension of the participants on treatment probes. All of the participants were able to increase their scores on these measures over baseline levels; however, the results were not as evident for generalization probes. Many of the participants were not able to increase their ORF on generalization probes to benchmark levels. Due to this failure to increase reading fluency a second treatment phase was implemented with increase fluency requirements. During this second phase 5 out of 8 participants were able to increase their ORF to benchmark levels on generalization passages. Additionally, 5 out of 8 participants were able to decrease their DIBELS ORF risk status on winter benchmark assessments. These finding support research on the use of repeated reading strategies, but extend the research in several ways. First, the results suggest the computer assisted reading programs are a viable means to supplement classroom instruction. Second, they suggest that generalization might be promoted by increasing fluency goal criteria on practice passage reading. Finally, the results suggest that repeated reading strategies can be used successful with first grade students. Implications for classroom use, limitations, and directions for future research are presented.

178,The Effects of a Supplementary Computerized Fluency Intervention on the Generalization of the Oral Reading Fluency and Comprehension of First-Grade Students,"The current study investigated the effects of a repeated reading intervention on the oral reading fluency (ORF) and comprehension on generalization passages for eight, first-grade students with reading risk. The intervention involved a commercial computerized program (Read Naturally Software Edition [RNSE], 2009) and a generalization principle requiring a ""greater magnitude"" of responding. A multiple probe experimental design with two treatment phases was used to determine the effects of the intervention. Phase I used a standard end-of-year benchmark score (i.e., 40 CWMP) as fluency criteria for all participants. During Phase II, fluency criteria were changed and individualized for each participant based on performance during Phase I. Data were collected on ORF and word retell fluency (WRF) across treatment and generalization probes. Results showed ORF and comprehension increases in both phases; however, satisfactory generalization did not occur for most of the participants until the second phase was implemented. These results are discussed relative to classroom implications and directions for future research.",At Risk Students; Benchmarking; Computer Assisted Instruction; Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS); Elementary School Students; Generalization; Grade 1; intervention; Oral Reading; reading comprehension; Reading Fluency; Reading Improvement; reading instruction; Reading strategies; Reading Tests; Scores; Supplementary Education,"Gibson, Lenwood, Jr.; Cartledge, Gwendolyn; Keyes, Starr E.; Yawn, Christopher D.",2014.0,,0,178
179,Contemporary Spheres for the Teaching Education: Freire's Principles,"Freire's cogitation on Information Technology (IT), resources for education have been known since the decade of the 50s. And now, within the current context, this analysis outlines the literacy problem as an issue of gnosis and anthropology while existing in a virtual dimension. Based on research/experiences that also were carried out in Brazil, it can be noted that the literacy that is being discussed 1s the skill in handling a mouse, selecting, dragging, cutting, pasting, CTRL C+CTRL V, writing a text and searching the internet, but although it seems ""obvious"", public education policy has not given sufficient thought nor assumed a pedagogical position on these issues. This discussed cogitation considers contributions of the Freire pedagogy, in the attempt to attain, through this type of literacy, the unprecedented accomplishment of something viable-that what teachers realize as unprecedented, due to the fact that nobody has accomplished it before, however viable, because all of the conditions to make it happen are there, including a critical preparation of the educators. Within the internet context, the proposal implies a digital writing and reading ability that is based on communication and dialogue skills and, as fundamental strategies for reading the world, the real/virtual world, the knowledge of the daily speech, of writing and reading within a multi-diversification of digitally generated texts.

180,Digital versus paper reading processes and links to comprehension for middle school students,"This study explores digital and paper reading processes and outcomes for 371 fifth to eighth graders completing a reading task similar to standardized testing. Results showed students highlighted and annotated more when reading the paper versus digital text. Also, reading on paper versus digitally was slightly supportive of reading comprehension for the longer section of text. For behaviors, digital highlighting and looking back at the paper text were supportive of reading comprehension, whereas paper highlighting was negatively related, likely because paper highlighting tended to occur often outside of important areas of the text. Paper and digital annotating, online dictionary use, and digital look-back did not link to comprehension, when controlling for other covariates. Links to theory, research, and practice are discussed.

181,"Glossing for meaning and glossing for form A computerized study of the effects of glossing and type of linguistic item on reading comprehension, noticing, and L2 learning","The relative effectiveness of annotating L2 texts for improved comprehension has been generally supported by studies on glossing. The assumption has been that glosses are effective decoding devices that help L2 readers overcome their limited proficiency by making meanings more accessible to them. At the same time, glosses have been investigated in relation to noticing and learning in incidental contexts. In spite of its centrality, this question has not generally been addressed empirically in previous studies on glossing and L2 learning because qualitative measures of L2 processing, and concurrent data elicited via those measures, were generally not available in these studies. The present study addresses this important methodological problem in the glossing strand of research by utilizing a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest hybrid design that incorporates a combination of outcome and processing measures to investigate the issue of L1-translation glosses and type of linguistic item in relation to reading comprehension, noticing and learning. First-year college students learning Spanish were asked to read one of two versions of an L2 Spanish text on a computer. In the glossed version, exemplars of three types of linguistic items embedded in the text were glossed with L1 English translations presented at the bottom of page. In the no-gloss conditions, participants were exposed to a different version of the same text without glosses. After exposure to the L2 reading task, participants completed a multiple-choice comprehension questionnaire previously announced to them, and two unannounced production and recognition immediate posttests, which were repeated three weeks later. The results of the study indicate that the presence of a gloss has a positive effect on a reading comprehension. However, the quantitative and qualitative evidence of the study does not support an effect of glosses on noticing and L2 learning of targeted items. Rather, the study provides evidence that glosses work in combination with other variables to impact different types of items differentially. Combined effects of glossing and type of linguistic item found in the study strongly suggest that glosses do not work in isolation but in combination with other factors to affect noticing and learning.

182,The effects of low-vision rehabilitation on reading speed and depression in age related macular degeneration: A meta-analysis,"Importance: Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive eye disease that, as of 2015, has affected 11 million people in the U.S. and 1.5 million in Canada causing central vision blindness. By 2050, this number is expected to double to 22 million. Eccentric vision is the target of low-vision rehabilitation aids and programs for patients with AMD, which are thought to improve functional performance by improving reading speed and depression. Objective: This study evaluates the effect of various low-vision rehabilitation strategies on reading speed and depression in patients 55 and older with AMD. Data Sources: Computer databases including MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson-Reuters), CINAHL (EBSCO), Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED), ISI Web of Science (Thomson-Reuters) and the Cochrane Library (Wiley) were searched from the year 2000 to January 2015. Study Selection: 1d papers were research studies with a sample size of 20 eyes or greater focused on AMD in adults aged 55 or older with low vision (20/60 or lower). Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers screened and extracted relevant data from the 1d articles. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was chosen as an effect size to perform metaanalysis using STATA. Fixed- and random-effect models were developed based on heterogeneity. Main Outcomes: Reading Speed and Depression Scores. Results: A total of 9 studies (885 subjects) were 1d. Overall, a significant improvement in reading speed was found with a SMD of 1.01 [95% CI: 0.05 to 1.97]. Low-vision rehabilitation strategies including micro-perimetric biofeedback, microscopes teaching program significantly improved reading speed. Eccentric viewing training showed the maximum improvement in reading speed. In addition, a non-significant improvement in depression scores was found with a SMD of -0.44 [95% CI: -0.96 to 0.09]. Conclusion: A considerable amount of research is required in the area of low-vision rehabilitation strategies for patients with AMD. Based on current research, low-vision rehabilitation aids improve reading speed. However, they do not have a significant effect on depression scores in those 55 and older with AMD.

183,Applicability of the compensatory encoding model in foreign language reading: An investigation with Chinese college English language learners,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 9[919] of Frontiers in Psychology (see record [rid]2018-31445-001[/rid]). The original Appendix 3, which contained the four reading texts, was removed due to copyright concerns. The enumeration of the appendices has been updated accordingly. This does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way. The original article has been updated.] While some first language (L1) reading models suggest that inefficient word recognition and small working memory tend to inhibit higher-level comprehension processes;the Compensatory Encoding Model maintains that slow word recognition and small working memory do not normally hinder reading comprehension, as readers are able to operate metacognitive strategies to compensate for inefficient word recognition and working memory limitation as long as readers process a reading task without time constraint. Although empirical evidence is accumulated for support of the Compensatory Encoding Model in L1 reading, there is lack of research for testing of the Compensatory Encoding Model in foreign language (FL) reading. This research empirically tested the Compensatory Encoding Model in English reading among Chinese college English language learners (ELLs). Two studies were conducted.Study one focused on testing whether reading condition varying time affects the relationship between word recognition, working memory, and reading comprehension.Students were tested on a computerized English word recognition test, a computerized Operation Span task, and reading comprehension in time constraint and non-time constraint reading. The correlation and regression analyses showed that the strength of association was much stronger between word recognition, working memory, and reading comprehension in time constraint than that in non-time constraint reading condition. Study two examined whether FL readers were able to operate metacognitive reading strategies as a compensatory way of reading comprehension for inefficient word recognition and working memory limitation in non-time constraint reading. The participants were tested on the same computerized English word recognition test and Operation Span test. They were required to think aloud while reading and to complete the comprehension questions. The think-aloud protocols were coded for concurrent use of reading strategies, classified into language-oriented strategies, content-oriented strategies, re-reading, pausing, and meta-comment. The correlation analyses showed that while word recognition and working memory were only significantly related to frequency of language-oriented strategies, re-reading, and pausing, but not with reading comprehension. Jointly viewed, the results of the two studies, complimenting each other, supported the applicability of the Compensatory Encoding Model in FL reading with Chinese college ELLs.

184,ConfChem Conference on Flipped Classroom: Time-Saving Resources Aligned with Cognitive Science to Help Instructors,"Studies in cognitive science have verified that working memory (where the brain solves problems) can manipulate nearly all elements of knowledge that can be recalled automatically from long-term memory, but only a few elements that have not previously been well memorized. Research in reading comprehension has found that ""lecture notes with clicker questions"" can move a portion of lecture content to homework. By applying these findings to the design of homework-tutorials for students, under the right conditions, we found that time for active learning during lecture increased and student achievement measurably improved. Factors that have affected the outcome of our experiments are discussed. This communication summarizes one of the invited papers to the ConfChem online conference Flipped Classroom, held from May 9 to June 12, 2014 and hosted by the ACS DivCHED Committee on Computers in Chemical Education (CCCE).",Audience Response Systems; Brain; Cognitive Processes; Cognitive Science; College Science; executive function; High Schools; Homework; Long Term Memory; Memorization; New Jersey; problem solving; reading comprehension; Science Instruction; Secondary School Science; Short Term Memory; Undergraduate Study,"Hartman, JudithAnn R.; Dahm, Donald J.; Nelson, Eric A.",2015.0,,0,184
185,"Why Johnny can read Chinese: Working memory, cognitive processes, and reading comprehension","For many native English speakers, learning to read Chinese as a second or foreign language is a long and oftentimes laborious process, fraught with seemingly endless and demoralizing frustrations. Unlike the relationships of English to French, German, or Spanish, which share varying but useful amounts of cognates, English and Chinese share no cognates, which means that from the start learners have nothing to rely onto help them navigate their way through seas of Chinese text. Yet, with time, non-native learners of Chinese do come to comprehend novel texts they are faced with on their own. In order to understand the paths nonnative readers of Chinese take to comprehend the texts they read, this study examines and attempts to identify and describe effects of difficulty level on cognitive processing based on eye-tracking data. The data from three groups of participants (non-native Intermediate level [n = 5], non-native Superior level [n = 7], and native Chinese [n = 13]) were gathered during a computer-adaptive test. Quantitative (descriptive) and qualitative analyses were conducted on the data. The study shows that non-native readers of Chinese at an Intermediate level demonstrate different reading strategies than non-native readers of Chinese at a Superior level, who in turn use a similar strategies as native Chinese readers, but at different times during the reading process. There were also indications that there are two distinct types of readers within the non-native Superior level participants, i.e., those who were still more nonnative in their approach to texts and those who displayed native-like reading strategies. The study shows that learners of Chinese go through phases of cognitive abilities as their knowledge of vocabulary and structures increases and they expand their reading experiences with a variety of text types. Theoretical, pedagogical, and methodological implications are discussed.

186,The Variance of Intraclass Correlations in Three- and Four-Level Models,"Intraclass correlations are used to summarize the variance decomposition in populations with multilevel hierarchical structure. There has recently been considerable interest in estimating intraclass correlations from surveys or designed experiments to provide design parameters for planning future large-scale randomized experiments. The large sample distribution of estimates of the intraclass correlation in two-level situations is well known. Contemporary educational and social experiments often involve sampling designs with three or four levels of nesting, leading to three- and four-level intraclass correlation structures. The present article provides expressions for the large sample variances and covariances of estimates of three- and four-level intraclass correlation structures.

187,The effects of literacy support tools on the comprehension of informational e-books and print-based text,"This mixed methods research explores the effects of literacy support tools to support comprehension strategies when reading informational e-books and print-based text with 14 first-grade students. This study focused on the following comprehension strategies: annotating connections, annotating I wonders, and looking back in the text. Data collection comprised the Developmental Reading AssessmentRTM, 2nd edition, comprehension quiz scores, literacy support tools tally system, teacher interview, and researcher/literacy support personnel's anecdotal notes. The students participated in two conditions: (a) reading informational e-books using digital literacy support tools, and (b) reading informational print-based texts using traditional literacy support tools in either Phase 1--Fall or Phase 2--Winter/Spring. Students who read informational print-based text showed a higher mean level of comprehension, F(1, 24) = 22.415, p = 0.001, eta2 = 0.483, than those that read informational e-books. A chi-square analysis indicated significant patterns between the e-book comprehension scores and the usage of the literacy support tools, X2(6, n = 211) = 25.79, p = 0.001, as well as between the print-based comprehension scores and the usage of the literacy support tools, X2(4, n = 640) = 10.98, p = 0.027. In addition, there were significant patterns between the student's reading level and the usage of the literacy support tools when reading e-books, X2(4, n = 214) = 35.21, p = 0.001, as well as between the student's reading level and the usage of literacy support tools, X 2(4, n = 639) = 21.43, p = 0.001. The qualitative data highlights the student's literacy support tool preference, the ability to use the tools, and understanding the relevant application of the tools. Incorporating informational e-books and digital literacy support tools into the classroom provides additional opportunities to read and comprehend informational text.

188,Bridging Skill and Task Oriented Reading,"Some individual difference factors are more strongly correlated with performance on postreading questions when the text is not available than when it is. The present study explores if similar interactions occur with bridging skill, which refers to a reader's propensity to establish connections between explicit text during reading. Undergraduates read science texts using two research tools. The Reading Strategy Assessment Tool provided a measure of bridging skill. Texts and postreading questions were presented in Read&Answer, and the availability of the text while answering was manipulated. Contrary to prior research, bridging skill was comparably correlated with performance in both availability conditions. Although bridging skill was not correlated with search decisions, there was a trend toward a positive correlation with search time, suggesting that readers who tend to bridge more may also tend to persist longer in searching for answers. The results are discussed in terms of dynamic perspectives of task-oriented reading. [At the time of submission to ERIC this article was in press with ""Discourse Processes.""

190,"Can an Integrated Technology-Aided Instruction Program Lead to Improved Learning Outcomes in Low-Income, Rural Zambia? Midline Findings from a Mixed-Methods Experimental Study","Zambia faces many challenges common to low- and middle-income countries as it seeks to improve its education system, including low literacy rates for young Zambians and low public expenditure on education. In the past 20 years, Zambia's school system has expanded to reach more children in rural areas, primarily through community schools, which are autonomous from the government. But many community schools in Zambia are staffed by untrained and underpaid teachers who lack access to quality lesson plans, management skills, and basic supplies. These schools need a cost-effective solution for delivering quality education to improve learning outcomes. One potentially promising intervention for Zambia's community schools is Impact Network's eSchool 360 model, a multifaceted technology-aided instruction program designed to deliver low-cost education to children in rural areas. The model incorporates three potentially high-impact components: (1) standardized e-learning curriculum and pedagogy, through which schools receive technology--tablets and projectors powered through solar power--loaded with lesson plans for teachers and interactive lessons for students in the local language; (2) frequent teacher coaching and professional development on how to use the technology and enhance pedagogical skills; and (3) community ownership, meaning that teachers are recruited from the community and schools engage frequently with parents of students. The American Institutes for Research (AIR) is conducting an evaluation of this model's effectiveness in support of its mission to use the best evidence available to improve people's lives.

191,A Vocabulary Learning Tool for L2 Undergraduates Reading Science and Technology Textbooks,"Students of English as a second language who major in science and technology use English-language textbooks to ensure that they can read English materials upon graduation. Research indicates that teachers spend little time helping these students on the linguistic complexity of such textbooks. Vocabulary, grammar, and article structure are elements of this complexity, but to many students, these elements can be akin to locked doors. This study presents MyVLS-Reader, which focuses on unlocking the first of these doors--vocabulary--while assisting in reading. With explicit vocabulary learning, students learn and memorize individual vocabulary, but the context is lost if the depth of learning discards context. In implicit vocabulary learning, students acquire vocabulary through repeated exposure to contexts, but repeated encounters with new words are required. Few e-learning systems combine both vocabulary-learning approaches. MyVLS-Reader achieves such synergy by (1) using a keyword setting to provide context-matched vocabulary explanation while reading and (2) embedding multiple learning choices, such as keyword setting, the review and memorization of explicit vocabulary, and the option to ask instructors. This study 1s two rounds of evaluations: (1) an evaluation of the learning achievements of control and treatment groups and (2) a quantitative and qualitative investigation of perceptions regarding the use of MyVLS-Reader. The evaluation results indicate that the treatment group developed a better vocabulary than the control group in significantly less time. The use of MyVLS-Reader also slightly improved higher-order thinking skills. This result suggests that MyVLS-Reader can effective assist students in building their vocabulary while reading.

192,A personalized recommendation-based mobile learning approach to improving the reading performance of EFL students,"In this paper, a personalized recommendation-based mobile language learning approach is proposed. A mobile learning system has been developed based on the approach by providing a reading material recommendation mechanism for guiding EFL (English as Foreign Language) students to read articles that match their preferences and knowledge levels, and a reading annotation module that enables students to take notes of English vocabulary translations for the reading content in individual or shared annotation mode. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted on a senior high school English course by assigning three classes of students to two experimental groups and a control group. One experimental group learned with the recommendation system with the individual annotation function, the other experimental group learned with the recommendation system with the shared annotation function, while the students in the control group learned with the individual annotation function, but without the recommendation system. The experimental results show that both experimental groups outperformed the control group, but there was no difference in learning outcome between the two experimental groups in terms of learning achievements.

Fifty-seven university students from two intact reading classes with comparable proficiency levels were assigned to participate in either a paper-based or an online reading instructional module. Both groups received comparable reading strategy instruction in four areas: Global (keyword list, prediction, overview, and text structure), Problem-solving (reading rate, listening, summarizing, and concept mapping), Support (dictionary, grammar book, translator, highlight, and record book), and Socio-affective (music and peer interaction) strategies. The only difference was the medium: the instruction was paper-based in one class and computer-based in the other class. After each group's four-hour training and reading period, students' reading comprehension was measured using a written recall and further analyzed with a weighted propositional system. Results showed that the online reading group outperformed the paper-based group on overall reading comprehension. An interview session provided insights into students' perceptions of the online module. Findings of this study can encourage teachers to incorporate web-based reading strategy training into their curriculum.",College Freshmen; Comparative Analysis; Conventional Instruction; Electronic Learning; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; instructional effectiveness; Interviews; Language Proficiency; Measures (Individuals); problem solving; Quasiexperimental Design; reading comprehension; reading instruction; Reading strategies; Recall (Psychology); Second Language Instruction; Student Attitudes; Taiwan,"Huang, Hsin-chou",2014.0,,0,194
195,The Effects of Multimedia Annotation and Summary Writing on Taiwanese EFL Students' Reading Comprehension,"The present study investigates the effects of multimedia annotation through the discourse scheme and summary writing through the grounding theory (Chang, 1997) on text comprehension. Specifically, the study focuses on examining the influences of multimedia annotation from a special perspective, namely, the use of modified discourse scheme to trigger EFL learners' active reading process, rather than a passive way of receiving different types of annotations. Summary writing, a newly applied means to test learners' reading comprehension (Trites & McGroarty, 2005), is probed to see whether there exist wash back effects in assisting learners' reading performance. One hundred Taiwanese EFL university freshmen were divided into four groups, each group receiving a different treatment within a pretest-posttest-delay post-test design. Results of ANOVA indicated that both multimedia annotation and summary writing had significant positive effects on learners' reading performance, with obvious variances in the post and delayed post-test. Moreover, the repeated measure was applied to examine the lasting effects of the treatments. In addition, qualitative interview data relating to the participants' ideas and attitudes are also discussed.",College Freshmen; Documentation; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Multimedia Materials; Pretests Posttests; Program Effectiveness; reading comprehension; Second Language Learning; Statistical Analysis; Student Attitudes; Taiwan; Writing (Composition),"Huang, Wen-Chi",2014.0,,0,195
196,The effectiveness of adopting e-readers to facilitate EFL students’ process-based academic writing,"English as Foreign Language (EFL) students face additional difficulties for academic writing largely due to their level of language competency. An appropriate structural process of writing can help students develop their academic writing skills. This study explored the use of the e-readers to facilitate EFL students' process-based academic writing. The experiment was conducted in the graduate level class entitled 'Technical and Scientific English Writing' in a northern Taiwan university for the entire semester, about 5 months. Students’ perceptions, writing outcome and portfolio were collected and were later evaluated. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were adopted in this study. Empirical data were collected and analyzed to report on the performance of EFL students’ academic writing with and without the e-readers. Findings indicate that e-readers affected the process of reading, annotation, and information retrieval with the unique functions. For EFL students’ academic writing, e-reader can be a tool for reciprocal peer review that aided academic writing. Moreover, e-readers are significantly beneficial for students’ academic writing progress compared to the conventional paper-based materials. The functions of e-readers can assist students’ writing process and make the recursive circle of steps more efficiently. E-readers could afford creating a better writing environment in the process-based writing approach. This study further discussed the role of e-readers in the academic writing classroom and further discusses how to use e-readers to facilitate academic writing in the classroom.

197,Extensive reading for undergraduate EFL learners: Multimodal text vs linear text,"Scholars have advocated that the literacy of multimodal text is indispensible and irreversible in this era of widespread use of Information and Computer Technology (ICT). In response to this advocacy, the current quasi-experimental study was designed to examine effects of English Internet extensive reading on the development of English proficiency of Taiwanese undergraduate learners of English as a foreign language (EFL). Because positive impact of the extensive reading of books, or linear printed text, has been established relatively firmly by existing literature, the current study examined effects of the extensive reading of multimodal text against that of linear text. Fiction was the genre of reading text in the current study because it was used in all the reviewed studies of extensive reading of linear text. Guided by four hypotheses, three types of statistical analysis tests were conducted. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test results indicated equally significant improvement in English proficiency in the experimental groups but not significant change in motivation for reading across all three groups. The multiple regression test results suggested that the extensive reading of either linear or multimodal text predicted English proficiency. The chi-square test results did not reveal significant association between extensive reading and application of several reading strategies. The discussion involving statistical findings and contextual data provided by questionnaires and participants’ assignment sheets leads to pedagogical implications and directions for future research. The pedagogical implications are incorporating extensive reading of linear and/or multimodal text into formal EFL curricula and including multimodal informational text in the program. Regarding directions for future research, one is unveiling EFL learners’ perception of the role of multimodal text in and the impact of their perception on their development of English literacy. Other directions 1 exploring effects of interacting with informational type of multimodal text and integrating reading strategy instructions in an extensive reading program. Finally, future research is recommended to identify essential elements a reliable and valid measure of motivation for EFL reading should contain to uncover the role motivation for reading plays in the development of EFL learners’ English literacy.

198,English as Second Language: Students' Awareness of Learning Strategies Used in Reading Comprehension,"This study investigated the reading strategies used by adult learners' to read materials in English language for their studies. The population of the study consisted of students of Universiti Sains Malaysia. A sample of 80 (40 Postgraduates and 40 Undergraduates) TESOL students enrolled in the University were selected randomly. The data were collected by administering a piloted questionnaire and analyzed through SPSS. The results of the study revealed that TESOL students used different strategies in reading textual materials. The main reading strategies appeared to be adjusting reading speed;focusing on typographical features; summarizing; re-reading the text; taking notes; reviewing the text; underlining or circling important information; using tables, figures, pictures and contextual clues, and guessing the meaning of unknown words and/ or phrases. The study further demonstrated that, in spite of using the mentioned reading strategies; the learners need to know how to use dictionaries, pauses, visualization and critical evaluation of the text. Based on the findings of the study, preparation of proper guidelines and their effective use by TESOL students, teachers and researchers to enhance reading comprehension were recommended.",Adult Students; College Students; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Guessing (Tests); Laptop Computers; Likert Scales; Malaysia; Measures (Individuals); Questionnaires; reading comprehension; Reading Rate; Reading strategies; Second Language Instruction; Second Language Learning; Statistical Analysis; Visual Aids,"Hussain, Irshad; Javed, Muhammad; Munshi, Parveen",2015.0,,0,198
199,Effects of integrating a concept mapping‐based summarization strategy into flipped learning on students’ reading performances and perceptions in Chinese courses,"The capability of reading comprehension is one of the essential skills for learning different topics, and has been recognized as a challenging objective in the Chinese curriculum. In this study, a concept mapping‐based summarization strategy was incorporated into flipped learning to improve students’ reading comprehension. The participants of the study were 45 fifth graders from two Mandarin Chinese classes at an elementary school in Taiwan. None of the students had previous flipped learning experience. A pretest and posttest of reading comprehension as well as pre‐ and post‐questionnaires for measuring the students’ reading motivation, self‐efficacy, and cognitive load were conducted. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improved the students’ summarization skills, while the impact of the approach on students’ reading comprehension was not significant. Moreover, reading comprehension and self‐efficacy showed a positive correlation, and self‐efficacy was positively correlated with both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Consequently, it is concluded that employing concept mapping with the summarization strategy in flipped learning and students’ summarization ability are directly related, but there may be an indirect relationship with reading comprehension.

201,The Impact of Interface on ESL Reading Comprehension and Strategy Use: A Comparison of E-Books and Paper Texts,"The use of e-books in postsecondary education is projected to increase, yet many English as a second language (ESL) institutions have not yet incorporated e-books into their curricula, in part due to a dearth of research regarding their potential impacts on ESL reading comprehension and strategy use. This study fills a gap in the existing research by investigating the impacts of contemporary e-books on ESL strategy use and reading comprehension, in comparison to paper texts. Twenty-two high-intermediate ESL participants were separated evenly into a paper text group and an e-book group. They were given pretests, support strategy mini-lessons, reading sessions with observation, posttests, surveys, and delayed posttests. Independent-sample t-tests revealed no significant difference between the groups' reading comprehension rates; however, reading strategy use and frequency varied between groups. Though the majority of e-book participants had not previously used e-books for learning, they reported preferring them over paper texts after the reading sessions were completed. The study's findings offer some support for the incorporation of e-books in ESL curricula. In addition, the findings suggest that instructors provide e-book strategy lessons to students so they can appropriate the technology effectively.",Books; Comparative Analysis; educational technology; Electronic Publishing; English (Second Language); Observation; Postsecondary Education; Pretests Posttests; Printed Materials; reading comprehension; Reading strategies; Second Language Instruction; Surveys; Teaching Methods; Technology Uses in Education,"Isaacson, Sarah A.",2017.0,,0,201
202,Enhancing Oral Reading Fluency through Computer Assisted Repeated Reading,"This study was carried out to investigate the effectiveness of using the Computer Assisted Repeated Reading (CARR) technique to enhance Form One rural students' oral reading fluency (ORF). The single subject experimental design (SSED) involved five students who participated in a 12-week study where CARR intervention was carried out twice a week. CARR, the adaptation of the CBM/ORF procedure, was used to improve their accuracy and automaticity in word decoding. Each participant's accuracy and automaticity in word decoding before and after intervention were charted on line graphs. Accuracy was determined by the percentage of words read correctly. The participant's initial reading accuracy showed that they could only read at instructional level but improved after the CARR intervention. Automaticity was determined by the reading rate or words read correctly per minute (WCPM) and the results too showed improvements. It can be concluded that the CARR technique was effective in improving struggling readers' reading fluency. Overall CARR can help ease teachers' burden, and their students to improve their reading skills.",Accuracy; Computer Assisted Instruction; Decoding (Reading); Foreign Countries; Grade 7; instructional effectiveness; Malaysia; Oral Reading; Reading Fluency; Reading Improvement; reading instruction; Reading Rate; Reading strategies; Repetition; Rural Schools; Secondary School Students; word recognition,"Ja'afar, Hasimah; Othman, Wan Mazlini; Kesevan, Hema Vanita; Budi, M.

203,Timing Game-Based Practice in a Reading Comprehension Strategy Tutor,"Game-based practice within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) can be optimized by examining how properties of practice activities influence learning outcomes and motivation. In the current study, we manipulated when game-based practice was available to students. All students (n = 149) first completed lesson videos in iSTART-2, an ITS focusing on reading comprehension strategies. They then practiced with iSTART-2 for two 2-hour sessions. Students' first session was either in a game or nongame practice environment. In the second session, they either switched to the alternate environment or remained in the same environment. Students' comprehension was tested at pretest and post-test, and motivational measures were collected. Overall, students' comprehension increased from pretest to posttest. Effect sizes of the pretest to posttest gain suggested that switching from the game to nongame environment was least effective, while switching from a nongame to game environment or remaining in the game environment was more effective. However, these differences between the practice conditions were not statistically significant, either on comprehension or motivation measures, suggesting that for iSTART-2, the timing of game-based practice availability does not substantially impact students' experience in the system.",Correlation; Educational Games; High School Graduates; High School Students; instructional effectiveness; Intelligent tutoring systems; Pretests Posttests; Reading Achievement; reading comprehension; reading instruction; Reading strategies; Statistical Analysis; Student Motivation; Time Factors (Learning),"Jacovina, Matthew E.; Jackson, G.

204,Improving Critical Reading with E-Texts: A Controlled Study in a Collegiate Philosophy Course,"This study investigated the impact of incorporating e-reader texts and annotation tools in multiple sections of an upper level philosophy course (N Control = 98; NE-reader = 76). This study adds to the body of literature that assesses gains/losses in conventional measures of performance (e.g., scores on graded assignments) and changes in student attitudes as reported in questionnaires. However, this study was unique in that it focused on training students to use e-reader tools for critical reading practices and it 1d assessment of student annotations and their relationship with the performance measures. Using both quantitative and qualitative data, we tested the hypothesis that, with intentional training and a course-design that provided multiple opportunities for practice and feedback, students using e-readers for critical engagement with their reading assignments would demonstrate (a) deeper understanding of the content of the texts, (b) improvement in their use of critical reading practices, and (c) improvement in their attitudes toward the use of e-readers for academic work. While we did not observe significant gains in graded assignments compared with control groups using printed texts, we found no evidence of losses for students using e-readers. At the same time, we found evidence of improvement in students' critical reading practices, especially when paired with modeling and practice throughout the term. We also observed significant positive changes in student attitudes toward the use of e-readers for academic work, compared with controls. Our findings suggest that achieving the benefits of e-readers for the development of critical reading skills requires a course with design elements that are specifically tailored to this purpose.",College Students; Critical Reading; Curriculum Design; Documentation; Educational Benefits; Electronic Publishing; Handheld Devices; Philosophy; reading comprehension; Reading Improvement; Reading Skills; Textbooks,"Jensen, Mark N.; Scharff, Mark N.",2019.0,,0,204
205,Reading in print versus digital media uses different cognitive strategies: Evidence from eye movements during science-text reading,"Comparing comprehension outcomes in print and digital reading is an active area of research but little is known about the reading processes that these media entail. This study involved an eye-tracking experiment with 50 undergraduate students to investigate the differences in reading processes in print and digital media. The participants were randomly assigned to read the same six-page popular science article that 1d several diagrams either in print or on a tablet computer and then answer reading comprehension questions. The results showed that comprehension was better when reading in print. Eye-movement data indicated that the print and digital groups spent about the same amount of time processing the article, texts, diagrams, and diagram statements, but the time was not divided evenly between the first pass and the rereading stages. The digital group spent more time reading the article at the first-pass reading stage and seldom reread it. In contrast, the print group first skimmed the article and then reread the important parts, exhibiting both longer total fixation durations in the rereading stage and a higher number of rereading instances across pages. In sum, the findings indicate that reading in print versus digital media employs different cognitive strategies with those reading in print showing more selective and intentional reading behavior.

206,"Marginalised Behaviour: Digital Annotations, Spatial Encoding and the Implications for Reading Comprehension","Within large scale educational assessment agencies in the UK, there has been a shift towards assessors marking digitally scanned copies rather than the original paper scripts that were traditionally used. This project uses extended essay examination scripts to consider whether the mode in which an essay is read potentially influences the judgements made about it, employing qualitative and quantitative data-gathering approaches to focus on the annotation practices of readers who are assessing extended essays, and to explore whether this might be affected by mode. The project also gathers evidence about the spatial encoding ability of these readers to suggest that mode-related influences on annotation might influence the ability of readers to comprehend fully the material being read. Examiners had less spatial awareness about the location of script features on screen than on paper; however, annotating on screen might link to both the provision of appropriate annotations and the relative ease with which these are deployed whilst reading. There was also evidence that on-screen annotation could contribute to the development of good mental representations of texts on screen.

The participants in the study were selected from four intact classes consisting of 100 students studying English at intermediate level in Kish Institute of Science & technology (olom va fonon), in Iran. After they were given a reading comprehension text, the four experimental groups were given the same reading comprehension texts with different annotations. Then, they were asked to take the same reading test as posttest. The results of the study demonstrated that text-only and audio-only were more effective than other kinds of annotation. The results suggested that providing the new words whether in audio or text annotation during reading comprehension can help students to comprehend reading in an effective way. Educational implications suggest that provision of different kinds of glosses is beneficial for L2 students although they need some scaffolding for utilizing glosses in a beneficial way.",Audiovisual Aids; College Students; English (Second Language); English Proficiency Test; Foreign Countries; Hypermedia; Iran; Language Tests; reading comprehension; Second Language Learning; Technology Uses in Education; Visual Aids; Vocabulary Development,"Karbalaei, Alireza; Zare, Amaneh",2019.0,,0,207
208,Examining comprehension of children with reading difficulty following reading with text-to-speech features,"The purpose of this dissertation research was to explore the effectiveness of text-to-speech (TTS) technology as a compensatory reading strategy to support the reading comprehension of students with reading difficulties. The literature is mixed in regard to the usefulness of TTS to help bolster children's reading comprehension. Research examining the specific TTS presentational features that best support reading comprehension is scarce in the literature. In addition, more research is needed to address the specific reading profiles of struggling readers and their relationship to successful comprehension outcomes with TTS.Two exploratory studies were conducted. Participants 1d 29 children, ages 8-12 years, with reading difficulty as determined by the inclusion/exclusion reading test battery. The first experimental study examined the reading comprehension of students after reading a grade level passage with or without TTS. The researchers also examined whether there was a significant difference among the reading comprehension scores under the following conditions: (a) silent reading of the passage, (b) reading the passage aloud, (c) listening to the passage with digitized speech only and no text, (d) reading the passage with the use of text-to-speech with no highlighting, and (e) reading the passage with the use of text-to-speech with highlighting features. The second study described the relationship between the child's performance on behavioral tests of reading, language and executive function and comprehension scores following reading a passage under the aforementioned conditions.The results of the first study, showed that TTS significantly improved reading comprehension for students with reading difficulties. This initial finding is corroborated by a number of previously mentioned studies. In addition, the results of the first study extend this finding by reporting that the variation of TTS features (highlighting versus no highlighting) did not significantly impact reading comprehension when examining the whole group of participants with reading difficulty. Yet, the results of an exploratory analysis of children with Dyslexia Only and children with Reading and Language Impairment showed that these two subgroups of children performed differently when using TTS under the five conditions. Children with Reading and Language Impairment seemed to derive less benefit from TTS in regard to their reading comprehension than the children with Dyslexia Only.

This in-depth, qualitative approach to describing differences among countries in terms of policy, organization, and practice is intended to complement the more quantitative approach adopted by the ""PIRLS 2006 International Report,"" which summarizes reading achievement in participating countries and presents reports by parents, teachers, and students of literacy activities and educational resources in the home and school, and instructional practices in the classroom. The ""PIRLS 2006 Encyclopedia"" was developed specifically to describe a number of the factors influencing the intended curriculum within each participating country and to present the intended reading curricula through the fourth grade. The culture of the country, including the value placed on education, learning, and literacy, is a powerful influencing factor as is its economic health and the diversity of its citizenry. Within this context, some countries have centralized education systems and others have decentralized decision-making structures. In many countries, the locus of decision making can differ depending on the particular policies. For example, there are often national regulations about the number of years of compulsory schooling, the structure of the education system, and the criteria for students receiving certificates of completion or diplomas. Also, many countries have a nationally recognized curriculum, whereas others have a more decentralized approach to curricular decisions. Each chapter summarizes the curriculum intended to guide reading instruction through the fourth grade. There is considerable information about the reading skills and strategies that children were expected to have studied and learned prior to the PIRLS 2006 assessment. Textbooks, instructional materials, technological resources, and library facilities are described because they serve and reflect the priorities of the intended curriculum. Assessment and examination systems also are covered because they provide information to identify students needing remediation, suggest instructional programs needing improvement, and further support the expected outcomes of the education system.

In Stage 1, we ask whether it is better for children to receive an adaptive intervention based on (a) 10 conceptually coherent texts or (b) 10 leveled texts on a range of topics. In Stage 2, we ask how best to encourage nonresponding children. Findings indicate that children who received either conceptually coherent texts or leveled texts performed similarly on reading comprehension posttests, while augmenting and intensifying follow-up with gamification of the app and text messages to parents improved comprehension outcomes for nonresponders. Descriptively, we find that only 26% (n = 71) of parents accessed the app, highlighting the need for better implementation procedures to increase take up of app-based digital activities.",Achievement Tests; Computer Oriented Programs; Educational Games; educational technology; Elementary School Teachers; Emergent literacy; Grade 1; Grade 2; Individualized Instruction; intervention; Kindergarten; Learning Activities; Measures of Academic Progress; Outcomes of Education; Parent Child Relationship; Parents; Preschool Teachers; Printed Materials; Program Implementation; Randomized Controlled Trials; reading comprehension; reading instruction; Reading Programs; Summer Programs; Technology Uses in Education,"Kim, James S.; Asher, Catherine A.; Burkhauser, Mary; Mesite, Laura; Leyva, Diana",2019.0,,0,210
211,Improving eighth grade students' reading comprehension through the use of the collision plus arts-integrated program,"African American and Latino students attending Title I schools in the metropolitan Atlanta area were not reading on grade level. The majority of students are low performing readers and minimally met the reading comprehension requirements. The 2015 average 8th grade reading score for these students was 246 out of 500. This applied dissertation was designed to add to existing literature on the benefits of arts integration. Specifically, this study looked at whether the Alliance Theatre's Collision Plus Program, an arts integration strategy, improved reading comprehension skills. Moreover, from the perception of the English language arts teacher, this study examined to what extent arts-integrated techniques prepare students for college or a career. Using a quasi-experimental mixed methods design, pre- and posttest results of the Scantron Performance Series computer adaptive assessment (CAAS) assessment were analyzed for an ELA control group and treatment group to determine if arts integrated instruction impacted the reading comprehension of the middle school students who participated in the study. Findings indicated that the mean and median scores for the treatment group of students were not statistically different than that of the control group of students after the Alliance Theatre Collision Plus Program lessons. From the perception of the ELA teacher, arts integration helped learners to comprehend what they are reading because they are able to connect to the text. Students showed greater inquisitiveness and the ability to change and produce new ideas. Recommendations for future research 1 utilizing a larger sample size and providing ongoing professional development to teachers on arts integration strategies.

212,"Students' Use of Web Literacy Skills and Strategies: Searching, Reading and Evaluating Web Information","Introduction: This article reports on the adequacy and specific characteristics of 5th grade students' use of Web literacy skills and strategies after completing a programme in which these skills and strategies were the focus of attention. Method: Data were collected from twenty-one student pairs' Web use during six assignments, and recorded with help of Camtasia screen recording software. The students' dialogues as well as their screen behaviour were transcribed. Analysis: The quantitative part of the analysis focused on the extent of students' use of Web strategies and on the adequacy of those strategies, for which we constructed an adequacy index. The qualitative part of the analysis focused on the adequacy of Web strategies. Methods of data reduction, comparison and contrast were applied. Results: The students' strategy use is characterized by differences in adequacy both between and within assignments. This can partly be explained by differences in students' use of searching, reading and evaluating skills and partly by specific patterns underlying their Web strategy use such as flexibility, impulsiveness and a tendency to look only for ""one right answer"". The reflective use of Web literacy skills in particular seems to determine students' adequacy.

213,Reading to write in an SLA multimedia environment: A cognitive approach,"This dissertation looked at the concept of transfer within Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning as a theoretical link between L2 reading and written output in order to shed light on the effectiveness of multimedia materials in improving learners' written performance. It was hypothesized that the mental processes of selecting, organizing, and integrating information present in the reading comprehension process would also intervene in the act of writing. In contrast to reading comprehension, reading to write in a multimedia context has not received extensive attention in the SLA literature. An experimental study was conducted where participants had to read a Spanish short story during the regular course of instruction in one of four treatment conditions: no annotations, verbal-only, visual-only, or multimedia annotations. In addition, learners were given two writing tasks similar to those frequently used in language classrooms. The verbal-only treatment had the highest reading comprehension scores in the post-treatment vocabulary test. Given this group's heavy usage of English translations of the Spanish terms in the short story, their improved performance may be indicative of the method of memorizing vocabulary terms commonly used in the L2 classrooms. Contrary to previous findings, there were no significant group differences in students' comprehension of the story as measured by their recall in L1. In the case of L2 writing, the results of my study offer partial empirical evidence that the mental processes present in L2 reading comprehension also apply to the act of L2 writing as the visual-only group performed significantly better than the other groups in the two writing tasks. I interpret this result as indicative of a multimedia transfer effect by which the additional visual information received helped learners take advantage of the dual coding nature of working memory to create a richer mental model of the L2 information. In addition, learners did not have to switch between their L1 and L2 language systems, and thereby, optimized their mental effort to store and later retrieve L2 information. This finding is in line with Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning and extend this theory to L2 writing environments.

214,The effects of meta-cognitive instruction on students’ reading comprehension in computerized reading contexts: A quantitative meta-analysis,"Comprehension is the essence of reading. Finding appropriate and effective reading strategies to support students’ reading comprehension has always been a critical issue for educators. This article presents findings from a meta-analysis of 17 studies of metacognitive strategy instruction on students’ reading comprehension in computerized reading contexts. Overall, some instances of metacognitive strategy instruction tended to be more effective than others. Additionally, the effects of the instruction seemed to vary according to participants’ characteristics. Drawing upon the findings of this meta-analysis, we propose recommendations for future research and practice.

215,Strategic text processing across mediums: A verbal protocol study,"Using a sample of 116 Norwegian undergraduate readers in this experimental study, we investigated whether reading informational text on a tablet versus on paper would lead to differences with respect to strategic text processing and text comprehension. Strategic text processing was measured by means of verbal protocol analysis, and text comprehension was measured by means of postreading written products. Results were inconsistent with the shallowing hypothesis proposing that there are comprehension advantages for printed texts because digital texts are typically processed in a more shallow, superficial way. That is, we found no differences across the reading mediums with respect to strategic text processing or text comprehension. These results may suggest that there are boundaries to the shallowing hypothesis that are related to tasks, individual differences, and reading contexts. Such potential boundaries are discussed in light of the current findings, and suggestions for future research to clarify those boundaries are offered.

216,iSTART2: Improvements for efficiency and effectiveness,"iSTART (interactive strategy training for active reading and thinking) is a Web-based reading strategy trainer that develops students' ability to self-explain difficult text as a means to improving reading comprehension. Its curriculum consists of modules presented interactively by pedagogical agents: an introduction to the basics of using reading strategies in the context of self-explanation, a demonstration of self-explanation, and a practice module in which the trainee generates self-explanations with feedback on the quality of reading strategies contained in the self-explanations. We discuss the objectives that guided the development of the second version of iSTART toward the goals of increased efficiency for the experimenters and effectiveness in the training. The more pedagogically challenging high school audience is accommodated by (1) a new introduction that increases interactivity, (2) a new demonstration with more and better focused scaffolding, and (3) a new practice module that provides improved feedback and 1s a less intense but more extended regimen. Version 2 also benefits experimenters, who can set up and evaluate experiments with less time and effort, because pre- and posttesting has been fully computerized and the process of preparing a text for the practice module has been reduced from more than 1 person-week to about an hour's time.

217,Test-taking skills of high school students with and without learning disabilities,"This study assessed the test-taking skills of 776 high school students, 35 of whom were diagnosed with learning disabilities (LD). Students completed a computerized battery of timed reading tests as well as scales that assess test anxiety and test-taking perceptions. Students with LD obtained lower scores than the nondisabled group on all of the reading tasks (speed, comprehension, vocabulary, and decoding), spent more time reviewing comprehension questions, and were less active in looking for answers in the passages. Both groups favored the same comprehension strategy of reading the entire passage and then answering questions. The groups did not differ in their levels of test anxiety or confidence in taking tests under timed conditions. Vocabulary score best discriminated between groups and best predicted reading comprehension performance, suggesting a potential target for intervention.

218,"""E-Book Flood"" for Changing EFL Learners' Reading Attitudes","This paper was intended to investigate the effects of using e-books (or texts with multimedia support) in an ERP (extensive reading program) on EFL (English as a foreign language) learners' attitudes toward reading in English. In a junior high school in northern Taiwan, 109 students from 3 intact classes were recruited in the 10-week ERP of e-books. Each class was introduced to a list of 140 selected e-books for the reading program; each student was then encouraged to read e-books after school, with the target of reading 4 e-books every week. The degree of changes in reading attitudes was assessed by using the reading attitudes scale (Stokmans, 1999) before and after the e-book ERP. In addition, the teacher's class notes of the students' reading behaviors and reactions as well as their spontaneous oral or written feedback were analyzed to be triangulated with the quantitative data. The results showed that the e-books had positive effects on the students' attitudinal changes in all dimensions of reading attitudes, namely, utility, development, enjoyment and escape, as well as in all the cognitive, affective and conative components. The results also showed that the features of the e-books, especially oral reading, highlighting, animations and music/sound effects, were considered important to change their attitudes. The implementation of interaction and learner control in the e-books guaranteed positive attitudinal changes as well. (Contains 1 table.)

219,Intermediate Greek EFL Learners' Attitudes to On-Line Teaching Practices: A Blended Task-Based English Language Learning Approach,"This paper reports on a one-year longitudinal study that adopted a blended teaching approach based on designing and implementing an online EFL course to be used by Greek students aged 13-14 years old along their more traditional face-to-face lessons. The reason for creating a more dynamic learning environment aligned with the rest of the curriculum was to increase EFL learners' engagement and motivation through their exposure to authentic online material and participation in a variety of reading, writing, speaking and listening tasks. Data analysis of pre- and post-achievement tests on English language reading comprehension performance along with students' Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) attitude questionnaire showed that participants generally had a positive attitude toward CALL. At the same time, open online access technologies gave them the opportunity to further develop their EFL reading comprehension skills. The paper concludes by highlighting the fact that online class components were not designed to fit the online tools into a task-based EFL lesson, but rather served the learning objectives of the actual lesson based on a blended teaching approach",blended learning; Early Adolescents; educational technology; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Greece (Athens); Junior High School Students; Longitudinal Studies; Online Courses; Pretests Posttests; Questionnaires; reading comprehension; Second Language Instruction; Statistical Analysis; Student Attitudes; Teaching Methods; Technology Uses in Education,"Liontou, Trisevgeni",2015.0,,0,219
220,Effects of a computer-assisted concept mapping learning strategy on EFL college students’ English reading comprehension,"The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of a computer-assisted concept mapping learning strategy on EFL college learners’ English reading comprehension. The research questions were: (1) what was the influence of the computer-assisted concept mapping learning strategy on different learners’ English reading comprehension? (2) did the computer-assisted concept mapping learning strategy affect learners’ use of other English reading strategies? One hundred ninety-four freshmen who were enrolled in the English course were divided into low-level and high-level groups according to their English proficiency. A computer-assisted concept mapping learning strategy was introduced to the learners in the experimental class to improve their reading ability. Through two-way ANOVA analysis, it was found that the computer-assisted concept mapping learning strategy had greater reading benefit for the low-level group than for the high-level group. In addition, the results of independent sample t-test analysis indicated that the computer-assisted concept mapping learning strategy enhanced learners’ use of other English reading strategies–listing, enforcing, and reviewing.

221,Formative Feedback to Transfer Self-Regulation of Task-Oriented Reading Strategies,"The study 1s two experiments to analyse the effects of automatic formative feedback designed to promote the transfer of self-regulation of strategic decisions in task-oriented reading (e.g. answering questions from an available text). Secondary-school students read and answered multiple-choice comprehension questions from two texts having them available while receiving consistent feedback about their performance and strategic decisions. Then, they read a different text and answered questions also with the text available, but receiving no feedback. In Experiment 1, we tested two feedback procedures that differed in task conditions and the feedback information associated to these conditions. The most effective was a procedure that forced students to select relevant text information to answer each question and provided accurate feedback based on that selection. Experiment 2 was designed to disentangle the role played by the selection task from that played by the feedback provided. We found that the two components contribute to transfer the self-regulation strategies, although each one has a specific role for different strategies. Theoretical and practical implications of the studies are discussed.",Experiments; Feedback (Response); Formative Evaluation; Multiple Choice Tests; Reader Text Relationship; Reading; reading comprehension; reading instruction; Reading strategies; Secondary School Students; Self Control,"Llorens, A.

222,Comparing Foreign Language Learners' Use of Online Glossing Programs,"This study furthers research in three crucial related areas: (1) comparing various online glossing and vocabulary learning tools; (2) language teaching and learning using a more natural bilingualized approach to developing online reading skills in a second or foreign language; and (3) comparing the relative level of enjoyment and effectiveness students experience when using various CALL programs. This paper applies recent insights into vocabulary learning behaviors and functions online and investigates whether teachers can help learners increase their use of online glosses to improve their vocabulary learning by giving them automatic mouse-over instant glosses versus optional, clickable, mechanical access. The authors compare Japanese college students' actual use of three types of glossing when reading similar texts online. The findings suggest that an expanded glossing system that helps encourage deeper lexical processing by providing automatic, archivable glosses would be superior for digital vocabulary learning because it can simultaneously offer better monitoring and more motivation vis-à-vis online word learning.",Bilingualism; College Students; Comparative Analysis; Computer Assisted Instruction; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Japan (Tokyo); Language Processing; learning motivation; Pretests Posttests; Questionnaires; reading comprehension; Reading Processes; Reading strategies; Scores; Second Language Instruction; Second Language Learning; Student Motivation; Teaching Methods; Undergraduate Students; Vocabulary Development; Web Sites,"Loucky, John Paul; Tuzi, Frank",2010.0,,0,222
223,The efficacy of corrective feedback and target form enhancement in promoting acquisition of the a/au/en/aux distinction in L2 French,"Despite popular theoretical arguments against the usefulness of explicit knowledge in the development of linguistic competence (cf. Krashen, 1982; Schwartz, 1993), empirical studies have suggested that comprehensible input alone may be insufficient in fostering target-like L2 production skills (Swain, 1985; Hammerly, 1987; Klein & Perdue, 1997). As such, many SLA researchers (e.g., Long, 1991; 1996; 2007; Spada, 1997; Lyster, 1998; 2001; 2004) now advocate teacher use of negative feedback during communicative activities to promote learner noticing of errors and internalization of correct forms; yet the efficacy of this practice remains questionable as it not only entails the provision of additional input but generally enhances otherwise non-salient linguistic features as well (Leeman, 2003). Moreover, these potentially confounding variables may be particularly problematic with regard to the acquisition of grammatical structures bearing little informational content such as the a/au/en/aux distinction before French toponyms. In a controlled experiment with a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest design, all French 102 students at the University of Arizona in Fall 2006 were randomly assigned to an interactive, computer-based reading lesson featuring either typographically enhanced or unenhanced target forms and one of four types of corrective feedback: meaning-focused, implicit form-focused, simple explicit form-focused, or explicit form-focused with rule explanation. Statistical analyses of the results on both the short-term and long-term linguistic outcome measures showed continuous improvement in target structure accuracy for learners in all treatment conditions. However, there was no significant advantage for any of the investigated feedback types, nor for target form enhancement, and no interaction between these two variables. This study assessed learners' pre-treatment performance on the target structures but not their explicit prior knowledge of them. Thus, it is possible that a fine-tuning of the latter through exposure to comprehensible input reduced the magnitude of the learning effects, especially given the proximity of the target prepositions to their objects. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that neither highlighting nor repeated correction and explanation of these particular grammatical items yields any additional benefit and that instructional efforts may better be focused on maximizing beginning learners' opportunities to process authentic language through meaningful activities.

224,"Distant-supervised algorithms with applications to text mining, product search, and scholarly networks","In recent times, data has become the lifeblood of pretty much all businesses. As such, the real-world impact of data-driven machine learning has grown in leaps and bounds. It has set up itself as a standard tool for organizations to draw insights from the data at scale, and hence, to enhance their profits. However, one of the key-bottlenecks in deploying machine learning models in practice is the unavailability of labeled training data. The manually-labeled training sets are expensive and it can be a tedious exercise to create them. Besides, they cannot be practically reused for new objectives, if the underlying distribution of data changes with time. As such, distant-supervision provides a solution to using expensive hand-labeled datasets, which means leveraging alternative sources of weak-supervision. In this thesis, we identify and provide solutions to some of the challenges that can benefit from distant-supervised approaches. First, we present a distant-supervised approach to accurately and efficiently estimate a vector representation for each sense of the multi-sense words. Second, we present approaches for distant-supervised text-segmentation and annotation, which is the task of associating individual parts in a multilabel document with their most appropriate class labels. Third, we present approaches for query understanding in product search. Specifically, we developed distant-supervised solutions to three challenges in query understanding: (i) when multiple terms are present in a query, determining the relevant terms that are representative of the query's product intent, (ii) vocabulary gap between the terms in the query and the product's description, and (iii) annotating individual terms in a query with the corresponding intended product characteristics (product type, brand, gender, size, color, etc.). Fourth, we present approaches to estimate content-aware bibliometrics to accurately quantitatively measure the scholarly impact of a publication. Our proposed metric assigns content-aware weights to the edges of a citation network, that quantify the extent to which the cited-node informs the citing-node. Consequently, this weighted network can be used to derive impact metrics for the various involved entities, like the publications, authors, etc. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",Algorithms; Attribution; Bibliometrics; Credit attribution; Distant supervision; e-commerce; Electronic Commerce; Machine Learning; Product Design; Query understanding; reading comprehension; Text mining; Training,"Manchanda, Saurav",2021.0,,0,224
225,Fluency Transfer: Differential Gains in Reading Speed and Accuracy Following Isolated Word and Context Training,"While fluent reading is recognized as a primary goal of educational instruction, the methods that best promote the development of fluency remain unclear. Two experiments are reported that examined increases in reading fluency of a novel passage following two types of training. In the context training condition, children learned to read a set of target words in a story context, while in the isolated word training condition, fluency with a target word set was gained from a computerized word naming game. Transfer of fluency to reading these words in a new context was then measured by gains in reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension of a novel story. Results indicated that young readers showed speed benefits on transfer stories following both context and isolated word training, but the increases were larger following context training.",Computer Assisted Instruction; reading comprehension; Reading Fluency; reading instruction; Reading Rate; Reading strategies; Teaching Methods; Transfer of Training; Vocabulary Development,"Martin-Chang, Sandra Lyn; Levy, Betty Ann",2005.0,,0,225
226,Collaborative Strategic Reading on Multi-Touch and Multi-User Digital Tabletop Displays,"This paper is part of a work-in-progress that reports on the design, development, and evaluation of a Digital Collaborative Strategic Reading (DCSR) application with regard to its effectiveness in improving English as a second language (ESL) reading comprehension. The DCSR application allows users to read collaboratively on multitouch and multi-user digital tabletop displays that support both face-to-face and computerbased interaction. The application is designed to provide systematic instruction on tabletop computers using four main comprehension strategies that form the Collaborative Strategic Reading (CSR) instructional approach. The paper addresses one main research question: ""How does the use of the tabletop-based reading application (DCSR) affect learners' reading processes and outcomes?"", and the following sub-questions: (1) What is the impact of the tabletop-based reading system on learners' reading scores with regard to the reading assessments? (2) How do learners collaboratively construct meaning on the tabletop? To answer these research questions, the subjects used the DCSR application on tabletop computers in groups of four, once a week for 5 weeks. Data were collected and analysed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Each reading session was preceded by a cloze test and followed by two types of assessment: a written recall test and a cloze test; both tests were designed to reflect the students' comprehension of the reading passages. The paper will report on the design of the software and the administration of the study, but will focus on the analysis of the data from the different sources, and present insights into the nature of collaborative reading using the DCSR application on a tabletop computer.

227,"Nonadherence to outpatient appointments and early dropout from depression treatment: Differences in beliefs among no-shows, early dropouts, and adherers","The use of assistive technology is rarely supported by instructors in the developmental reading classroom at the Guam Community College even though research studies have suggested that web-based reading programs will increase students' vocabulary and comprehension skills. Large numbers of incoming students at the College are often academically under-prepared. Their inability to pass the entrance exam places them in the developmental reading class. Insufficient vocabulary knowledge, poor reading comprehension skills, lack of reading motivation, and different learning styles will also hinder their abilities to pass the developmental reading course. The purpose of this quantitative, quasi-experimental and correlational study will explore the relationship between the amounts of online reading practice, reading motivation, individual learning styles, and student pass rate in the developmental reading class. In addition, the study will analyze the difference in reading comprehension skills, vocabulary knowledge, reading motivation, and individual learning styles between the experimental (computer-assisted teaching strategy) and control groups. Changes between pre- and post- vocabulary and reading comprehension test scores in the experimental group will be examined as well since computer-assisted language learning is believed to facilitate reading comprehension and promote vocabulary development, motivate low-performing students, and support individual learning styles. Furthermore, the study will allow reading instructors to investigate the idea that the use of computer-assisted teaching approach might strengthen students' meta-cognitive strategies for comprehending reading passages and augment other areas in their reading skills development. Finally, this quasi-experimental nonequivalent design study will comprise 39 developmental reading students of ethnic background primarily from the FSM, the Philippines, Guam, and Asia.

228,Print and digital texts: Evaluating the differences in reading comprehension strategies,"Concerns about the reading comprehension skills of students in the United States have been raised partly because of the introduction of digital products into their lives and the classroom setting. The Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards results from 2013 that were provided by the Arizona Department of Education indicated that reading scores drop from 1 point up to 30 points in Grade 8. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of technology on reading comprehension to determine whether there needs to be a change in how reading comprehension is taught. A quantitative, correlational method was used with a sample of Grade 8 students in a school in Maricopa County, AZ. Students were given a pretest and then divided randomly into two groups. One group read a text in print format, and the other read a text in digital format. Both groups were taught reading comprehension using the reciprocal teaching method. All students were then given a posttest. The Mann-Whitney test performed to analyze the collected data for the research question did not provide evidence of a significant relationship between reading medium (print vs. digital) and reading comprehension. The mean data for the group using digital text declined, showing a net loss of -0.58; the mean data for the group using print text showed a net loss of -6.56. The Spearman-Rho correlation (rs) evaluated the strength of the relationship between groups, and the Mann-Whitney z score measured differences between the two groups. Pretest scores and reading comprehension of print and digital text were not significantly related (r s = .06, p = .78). Posttest and comprehension scores between the print and digital formats also were not significantly related (rs = .19, p = .39).

229,The Effects of Using Audience Response Systems Incorporating Student-Generated Questions on EFL Students' Reading Comprehension,"While Audience Response System (ARS) such as Kahoot! can promote learner self-regulation and enhance comprehension by engaging cognitive processing on multiple levels, learning behavior in questioning with ARS was understudied. The present study explores the use of Kahoot! with student-generated questioning, to report the effect on students' reading comprehension. This study involved two intact sixth grade elementary school classes, with a total of 48 students which were divided into an experimental group and a control group. All students first took the simulated GEPT (General English Proficiency Test)-Kids reading test as a pre-test. Each team was assigned a story commensurate with their reading level by the instructor. The experimental group used Kahoot! as an ARS to generate questions, while the control group presented their questions by PowerPoint. The data were analyzed in terms of the students' pre-test and post-test GEPT-Kids scores, and the worksheets. The results indicated that although little significant improvement was recorded from the GEPT scores, the quality of the questions generated by the group using Kahoot! increased at a greater rate over time compared to the control group. The question-generation process showed that the Kahoot! group indicated a higher level of engagement and collaboration and also stimulated an active learning environment.",Active Learning; Audience Response Systems; Children; Computer Assisted Testing; Elementary School Students; English (Second Language); Grade 6; instructional effectiveness; Learner Engagement; Questioning Techniques; reading comprehension; Second Language Instruction; Second Language Learning,"Mays, Benjamin R.; Yeh, Hui-Chin; Chen, Nian-Shing",2020.0,,0,229

One such system, iSTART (Interactive Strategy Training for Active Reading and Thinking) is an adaptive, game-based tutoring system for reading comprehension. This paper describes how efforts to increase personalized learning have improved the system. It also provides results of a recent implementation of an adaptive logic that increases or decreases text difficulty based on students' performance rather than presenting texts randomly. High school students who received adaptive text selection showed increased sense of learning. Adaptive text selection also resulted in greater pre-training to post-training comprehension test gains, especially for less-skilled readers. The findings demonstrate that system-driven, just-in-time support consistent with the goals of personalized learning benefit the efficacy of computer-based learning environments.

231,A comparison of adolescents' digital and print reading experiences: Does mode matter?,"The purpose of this mixed-methods research study was to investigate the comprehension and motivation of 36, sixth-grade students reading moderately challenging text under two conditions: Nook or book. Using a Sequential Explanatory Design model, quantitative data were collected prior to qualitative data collection (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). A Matched Pairs Design model (Hinkle, Wiersma, & Jurs, 2003) was employed for the quantitative portion of the study with 18 participants randomly assigned to the Nook group and 18 participants randomly assigned to the book group. Nook group participants were instructed to use the following electronic features during reading: highlighting, note taking, and dictionary usage. The book group participants received instruction for using actual highlighters, sticky notes, and dictionaries during reading. Participants read and responded to Sounder (Armstrong, 1969) in either a traditional or digital (Nook) format. Quantitative data 1d scores on a reading motivation survey and summative comprehension test. Qualitative data 1d students' journal entries, researcher's field notes, and participants' verbal responses to interview questions. Results indicate the Nook group achieved higher overall comprehension scores with statistically significant higher inferential comprehension scores than the book group. Nook group participants also read approximately 3 minutes longer per day, chose a free-write response option (as opposed to responding to researcher-constructed writing prompts), and cited text more frequently in journal responses than book group participants. Findings suggest that engaging students in reading digital text and teaching them to use the technology's facilitative features has the potential to improve student's reading comprehension of moderately challenging text.

234,Intensive and systematic training in working memory: Does it have validity for improving reading achievement?,"It is rarely challenged that deficits in working memory during childhood are related to academic difficulties. Poor working memory is linked to difficulties focusing, remembering and completing classroom instructions, planning and organizing information, solving problems, and monitoring progress during complex tasks. Researchers have consistently demonstrated a relationship between working memory and reading ability. Moreover, it is well established that students who have deficits in reading also perform poorly on working memory tasks when compared to same-aged peers. The current study assessed the effectiveness of adaptive training on working memory and reading achievement via the use of Cogmed. Cogmed is an evidenced-based intervention designed to improve working memory. Cogmed training uses a web-based computerized system and can be accessed in various locations. The training has been demonstrated to be a complementary intervention and will likely produce the greatest benefit when combined with other sources of interventions. Research has shown that adaptive training in working memory has led to gains in word reading, reading comprehension, mathematical ability, and improved attention. The current study examined the effects of intensive and systematic training in working memory strategies on reading performance. A series of one-sample t-tests and two ANCOVAs were used to statistically determine improvements in working memory performance and significant differences, if any, in reading comprehension and reading fluency achievement between treatment groups. The results indicated that Cogmed training significantly improved working memory performance for the students in the experimental group. However, it appears that the gains did not result in better reading comprehension and reading fluency performance compared to the control group without the working memory training. Implications for the field of school psychology are noted as well as recommendations for future research.

235,Interactive Book-Reading to Improve Inferencing Abilities in Kindergarten Classrooms: A Clinical Project,"Inferencing abilities are crucial to development of reading comprehension. However, few studies addressed those abilities in interventions promoting early literacy skills, especially in kindergartners. The aim of this study was to measure the efficacy of an interactive book-reading intervention targeting inferencing abilities, delivered by a school-based speech-language pathologist (SLP) in whole group kindergarten classes. Two hundred and forty-nine 5-year-old kindergartners from low socio-economic settings were quasi-randomly assigned to either one of the experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) or an active control group (CG). EG1 received a 7-week interactive book-reading intervention followed by a 7-week period where it was up to the teachers to implement aspects of the intervention in their teaching or not. EG2 received the 7-week interactive book-reading intervention only and the active control group received an initial workshop only. Three subtests targeting (1) causal inferences during book-reading, (2) causal inferences in a formal task, and (3) referential inferences in a formal task were performed at pre- and post-intervention assessments. There was a significant Time × Group interaction effect for the first subtest indicating an advantage for EG1 compared to CG over time. EG2 appeared as an intermediary group as its results were not different from EG1 and showing only a trend toward significance (p = 0.064) when compared to CG. There was no significant Time × Group interaction effect for the second subtest. A significant Time × Group interaction effect was present for the third subtest, EG1 and EG2 showing larger improvement than CG.",Allied Health Personnel; Best Practices; Books; Canada; Direct Instruction; Foreign Countries; French; Inferences; instructional effectiveness; intervention; Kindergarten; Low Income Students; reading comprehension; reading instruction; Reading Skills; Reading strategies; Speech Language Pathology; Teaching Methods,"McMahon-Morin, Paméla; Rezzonico, Stefano; Trudeau, Natacha; Croteau, Claire",2021.0,,0,235

237,Navigating the Maze of Hypertext,"Because students are highly motivated to read texts online rather than in traditional form, McNabb argues, schools should encourage students to use the Internet for academic and pleasure reading. However, hypertext has unique features that make comprehension monitoring while reading challenging. Strategies that work for reading passages of printed text--which McNabb calls lexia--don't work in an environment where every text instantly links to dozens of other texts and readers choose their own path. Teachers can't assume that students know how to read effectively online; in fact McNabb presents research showing that teenagers perform poorly compared to adults on online reading tasks. Many students become distracted or confused about which links will yield what they are looking for, and end up clicking randomly or chasing personal interests. McNabb suggests teaching strategies to help students develop an ""internal narrator"" to guide online reading, such as previewing Web sites to better direct online reading assignments, modeling think-aloud predictions for where hyperlinks will lead, and having students annotate their search history for an online research session.",Adolescents; Directed Reading Activity; Hypermedia; Information literacy; Internet; Reading Assignments; reading comprehension; Reading Processes; Reading strategies; Scaffolding (Teaching Technique); Teaching Methods,"McNabb, Mary",2006.0,,0,237

239,"Fostering the Development of Critical Thinking Skills, and Reading Comprehension of Undergraduates Using a Web 2.0 Tool Coupled with a Learning System","A social annotation model learning system (SAM-LS) was created using multiple instructional strategies thereby supporting the student in improving in critical thinking, critical writing and related literacy. There are four mechanisms in which the SAM-LS methodology is believed to improve learning and performance. These mechanisms 1 providing relevant activities such as (1) examples, (2) practice, (3) reflection and (4) collaboration. The Social Annotation Model uses HyLighter, an online annotation system that amalgamates reading and writing, facilitates shared annotation practices and coalesces annotations from multiple reviewers. This article reports on three studies conducted using HyLighter. The purpose of the first study was to determine student perceptions on the benefits and weaknesses of the learning environment, using HyLighter, with a focus on peer critique. The findings indicated that users' experiences were positive and specifically the annotations and tags were useful in a peer critique activity. The second study was a nonexperimental comparative study that looked at students' ability to critically analyze information and reading comprehension using HyLighter in collaborative activities. Initial findings show that working in small collaborative groups may promote deeper thinking through peer interactions. The third study was to determine whether there was a change in reading comprehension, critical thinking and meta-cognition skills from the use of SAM-LS instructional strategies. Results indicate that HyLighter may help students in several areas including enhancing the students' ability to think critically.

The students were selected through locus of control questionnaire and it is followed by OSORS questionnaire to measure online metacognitive strategies used by students. The results of study revealed that online metacognitive reading strategies used mostly by internal locus of control students rather than external locus of control students. There were clear interrelationships among types of metacognitive reading strategies used and internal locus of control characteristics. Among three subcategories of metacognitive strategies, students with internal locus of control are more interested to use global strategies, whereas students with external locus of control tend less to use this strategy.

241,Web-Based Tutoring of the Structure Strategy with or without Elaborated Feedback or Choice for Fifth- and Seventh-Grade Readers,"This study investigated the effects of different versions of Web-based instruction focused on text structure on fifth- and seventh-grade students' reading comprehension. Stratified random assignment was employed in a two-factor experiment embedded within a pretest and multiple posttests design (immediate and four-month delayed posttests). The two factors were type of feedback provided by the Web-based tutor (elaborated vs. simple feedback) and the motivational factor of choice of text topics in practice lessons (student choice of texts vs. no choice). These factors were examined to learn how they affected performance after the six-month, 90-minutes/week intervention. Students who received elaborated feedback performed better on a standardized test of reading comprehension than students who received simple feedback. Learning how to attend to errors from the elaborated feedback tutor yielded large gains in test performance. Simple feedback did not help the least skilled third of readers move from complete lack of competency to competency using the structure strategy with problem-and-solution text. Choice between two topics for practice lessons did not increase reading comprehension. Substantial effects sizes were found from pretest to posttest on various measures of reading comprehension: recall, strategy competence, and standardized reading comprehension test scores. Maintenance of performance over summer break was found for most measures. The study informs research and teaching about Web-based reading tutors, feedback, comprehension, and top-level text structure.

243,The nature and efficiency of the word reading strategies of orally raised deaf students,"The main objective of this study was to unveil similarities and differences in the word reading strategies of orally raised individuals with prelingual deafness and hearing individuals. Relevant data were gathered by a computerized research paradigm asking participants to make rapid same/different judgments for words. There were three distinct study conditions: (a) a visual condition manipulating the visual–perceptional properties of the target word pairs, (b) a phonological condition manipulating their phonological properties, and (c) a control condition. Participants were 31 high school and postgraduate students with prelingual deafness and 59 hearing students (the control group). Analysis of response latencies and accuracy in the three study conditions suggests that the word reading strategies the groups relied upon to process the stimulus materials were of the same nature. Evidence further suggests that prelingual deafness does not undermine the efficiency with which readers use these strategies. To gain a broader understanding of the obtained evidence, participants’ performance in the word processing experiment was correlated with their phonemic awareness—the hypothesized hallmark of proficient word reading—and their reading comprehension skills. Findings are discussed with reference to a reading theory that assigns phonology a central role in proficient word reading.

244,An Examination of Reliability and Validity Claims of a Foreign Language Proficiency Test,"This dissertation study examined the reliability and validity claims of a modified version of the Spanish Modern Language Association Foreign Language Proficiency Test for Teachers and Advanced Students administered at George Mason University (GMU). The study used the 1999 computerized GMU version that was administered to 277 test-takers via WebCT, (a web course management tool), and not the original 1961 pencil-and-paper edition. The GMU examination retained five sections from the test's original seven, namely Speaking, Listening, Reading, Writing, and Culture and Civilization. The original response formats, i.e. multiple-choice and true-false, were preserved for the most part. The Writing section was changed from the original error correction and text editing format to a fill-in-the-blanks format. The Culture and Civilization section was re-written due to obsolescence; however it retained the original answer format, to which a matching component was added. The study's design was framed by the investigative steps proposed by Messick (1989) and Nitko and Brookhart (2007). An ""ex post facto"" approach was used, which mixed the confirmatory factor analysis and multiple regression analyses with descriptive interpretations. The quantitative analyses examined the impact of nationality, gender and average time spent on completing the tasks on the five subscales of the Spanish GMU MLA examinations. The analyses provided mixed results related to the predictors' ability to explain the subscale scores. The descriptive analyses revealed numerous validity flaws and gaps in the test construction. Such inadequacies overshadowed the positive aspects and eventually led to my questioning of the hypothesis that the judgments based on data from the Spanish GMU MLA examinations are reliable and valid. Recommendations for possible revisions were made, along with suggestions for future research avenues. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

245,Effects of help options in a multimedia listening environment on L2 vocabulary acquisition,"Several types of help options have been incorporated into reading and listening comprehension activities to aid second language (L2) vocabulary acquisition. Textbook authors, teachers, and sometimes even students may pick and choose which help options they wish to use. In this paper, I investigate the effects of two help options in a multimedia listening environment (annotated captioned animation versus annotated transcript animation) on L2 vocabulary acquisition. Thirty-four Arab learners of English as a foreign language watched and listened to an animated story under any one of the following conditions: (1) annotations + captions + animation (ACA) and (2) annotations + transcripts+ animation (ATA). After viewing the story, the participants received a vocabulary posttest (i.e., L2 spelling) and posttest of translating Arabic words into the target language (L2 form recall). These tests were readministered five weeks after the treatment. The results revealed that the ACA and ATA groups performed significantly better on both L2 vocabulary spelling and L2 vocabulary recall in posttest and delayed test treatments than on L2 vocabulary spelling and recall in the pretest treatments. No significant difference was observed between the ACA and ATA groups in terms of vocabulary posttests. However, the ACA group slightly outscored the ATA group in the long-term L2 form recall tests (i.e., delayed tests). The results suggest that both types (i.e., ACA and ATA) help improve L2 vocabulary acquisition, whereas ACA surpasses ATA in aiding L2 vocabulary acquisition over a long term. In light of these findings, pedagogical implications to teachers, learners, and curricula designers are discussed.

246,How school library media specialists support reading and information literacy skills instruction for English language learners,"This study explored the school library media programs in four schools. The percentage of English language learners (ELLs) enrolled in each of these schools was among the highest on their respective levels in their school districts. Moreover, the percentage of ELLs in these schools who met and exceeded the standard for reading and English/language arts on the Georgia Criterion-Referenced Competency Test (CRCT) in the spring of 2010 was more than the Annual Measureable Objective (AMO) of 73.3% or slightly less. The participants were the school library media specialists who administered the school library media programs in these schools. This was a qualitative study. During an inductive thematic analysis, the data coalesced into four themes that corresponded with the research questions: instruction, collaboration, media/technology, and interpersonal communication. These findings were derived from the data. 1. The participants used both conventional and technology-based instructional strategies to support reading and information literacy skills instruction for all of their students, including the ELLs. 2. The school library media collections 1d first language, bilingual, and multicultural literatures, picture books, nonfiction books written on a lower reading level, graphic materials, Hi-Lo reading materials and other digital resources; however, the materials varied in age, suitability, and condition. 3. The school library media specialists collaborated informally with the other members of the instructional team. 4. The school library media specialists undertook other practices that support reading and information literacy skills instruction for ELLs on a discretionary basis.

247,Contexts of Digital Reading: How Genres Affect Reading Practices,"""Contexts of Digital Reading: How Genres Affect Reading Practices"" is a study of the different ways university students use digital devices to read. Many mainstream representations of digital reading fail to distinguish between different contexts or genres of reading, making digital reading appear transparent rather than mediated by device or purpose. Furthermore, research on student reading deficiencies often locates reading problems in the textual medium (linking digital technologies to greater reading problems than print) rather than in the situations where reading takes place. Contrary to that line of thinking, my dissertation demonstrates that reading is a complex process shaped by material conditions and by shifting variables. Readers' practices are constantly changing depending on the different situations where they read; the available technologies; and emotional and environmental factors like energy, mood, their physical location, and time of day. This project seeks to further explore the different ways students use their digital technologies depending on these variables and complicate existing pictures of digital readers. Drawing on new media, genre, and reading studies scholarship, ""Contexts of Digital Reading"" uses surveys and interviews to examine how students' reading practices change with different devices and situations. The participants reveal that they rely heavily on laptops and smartphones in their daily communications; that their practices change along with different contexts; and that reading instruction is performed in varying ways. To account for the inconsistencies with reading instruction, I offer instructors assignments that can help students become aware of the practices they perform in different situations and provide opportunities for using digital annotation technologies. Within composition and rhetoric, the ability to read well (and accompanying practices like mindfulness and purposeful engagement with texts) can help students to produce more effective writing. My study reinvigorates reading as a necessary, yet often taken for granted, part of the composing process by calling attention to the materiality of reading.

248,Before and beyond reading comprehension strategies: Sixth graders' diverse modi operandi (MOs) for reading,"This mixed-methods dissertation study investigated the hypothesis that, above and beyond what they may have learned in school about garden-variety reading comprehension strategies (e.g., predicting, visualizing, summarizing ), by the time they reach 6th grade most adolescent readers possess declarative and procedural knowledge of diverse and sometimes idiosyncratic modi operandi (MOs) for reading. On the basis of pilot work and a review of relevant research, these reading MOs were hypothesized to be experientially distinct, subjectively coherent, and habitual ways of orchestrating reading activity that typically comprise reading strategies but also comprise other elements and features (e.g., culture- and subculture-specific attitudes, topic knowledge, epistemic beliefs, affective investments, experience with particular types of social interaction around texts). It was further hypothesized that these diverse MOs readers know and use are superordinate to conventional reading strategies and in fact regulate their application, such that a reader's MO selection constrains her selection, and guides her application, of reading comprehension strategies, not the other way around. More generally, it was hypothesized that adolescent readers experience reading, and view whatever conscious choices they make regarding reading, through the prism of these MOs---as opposed to through the prism of whatever reading comprehension strategies they know, or through the prism of a universally applicable, generic goal of comprehending text. These hypotheses were investigated through (a) structured written interviews with 30 randomly sampled 6th graders in one school district and (b) follow-up case studies with six 6th graders randomly sampled from the initial 30. Analysis of interview responses and case study data (comprising transcripts of conversations as well as think-aloud protocols of participants reading diverse self-chosen and researcher-provided texts) indicated that 100% of students had declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge of two or more MOs for reading, with students on average reporting more than six MOs. Across participants there were significant differences with regard to types of MOs used, preferences for particular MOs, and criteria used to distinguish among MOs. At the same time, all participants demonstrated ability and willingness to describe and discuss their MOs---this despite the fact that none recalled receiving any explicit instruction or mentoring to develop distinct 'ways of reading.' In sum, the study's findings give substantial, preliminary support to the hypothesis that adolescent readers know and use a diverse array of reading MOs, and that MOs rather than reading comprehension strategies constitute the level at which adolescent readers make strategic choices and adjustments in reading. Implications for cognitively focused models of reading comprehension are discussed, as are possible implications for classroom instruction.

249,ReflectED: Evaluation Report and Executive Summary,"The ReflectED programme was developed by Rosendale Primary School to improve pupils' metacognition--their ability to think about and manage their own learning. This 1s the skills of setting and monitoring goals, assessing progress, and identifying personal strengths and challenges. ReflectED consists of 28, weekly, half-hour lessons, which teach pupils strategies they can use to monitor and manage their own learning. Pupils are supported to apply and practise these strategies throughout the rest of the curriculum; reflect on their learning; and record audio, photographed and written notes of their reflections on Evernote, a note-taking app. Pupils are then encouraged to review and reflect on these records over time, so that they can observe their progress and consider which strategies seemed to work well. Teachers can also look across these records to get an overview of the areas that pupils are enjoying or struggling with, and identify specific pupil needs. For example, a teacher could explore the notes that a pupil has tagged as ""maths"" and ""difficult"" to see which ones they struggled with, and examine which strategies seemed to help them with this. In this project, Rosendale Primary School trained teachers from 30 schools in five areas throughout England to deliver ReflectED over the academic year 2014/15. At the beginning of the year, participating teachers received a pack of lesson plans and supporting resources, and an initial daylong training session. This was followed by three additional half-day training sessions throughout the year. A website, digital resources, and weekly reminders and tips were provided by the London Connected Learning Centre. The National Education Trust supported school recruitment and test administration. The programme was co-funded by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), KPMG Foundation and Nominet Trust, and was part of a funding round focused on digital technology. The impact of the programme on the attainment of pupils in Year 5 was evaluated using a randomised control trial involving 1858 pupils. Year 5 teachers within each of the 30 schools were randomly allocated to either participate in the programme or to a control group which continued with their usual teaching. The primary outcome measure was pupils' maths attainment. The evaluation also examined the impact on pupil's reading attainment and attitudes towards reading and maths, and the impact on the maths attainment of pupils eligible for free school meals. Class observations, interviews and focus groups were conducted to examine how the programme was implemented and adapted by teachers, explore activity in the control group, and identify factors that might affect the impact of the programme. The close involvement of the original developer in the delivery of the programme means that this was an efficacy trial. Efficacy trials aim to test whether the intervention can succeed under ideal conditions. Key findings 1: (1) Pupils who participated in ReflectED made an average of four months' additional progress in maths compared to pupils who did not; (2) Pupils who participated in ReflectED made an average of two months' less progress in reading compared to pupils who did not; (3) The findings for the schools in this trial have moderate to high security. However, the analysis conducted suggests that we cannot conclude from this trial alone that the intervention would have a similar impact in other schools; (4) Most schools were already teaching metacognitive and reflective skills similar to those encouraged by ReflectED. This might have limited the additional impact that ReflectED had on teachers' practice and pupils' outcomes; and (5) Teachers suggested that ReflectED would work best as a whole-school programme, and that they could deliver the programme more effectively after the first year of delivery. Future research could examine the impact of implementing ReflectED across all year groups in the school and allowing more time for the programme to become embedded.",Documentation; Elementary School Students; Elementary School Teachers; Foreign Countries; goal orientation; intervention; Interviews; Mathematics Achievement; Metacognition; Observation; Program Effectiveness; Program Evaluation; Progress Monitoring; Randomized Controlled Trials; Reading Achievement; Reflection; Self Management; Skill Development; Statistical Analysis; Student Characteristics; Student Responsibility; Surveys; Thinking Skills; United Kingdom (England),"Motteram, Gary; Choudry, Sophina; Kalambouka, Afroditi; Hutcheson, Graeme; Barton, Hutcheson; Education Endowment Foundation (EEF); University of Manchester",2016.0,,0,249
250,The edmark® reading program: A comparison of computerized and table top presentation in reading outcomes in students with autism spectrum disorder,"AbstractEvery child has the right to access the education curriculum in their least restrictive environment. Therefore, it is important that students with special education needs, such as autism spectrum disorder can access general education in inclusive environments. A between-groups design was used to investigate the Edmark® Reading Program (ERP) across inclusive school settings, and self-contained classrooms, to compare its efficacy in basic teaching reading outcomes using both table-top and software format. Nine schools were randomized into two groups. There were between 2 and 8 students per school, and 31 students in total. Participants were exposed to ERP in one of two conditions, table-top instruction (TTI) or computer-assisted instruction (CAI), for one full school semester. Assessments of reading ability were conducted before and after exposure to ERP on word reading, accuracy, rate, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. When formats were compared, there were statistically significant differences found in favor of TTI on reading accuracy (small effect; size, 0.19), reading rate (medium effect size; 0.74) and phonemic awareness, specifically first sound fluency (small effect size; 0.19). Despite these outcomes, upon completion of the study, many teachers in the TTI condition requested to switch to CAI, possibly highlighting the perceived response effort required in the administration of ERP-TTI. Descriptive analyses of pre-post data also showed that students made sizable growth on many reading outcomes.

251,"Improving readability through individualized summary extraction, using interactive genetic algorithm","The impact of individualized summarization is high, because a summary would be difficult to understand by all if summarized in a generic manner. When sentences are important as well as readable to the learner with reading difficulties, the summary might be useful for better comprehension of the text. In this article, we propose an Interactive Genetic Algorithm-based individualized summarization to maximize the readability of selected important sentences. The individualized summarization applies to the educational domain using readability-based features to extract readable important sentences. Inclusion of features representing reading difficulty should not dilute the informative score of the summary, moreover it aids the learner who has reading difficulties to comprehend the complete text better, using the summary as supplementary to the complete text and not as a substitute for it. The experimental results derived from intrinsic evaluation shows that individual summary extraction performs better than a GA-based approach and a baseline approach. Moreover, user -based direct evaluation also supports individualized summarization for improving the readability by the target audience.

252,"The skilled, the knowledgeable, and the motivated: Investigating the strategic allocation of time on task in a computer-based assessment","In large scale low stakes assessments, students usually choose their own speed at which to work on tasks. At the same time, previous research has shown that in hard tasks, the time students invest is a positive predictor of task performance. From this perspective, a relevant question is whether student dispositions other than the targeted skill might affect students’ time on task behavior, thus potentially affecting their task performance and in turn their estimated skill in the target domain. Using PISA 2009 computer based assessment data, the present research investigated for the domain of reading digital text whether three variables that can be assumed to predict performance in digital reading tasks, comprehension skill, enjoyment of reading, and knowledge of reading strategies would also predict how much time students would devote to digital reading tasks, and in particular, whether they would adapt time on task to task difficulty. To address this question, two linear mixed models were estimated that predicted the time students spent on a task, and the average time students spent on relevant pages within each task, by the interaction of task difficulty with comprehension skill, enjoyment of reading, and knowledge of reading strategies. To account for time on task being nested in students and tasks, random effects for persons and tasks were 1d. The interaction of task difficulty with gender and Socio-Economic Status (SES) was 1d for control purposes. Models were estimated individually for 19 countries, and results integrated meta-analytically. In line with predictions, for both time on task indicators, significant positive interactions were found with comprehension skill, enjoyment of reading, and knowledge of reading strategies. These interactions indicated that in students with high comprehension skill, enjoyment of reading, and knowledge of reading strategies there was a stronger association of task difficulty with time on task than in students low in either of these variables. Thus, skilled comprehenders, students enjoying reading, and students in command of reading strategies behaved more adaptively than lower skilled, motivated, or knowledgeable students. Implications of these findings for the validity of self-paced computer-based assessments are discussed.

253,Research Timeline: Dictionary Use by English Language Learners,"The history of research into dictionary use tends to be characterised by small-scale studies undertaken in a variety of different contexts, rather than larger-scale, longer-term funded projects. The research conducted by dictionary publishers is not generally made public, because of its commercial sensitivity, yet because dictionary production is largely a commercial venture, academic research in this area has rarely attracted public funding. Findings from multiple small studies are often difficult to compare because of variations in the types of user, dictionary material, and experimental method. Research into dictionary use has gradually become more subtle and more complex, however. Researchers have tried to control for lexicographical variables by using specially created ""mini-dictionaries"", rather than original dictionaries produced by different publishers, and new computer-based research tools and the synthesis of findings from different types of data set are helping to resolve the apparent contradictions noted in earlier studies. Following Hulstijn & Atkins (1998: 10) this timeline concerns research which aims at ""bringing the dictionary to the user (how can the dictionary best serve its users' needs?)"" and ""bringing the user to the dictionary (how can people be made better dictionary users?)"". Only empirical research and overviews of empirical research are 1d. The author's selection represents five recurring themes: (1) English language learners' preferences and attitudes regarding dictionary use; (2) The influence of dictionaries on English language learners' text comprehension; (3) The influence of dictionaries on English language learners' text production; (4) The role of dictionaries as an aid to English language learning; and (5) English language learners' dictionary consultation behaviour.",Access to Information; Annotated Bibliographies; comprehension; Dictionaries; English (Second Language); Language Research; Predictor Variables; Second Language Learning; Use Studies; Writing Skills,"Nesi, Hilary",2014.0,,0,253
254,Sociocultural and educational factors for reading literacy decline in the Netherlands in the past decade,"This study examined sociocultural and educational factors in explaining the reading literacy achievement of fourth-grade children (about 10years of age) in the Netherlands during the past decade. Using 2001, 2006 and 2011 PIRLS data, a multilevel modeling analysis was conducted to examine levels and changes in reading literacy achievement over the years in relation to gender, SES, ethnicity, linguistic background and number of books in the home, and school SES as sociocultural factors, and early literacy activities and abilities, reading strategies instruction, time spent on reading and computer use as educational factors. A significant decline in reading achievement between 2001 and 2011 was evidenced with more than 80% of the variance being explained at the student level. All factors, except for early literacy abilities, reading strategy instruction and time spent on reading, showed statistically significant effects on reading literacy. All these effects applied to both literary and expository text genres, and to higher-order as well as to lower-order reading comprehension processes with two exceptions: computer use showed only an impact on expository texts and on the lower-order processing condition, and a rural school setting showed no impact on the literary text genre. Interaction effects showed that the decline in reading literacy achievement in the Netherlands in the past decade is related to the sociocultural factors of gender and student SES and to the educational factors of early literacy activities in the home and early literacy abilities established in the school.

255,Computerized silent reading rate and strategy instruction for fourth graders at risk in silent reading rate,"Fourth graders whose silent word reading and/or sentence reading rate was, on average, two-thirds standard deviation below their oral reading of real and pseudowords and reading comprehension accuracy were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 7) or wait-listed (n = 7) control groups. Following nine sessions combining computerized rapid-accelerated-reading program (RAP), which individually tailors rate of written text presentation to comprehension criterion (80%), and self-regulated strategies for attending and engaging, the treated group significantly outperformed the wait-listed group before treatment on (a) a grade-normed, silent sentence reading rate task requiring lexical- and syntactic-level processing to decide which of three sentences makes sense and (b) RAP presentation rates yoked to comprehension accuracy level. Each group improved significantly on these same outcomes from before to after instruction. Attention ratings and working memory for written words predicted posttreatment accuracy, which correlated significantly with the silent sentence reading rate score. Implications are discussed for (a) preventing silent reading disabilities during the transition to increasing emphasis on silent reading, (b) evidence-based approaches for making accommodation of extra time on timed tests requiring silent reading, and (c) combining computerized instruction with strategies for self-regulation during silent reading.

256,Paraphrasing Refutation Text and Knowledge Form: Examples from Repairing Relational Database Design Misconceptions,"This experimental study examined the effects of conceptual change-oriented refutation text (RT) on declarative knowledge and conceptual knowledge. Information Science undergraduates (N = 66) enrolled in two sections of a course with different instructors but the same syllabus were randomly assigned to one of four RT treatments that 1d read only vs. reading plus paraphrasing, with either set 1 or set 2 RTs, each RT set addressed five separate misconceptions. Pretest and posttest assessed the declarative and conceptual aspects of all ten misconceptions. For conceptual knowledge, pretest-to-posttest results show that reading and paraphrasing RTs is superior to only reading the RTs (ES = 0.40). Unexpectedly, conceptual knowledge improved for all misconceptions, both for the assigned RTs as well as those not assigned, thus RTs had a broad structural rather than a narrow attentional influence. However, declarative knowledge scores significantly and substantially decreased from pretest-to-posttest, indicating that the conceptual gains observed here came at the cost of declarative knowledge. Misconceptions are represented here as multiword chunks using a Pathfinder network approach, and conceptual improvement is explained as the effects of refutation text as a form of structural feedback acting on these chunks. Future research is needed to further consider the effects of addressing multiple misconceptions at once, and also on how RTs impact different kinds of learning outcomes.",Attitude Change; Information Science; Misconceptions; Persuasive Discourse; Pretests Posttests; reading comprehension; Scores; Undergraduate Students; Writing Skills,"Ntshalintshali, General M.; Clariana, Roy B.",2020.0,,0,256
257,SlideIt+ New Ebook Reader for Personal Computer (PC) for Improved Reading Comprehension,"Reading expository text is essential in educational settings but can present challenges. eBooks bring several advantages: they are portable, searchable and efficiently stored. However, eBooks have disadvantages compared to natural books. eBooks are more rigid and fragile than natural books. Although reading on a mobile phone is more flexible than on PC (desktop or laptop), it still lacks the flexibility of a natural book. Further, mobile phones can only handle relatively small texts and are not suitable for texts with high-resolution graphics or multimedia. This study developed SlideIt+, an eBook reader for PC to target reading comprehension while drawing on eBook advantages. Thirty-four participants were grouped into three conditions: an experimental group that used the eBook reader; a control group who read natural books, and an experimental group who read natural books with a structured reading strategy that was also incorporated into the eBook reader. The eBook reader outperformed natural book reading, and performance was equivalent for the eBook reader and natural books when the reading strategy was used. SlideIt+ effectively helps comprehension of expository text on PC. The SlideIt+ eBook reader mechanism could be adapted for other eBook readers, supporting research into the integration of reading strategies into eBooks.",Books; educational technology; Electronic Publishing; Handheld Devices; Program Effectiveness; reading comprehension; Reading strategies; Technology Uses in Education; Telecommunications,"Nugroho, Joan; Chen, Gwo-Dong; Li, Liang-Yi; Tjiharjadi, Semuil",2021.0,,0,257
258,Cooperative Learning and Teacher-Directed Learning Classrooms: Places for the Development of Metacognitive Skills for Reading Proficiency,"Introduction: Persistent abysmal academic achievement among adolescents in Nigerian secondary schools has become a concern among stakeholders in the Nigerian system of education. This, over time, has been linked to poor reading culture and reading skills, worsened by unproductive instructional approaches adopted by teachers for reading proficiency. An investigation into effective instructional approaches to arm adolescents with metacognitive skills for reading proficiency becomes imperative. This study, therefore, investigated the impact of cooperative learning and teacher-directed learning approaches on secondary school students' development of metacognitive skills for reading proficiency. Method: We adopted a quasi-experimental research design in our study. One hundred and eighteen early adolescent students were sampled from three public secondary schools in Anambra state. The instrument used in the study is an open-ended metacognitive skill for reading proficiency questionnaire (OMSRPQ). Three operations were used for the experiment: 1) task understanding, 2) strategy understanding, and 3) management of learning process. The sum of these three operations is the overall metacognitive skills of the students. Results. Our findings showed that students in cooperative integrated reading and composition (CIRC) learning approach differed significantly from those in the teacher-directed instructional (DI) approach and the control group (C1) in task understanding operation F (2,118) = 8.783, p <0.01, strategy understanding F(2,118) = 6.324, p <0.01and the overall metacognitive reading skills F(2, 118) = 7.047, p < 0.01. No significant mean differences occurred among the groups in management of learning process skills F (2,118) = 2.949, p >.05. Adjusted omega squared (est. [omega][superscript 2]) test showed large to moderate effect sizes in the operations that were significant. Discussion and Conclusion: We concluded that metacognitive skills for reading could be better enhanced in cooperative learning approach. Based on these findings, the researchers recommended that CIRC can be used in developing metacognitive skills needed in secondary school reading classrooms.",Academic Achievement; Cognitive Style; Comparative Analysis; Cooperative Learning; Foreign Countries; instructional effectiveness; Metacognition; Nigeria; Pretests Posttests; Reading Skills; Reading strategies; Secondary School Students; Task Analysis; Teaching Methods,"Nwosu, Kingsley Chinaza; Unachukwu, Gabriel Chidi; Hickman, Gregory P.",2021.0,,0,258
259,Providing Pedagogical Learner Training in CALL: Impact on Student Use of Language-Learning Strategies and Glosses,"While recent studies have found that viewing glosses with multimedia annotations can help students learn and retain vocabulary words (Chun & Plass, 1996; Al-Seghayer, 2001), O'Bryan (2005) found that when providing pictorial glosses for select words within an online reading unit, few students took advantage of the clickable gloss function allowed by the medium, a finding mirrored in a number of research studies (Hegelheimer, 1998; Hegelheimer & Tower, 2004). In an attempt to address this issue, this study investigated whether training learners to use CALL effectively following Hubbard's (2004) 5-step approach leads to increased gloss use.

260,The Effect of Media Annotation Technology on Enhancing the Use of Discourse Markers within Communicative Speech,"Language learners need to understand and apply appropriate discourse as part of the process of attaining ""communicative competence"" (Canale, 1983) needed to fulfill academic and social-adaptive functions. Students who are able to apply discourse strategies within the classroom demonstrate higher levels of metacognition and critical thinking (Reznitskaya et al, 2001; Kramarski and Mevarech, 2003; Mercer, 2004). Given the opportunity to reflect upon their own learning, students often become more engaged (Lattuca and Stark, 2011, p. 221). Language educators may better serve contemporary students, who are motivated by effective integration of technology in the curriculum (Knight, 2008) by using this technology to increase opportunities for communication, reflection (metacognition) and overall engagement. This study used a between-subject design involving 68 international students at a university English language program divided between treatment group 1 (n = 37) and treatment group 2 (n = 31). The research examined the effect of annotation functionality within VoiceThread, a popular web-based multimedia platform, as a means to promote participants' acquisition and appropriate use of discourse markers through the process reflecting upon recorded speaking performances. Although the effectiveness of digital annotation technology was not revealed via a significant interaction effect, a significant main effect provides evidence of the effectiveness of more basic VoiceThread functions in promoting communicative language. Follow-up qualitative interviews were used to gain insight into students' experiences with the technology.

261,Improving informed consent to chemotherapy: A randomized controlled trial of written information versus an interactive multimedia CD-ROM,"Objective: This randomized controlled trial aimed to determine whether an interactive CD-ROM improved cancer patients’ recall of chemotherapy treatment information over standard written information, and whether demographic, cognitive, and psychological factors better predicted recall than this format of delivery. Methods: One-hundred- and-one new patients about to commence chemotherapy were randomized to receive written information or a CD-ROM containing treatment information before giving informed consent. Patients’ recall, concentration, short-term memory, reading comprehension, anxiety, depression, and coping styles were assessed with standardized measures pre-treatment. Seventy-seven patients completed tests for recall of treatment information before their second chemotherapy session. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated no significant differences between the written information and CD-ROM groups across recall questions about number of drugs received (p = .43), treatment length (p = .23), and treatment goal (p = .69). Binary logistic regressions indicated that for groups combined different variables predicted each of the recall questions. Conclusion: An interactive CD-ROM did not improve cancer patients’ recall of treatment information enough to warrant changes in consent procedures. Practice implications: Different variables predicted recall of different treatment aspects highlighting the complex nature of attempting to improve patient recall. Attending to the effect of depression on patient knowledge and understanding appears paramount.

We hypothesized that as a consequence, students would improve their traditional reading and writing skills as well as develop new digital literacy skills. Eighteen classes of grade 4 students were assigned to either an experimental or control group. Both groups studied the same curriculum unit over a 10 week period, however, in addition the experimental group developed computer games related to the unit using a game development shell. An analysis of pre- and post-unit scores on two standardized literacy test batteries revealed that the experimental students performed significantly better on one of the subtests, a measure of logical sentence construction (p = .002). Field notes and teacher interview data indicated that game development helped improve student content retention, ability to compare and contrast information presented, utilize more and different kinds of research materials including digital resources, editing skills, and develop an insight into questioning skills.

263,How Does the Use of Blogs Impact Student Motivation for Literature Discussions?,"This study sought to determine the impact of blogs on student motivation to discuss literature. The participants were 11 male and 12 female fourth grade students ranging from eight to ten years of age. All of the students were instructed in one classroom located in a suburban school setting. All students had access to computers fitted with high speed Internet in their classroom. Most of the students had access to the Internet at home as well. Semi-structured interviews and survey instruments were administered over a six-week period. The response data were analyzed to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the students as well as to make suggestions for improvement with reference to the use of blogs. Data analysis revealed gender and reading ability did not impact preferences significantly, and there was generally an equal split between preferences for blogs and face-to-face discussion of literature. A major factor in student preference was the ease with which the blog approach was perceived. Ease interacted with time limitations, technological ability, individual and group dynamics, and beliefs towards publication to a worldwide audience. It was concluded that blogs, while not solely motivating, can impact student motivation toward discussion.",Computer Mediated Communication; data analysis; Discussion Groups; Electronic Journals; Elementary School Students; gender differences; Grade 4; Literature Appreciation; Outcomes of Education; Preferences; Pretests Posttests; Reading Ability; Reading strategies; Semi Structured Interviews; Student Journals; Student Motivation; Student Surveys; Suburban Schools; Usability,"Pane, Pamela",2014.0,,0,263
264,Reading instruction in a technological age,"This chapter explores how digital media can be integrated into L2 reading instruction to help learners improve their reaching skills. Drawing on literature that outlines principles of L2 reading instruction, this chapter focuses on technological tools that can be used in activating background knowledge, enriching vocabulary, teaching for comprehension, improving reading fluency, and promoting extensive reading. Some of these tools are specifically geared to provide reading support, such as hypermedia annotation, text-to-speech, and text reformatting others are more general, such as Internet resources, wilds, and blogs. We discuss findings from empirical studies that examine how effectivity these tools facilitate cognitive processes integral to L2 reading, thereby assisting reading skills development Limitations surrounding these studies are also addressed. We conclude by summarizing pedagogical implications for L2 instructors and offering suggestions to researchers who study the use of technologies in L2 reading.

265,The Impact of Collaborative Online Reading on Summarizing Skills,"The aim of this study was to determine whether, as a result of collaborative-online reading of a chapter from a book of an academic nature, the quality of the collaborative summary that the readers would write would be higher than that written by readers who would both read the same chapter and write a summary in a face-to-face setting. In this study we examined the difference between the summaries written by participants from two groups, each group was divided into subgroups of 3 participants who had read collaboratively a chapter of a book, and collaborated on writing a summary. The participants of the experimental group read the chapter as it appeared in a website for collaborative reading built especially for this study and the participants were asked to summarize the chapter on a shared online digital document. The participants of the control group were asked to read the chapter face-to-face and to collaboratively summarize it in hand writing. The quality of the summaries was evaluated with a tool developed by Rivard (2001). This tool was developed to measure the quality of the summaries. In our study the main and secondary ideas that were supposed to be 1d in the participants' summaries were identified by three literature teachers using ten different criteria and the summaries were analyzed by two other judges based on these criteria. The findings indicated that there were significant differences in the majority of the writing indicators being measured with the tool. The findings indicated that collaborative-online reading and writing produce a summary of a higher quality than one read and hand written collaboratively face-to-face.",Control Groups; Conventional Instruction; Cooperation; Cooperative Learning; Documentation; Electronic Publishing; Experimental Groups; instructional effectiveness; Reading Assignments; Writing Skills,"Passig, David; Maidel-Kravetsky, Jenny",2016.0,,0,265
266,Developing Summarizing Skills in 4th Grade Students: Intervention Programme Effects,"The aim of our study was to determine whether summarizing skills could be developed in 4th grade primary school students. We designed a 5-month intervention programme as an experimental study, in which teachers trained students in the experimental group in their ability to summarize, which is one of the important strategies that enhance reading comprehension. 190 students in 4th grade from 8 primary schools in Slovenia participated in the study. We evaluated students' general reading competency, their metacognitive knowledge about reading and their ability to make summaries of two short and one longer expository text (pretest, posttest and follow-up test). The general reading competency explained the most variance in summarizing at pretest and posttest by experimental and control group of students. In the follow-up test, the summarizing from posttest was the strongest predictor in both groups and in the experimental group also the metacognitive knowledge about reading. The results showed that teachers can develop summarizing skills in students by systematically training them to use these skills, but the training effects decrease if the learning environment does not encourage students to use these skills.",Control Groups; Elementary School Students; elementary schools; Foreign Countries; Grade 4; intervention; Metacognition; Predictor Variables; Pretests Posttests; reading comprehension; Reading Fluency; reading instruction; Reading Tests; Slovenia; Vocabulary,"Pecjak, Sonja; Pirc, Tina",2018.0,,0,266
267,Evaluating an Intelligent Tutoring System for Making Legal Arguments with Hypotheticals,"Argumentation is a process that occurs often in ill-defined domains and that helps deal with the ill-definedness. Typically a notion of ""correctness"" for an argument in an ill-defined domain is impossible to define or verify formally because the underlying concepts are open-textured and the quality of the argument may be subject to discussion or even expert disagreement. Previous research has highlighted the advantages of graphical representations for learning argumentation skills. A number of intelligent tutoring systems have been built that support students in rendering arguments graphically, as they learn argumentation skills. The relative instructional benefits of graphical argument representations have not been reliably shown, however. In this paper we present a formative evaluation of LARGO (Legal ARgument Graph Observer), a system that enables law students graphically to represent examples of legal interpretation with hypotheticals they observe while reading texts of U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments. We hypothesized that, compared to a text-based alternative, LARGO's diagramming language geared toward depicting hypothetical reasoning processes, coupled with non-directive feedback, helps students better extract the important information from argument transcripts and better learn argumentation skills. A first pilot study, conducted with volunteer first-semester law students, provided support for the hypothesis. The system especially helped lower-aptitude students learn argumentation skills, and LARGO improved the reading skills of students as they studied expert arguments. A second study with LARGO was conducted as a mandatory part of a first-semester University law course. Although there were no differences in the learning outcomes of the two conditions, the second study showed some evidence that those students who engaged more with the argument diagrams through the advice did better than the text condition. One lesson learned from these two studies is that graphical representations in intelligent tutoring systems for the ill-defined domain of argumentation may still be better than text, but that engagement is essential.

268,Contrasting group analysis of Brazilian students with dyslexia and good readers using the computerized reading and writing assessment battery 'BALE',"The analysis of cognitive processes underpinning reading and writing skills may help to distinguish different reading ability profiles. The present study used a Brazilian reading and writing battery to compare performance of students with dyslexia with two individually matched control groups: one contrasting on reading competence but not age and the other group contrasting on age but not reading competence. Participants were 28 individuals with dyslexia (19 boys) with a mean age of 9.82 (SD ± 1.44) drawn from public and private schools. These were matched to: (1) an age control group (AC) of 26 good readers with a mean age of 9.77 (SD ± 1.44) matched by age, sex, years of schooling, and type of school; (2) reading control group (RC) of 28 younger controls with a mean age of 7.82 (SD ± 1.06) matched by sex, type of school, and reading level. All groups were tested on four tasks from the Brazilian Reading and Writing Assessment battery ('BALE'):Written Sentence Comprehension Test (WSCT); Spoken Sentence Comprehension Test (OSCT); Picture- Print Writing Test (PPWT 1.1-Writing); and the Reading Competence Test (RCT). These tasks evaluate reading and listening comprehension for sentences, spelling, and reading isolated words and pseudowords (non-words). The dyslexia group scored lower and took longer to complete tasks than the AC group. Compared with the RC group, there were no differences in total scores on reading or oral comprehension tasks. However, dyslexics presented slower reading speeds, longer completion times, and lower scores on spelling tasks, even compared with younger controls. Analysis of types of errors on word and pseudoword reading items showed students with dyslexia scoring lower for pseudoword reading than the other two groups.These findings suggest that the dyslexics overall scores were similar to those of younger readers. However, specific phonological and visual decoding deficits showed that the two groups differ in terms of underpinning reading strategies.

269,Deriving Empirically-Based Design Guidelines for Advanced Learning Technologies that Foster Disciplinary Comprehension,"Planning, conducting, and reporting leading-edge research requires professionals who are capable of highly skilled reading. This study reports the development of an empirically informed computer-based learning environment designed to foster the acquisition of reading comprehension strategies that mediate expertise in the social sciences. Empirical data were gathered in a mixed-methods explanatory sequential design that examined the reading comprehension strategies used by an expert social scientist while reading a professional-level text. Process data were collected through a concurrent think-aloud protocol and coded according to reading comprehension processes. We combined both quantitative and qualitative analyses to identify, describe, and explain patterns in the expert's use of reading strategies. Our findings indicate that highly-skilled reading is characterized by critiquing text information, relating information to prior knowledge, and evaluating one's own understanding of text information. Findings are used to inform the design of worked-examples and a pedagogical agent embedded within the Highly-Skilled Reading Tutor.

270,Instructional Effectiveness of a Computer-Supported Program for Teaching Reading Comprehension Strategies,"This article examines the effectiveness of a computer-based instructional program (e-PELS) aimed at direct instruction in a collection of reading comprehension strategies. In e-PELS, students learn to highlight and outline expository passages based on various types of text structures (such as comparison or cause-and-effect) as well as to paraphrase, self-question, and summarize. The study involved 1041 fourth-grade elementary students from 21 schools distributed in three regions in central Chile. Participant teachers integrated this program into the Spanish language curriculum, instructing their students during thirty sessions of 90 min each during one school semester. Pretest-to-posttest gains in reading comprehension scores were significantly greater for students instructed with this program than for students who received traditional instruction (d = 0.5), with particularly strong effects for lower-achieving students (d = 0.7). The findings support the efficacy of direct instruction in specific learning strategies in a computer-based environment.

271,Word reading skills of beginning non-readers: Effects of training with a visible orthography,"The experiments presented here investigated the effects of manipulating the visibility of spelling patterns in English print, without concurrent oral segmentation, on the word identification skills of beginning non-readers. Visibility of the orthographic patterns was manipulated by presenting material organized into rime families (blocked) or with rime families distributed throughout training (unblocked), as well as through highlighting common rimes in the same colour of print. Experiment 1 demonstrated that while a program emphasizing the orthographic patterns in the English writing system (without concurrent phonological segmentation) led to rapid improvements in beginning non-readers' online word identification, the benefits of such training did not persist beyond the training context. Experiments 2A and 2B investigated whether the failure to transfer word reading skills beyond the blocked training context was mitigated by training programs that required increased focus on the letter patterns (2A) and the letter-sound relations (2B). These manipulations did not influence performance; children continued to demonstrate poor transfer beyond the training context. Experiment 3 focused on determining the mechanisms underlying the poor transfer following blocked training. To evaluate performance, this final experiment used a novel measure comprising word identification as well as onset and rime identification. Training materials were blocked either by rimes or onsets. The question of interest was whether training on material that blocks by orthographic units allows children to identify the blocked units during training without actively decoding their letter-sound relations, thus decreasing the probability of forming connections between the graphemes and phonemes comprising them. Results indicated that this is the case when children were trained on material blocked by rimes, but not that blocked by onsets.

272,Online Research Strategies of L2 Readers: Evaluating Strategic Competence through Mixed Methods,"Researching from multiple-documents online is an essential activity, but it has generally been overlooked by second language (L2) educators. This study uses navigation tracking, eye tracking, a post-reading recall task, and interviews to examine the degree to which Japanese L2 readers maintain task awareness when researching online. Key reading variables analyzed were attention to relevant versus irrelevant pages and repeated versus novel content. Finally, the experiment analyzed the connection between the reading measures and post-reading recall scores. The findings suggest that the readers displayed moderate competence overall, but some participants lacked strategic competence. There was a significant correlation between reading relevant content and recall performance.

273,The Relationship between Reading Strategy Use and Reading Comprehension as Mediated by Reading Rate: The Case of Eye Movement Training by Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP),The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between reading strategy use and reading comprehension as mediated by reading rate amongst advanced EFL students who received eye movement training by Rapid Visual Presentation (RSVP) technology. Seventy-two EFL learners participated in the study and received instruction for enhancing their reading speed via Reading Trainer Application for twelve consecutive weeks. Their entry-level of reading strategies awareness was assessed by the Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory prior to and after the study. Their reading comprehension was assessed by International English System Test before and after the study. Their reading rate was also recorded prior to and after the study. Modelling the relationship between strategy use and reading comprehension as mediated by reading rate was tested prior to the study and the findings showed that the model was not statistically significant. The model was reassessed after the experiment and the results lent credence to the fact that eye training via RSVP for speed reading led to a mediating role for reading rate in the relationship between strategy use and reading comprehension. The results support the fact that reading rate is a contributory factor in understanding reading passages and integrating speed reading training using the-state-of-the-art technologies into reading instruction should be considered in EFL reading courses.,Computer Assisted Instruction; computer software; Correlation; English (Second Language); Eye Movements; Handheld Devices; instructional effectiveness; International English Language Testing System; Language Tests; Late Adolescents; Metacognition; reading comprehension; Reading Rate; Reading strategies; Second Language Learning; Telecommunications; Training Methods,"Rahimi, Mehrak; Babaei, Seyyed Abolfazl",2021.0,,0,273
274,Reading-metacognitive strategy awareness and use in reciprocal teaching settings: Implementing a computerized RMSA system,"The present experiment was composed of both qualitative and quantitative methods and aimed at investigating Reading Metacognitive Strategy Awareness (RMSA) and use by the aid of three inventory techniques including a questionnaire, a think-aloud protocol, and a Computerized RMSA System. The computerized system was specifically designed and validated to satisfy the needs of this study in measuring and practicing Reading Metacognitive Strategies. It also tried to explore any possible effects of Computerized RMSA System on reading comprehension of the participants. To this end, a sample of 25 university students majoring in English Translation and English Literature from a University in Iran were selected based on purposive and clustered sampling. The research data were selected using a number of instruments including the reading section of Test of English as a Foreign Language as pre/posttest, a researcher-made Reading Metacognitive Strategies questionnaire, think-aloud protocol and a Computerized RMSA System. The research findings show that the questionnaire, think-aloud and Computerized RMSA System results vary significantly. Moreover, Computerized RMSA System has a positive effect on reading comprehension of learners of English as a Foreign Language. Pedagogical implications of the findings are discussed.

275,Investigating the Effect of Using Multiple Sensory Modes of Glossing Vocabulary Items in a Reading Text with Multimedia Annotations,"In recent years, improvements in technology have enhanced the possibilities of teaching and learning various subjects. This is specially the case in foreign language instruction. The use of technology and multimedia brings new opportunities for learning different areas of language. In this regard, the present study attempts to find out if the use of multimedia, images and movies, helps learners in learning vocabulary items 1d in a reading comprehension text. For this purpose, 70 students studying English at pre-intermediate level have been selected. These participants are then divided into three groups, each of which receives a different kind of instruction. The members of the first group were required to read some texts in which certain vocabulary items were 1d as the target of teaching. Those in the second group received the same texts with some pictures added so that the grasp of the unknown words would become facilitated. The students in the third group were exposed to the same material along with some movie strips. The strips were selected in a way to 1 the specific vocabulary items. The course duration was about 45 days. At the end of the course, all the students in the three aforementioned groups were sat for taking a vocabulary test. The test format was multiple-choice. The results of the ANOVA indicated that annotating reading comprehension passages with movie clips contributes to better learning and recall of vocabulary through reading texts.",Adult Students; Computer Assisted Instruction; English (Second Language); Films; Illustrations; Institutes (Training Programs); Language Tests; Multimedia Instruction; Multiple Choice Tests; Pretests Posttests; reading comprehension; Recall (Psychology); Scores; Second Language Instruction; Second Language Learning; Statistical Analysis; Student Attitudes; Test Format; Vocabulary Development,"Rezaee, Abbas Ali; Shoar, Neda Sharbaf",2011.0,,0,275

The idea with this experiment was to explore if students are capable of analyzing business and technology information from technical readings in a way to represent it graphically with CMs and social networks. Preliminary data from the case study showed that students were reasonably successful in processing texts on topics related to the Tesla electric car company's business and technology models. Multiple iterations and guided instructions when designing CMs demonstrated the interplay of various actors, processes, interactions, and contexts. Student performance indicated significant expertise with CM design and text summarization but inadequate performance designing social networks, indicating the necessity for more structured instructions and practice.",Business Administration Education; concept mapping; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Japan; reading comprehension; Second Language Instruction; Teaching Methods; Technical Writing; Undergraduate Students,"Roy, Debopriyo",2021.0,,0,276
277,"Website analysis in an EFL context: Content comprehension, perceptions on web usability and awareness of reading strategies","Website analysis is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry that focuses on both digital literacy and language competence (Brugger, 2009). Website analysis in an EFL learning context has the potential to facilitate logical thinking and in the process develop functional language proficiency. This study reported on an English language website (http://www.travelbelize.org/) analysis experiment carried out for three weeks as an in-class and homework activity in a third year (junior) level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) course at a Japanese technical university. The purpose was to explore EFL learners’ ability to analyze an English language website and produce concrete design responses in English. During the first week of the analysis (involving sixteen students selected due to performing the best during earlier in-class website analysis activities on the course), participants produced their own responses to eight open-ended design questions about the website. The second week of the analysis (involving all 59 students on the course) tested the students’ ability to search for information from the website, and recorded their impressions about the website design based on standard usability questionnaires (CSUQ, QUIS, and MPRC). The third week of the analysis had the 59 students self-report on their use of meta-cognitive reading strategies (MARSI 1.0 Questionnaire) during the website analysis. The results of the questionnaires showed that, overall, the EFL students had a basic understanding of major design questions related to information organization, screen interface design, audience, technology used, etc. However, there was statistically significant variability between responses in different groups (comprehensive evaluation, webpage design, terminology and website information and website capabilities) and the respondents were not unanimous in their impressions about the website. The result of the student self-reports on metacognitive reading strategies showed wide acceptability and use of problem-solving strategies.

278,Improving emergent literacy with school-based shared reading: Paper versus ebooks,"Shared reading interactions with electronic books (ebooks) versus paper books were compared, using a randomized controlled crossover design. The ebooks were designed to encourage an interactive reading style by the adult reader and to highlight text-meaning correspondences for the child participants. Twenty-eight children from kindergarten classes situated in a low income community participated in the study, sharing books with an adult reader. Each child shared the same paper book three times in a single week and an ebook three times in a second week, with story and book presented in counterbalanced order. At the end of each week the child’s learning with respect to story comprehension and emergent literacy was assessed by research personnel. All outcomes were significantly related to the child’s letter knowledge. However, emergent literacy knowledge was greatest in the ebook condition compared to the print book condition, especially for those children with poor letter knowledge. Therefore, ebooks designed to facilitate supportive adult reading strategies may improve emergent literacy skills, especially in children with deficient skills at school entry.

279,Calling Iranian learners of L2 English: Effect of gloss type on lexical retention and reading performance under different learning conditions,"This study sought to compare how three different gloss types (text–picture, text–audio and text–picture–audio) affected English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. The study also compared how results on comprehension and vocabulary acquisition differed across three learning conditions (i.e., incidental, intentional and explicit instruction). A between‐groups design was employed with four groups (N = 135) of Iranian university learners of L2 English. The participants (with upper‐intermediate proficiency level) read English texts. Written recall and multiple‐choice questions were used to measure reading comprehension; vocabulary knowledge scale (VKS) and contextualized vocabulary knowledge test (CVKT) were used to assess vocabulary acquisition. Results of statistical analyses revealed that while the text–picture–audio gloss type consistently resulted in better vocabulary learning and reading comprehension, the learning conditions varied in terms of their immediate and delayed effect on vocabulary and reading scores. This study suggests that learner performances across gloss types are condition specific and provides both pedagogical and theoretical implications. What is already known about this topic: (1) Electronic glosses foster reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. (2) There are different positions about the effectiveness of form focused instruction in grammar, with the focus on forms approach having a higher acceptable rate in SLA. But, this issue has been rarely researched in vocabulary acquisition. What this paper adds: (1) This study supports the complementary nature of dual annotations in vocabulary learning and reading comprehension. (2) This study extends the issue of form focused instruction to vocabulary learning by comparing the incidental, intentional and incidental–intentional learning orientations. (3) This study evaluates the interaction between the multiple gloss types and the learning orientations. Implications for theory, policy or practice: This study provides both pedagogical and theoretical implications.

280,What does the evidence really say about effective literacy teaching?,"This paper is shaped by the question: What does the evidence really say about effective literacy teaching? The studies reviewed come from a systematic meta-analysis of randomised control (RCT) design studies, arid other closely related relevant research available in English. The aforementioned question was applied to the areas of reading accuracy and phonics; reading comprehension; reading fluency; spelling; and educational technologies. Findings in the area of reading accuracy and phonics suggest that although the evidence exists on the positives results of phonics instruction, mare research is needed on the different approaches (e.g. synthetic, analytic). Eight strategies in reading comprehension are briefly explored. It is concluded that the research in this area is relatively weak, as few RCT studies exist in this domain. Similar findings were evident in the area of reading fluency, and spelling. The research hi the area of educational technologies proved to be the weakest explored. Of the few studies found, the research seems to imply that educational technologies do not enhance the reading success of the learner. However, recent and more rigorously designed research highlight preliminary results in this area that appear to show promise.

283,Negotiating new literacies in science: An examination of at-risk and average-achieving ninth-grade readers' online reading comprehension strategies,"In today's digital world the Internet is becoming an increasingly predominant resource for science information, rapidly eclipsing the traditional science textbook in content area classrooms (Lawless & Schrader, 2008). The shift challenges researchers, educators, administrators, and policy makers to reconsider what it means to read and comprehend online science information. The research on digital literacy is still in its infancy and little is known about the strategies and processes students use when reading science content on the Internet. Even less is known about how at-risk readers comprehend digital science content. Therefore, this study addresses three research questions: (1) What strategies and processes do at-risk and average-achieving readers use as they locate information and generate meaning from science websites? (2) What navigational profiles emerge as at-risk and average-achieving readers construct traversals (unique online paths of information) they locate information and generate meaning from science websites? (3) What individual characteristics influenced students' strategies as they locate information and generate meaning from science websites? Participants were six ninth-grade students in general education biology classrooms. Three were average-achieving readers and three were at-risk readers based on assessments of reading comprehension in traditional print-based texts. The students engaged in a three-day research project about the rainforest biome, locating information online, taking notes, and constructing an information brochure about the rainforest for peers. Data measures prior to and during the research 1d an Internet use survey, verbal protocols, screen captures of online activity, oral reading fluency assessments, and prior knowledge and topic engagement surveys. Quantitative descriptive and univariate analyses as well as qualitative abductive coding were employed over multiple phases to analyze the data. First, the results suggest that students employed a variety of online reading comprehension strategies in complex and dynamic ways. Among the many strategies revealed, the group of self-regulatory strategies (planning, predicting, monitoring, and evaluating) played a significant role, influencing students' use of all other strategies for locating and generating meaning from science websites. Second, the results also suggested that patterns of strategy use could be examined as unique navigational profiles. Rather than remaining fixed, the navigational profiles of each student altered in response to tasks and research methods. Importantly, all at-risk readers revealed more effective navigational profiles on Day 3 when they were forced by design of the task to attend to project goals and employ more self-regulatory strategies. Third, the results revealed that traditional reading comprehension strategies and prior knowledge of the rainforest also influenced online reading comprehension. Specifically, the at-risk readers with the lowest reading comprehension, oral reading fluency, and prior knowledge scores were more likely than the average-achieving readers to encounter issues in online texts that resulted in constructing ineffective traversals, or online reading paths, and spending significant time investing in online reading that was irrelevant to the research project. Ultimately, this study advanced the understanding about online reading comprehension for average-achieving and at-risk readers in science classrooms, contributing to a gap in the research, suggesting implications for practice, and promoting future research questions.

This study aimed to understand how changes from paper to electronic textbooks have affected the academic reading task, investigate student users’ perceptions of in-app components and screen sizes, and identify issues affecting in-app components and task requirements. A mixed factorial design experiment was employed. Results showed that there were no significant changes in comprehension and time spent reading between print text and the iPad. Yet, student highlighting, notetaking, and reading behavior and perception significantly changed based on condition. In addition, students struggled to use in-app components and found them frustrating especially when accounting for sentence splitting. The findings presented can assist in understanding the changes in student reading behavior, which can be used to improve interface design of future e-textbooks.

Overall, results suggest that medium plays an influential role under certain text or task conditions or for certain readers. Additional goals were to identify how researchers defined and measured comprehension, and the various trends that have emerged over the past 25 years, since Dillon's review. Analysis showed that relatively few researchers defined either reading or digital reading, and that the majority of studies relied on researcher-developed measures. Three types of trends were identified in this body of work: incremental (significant increase; e.g., number of studies conducted, variety of digital devices used), stationary (relative stability; e.g., research setting, chose of participants), and iterative (wide fluctuation; e.g., text length, text manipulations). The review concludes by considering the significance of these findings for future empirical research on reading in print or digital mediums.",Definitions; Educational Practices; educational technology; Electronic Learning; Evaluation Methods; Intermode Differences; Literature Reviews; Participant Characteristics; Printed Materials; reading comprehension; Reading strategies; Trend Analysis,"Singer, Lauren M.; Alexander, Patricia A.",2017.0,,0,285

Study inclusion criteria 1d use of randomized or matched control groups, a study duration of at least 12 weeks, valid achievement measures independent of the experimental treatments, and a final assessment at the end of Grade 1 or later. A total of 63 beginning reading (starting in Grades K or 1) and 79 upper elementary (Grades 2 through 5) reading studies met these criteria. The review concludes that instructional process programs designed to change daily teaching practices have substantially greater research support than programs that focus on curriculum or technology alone.

287,Effective Programs for Struggling Readers: A Best-Evidence Synthesis,"This article reviews research on the achievement outcomes of alternative approaches for struggling readers in grades K-5: One-to-one tutoring, small group tutorials, classroom instructional process approaches, and computer-assisted instruction. Study inclusion criteria 1d use of randomized or well-matched control groups, study duration of at least 12 weeks, and use of valid measures independent of treatments. A total of 96 studies met these criteria. The review concludes that one-to-one tutoring is very effective in improving reading performance. Tutoring models that focus on phonics obtain much better outcomes than others. Teachers are more effective than paraprofessionals and volunteers as tutors. Small-group, phonetic tutorials can be effective, but are not as effective as one-to-one phonetically-focused tutoring. Classroom instructional process programs, especially cooperative learning, can have very positive effects for struggling readers. Computer-assisted instruction generally had few effects on reading.

288,Identifying What Works for Struggling Readers. Educator's Guide,"This guide summarizes ""Effective Programs for Struggling Readers: A Best Evidence Synthesis,"" a research review conducted by Johns Hopkins University's Center for Research and Reform in Education. The purpose of the review was to evaluate the achievement outcomes of alternative approaches for struggling readers in grade K-5: (1) one-to-one tutoring; (2) small group tutorials; (3) classroom instructional process approaches; and (4) instructional technology. Study inclusion criteria for the review 1d the use of randomized or well-matched control groups, study duration of at least 12 weeks, and the use of valid measures independent of treatments. A total of 96 studies met these criteria. The key findings of the review were as follows: (1) One-to-one tutoring works. Teachers are more effective as tutors than teaching assistants or volunteers, and an emphasis on phonics greatly improves tutoring outcomes; (2) Although one-to-one phonetic tutoring for first graders is highly effective, effects last into the upper elementary grades only if classroom interventions continue beyond this initial period; (3) Small group tutorials can be effective, but are not as effective as one-to-one instruction by teachers or paraprofessionals; (4) Classroom instructional process approaches, especially cooperative learning and structured phonetic models, have strong effects for low achievers (as well as other students); and (5) Traditional instructional technology programs have little impact on reading. Taken together, the key findings of the review support a strong focus on improving classroom instruction followed by targeted, phonetic tutoring for students who continue to experience difficulties.

289,What the Discourse Tells Us: Talk and Indicators of High-Level Comprehension,"The purpose of this study was to validate and extend the findings of an exhaustive literature search in Year 1 and a meta-analysis in Year 2 of a 3-year project in which nine (9) small-group discussion approaches were identified. Having identified parameters of discussion that were, to a greater or lesser extent, present in these nine discussion approaches, our goal in the study being reported in this paper, was to evaluate the nine discussion approaches on a common set of discourse features known to characterize ""quality"" discussions. Although there is overlap among some studies in the nature of the measures used, the extant literature does not afford a uniform basis on which to evaluate student talk as an indicator of student understanding and critical thinking. In the present study, we identified features of classroom discourse that might serve as proximal indices of students' learning and comprehension and we employed each of these proximal indices in analyzing and evaluating the discourse samples solicited from the proponents of the discussion approaches. Two research questions guided this study: (1) Which discourse features (established in existing research) can productively serve across all nine discussion approaches as proximal indices of high-level learning and comprehension of text? (2) To what extent does an analysis of the discourse of representative transcripts from each of the nine discussion approaches validate and extend our understanding of quality group discussions? Our procedure entailed the solicitation of four typical, complete discussions from the proponents of nine identified discussion approaches, providing us with a total of 36 transcripts. Our goal was to identify indices for which there was good theoretical warrant and evidence drawn from empirical research that link these to high-level thinking and comprehension. Our coding scheme focuses on the quality of teacher and student questions [Nystrand, M., Gamoran, A., Kachur, R., & Prendergast, C. (1997). ""Opening dialogue: Understanding the dynamics of language and learning in the English classroom."" New York: Teachers College Press; Nystrand, M., Wu, A., Gamoran, A., Zeiser, S., & Long, D. A. (2003). ""Questions in time: Investigating the structure and dynamics of unfolding classroom discourse."" ""Discourse Processes,"" 35(3), 135-198], the presence of elaborated explanations [Webb, N. M. (1991). ""Task-related verbal interaction and mathematics learning in small groups."" ""Journal for Research in Mathematics Education,"" 22, 366-389], the presence of ""key"" or reasoning words [Wegerif, R., & Mercer, N. (1997). ""Using computer-based text analysis to integrate qualitative and quantitative methods in research on collaborative learning."" ""Language and Education,"" 11(4), 271-286; Wegerif, R., Mercer, N., & Dawes, L. (1999). ""From social interaction to individual: An empirical investigation of a possible socio-cultural model of cognitive development."" ""Learning and Instruction,"" 9, 493-516] and the presence of exploratory talk [Mercer, N. (1995). ""The guided construction of knowledge: Talk amongst teachers and learners."" Clevedon, England: Multilingual Matters; Mercer, N. (2000). ""Words and minds: How we use language to think together."" London: Routledge]. The data indicate that the most productive discussions (whether peer or teacher-led) are structured, focused, occur when students hold the floor for extended periods of time, when students are prompted to discuss texts through open-ended or authentic questions, and when discussion incorporates a high degree of uptake. Results also indicate that authentic questions give rise to longer incidences of student talk, which in most cases result in opportunities for greater elaboration of utterances by students, and which in turn, generate reasoning and high-level thinking. Our results also support the view that affective connections between readers and text appear to play a role in generating discourse that elicits high-level comprehension and critical-analytic responses in text-based discussions. Indeed, the richest reasoning appears to occur in the critical-analytic rather than in the expressive discussion approaches. Our analysis of discourse, then, suggests that authentic question, uptake, the density of reasoning words, and elaborated explanations may indeed be useful measures of productive discussions despite the highly situated nature of small group discussions.

290,Strategies to Help University Students Avoid Plagiarism: A Focus on Translation as an Intervention Strategy,"The importance of plagiarism in an academic setting cannot be overlooked. Creating an awareness of plagiarism avoidance amongst students may be achievable and teaching students certain skills to avoid plagiarism, like paraphrasing, may also be possible. Although paraphrasing is one of the most important skills for avoiding plagiarism, it is a real challenge, particularly for English second language students. Difficulties in paraphrasing arise from lack of English language proficiency and academic writing skills, as well as low reading comprehension. Writing centres were established at a number of universities in South Africa to help students develop their academic skills through appropriate interventions. Nevertheless, additional intervention strategies need to be implemented to help them avoid plagiarism. One such intervention, in the form of translation, was investigated at a rural university campus to test whether translation would reduce plagiarism amongst first-year students. A quantitative research approach was used to collect and analyse the data. Plagiarism in students' work was detected using manual evaluations and the Turnitin[TM] application. An intervention was carried out to develop students' skills in paraphrasing and inform them about plagiarism.

291,Computer assisted instruction to promote comprehension strategies in students with learning disabilities,"The purpose of this study was to investigate if comprehension strategy instruction, specifically story grammar (such as plot, character, setting, and theme), conducted through the use of a computer could improve the reading comprehension of students with learning disabilities. The population 1d nine students with learning disabilities in the ninth grade, who scored between the third and fifth grade equivalents on the Gates-MacGinitie reading comprehension test. Students were assigned to one of three groups for the single-subject, multiple-baseline design. These three groups met in the computer lab during their assigned reading class time. A highly qualified graduate student majoring in education provided instruction throughout the intervention with the researcher overseeing the intervention and assuring fidelity of the intervention across groups. After the initial screening phase where reading level was established, students participated in a baseline phase which 1d students working on a computer and viewing a vocabulary page, reading a short story, and answering multiple-choice questions. The intervention phase consisted of modules which 1 viewing vocabulary, reading a short story, instruction on story grammar, completing a story map, and answering multiple-choice questions. At the end of the intervention, the students took the second form of the Gates-MacGinitie and were given a short survey consisting of Likert-type questions and open-ended questions regarding the ease of use and their perceptions about learning the reading strategy. A week after the intervention during the maintenance phase, three students, one from each group, will be randomly selected to repeat the baseline phase for five additional sessions. Students made little progress in the area of reading comprehension by participating in the intervention. Students did not show growth on their daily comprehension quizzes after the introduction of the intervention. Four of the six students in the intervention groups made progress on the standardized test, though this was confounded by all of the students in the baseline group also making progress. Students perceived the exercises on the computer positively. The findings suggest that working with students on the computer has a lot of potential, but needs to incorporate much more extensive teacher instruction.

292,Are prompts provided by electronic books as effective for teaching preschoolers a biological concept as those provided by adults?,"Research Findings: Prior research indicates that shared book reading is an effective method for teaching biological concepts to young children. Adult questioning during reading enhances children’s comprehension. We investigated whether adult prompting during the reading of an electronic book enhanced children’s understanding of a biological concept. Ninety-one 4-year-olds read about camouflage in 3 conditions. We varied how prompts were provided: (a) read by the book, (b) read by a researcher, or (c) given face to face by the researcher. There was an interaction between children’s initial vocabulary level and condition. Children with low vocabulary scores gave fewer camouflage responses than their high-vocabulary peers, and this effect was particularly pronounced in the book-read condition. Children’s executive function was also measured and discussed. Practice or Policy: Our findings indicate that under some circumstances electronic prompts built into touchscreen books can be as effective at supporting conceptual development as the same prompts provided by a coreading adult. However, children with low vocabulary skills may be particularly supported by adult-led prompting. We suggest that adult prompting be used to motivate children to test and revise their own biological theories. Once children have learned strategies for updating their concepts, electronic prompting may be useful for scaffolding children’s transition to using the strategies when reading alone.

293,How Does Mozart's Music Affect Children's Reading? The Evidence from Learning Anxiety and Reading Rates with E-Books,"Some music has been proved effectively to mitigate anxiety, beneficial to reading. However, little was known on its influence of reading behaviors and outcomes. Thanks to the advance of e-book technology, it becomes possible to track reading rate and outcomes in a real-time manner by the underlying mobile devices. This study intends to examine the effects of the Mozart piece K.448 (sonata for two pianos in D major) on the learning anxiety, reading rates and reading comprehension of students for reading e-books. The quasi-experimental design was applied, and 62 senior grade elementary school students participated in this experiment. The results showed that when compared with a silent task (reading without the music), this piece of Mozart's music had positive effect in reducing learning anxiety, and improving the students' reading rates, reading comprehension and direct process performance. However, we found that the music had a negative effect on the students' attention for their interpretation process. We inferred that this Mozart's music might take part of attention resource. This was supported by the increase of students' extraneous load while listening to Mozart music, which led to the insufficient concentration in the interpretation and the evaluation of content. Overall, the findings reveal that the use of certain music, such as Mozart K.488, can be a potential tool to enhance reading outcomes when using e-books.",Anxiety; attention; Classical Music; Cognitive Processes; Difficulty Level; Electronic Publishing; Elementary School Students; Foreign Countries; Hypothesis Testing; Quasiexperimental Design; Questionnaires; Reading; reading comprehension; Reading Rate; Reading strategies; Reading Tests; Taiwan; Teaching Methods,"Su, Yen-Ning; Kao, Chih-Chien; Hsu, Chia-Cheng; Pan, Lu-Chun; Cheng, Shu-Chen; Huang, Yueh-Min",2017.0,,0,293
294,Nonlinear growth curve modeling using penalized spline models: A gentle introduction,"This didactic article aims to provide a gentle introduction to penalized splines as a way of estimating nonlinear growth curves in which many observations are collected over time on a single or multiple individuals. We begin by presenting piecewise linear models in which the time domain of the data is divided into consecutive phases and a separate linear regression line is fitted in each phase. Linear splines add the feature that the regression lines fitted in adjacent phases are always joined at the boundary so there is no discontinuity in level between phases. Splines are highly flexible raising the fundamental tradeoff between model fit and smoothness of the curve. Penalized spline models address this tradeoff by introducing a penalty term to achieve balance between fit and smoothness. The linear mixed-effects model, familiar from multilevel analysis, is introduced as a method for estimating penalized spline models. Higher order spline models using quadratic or cubic functions which further enhance a smooth fit are introduced. Technical issues in estimation, hypothesis testing, and constructing confidence intervals for higher order penalized spline models are considered. We then use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study to illustrate each step in fitting a higher order penalized spline model, and to illustrate hypothesis testing, the construction of confidence intervals, and the comparison of the functions in 2 groups (boys and girls). Extensive graphical illustrations are provided throughout. Annotated computer scripts using the R package nlme are provided in online supplemental materials.

Translational Abstract—Methods such as daily diaries and technological advances such as wearable monitoring devices make it possible to repeatedly measure people during their daily lives. These advances produce rich longitudinal data sets that offer the possibility of providing a close representation of the trajectory of change over time. Traditional approaches such as regression with polynomial terms (e.g., X2, X3) may not be flexible enough to represent a complex pattern of change over time. Alternatives such as spline models that divide the data into adjacent time segments and fit a different polynomial function in each segment may be too flexible, producing a highly fluctuating trajectory that is too rough. In this didactic presentation we introduce penalized spline models that produce nonlinear trajectories that can balance the 2 goals of having a trajectory that fits complex patterns of change yet maintains a relatively smooth form. We show step-by-step the procedure of fitting penalized splines to represent the growth trajectory of a single individual or the mean trajectory of change in a group of individuals. We show how to perform hypothesis tests, construct confidence intervals, and compare the growth trajectories in 2 groups. We provide extensive graphical illustrations of each step of the procedure using data on the development of reading ability in children from kindergarten through 8th grade. We provide extensive annotated R computer scripts in online supplemental materials permitting researchers to apply these approaches to their own longitudinal data sets.

295,Digital storytelling as a cultural-historical activity: Effects on information text comprehension,"New literacies in reading research demand for the study of comprehension skills using multiple modalities, through a more complex, multi-platform view of reading. Taking into account the robust roll of technology in our daily lives, research suggests that educators need activities to connect students' lack of reading skills with their growing multimodal literacy. During the post-reading phase of a directed reading activity (DRA), students were engaged in digital storytelling, where they created digital videos and slideshows based on information text read during DRA. Previous studies highlighting the use of digital storytelling have been limited to narrative formats and the influence that participation in this activity has on self-esteem and identity. This activity has been widely recommended for improving writing among teachers and in teaching journals, but it has not been empirically studied in the classroom as a comprehension activity. The theoretical framework that supported this study was Vygotsky's Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT). The researcher used the CHAT framework and Burke's Pentad of Analysis (1969) to study the nature of student interactions. Research questions for this study were answered through both quantitative and qualitative methods. The questions being asked by the researcher were: (1) What were the effects of participation in directed reading activity (DRA) modified to 1 digital storytelling in the post-reading phase of DRA on 6th graders' comprehension of information text? (2) Did the interactions observed during participation in directed reading activity modified to 1 digital storytelling reflect the principles promoted by Cultural-Historical Activity Theory? Eighty sixth-grade students were randomly assigned to their digital storytelling groups. The subjects participated in whole-class DRA on two information texts, with the treatment group creating digital stories based on the texts. Cloze scores indicated that there was no significant difference in comprehension due to the treatment. However, there was ample evidence to support the claim that participation in digital storytelling instantiates the principles of CHAT. Overall, digital storytelling does show promise as a multimodal instructional activity, and the discussion expands to several implications and recommendations of future research on this instructional activity.

296,Glossing Frequency and L2 Reading Comprehension: The Influence of CALL Glossing,"This study challenges the assertion that an increase in L1 glossing results in more L2 reading comprehension. The results of this study, a quantitative meta-analysis, indicate that there is a significant difference (p = 0.04) in L2 reading comprehension between groups based on how much L1 glossing is provided. It was found that the group with the highest average effect size--which had all computer-assisted language learning (CALL) studies--1d studies with 50% or more L1 glossing. However, the second largest mean effect size came from a group that contained 5% or less L1 glossing. In looking across groups in this meta-analysis, it was found that of the six studies with the largest effect sizes, five of them were CALL studies. In light of this finding, this paper will discuss the interaction of the variables of CALL glossing and percentage of text glossed in order to determine their possible influence on L2 reading comprehension.",Comparative Analysis; Computer Assisted Instruction; Correlation; educational technology; Effect Size; instructional effectiveness; Learning Strategies; Meta Analysis; Native Language; Notetaking; reading comprehension; Second Language Instruction; Second Language Learning; Statistical Analysis; Teaching Methods,"Taylor, Alan",2014.0,,0,296

They were administered vocabulary and reading comprehension tests, and a questionnaire concerning their attitude toward the task. Results showed rather complex interactions between the variables of sex and ability. Although the differences overall failed to achieve statistical significance, an analysis of the attitude questions separately resulted in several significant interactions for gender.

These three areas were used as the focal points in the study as they are educational qualities that are closely interrelated and mutually reinforcing. The research study was a case study incorporating quantitative and qualitative research methods. The data required were gathered in three phases, with phase one being implemented when the students were in the first semester. The methods applied in this phase for gathering data on the perception of the students were: (i) monitoring logging-in days and times; (ii) initiating online discussion via an online forum and; (iii) administrating online questionnaires. Phase two of the study was implemented at the end of the first semester, after the students finished the course. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather data for this phase. The third phase was implemented when the students were in their final year. This time in-depth interviews were conducted. The data were collected, categorised, analysed and discussed in line with the three focal points of the study. The findings of the three phases of the study revealed that the students perceived this course as contributing highly towards their improvements in reading skills and strategies, contributing moderately towards improving their autonomy as some of them did not desire full autonomy in that they still indicated a preference for a combination of both face-to-face and online modes of learning and contributing highly towards their motivation.

This study analyzes the effectiveness of providing social networking strategies in online book discussion groups on enhancing middle grade student reading engagement and motivation. Additionally, this study reaffirmed that offering students choice of texts fostered more autonomous learning habits. Finally as a result of facilitating these online book discussions, graduate students were able to learn and develop more effective strategies and skills for engaging and motivating middle grade student reading.

This study employed a small‐scale randomized control trial to examine the impact of a researcher‐developed adaptive computer assisted instructional program, Digital Comprehension, on 47 upper elementary struggling readers' comprehension skills, specifically main idea identification. Students were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, with students in the treatment group engaging in the Digital Comprehension program and students in the control group receiving only business‐as‐usual classroom instruction. Students completed measures assessing main idea and general reading comprehension skills at pre‐ and post‐intervention. Students in the treatment group demonstrated statistically significant greater growth in main idea skills than students in the control group. No main effect for the intervention was found for general reading comprehension skills, although there was a significant interaction between condition and student's pretest scores. Results indicate that adaptive CAI may be an effective means for remediating struggling readers' main idea skills.

Specific reading strategy training was first integrated into a Moodle system, which 1d reading exercises on problem identification, monitoring comprehension, inferencing, summarizing, transfer, resourcing, and questioning for clarification. The comparison between pre-test and post-test of the experimental group indicated that students had improved their reading comprehension performance after the experimental course was implemented. No significant difference in student reading comprehension performance was found in the control group. Moreover, the learning records were significantly correlated with the post-test of reading comprehension in the experimental group, indicating the positive effect on learning outcome. A questionnaire was also conducted to investigate the students’ perceived learning progress and strategy use. Before the instruction took place, there was no difference in strategy use observed between the experimental and control groups. After the instruction, students in the experimental group employed significantly more reading strategies than the students in the control group, especially in the categories of metacognitive and cognitive strategies. The results demonstrate that Moodle-supported strategy instruction can and will facilitate the EFL students’ overall reading comprehension and strategy use.

304,Promoting Different Reading Comprehension Levels through Online Annotations,"Previous studies have evaluated reading comprehension as the general understanding of reading texts. However, this broad and generic assessment of reading comprehension overlooks the specific aspects and processes that students need to develop. This study adopted Kintsch's Construction-Integration model to tap into reading comprehension at different levels and investigated how English as a foreign language (EFL) students benefit from online annotations to scaffold reading comprehension. Fifty EFL students participated in this study and the data collected 1d (1) the pre- and post-test assessments in reading comprehension levels, (2) the students' online annotations on reading texts, and (3) the discussion transcripts from an online discussion forum. The results from the first two data sources (1 and 2) were the data-sets used to investigate the influence of the annotation types on reading comprehension levels. The third data source was the data-set used to probe into the process of how students benefited from annotation types to reach different levels of reading comprehension. Four types of online annotations were frequently used by the students while reading online, including (1) marking vocabulary, (2) adding Chinese explanatory notes to unknown vocabulary, (3) marking text information, and (4) adding summary notes to each paragraph. Different frequencies of using the four types of online annotations resulted in three different comprehension levels: surface-based, text-based, and situation-based levels. Marking vocabulary and adding Chinese explanatory notes helped scaffold the students' learning to achieve surface comprehension levels to facilitate recognition and meaning of unknown vocabulary. Marking text information and in particular, the adding of summary notes to each paragraph were the core annotations that helped students comprehend the online text in text-based and situation-based levels. EFL teachers can guide students to use online annotations to different extents in order to deepen their reading comprehension.",College Freshmen; Computer Uses in Education; Discussion; Documentation; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Notetaking; Pretests Posttests; reading comprehension; Reading Improvement; reading instruction; Scaffolding (Teaching Technique); Second Language Instruction; Taiwan; Test of English for International Communication; Vocabulary,"Tseng, Sheng-Shiang; Yeh, Hui-Chin; Yang, Shih-hsien",2015.0,,0,304
305,Test-Taking Strategies and Students' Achievement in EFL Reading Tests,"This research aims at investigating the effects of reading test-taking strategy training on EFL students' performance in English reading tests. The participants of the research were 90 prep-class students chosen randomly and divided into three groups of 30 students as face-to-face training group, online self-training group, and control group. The first group was involved in strategy training sessions for six weeks in school context (face-to-face) whereas the second group was only informed about the contend of the training sessions and directed to study through online strategy videos (online self-training). The last group was the control group the who were 0d from strategy training sessions. The reading test scores of the participants were analyzed via SPSS 16 with the aim of revealing whether or not there is an impact of strategy training. Moreover, semi-structured interviews were carried out with the participants, and the findings were analyzed through content analysis. Results of the research revealed that (a) the students' awareness of test taking strategies are in parallel with their test scores; (b) face-to-face strategy training was found to be more effective than online strategy training; (c) strategies related to 'drawing inference' and 'guessing the meaning from the context' were found to be the most effective ones while strategies such as detecting the question types, finding the main idea, skimming and scanning were other important strategies. The results suggested that strategy training on test taking might be 1d in the regular curriculums; students' awareness of test taking strategies should be fostered starting from the early stages of formal education; reading theories and strategies might be integrated into current reading courses with an inter-disciplinary model.",College Students; Electronic Learning; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Independent Study; instructional effectiveness; Reading Achievement; Reading Tests; Second Language Learning; Student Attitudes; Test Coaching; Test Wiseness; Turkey,"Tunaz, Mehmet; Tüm, Gülden",2019.0,,0,305
306,Effects of interactive versus simultaneous display of multimedia glosses on L2 reading comprehension and incidental vocabulary learning,"This study examines the effects of interactive versus simultaneous display of visual and verbal multimedia information on incidental vocabulary learning and reading comprehension of learners of English with lower proficiency levels. In the interactive display condition, learners were allowed to select the type of multimedia information whereas the simultaneous display condition presented the verbal (definitions) and visual (associated pictures) information in a single gloss. Eighty-two students were randomly assigned to the treatment conditions and were asked to read an annotated expository text. Reading comprehension was measured through a recall protocol and a multiple-choice test. Incidental vocabulary learning was measured through unannounced vocabulary tests of form recognition, meaning production, definition match, and bilingual synonym match. T-tests and ANOVA analyses indicated that the participants utilized glosses less frequently when they were given the control over access to the type of multimedia information. In addition, simultaneous display of multimedia information led to better performance on reading and vocabulary tests. The results are in line with the contiguity principle of Generative Theory of Multimedia Learning, which posits that presenting verbal and visual information simultaneously reduces cognitive load and results in better learning. The findings have implications for both the development of multimedia materials for L2 learners and training of learners to interact with multimedia materials.

308,Opening the black box: User-log analyses of children’s e-book reading and associations with word knowledge,"AbstractThird to fifth graders read an interactive choose-your-own adventure e-Book. User logs recorded their reading behaviors and were used to investigate students’ in-the-moment reading behaviors. Reader’s standards of coherence, motivation, and reading strategies were hypothesized to relate to children’s reading behaviors, such as time reading pages, answering embedded questions correctly, and making thoughtful decisions, and in turn to word knowledge gains. Structural equation models revealed that the more time students spent reading embedded questions, the more likely they were to answer the questions correctly, which in turn strongly predicted gains in word knowledge. The more time students spent reading text pages, the more likely they were to make good decisions. Additionally, student participation in a weekly book club, randomly assigned within classrooms, predicted stronger gains in word knowledge. Findings highlight the potential of e-Books to improve word knowledge, and that student user-logs offer another way to study reading comprehension in-the-moment.

309,"Effects of gloss type, gloss position, and working memory capacity on second language comprehension in electronic reading","This study explores the role of glosses and working memory capacity (WM) in second language (L2) learners’ recall and comprehension in electronic reading. Glosses were investigated in terms of the type of information they provided (lexical versus topic-level) and their location on the screen (pop-up window versus separate window). One hundred-twenty highly proficient participants were classified into high- and low-WM groups and were assigned to one of the four treatment conditions, namely pop-up window topic-level glosses, separate window topic-level glosses, pop-up window lexical glosses, separate window lexical glosses. The participants were asked to read an electronic text while a built-in tracking software recorded their interactions. After reading, the participants were given a free recall task and a multiple choice comprehension test. Findings showed that the effects of gloss content depended on the type of task used to gauge comprehension while the effect of gloss location was less clear-cut. Additionally, WM capacity played a major role in comprehension. Probing into the participants’ use of annotations revealed that lexical glosses led to longer reading times and pop-up conditions triggered more frequent look-up behavior.

310,Building E-Based Literacy for Vocational Education and Training Students,"The use of the Internet within educational settings means that the term ""literacy"" must be broadened to encompass new skills and reflect the merging of old and new literacy. For practitioners the challenge lies in making new media meaningful and empowering for students. Whilst interacting with hypertext has received much attention over the last two decades, little research has focused on comprehending in the hypertext context. This study investigated and compared the effectiveness of metacognitive reading comprehension strategies training on students' comprehension when reading hypertexts with linear structure containing text, picture or audio links. It was predicted that training students to monitor their comprehension would result in enhanced reading comprehension for a hypertext. In order to verify the hypothesis for the study, pretest, three training sessions and post-tests were conducted with the first year Diploma students studying within the Department of Horticulture and Environmental Science. The results indicated that training to apply metacognitive strategies enhanced comprehension in the hypertext context.

311,The Targeted Reading Intervention: A Classroom Teacher Professional Development Program to Promote Effective Teaching for Struggling Readers in Kindergarten and First Grade,"The main objective of the overall Targeted Reading Intervention (TRI) was to help the classroom teacher acquire the key reading diagnostic strategies (e.g., Cooter, 2003; Desimone, 2009; Garet et al., 2001; Timperley & Phillips, 2003) relevant to K-1 struggling readers (e.g., Desimone, 2009; Garet et al., 2001; Guskey, 2002; Joyce & Showers, 2002; Penuel et al., 2007; Taylor, Pressley & Pearson, 2004) through the authors' professional development program. In the present study the authors employed an innovative distance technology model to deliver professional development and real-time collaborative coaching to isolated rural schools. Each experimental classroom received a laptop, webcam, and webconferencing software. This technology was used with each experimental teacher so that the authors could see and hear her working with each of her struggling readers in real time and she could see and hear the literacy consultants at their university thousands of miles away. Through this technology the literacy consultants could coach the classroom teacher in using the TRI strategies and also use the technology of grade level meetings and workshops throughout the year. Findings of this study suggests that the Targeted Reading Intervention, using webcam technology with classroom teachers in kindergarten and first grade, can significantly help struggling readers progress more quickly in all of the basic word reading and comprehension skills over one year. In addition, for the basic word reading skills, the TRI can actually help struggling readers catch up with their non-struggling peers in the same classroom by the end of the school year. Future work is needed to understand what actual teacher knowledge and practice constructs that might mediate the relationship between treatment and student outcomes.

312,Beyond CTT and IRT: Using an interactional measurement model to investigate the decision making process of ept essay raters,"The current study as a doctorate dissertation investigates the gap between the nature of ESL performance tests and score-based analysis tools used in the field of language testing. The purpose of this study is hence to propose a new testing model and a new experiment instrument to examine test validity and reliability through rater’s decision making process in an ESL writing performance test. A writing test as a language performance assessment is a multifaceted entity that involves the interaction of various stakeholders, among whom essay raters have a great impact on essay scores due to their subjective scoring decision, hence influencing the test validity and reliability (Huot, 1990; Lumley, 2002). This understanding puts forward the demand on the development and facilitation of methodological tools to quantify rater decision making process and the interaction between rater and other stakeholders in a language test. Previous studies within the framework of Classic Testing Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT) mainly focus on the final outcome of rating or the retrospective survey data and/or rater’s think-aloud protocols. Due to the limitation of experimental tools, very few studies, if any, have directly examined the moment-to-moment process about how essay raters reach their scoring decisions and the interaction per se. The present study proposes a behavioral model for writing performance tests, which investigates raters’ scoring behavior and their reading comprehension as combined with the final essay score. Though the focus of this study is writing assessment, the current research methodology is applicable to the field of performance-based testing in general. The present framework considers the process of a language test as the interaction between test developer, test taker, test rater and other test stakeholders. In the current study focusing on writing performance test, the interaction between test developer and test taker is realized directly through test prompt and indirectly through test score; on the other hand, the interaction between test taker and test rater is reflected in the writing response. This model defines and explores rater reliability and test validity via the interaction between text (essays written by test-takers) and essay rater. Instead of indirectly approaching the success of such an interaction through the final score, this new testing model directly measures and examines the success of rater behaviors with regard to their essay reading and score decision making. Bearing the 'interactional' nature of a performance test, this new model is named as the Interactional Testing Model (ITM). In order to examine the online evidence of rater decision making, a computer-based interface was designed for this study to automatically collect the time-by-location information of raters’ reading patterns, their text comprehension and other scoring events. Three groups of variables representing essay features and raters’ dynamic scoring process were measured by the rating interface: 1) Reading pattern. Related variables 1 raters’ reading rate, raters’ go-back rate within and across paragraphs, and the time-by-location information of raters’ sentence selection. 2) Raters’ reading comprehension and scoring behaviors. Variables 1 the time-by-location information of raters’ verbatim annotation, the time-by-location information of raters’ comments, essay score assignment, and their answers to survey questions. 3) Essay features.

313,Reading strategies and cognitive skills in children with cochlear implants,"Background: The present study investigated working memory capacity, lexical access, phonological skills and reading ability in 6 children with cochlear implants (CI), attending grades 1-3. For each test measure, the individual performance of the children was compared to a grade-matched comparison group of children with normal hearing. Performance was also studied in relation to demographic factors. Material/ Methods: Cognitive skills were assessed in a computer-based test battery. Different aspects of each of the component skills were tapped in various subtests. Reading comprehension was measured by the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test and decoding was assessed in the Test of Word Reading (TOWRE). The children were also tested on orthographic learning. Results: These children with CI have specific difficulties in tasks of phonological skills and phonological working memory (WM) where nonwords are used as test stimuli. They do not seem to have problems with phonological processing of words for which they have a well defined phonological representation. They also experienced relatively more difficulties in tasks on lexical access without any contextual information. Conclusions: We suggest that children with CI are particularly efficient in using compensatory strategies in situations where their auditory perception does not provide sufficient information to correctly match the incoming speech signal to a corresponding representation in long-term phonological storage. The children with CI in this study were skilled readers, both for decoding of words and nonwords and for reading comprehension. They may use both orthographic and phonological reading strategies, although most of them seem to be dependent on phonological decoding to some extent.

314,Fast ForWord[R]. What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report,"""Fast ForWord""[R] is a computer-based reading program intended to help students develop and strengthen the cognitive skills necessary for successful reading and learning. The program, which is designed to be used 30-100 minutes a day, 5 days a week, for 4-16 weeks, 1s three series. The ""Fast ForWord[R] Language"" series and the ""Fast ForWord[R] Literacy"" series aim to build cognitive skills such as memory, attention, processing, and sequencing. They also strive to build language and reading skills, including listening accuracy, phonological awareness, and knowledge of language structures. The ""Fast ForWord[R] to Reading"" series (also known as the ""Fast ForWord[R] Reading"" series) aims to increase processing efficiency and further improve reading skills such as sound-letter associations, phonological awareness, word recognition, knowledge of English language conventions, vocabulary, and comprehension. The program is designed to adapt the nature and difficulty of the content based on individual student's responses. The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) identified 342 studies that investigated the effects of ""Fast ForWord""[R] on the reading skills of beginning readers. The WWC reviewed 25 of those studies against group design evidence standards. Seven studies (Borman, Benson, & Overman, 2009; Scientific Learning Corporation, 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2005c, 2006, 2007) are randomized controlled trials that meet WWC evidence standards without reservations, and two studies (Overbay & Baenen, 2003; Scientific Learning Corporation, 2008) are quasi-experimental designs that meet WWC evidence standards with reservations.

315,Read Naturally [R]. What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report. Updated,"The ""Read Naturally[R]"" program is a supplemental reading program that aims to improve reading fluency, accuracy, and comprehension of elementary and middle school students using a combination of texts, audio CDs, and computer software. The program uses one of four products that share a common fluency-building strategy: ""Read Naturally[R] Masters Edition,"" ""Read Naturally[R] Encore,"" ""Read Naturally[R] Software Edition,"" and ""Read Naturally[R] Live."" The common strategy 1s: modeling of story reading, repeated reading of text for developing oral reading fluency, and systematic monitoring of student progress by teachers and the students themselves. Students work at their reading level, progress through the program at their own rate, and work (for the most part) on an independent basis. The program can be delivered in three ways: (1) students use audio CDs with hard-copy reading materials (""Read Naturally[R] Masters,"" ""Read Naturally[R] Encore""), (2) students use the computer-based version (""Read Naturally[R] Software Edition""), or (3) students use the web-based version (""Read Naturally[R] Live""). This intervention report 1s studies of ""Read Naturally[R] Masters Edition"" and ""Read Naturally[R] Software Edition."" The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) identified five studies of ""Read Naturally[R]"" that both fall within the scope of the Beginning Reading topic area and meet WWC evidence standards. Four studies meet standards without reservations, and one study meets WWC evidence standards with reservations. Together, these studies 1d 484 beginning readers in grades 2-4 in more than 14 locations. The WWC considers the extent of evidence for ""Read Naturally[R]"" on the reading skills of beginning readers to be small for two outcome domains--alphabetic s and general reading achievement--and medium to large for two outcome domains--comprehension and reading fluency. (See the Effectiveness Summary on p. 5 for further description of all domains.) ""Read Naturally[R]"" was found to have no discernible effects on alphabetics and comprehension, mixed effects on reading fluency, and potentially positive effects on general reading achievement for beginning readers. The WWC identified 58 studies that investigated the effects of ""Read Naturally[R]"" on the reading skills of beginning readers. The WWC reviewed 11 of those studies against group design evidence standards. Four studies (Arvans, 2010; Christ & Davie, 2009; Hancock, 2002; Kemp, 2006) are randomized controlled trials that meet WWC evidence standards without reservations, and one study (Heistad, 2008) is a quasi-experimental design that meets WWC evidence standards with reservations. Those five studies are summarized in this report. Six studies do not meet WWC evidence standards. The remaining 47 studies do not meet WWC eligibility screens for review in this topic area. Citations for all 58 studies are provided in the References section. A summary of studies meeting WWC evidence standards without reservation are as follows. (1) Arvans (2010) conducted a randomized controlled trial of second- through fourth-grade students from one Midwestern elementary school. Students were randomly assigned to intervention and comparison groups using block randomization procedures. Students were paired based on pretest scores, grade, race, and gender, and then randomly assigned to either the ""Read Naturally[R]"" group or the comparison group. Students in the comparison group received their classroom's normal reading instruction. The final analysis sample consisted of 82 students. (2) Christ and Davie (2009) randomly assigned 109 third-grade students from six schools in four Midwestern school districts to either a ""Read Naturally[R]"" group or a comparison group. Students were deemed eligible for the study if they scored at or below the 40th percentile on measures of oral reading fluency and reading comprehension. Students in the comparison group received their classroom's normal reading instruction, with no supplemental fluency instruction. The analysis sample consisted of 106 students. (3) Hancock (2002) conducted a randomized controlled trial of second-grade students in five classrooms from one school in Arizona. Students were randomly assigned to intervention and comparison groups using block randomization procedures. Students were pretested, matched with a similarly-performing peer in their classroom, and then randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the comparison group. Forty-eight students were in the ""Read Naturally[R]"" group, and 46 students were in the comparison group, which received a supplemental mathematics intervention. (4) Kemp (2006) conducted a randomized controlled trial of third-grade students in three schools in a school district in Orange County, California. From 13 study classrooms, an initial sample of 168 students was randomly assigned to intervention and comparison groups using block randomization procedures. Within each classroom, students were assigned to pairs based on their scores from the reading portion of the California Standards Test from the previous spring. One member from each pair was randomly assigned to the intervention group, and the other member was randomly assigned to the comparison group. Comparison students participated in structured sustained silent reading; these reading sessions occurred concurrently with sessions of ""Read Naturally[R]."" The final analysis sample consisted of 158 students. A summary of one study meeting WWC evidence standards with reservations is as follows. Heisted (2008) examined the effects of ""Read Naturally[R]"" on the reading achievement of third-grade students who were enrolled in elementary schools in the Minneapolis Public School District. Students in three ""Read Naturally[R]"" elementary schools that were implementing ""Read Naturally[R]"" were matched with comparison students from other schools in the same district based on pretest score, grade, demographic variables, and the Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) status of their school. ""Read Naturally[R]"" was implemented as a supplemental reading intervention with individual and small groups of students. Two schools implemented ""Read Naturally[R]"" as a pull-out intervention during the school day, while one school used it as part of an after-school program. Students in the comparison group attended schools that were not implementing ""Read Naturally[R].""

316,Read Naturally. Revised. What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report,"""Read Naturally"" is designed to improve reading fluency using a combination of books, audio-tapes, and computer software. This program 1s three main strategies: repeated reading of English text for oral reading fluency development, teacher modeling of story reading, and systematic monitoring of student progress by teachers. Students work at a reading level appropriate for their achievement level, progress through the program at their own rate, and work, for the most part, on an independent basis. The ""Read Naturally"" strategy is designed to increase time spent reading by combining teacher modeling, repeated reading, and progress monitoring. Although the program was not originally developed for English language learners (ELL), materials for these students are now available. One study of a modified version of ""Read Naturally"" met the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards with reservations. This study 1d 60 ELL elementary school students from five schools in central Texas and examined effects on students' reading achievement. No studies that met WWC standards with or without reservations addressed mathematics achievement or English language development.

The analysis 1d 1,875 to 2,371 fourth-grade students from 100 to 117 classrooms in Pennsylvania elementary schools (sample sizes varied across outcome measures). Schools volunteered to participate in the study. Within each school or group of similar schools, researchers randomly assigned 131 classrooms to either participate in ""ITSS"" or serve as the comparison group, which followed the regular school curriculum for language arts. Students in the ""ITSS"" classrooms used the system for one class period a week for 6-7 months as a partial substitute for their regular language arts curriculum (i.e., time spent using ""ITSS"" replaced regular instructional time). This study assessed the effectiveness of ""ITSS"" immediately after the end of the intervention by comparing the reading comprehension of students in the ""ITSS"" classrooms with students in the comparison class-rooms. Reading comprehension was measured with a standardized test (the Gray Silent Reading Test, or GSRT) and five researcher-designed measures on two types of text structures: comparison type texts and problem/solution type texts. The study authors reported, and the WWC confirmed, that ""ITSS"" had a statistically significant positive effect on the reading comprehension of fourth-grade students as measured by the researcher-designed tests. The study authors also reported, and the WWC confirmed, no statistically significant effects of the intervention on the GSRT. The research described in this report meets WWC evidence standards without reservations. The study is a well-implemented randomized controlled trial.

320,Using Literature Circles to Enhance Student Knowledge of Nonfiction Text,"This mixed methods action research study explored how students reacted to using literature circles to enhance their knowledge and understanding of reading nonfiction text as compared to students using guided reading. This study showed a minimal improvement for students participating in the literature circle group in overall understanding of nonfiction text features and text structures at the end of the study. However, there was a substantial amount of growth shown in the literature circle group from the pre-test to the post-test, while there was only minimal growth shown in the guided reading group from the pre-test to the post-test. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of participation in nonfiction literature circles versus guided reading in fourth grade students' ability to comprehend and interpret nonfiction text while also examining the use of metacognition skills used during reading. This study used an online pre- and post-test to determine that fourth-grade students from a rural school in western Pennsylvania read and comprehended nonfiction text better after participation in literature circles, then after participation in guided reading. Students need to understand all aspects of nonfiction texts to answer comprehension questions about the text. For instance, students need to understand the text features and text structures of nonfiction text. Using literature circles to discuss nonfiction text aspects with their peers enabled them to read and understand nonfiction text at their grade level. Students kept journals in each group and journals were coded to determine which metacognition skills were used and how often the skills were used. It was determined that the literature circle group used significantly more metacognitive strategies than the guided reading group. To evaluate the true effectiveness of literature circles and nonfiction comprehension, additional research is necessary as there are several other reading strategies that literature circles can be compared to determine which strategy works best for the understanding of nonfiction text features and text structures. With additional research, student scores on standardized tests may begin to increase once the right teaching/learning method is discovered for comprehension of text features and text structures.

321,Etiology of teacher knowledge and instructional skills for literacy at the upper elementary grades,"The purpose of this research was to study the etiology of teacher knowledge about and factors that influence implementation of evidence-based reading and writing interventions at the upper elementary grade levels. Five data sources are used in this study: first, we used teacher surveys about their pre-service preparation on reading comprehension and literacy practices gathered during a recent cluster randomized control trial on a reading comprehension intervention conducted with 280 fourth and fifth-grade teachers and their classroom students. We also conducted focus group interviews with 43% of the teachers and observed 90% of the teachers once during the implementation years. For writing, we used data collected from 32 teachers during a 3-year design project for a teacher-led computer-supported writing intervention. We also collected data from groups of school administrators using structured interviews during both studies. Finally, we conducted an artifact review of school curricula and posted professional development (PD) plans. Our results show that in both reading comprehension and writing, all teachers reported not receiving sound evidence-based pre-service preparation and they were not currently employing any evidence-based approaches. Most teachers reported using the basal reading series with very little variation from the lesson scope and sequence. Teachers and administrators frequently reported that skills were being taught in isolation (e.g., skill of the week is summarizing) and that writing was neglected. The interviews showed very interesting patterns of curricula decision-making by school administrators and these findings were further confirmed through the artifact reviews. Based on these results, we recommend that any review of teacher practices focus also on administrator decision-making and school level factors that are driving what happens in the classrooms. The review showed that the teachers themselves do not feel empowered to learn and deliver evidence-based literacy practices and feel constrained by the system.

322,Web-based text structure strategy instruction improves seventh graders’ content area reading comprehension,"Reading comprehension in the content areas is a challenge for many middle grade students. Text structure-based instruction has yielded positive outcomes in reading comprehension at all grade levels in small and large studies. The text structure strategy delivered via the web, called Intelligent Tutoring System for the Text Structure Strategy (ITSS), has proven successful in large-scale studies at 4th and 5th grades and a smaller study at 7th grade. Text structure-based instruction focuses on selection and encoding of strategic memory. This strategic memory proves to be an effective springboard for many comprehension-based activities such as summarizing, inferring, elaborating, and applying. This was the first large-scale randomized controlled efficacy study on the web-based delivery of the text structure strategy to 7th-grade students. 108 classrooms from rural and suburban schools were randomly assigned to ITSS or control and pretests and posttests were administered at the beginning and end of the school year. Multilevel data analyses were conducted on standardized and researcher designed measures of reading comprehension. Results showed that ITSS classrooms outperformed the control classrooms on all measures with the highest effects reported for number of ideas 1d in the main idea. Results have practical implications for classroom practices.

323,Improving Content Area Reading Comprehension of Spanish Speaking English Learners in Grades 4 and 5 Using Web-Based Text Structure Instruction,"Reading and comprehending content area texts is important for academic and professional success as well as life skills necessary to maintain good health and quality lifestyle. Spanish speaking English language learners have shown poor performance on high-stakes assessments in reading comprehension. The number of Spanish speaking English learners (ELs) in our schools continues to increase at a fast pace, and therefore it is imperative that we address their reading comprehension needs swiftly and effectively. The text structure strategy has shown positive results on comprehension outcomes in many research studies with students at Grades 2, 4, 5, and 7. This study is the first implementation of instruction about the text structure strategy expressly designed to accommodate the linguistic and comprehension needs of Spanish speaking ELs in Grades 4 and 5. Strategy instruction on the web for English learners (SWELL) was designed to deliver instruction about the text structure strategy to Spanish speaker English learners. A randomized controlled study with pre and post-tests was conducted with 14 classrooms at fourth-grade and 17 classrooms at fifth-grade in high poverty schools where over 85% of students were Spanish speaking bilinguals or ELs. Analysis of data using multi-level models show moderate to large-effects favoring the students in the SWELL classrooms over the business as usual control classrooms on important measures such as a standardized reading comprehension test and main idea and cloze tasks. This research has practical implications for the use of web-based tools to provide high-quality and supportive instruction to improve Spanish speaking ELs reading comprehension skills.",Bilingual Students; Content Area Reading; educational technology; English language learners; Grade 4; Grade 5; instructional effectiveness; reading comprehension; Reading Skills; Reading strategies; Spanish Speaking; Teaching Methods; Technology Uses in Education; Text Structure,"Wijekumar, Kausalai; Meyer, Bonnie J.

324,Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial Examining Intelligent Tutoring of Structure Strategy for Fifth-Grade Readers,"This article reports on a large scale randomized controlled trial to study the efficacy of a web-based intelligent tutoring system for the structure strategy designed to improve content area reading comprehension. The research was conducted with 128 fifth-grade classrooms within 12 school districts in rural and suburban settings. Classrooms within each school were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The intervention group used the intelligent web-based tutoring system for the structure strategy (ITSS) for 30 to 45 min each week as a partial substitute for the language arts curriculum for the entire school year. The structure strategy teaches students how to read and comprehend expository texts by identifying the text structure and creating strategic mental representations of the text. The web-based tutoring system delivered the structure strategy training with modeling, practice tasks, assessment, and feedback. The control classrooms used the school's language arts curriculum for the full language-arts time. Results show that the ITSS delivered structure strategy training improved reading comprehension measured by a standardized test and researcher designed measures.",Content Area Reading; Elementary School Students; Grade 5; Hierarchical Linear Modeling; instructional effectiveness; Intelligent tutoring systems; Pennsylvania; Pretests Posttests; reading comprehension; reading instruction; Reading strategies; Reading Tests; Rural Schools; Standardized Tests; Suburban Schools; Web Based Instruction,"Wijekumar, Kausalai; Meyer, Bonnie J.

325,Supplementing teacher knowledge using web‐based Intelligent Tutoring System for the Text Structure Strategy to improve content area reading comprehension with fourth‐ and fifth‐grade struggling readers,"The effects of teaching the text structure strategy using a web‐based Intelligent Tutoring System for the Text Structure Strategy (ITSS) were examined with fourth‐ and fifth‐grade children scoring below the 25th percentile on comprehension measures using the Gray Silent Reading Test (GSRT) and researcher designed assessment from 130 fourth‐grade and 130 fifth‐grade classrooms. The ITSS was designed to teach students how to select and encode strategic memory from expository texts. The system provides modelling, practice, assessment, scaffolding, and feedback to learners on identifying signalling words, summarizing, making inferences, generating elaborations, and monitoring comprehension. A large scale randomized controlled trial was conducted with 130 fourth‐grade and 130 fifth‐grade classrooms. Students completed GSRT‐ and researcher‐designed measures of reading comprehension at pretest and posttests. An analysis of fourth‐grade students using ITSS who scores less than the 25th percentile on the GSRT pretest showed small but meaningful effect sized on the posttests. The fifth‐grade students in ITSS, who scored less than the 25% percentile on the GSRT pretest, showed the highest effect sizes (moderate to large effects) on the standardized test scores on the posttests.

326,Highlights as an early predictor of student comprehension and interests,"When engaging with a textbook, students are inclined to highlight key content. Although students believe that highlighting and subsequent review of the highlights will further their educational goals, the psychological literature provides little evidence of benefits. Nonetheless, a student’s choice of text for highlighting may serve as a window into her mental state—her level of comprehension, grasp of the key ideas, reading goals, and so on. We explore this hypothesis via an experiment in which 400 participants read three sections from a college‐level biology text, briefly reviewed the text, and then took a quiz on the material. During initial reading, participants were able to highlight words, phrases, and sentences, and these highlights were displayed along with the complete text during the subsequent review. Consistent with past research, the amount of highlighted material is unrelated to quiz performance. Nonetheless, highlighting patterns may allow us to infer reader comprehension and interests. Using multiple representations of the highlighting patterns, we built probabilistic models to predict quiz performance and matrix factorization models to predict what content would be highlighted in one passage from highlights in other passages. We find that quiz score prediction accuracy reliably improves with the inclusion of highlighting data (by about 1%–2%), both for held‐out students and for held‐out student questions (i.e., questions selected randomly for each student), but not for held‐out questions. Furthermore, an individual’s highlighting pattern is informative of what she highlights elsewhere. Our long‐term goal is to design digital textbooks that serve not only as conduits of information into the reader’s mind but also allow us to draw inferences about the reader at a point where interventions may increase the effectiveness of the material.

327,Can Textbook Annotations Serve as an Early Predictor of Student Learning?,"When engaging with a textbook, students are inclined to highlight key content. Although students believe that highlighting and subsequent review of the highlights will further their educational goals, the psychological literature provides no evidence of benefits. Nonetheless, a student's choice of text for highlighting may serve as a window into their mental state--their level of comprehension, grasp of the key ideas, reading goals, etc. We explore this hypothesis via an experiment in which 198 participants read sections from a college-level biology text, briefly reviewed the text, and then took a quiz on the material. During initial reading, participants were able to highlight words, phrases, and sentences, and these highlights were displayed along with the complete text during the subsequent review. Consistent with past research, the amount of highlighted material is unrelated to quiz performance. However, our main goal is to examine highlighting as a data source for inferring student understanding. We explored multiple representations of the highlighting patterns and tested Bayesian linear regression and neural network models, but we found little or no relationship between a student's highlights and quiz performance. Our long-term goal is to design digital textbooks that serve not only as conduits of information into the mind of the reader, but also allow us to draw inferences about the reader at a point where interventions may increase the effectiveness of the material.

328,Tracking Reading Strategy Utilisation through Pupillometry,"Explicit reading strategies help low-knowledge readers make the inferences necessary to comprehend expository texts. Self-explanation is a particularly effective strategy, but it is challenging to monitor how well a reader is applying self-explanation without requiring the reader to externalise the self-explanations being generated. Studies have shown that different reading strategies vary in the amount of cognitive control required as well as the engagement of brain regions involved in internally-directed attention. Pupil diameter is related to task engagement and cognitive control via the brain's locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. Therefore, pupil diameter could be a method to unobtrusively measure a reader's use of self-explanation. The current study assessed whether pupil diameter can be used to distinguish between the use of different reading strategies and whether it is linked to the quality and effectiveness of the strategy in terms of learning gains. Participants reread, paraphrased, and self-explained texts while pupil diameter was recorded, and completed comprehension tests. Average pupil diameter differed between all three reading strategies, and pupil diameter was related to learning gains and the quality of strategy use. The results suggest that pupil diameter could be used to track effective reading strategy utilisation.",Achievement Gains; Brain Hemisphere Functions; Cognitive Processes; Eye Movements; Measurement Techniques; Pennsylvania; Pretests Posttests; Reading Achievement; reading comprehension; Reading Materials; Reading strategies; Reading Tests; Statistical Analysis,"Wong, Aaron Y.; Moss, Jarrod; Schunn, Christian D.",2016.0,,0,328
329,"Beginning Readers' Use of ""Talking Books"" Software can Affect their Reading Strategies","This paper reports on a small-scale study that considered whether a phonic-based talking book could outperform one-to-one reading tuition with an adult with respect to improving beginning readers' phonological awareness over a short period. It also examined whether the children's reading strategies were affected by their use of the software. Two groups of children, one aged five years and one aged six years, used three phonic-based talking books over six 15-minute sessions and were assessed on their phonological awareness and reading strategies both before and after this intervention. Their performance was compared to that of matched comparison groups who were given one-to-one adult tutoring with the paper versions of the same books. There were no significant differences between the two groups in their phonological awareness attainment, with both groups showing equivalent gains from pre- to post-test. Use of specific features of the software was associated with gains in rhyme detection ability and with changes in the children's reading strategies.",Computer Assisted Instruction; computer software; intervention; phonology; Pretests Posttests; Reading Improvement; reading instruction; Reading Skills; Reading strategies; Rhyme,"Wood, Clare",2005.0,,0,329
330,Understanding the nature and impact of young readers’ literacy interactions with talking books and during adult reading support,"This paper reports an extended analysis of the study reported in [Wood, C. (2005). Beginning readers’ use of ‘talking books’ software can affect their reading strategies. Journal of Research in Reading, 28, 170–182.], in which five and six-year-old children received either six sessions using specially designed talking books or six sessions of one-to-one tuition with an adult using the paper-based versions of the same books. This analysis focuses on the nature of the children’s interactions with either the adult or the computer in an attempt to explore how these different resources impacted on the children’s literacy interactions, and whether different styles of literacy interaction observed within each group were associated with gains in phonological awareness or changes in reading strategy. Four styles of literacy interaction were identified and there was a significant association between these styles and membership of one of the two experimental conditions in the study. Interactional style was also seen to impact positively on phonological awareness development for lower ability children who used the talking books. In contrast, interactional style affected changes in reading strategy amongst children in the adult tutor condition. Finally, there was also an influence of interactional style on spontaneous dialogic reading by the children overall, but this effect originated from the children in the adult tutor group.

331,Workshop Training to Facilitate Parent-Child Instructional Opportunities for Reading and Social Development with Kindergarten Students,"This study provided workshops for parents on either early literacy or socio-emotional learning to examine the impact on their children's reading and social skills development (n = 576 parents; n = 584 children). Parents of kindergartners were offered interactive workshops designed to help them identify everyday opportunities to support reading skills or social skills development. Families were randomly assigned by school to workshops on one of three topics: (1) traditional text reading, (2) traditional text reading with computer-assisted learning opportunities, and (3) social-emotional learning. As expected, academic performance improved over time across all conditions. Additional gains were detected on specific language and literacy measures among children in both reading conditions whose parents attended the workshops in comparison to children of parents who did not attend. Gains were observed on academic measures for children in the socio-emotional condition relative to children in the reading conditions. Findings suggest that parental involvement in instructional workshops on early literacy and social development may have significant effects for children's academic success. This study provides evidence for the potential of involving parents in their children's educational interventions as a valuable addition to or alternative to traditional child-directed intervention programs to increase positive outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance parental efficacy.",Achievement Gains; Alphabets; Canada; Computer Assisted Instruction; Conventional Instruction; Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS); educational technology; Emergent literacy; Foreign Countries; Interpersonal Competence; Kindergarten; Literacy Education; Parent Education; Parent Role; phonological awareness; Program Effectiveness; reading comprehension; Reading Skills; Reading strategies; Social Emotional Learning; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; Vocabulary Development; Workshops,"Wood, Katherine R.; Wood, Eileen; Gottardo, Alexandra; Archer, Karin; Savage, Robert; Piquette, Noëlla",2021.0,,0,331
332,Interactive book reading: Promoting emergent literacy skills in preschool children through a parent training program,"This pilot study examined the effects of the Interactive Book Reading at Home (IBR; Wasik, 2009) parent training program on the emergent literacy skills of preschool children and parent beliefs about reading. A quasi-experimental, pretest and posttest design was utilized. Twenty parent-child dyads were randomly assigned to a control or treatment group. Nine treatment group dyads participated in a 10-week program designed to teach parents to use dialogic reading strategies. Eleven control group dyads engaged in reading as usual. All dyads were provided with developmentally appropriate books and were asked to engage in 15-minute dialogic reading sessions three times a week. Outcome measures assessed the alphabet knowledge, print awareness, and receptive and expressive vocabulary of the preschool children, as well as changes in parent reading beliefs. Between-group differences were examined using one-way ANCOVA, with the pretest scores being treated as covariates. Following the treatment period, no statistically significant differences were found between groups on measures of the children's emergent literacy skills or parent reading beliefs following the treatment period. By contrast, practical significance was detected for receptive vocabulary improvements and increased positivity in parent beliefs about reading, suggesting the treatment shows promise for positive change for children and adults who participate in the program. Regarding treatment acceptability, a descriptive analysis suggested that parents reported overall favorable impressions of the program. Further, moderately high participant attendance and low attrition rates within the treatment group provided additional support for treatment acceptability. In sum, the findings in this pilot study support the promise of the IBR at Home as a practical, acceptable parent training program that has the potential to impact literacy outcomes of children. Limitations of the study design and future research directions are also discussed.

333,Chinese EFL learners’ use of online reading strategies,"Based on Afflerbach and Cho's (2009) theoretical model of Constructively Responsive Reading on the Internet (CRRI model), this study aims to explore the patterns of reading strategies that 40 proficient, college-level, Chinese English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners use while reading online. It also seeks to identify the strategies' relations to reading comprehension. This study utilized an exploratory research design. During the study, the participants were required to complete a 30-minute reading task on a pre-selected website, followed by a comprehension assessment with 20 multiple-choice questions. During the reading task, the participants were asked to verbalize their thinking process. Both their verbalization and online actions were recorded by Camtasia. These recordings served as the primary data and then were coded using Afflerbach and Cho's (2009) four strategy categories as the coding scheme. Following this, the coded primary data were analyzed quantitatively. The results first indicated that participants' meaning-making strategy use dominated the whole reading process. Both the self-monitoring and text location strategies served as a supporting role in this reading task; however, the information evaluation strategy was used least often. Additionally, based on the sequential patterns of the participants' strategy use, three different types of readers were identified: uncertain readers, exploratory readers, and strategic readers. Lastly, the examination of the relationship between strategy use, reader types, and comprehension outcome revealed that both the meaning-making and self-monitoring strategies had a strong effect on the comprehension outcome. The results also showed that the comprehension outcome was significantly different among all three reader types. The comprehension outcomes of the strategic readers ranked highest, followed by the exploratory readers and the uncertain readers. This exploratory study not only provides a quantitative assessment of Afflerbach and Cho's (2009) theoretical framework, but also extends our understanding of online reading to a different cultural context. The findings of the study have important implications for both practice and research.

334,The Effect of Four Different Approaches to Parent-Child Reading on Young Chinese Children's Reading,"Forty families with four- to five-year-old Chinese children were chosen as experiment participants and equally divided into four groups for an eight-week parent-child reading experiment in different reading modes. (1) Groups A, B, and C read one of three kinds of Chinese-English audio bilingual picture books respectively: touch reading books, electronic books, and printed books + CDs, 30 minutes per day with their parents in the approach of Early Synchronous Bilingual Reading (ESBR). After the eight-week experiment, children participants cultivated good habits of and interest in reading and their reading comprehension, retelling and expression competence were improved significantly. Performance of each group in weekly reading time and frequency, proportion of recognized Chinese and English words was A>B>C>>D and differed significantly (p<0.01). The results show that reading bilingualism synchronously is effective and economical, and it not only enhanced children's bilingual competence, but broadened their multicultural international horizon and developed their creative thinking and leadership. (2) Group D kept their original family reading mode and did not progress significantly in reading habits and test indicators (p-value=0.5-1). (3) Determinants of reading effect are parents' awareness and choice of reading material, mode, frequency and time.

335,Developing a Reciprocal Teaching/Learning System for College Remedial Reading Instruction,"In face-to-face instruction of ""Reciprocal Teaching (RT)"", students' reading processes and dialogues with their peers are hardly observed. As a result, the teacher has few clues to identify students' learning difficulties and provide further scaffoldings. To record students' reading processes and enhance their comprehension, this study reports on the design of an online reciprocal teaching and learning system to support teachers and students in college remedial reading instruction. A sample of 129 under-prepared college students voluntarily signed up to participate in a remedial reading program. They were encouraged to use multiple strategies such as predicting, clarifying, questioning, and summarizing, which were supported by the functionalities of ""dialogue box"", ""chat room"", ""discussion forum"", and ""annotation tool"" in the system. In this study, it was observed that students employed the multiple strategies to enhance their reading comprehension, as revealed by the students' reading processes recorded in the system. When encountering difficulties in using these multiple strategies, students expressed that they observed and learned from the teacher's or their peers' externalization of strategy usage. Students' reading progress in the remedial instruction incorporating the RT system was also identified by the pre- and post-tests. This study suggests that there may be benefits for teachers in encouraging students to interact with others in order to clarify and discuss comprehension questions and constantly monitor and regulate their own reading.

336,Blended learning for college students with English reading difficulties,"Most previous studies in blended learning simply involved on-site and online instruction without considering students’ control of their own learning in these two different modalities. The purpose of this study was to investigate how college students with English reading difficulties integrate their conceptions of and approaches to blended learning for enhancing their reading proficiency. A sample of 108 students was recruited—54 students were assigned to the experimental group with blended learning and another 54 students to the control group with on-site instruction only. Results of this study revealed that the blended learning was effective in enhancing students’ reading proficiency in the experimental group as shown in the semi-structured interview for students’ conceptions of blended learning, log files for their approaches to blended learning, and the post-test for the improvement of their reading outcomes. From the new conceptions and approaches generated by students, three factors were identified as helping them take control of their own reading in blended learning. First, the online reading activities enabled students to extensively practice what they had learned in the on-site instruction without the limitations of time and location. Second, the process data (log files) for students to observe and reflect on their own online reading process in strategy usages engaged students in metacognition since they were not allowed to compare their reading processes with those of their peers in the on-site instruction. Finally, social interaction was facilitated in blended learning, as students had more opportunities to discuss their reading difficulties during group discussions and obtain individual feedback from different peers.

337,Negotiation of Meaning to Comprehend Hypertexts through Peer Questioning,"Many college students who study English as a Foreign Language (EFL) are less-proficient readers as they have few opportunities to negotiate their perspectives for creating meaning through peer questioning in onsite instruction. This study reports on using online peer questioning to enhance less-proficient college students' negotiation of meaning in comprehending texts. A sample of 50 college students was divided into two groups based on the pre-test, into a more-proficient group and a less-proficient group, with 25 students in each group. The results of this study reveal that the less-proficient students made greater progress in reading comprehension than the more-proficient students after using the strategy of online peer questioning. The less-proficient students were able to explicitly observe how the more-proficient peers used integration questions, agreed or disagreed with peer responses, and finally constructed new understandings of the hypertexts. Particularly, the less-proficient students learned from the more-proficient peers on how to engage in critical thinking to express and share multiple perspectives. Using online peer questioning, both the more-and the less-proficient students frequently engaged in negotiation of meaning, interaction, and teaching one another. Their reading progress was reflected in the post-test, the types of questions and responses, and their perceptions toward using online peer questioning.",blended learning; College Students; Computer Mediated Communication; Cooperative Learning; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Group Discussion; Hypermedia; Language Proficiency; Pretests Posttests; Qualitative Research; Questioning Techniques; reading comprehension; Semi Structured Interviews; Statistical Analysis; Taiwan; Test of English for International Communication,"Yang, Yu-Fen; Hsieh, Pei-Yin",2015.0,,0,337
338,The Use of Online Annotations in Reading Instruction and Its Impact on Students' Reading Progress and Processes,"Studies suggest that the incorporation of online annotations in reading instruction can improve students' reading comprehension. However, little research has addressed how students use online annotations in their reading processes and how such use may lead to their improvement. This study thus adopted Reciprocal Teaching (RT) as an instructional framework to support students' reading comprehension progress and processes, facilitated by the use of online annotations. A total of 54 English language learners at a university were recruited to read with online annotations based on the RT procedure, namely predicting, clarifying, questioning, and summarizing. The data collected 1d the students' scores on pre- and post-tests and their participation records in a collaborative learning environment. The results reveal that the students enhanced their reading comprehension after the intervention. Their reading processes were also analyzed, and the major differences between the groups making more and less progress were identified. Those who made more progress not only frequently reviewed their previously generated predictions, clarifications, questions, and summaries but also actively provided feedback to their peers in a reciprocal manner. Pedagogical implications and recommendations are discussed.",College Students; Cooperative Learning; Documentation; educational technology; English language learners; intervention; Prediction; Pretests Posttests; Program Effectiveness; Questioning Techniques; reading comprehension; reading instruction; reciprocal teaching; Scores; Student Participation; Technology Uses in Education,"Yeh, Hui-Chin; Hung, Hsiu-Ting; Chiang, Yu-Hsin",2017.0,,0,338
339,Metacognitive Process in Online Text Construction,"Many studies have reported the results of how students constructed texts, yet the cognitive process of how texts were constructed by sentences and how the constructive process was formulated and reformulated have rarely been addressed. This study aims to develop a computer-aided text construction system which supports 83 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) university students in inserting sentences to construct texts with the scaffoldings of lexical cohesion and sentence relations. The students' actions in text construction were recorded in a ""recording module"" which showed their metacognitive process during the task. Results of this study revealed that the engagement in metacognitive process was rarely found in the students who made little progress through three online texts. The students who demonstrated the developmental progress in three texts were actively engaged in the metacognitive process to monitor and evaluate their text constructive problems. They then frequently revised the text by reselecting the sentences with the assistance of lexical cohesion and sentence relations. It was further found that students' metacognition could be strengthened by the text construction task. The increased engagement in metacognition, especially reselecting the sentences (revising), led to higher scores being obtained in text construction.

340,Young Korean EFL Learners' Reading and Test-Taking Strategies in a Paper and a Computer-Based Reading Comprehension Tests,"This study investigated whether young Korean students learning English as a foreign language (EFL) engage in similar processes when responding to reading comprehension questions delivered in two different test-presentation modes: paper and computer. It examined the relationship between the two modes and test-takers' reading comprehension strategies, as well as the degree to which the test-takers' reading proficiency moderates this relationship. Eighty-four Korean middle school EFL learners took both paper-based and computer-based reading comprehension tests and filled out a questionnaire of reading and test-taking strategies as well as a background questionnaire and a posttest survey. Results revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the participants' scores on the reading tests delivered on paper and computer, and there were very few statistically significant differences in strategy use between the two modes. On the other hand, there were clear differences in the strategies used by learners with different levels of English reading proficiency. Despite the similarities in test performance and strategy use between the two modes, the majority of participants preferred taking the test on paper and reported difficulties with the computer mode -- a finding that might be due to the participants' lack of familiarity with reading English on a computer screen.",Computer Assisted Testing; Computer Use; Early Adolescents; English (Second Language); Foreign Countries; Middle School Students; Paper (Material); Preferences; Public Schools; reading comprehension; Reading Skills; Reading strategies; Second Language Learning; South Korea (Seoul); Test Format; Test Wiseness,"Yeom, Soohye; Jun, Henry",2020.0,,0,340
341,Exploring metacognitive online reading strategies of non-native English-speaking translation students,"International students, a growing population in US universities, need to possess excellent reading skills in order to succeed. American universities also benefit from admitting students who do not require remedial English classes. Reading online has become an integrated part of college education, which requires students to have additional skills. Awareness and usage of online reading strategies, known as metacognitive online reading strategies, are proven tools to enhance reading skills in online environments. The purpose of this mixed-method study was to investigate the metacognitive online reading strategies employed by highly proficient non-native English-speaking graduate students of Translation, Interpretation and Language Education at Middlebury Institute of International Studies to find out the types of reading strategies students report using, and how they use them when reading an academic text online on a laptop. Two conceptual frameworks were employed to analyze the data: metacognition theory and metacognition model. Quantitative data were collected from 46 students through the Online Survey of Reading Strategies (OSORS). Qualitative data were obtained through recording think-aloud sessions with six volunteers who individually read a TOEFL practice passage and said what they thought as they read the passage. The quantitative findings revealed that students used most of OSORS strategies in the three categories or Global strategies, Problem-solving strategies, and Support strategies. They used problem-solving strategies the most and support strategies the least. The qualitative data analysis revealed that students used most of the strategies that were relevant to the reading task. Moreover, they gave precedence to focusing and maintaining a steady reading pace over other strategies, and bundled related strategies to understand difficult text. Strategies such as slowing the speed of reading, rereading, reading aloud, and guessing meanings were activated together. Data also showed that they students decided on using various computer skills depending on their reading needs, engaging in a parallel metacognitive processing to their reading. Finally, the participants valued reading as part of their career, and made comments on contents of the passage in relation with the real world. Thus, comprehension was not the last step in the metacognitive process, internalizing and remembering the new information was.

342,Think-Aloud Strategy: Improving Reading Comprehension in an Online Context,"In response to the pandemic spread of COVID-19, universities all over the world have shifted to e-teaching. The Department of English, Mustaqbal University, College of Administration and Humanities, Saudi Arabia, used the Microsoft Teams App for teaching all courses in virtual classrooms. However, reading as a receptive skill, was difficult to teach remotely because it was not so interactive for a teacher to know whether the students have performed the assigned tasks or not. Therefore, there was a need to search for a strategy that could be integrated while using technology to help EFL students improve their reading comprehension. This strategy was think-aloud strategy which could potentially make use of participants' mental data while interpreting and responding to a text. During reading, this strategy is capable of making the mental processing covert showing direct evidence of internal reading processes. A quasi-experimental design with an experimental group and a control group was used to determine the effectiveness of this think-aloud strategy in improving the reading comprehension of 72 EFL female students majoring in English, Business, and Law. Moreover, the study also explored the instructors' and the students' perceptions towards this strategy. Results indicated that all participants viewed the think-aloud strategy very positively. The study recommends adopting a highly customized think-aloud strategy to facilitate readers' comprehension.",College Students; Computer Mediated Communication; COVID-19; English (Second Language); Females; Foreign Countries; Pandemics; Protocol Analysis; reading comprehension; Saudi Arabia; Second Language Learning; Student Attitudes; Teacher Attitudes; Teaching Methods; Web Based Instruction,"Zayed, Jihan",2021.0,,0,342
343,Awareness Development for Online Reading,"In a world in which online reading is becoming increasingly common and, as a consequence, online literacy more and more necessary, this paper focuses on possibility of training L2 (second language) readers to bridge the gap between paper reading and online reading. Many researchers believe metacognitive awareness to be the most important ability in the reading process. This paper will try to show that metacognitive awareness raising is an essential component of any strategy instruction that aims at improving students' reading skills in an EFL (English as a foreign language) context. The first part of the paper deals with concepts such as reading strategies, metacognition, and strategy instruction. The second part presents a study on the influence of metacognitive strategy instruction in online reading, which was carried out at a university in the north of Spain. Subjects were 143 students divided into experimental (n = 95) and control (n = 48) groups. Both quantitative and qualitative data were obtained by using different instruments, including some metacognitive tools, such as an online reading strategy survey, a metacognitive activity, or a strategy diary. Results revealed that this metacognitive strategy training had a positive effect on online reading but no effect on the number of strategies used.

345,What is behind a summary-evaluation decision?,"Research in psychology has reported that, among the variety of possibilities for assessment methodologies, summary evaluation offers a particularly adequate context for inferring text comprehension and topic under-standing. However, grades obtained in this methodology are hard to quantify objectively. Therefore, we carried out an empirical study to analyze the decisions underlying human summary-grading behavior. The task consisted of expert evaluation of summaries produced in critically relevant contexts of summarization development, and the resulting data were modeled by means of Bayesian networks using an application called Elvira, which allows for graphically observing the predictive power (if any) of the resultant variables. Thus, in this article, we analyzed summary-evaluation decision making in a computational framework.

346,EFL Reading Test on Mobile versus on Paper: A Study from Metacognitive Strategy Use to Test-Media Impacts,"This paper started with the examination of the effect of mobile-based reading test on EFL test-takers of different attitudes from their perception of metacognitive strategy use and the knock-on impact on test results. Then other possible factors of such impact are explored and corresponding solutions are presented. Quantitative analysis of questionnaire and reading test data indicated that test-takers with low acceptance of mobile-based reading test might be adversely affected in their metacognitive strategy use of planning, monitoring, and evaluating, as well as their test results. Qualitative analysis of the relevant literature and the interview data, combined with the quantitative results, revealed that, besides the inferiority of metacognitive regulation on screen, the negative effects might also involve other complicated and intertwined factors, such as reading proficiency, psychology, attitudes, adaptability, habits, and personality, as well as text and question presentation form, which could, in turn, lead to poor performance in this new test form. Therefore, metacognitive training, psychological preparation, guided practice, elaborated feedback, constructive advice, personalized dynamic assessment, optimization of the text and question presentation form, and overcoming of screen inferiority are necessary for better assessment ecology so that test-takers could gain more benefit and convenience brought by this new assessment medium.",Computer Assisted Testing; English (Second Language); Handheld Devices; Individual Differences; Learning Strategies; Metacognition; Reading strategies; Reading Tests; Second Language Learning; Test Format,"Zou, Xiao-Ling; Ou, Ling",2020.0,,0,346
