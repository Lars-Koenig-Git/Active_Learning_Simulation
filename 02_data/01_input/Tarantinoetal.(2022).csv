1,"Working with Young Children with Disabilities: Perceptions, Skills, and Training Needs of Head Start Teachers","Increasing numbers of young children with disabilities are receiving services in inclusive settings such as Head Start. It is important to note that positive outcomes for young children with disabilities are due in large part to practitioners' understanding and implementation of both recommended practices in both early care and education and early childhood special education. This study examined the Head Start teachers' perceptions, skills, and professional development needs to best serve young children with disabilities. Results revealed positive perceptions about including young children with disabilities in Head Start programs. Teachers indicated that they could organize the environment, observe children's developmental progress, and implement positive guidance strategies. Perceptions were mixed regarding skills to work with families, related professionals, and support staff and there was limited agreement about implementing Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals and objectives, alternate forms of communication, and working with young children with motor impairments. Implications for research, practice, and policy are provided.

2,Underuse of Yoga as a Referral Resource by Health Professions Students.,"Objective: Nearly 38% of U.S. adults use complementary and alternative medicine approaches to manage physical conditions (e.g., chronic pain, arthritis, cancer, heart disease, and high blood pressure) and psychological or emotional health concerns (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression). Research evidence has accumulated for yoga as an effective treatment approach for these conditions. Further, yoga has increased in popularity among healthcare providers and the general population. Given these trends, this study explored perceptions about yoga as a viable complementary treatment to which health professions students would refer patients. Participants: More than 1500 students enrolled in health professions programs at a Pacific Northwest school were enrolled; data were obtained from 478 respondents. Design: The study assessed willingness to refer patients to yoga as a complementary and alternative medicine for 27 symptoms (identified in the literature as having evidence for yoga's utility), which were subsequently grouped into skeletal, physical, and psychological on the basis of factor analysis. Responses were assessed using a mixed-model analysis of variance with health profession and yoga practitioner as between-subjects variables and symptoms as a within-subjects factor. Results: In descending order of likelihood to refer patients to yoga were students in occupational therapy, physician assistant program, psychology, physical therapy, pharmacy, dental hygiene, speech and audiology, and optometry. All groups perceived yoga's greatest utility for skeletal symptoms, followed by psychological and physical symptoms. Findings also revealed a significant positive relationship between level of personal yoga practice and willingness to refer patients to yoga. Conclusions: Although students expressed some openness to referring patients to yoga, ratings of appropriateness were not accurately aligned with extant evidence base. Personal experience seemed to be a salient factor for accepting yoga as a referral target. These findings suggest the importance of developing strategies to make health professionals more aware of the merits of yoga, regardless of whether they themselves are yoga practitioners.","Complementary Therapies;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Health Occupations;Adult;Female;Male;United States;Statistical Significance;Pain;Education;Optometry;Students, Speech-Language Pathology;Students, Dental;Students, Pharmacy;Students, Physical Therapy;Education;Psychology;Physician Assistants;Students, Occupational Therapy;Descriptive Statistics;Analysis of Variance;Stress, Psychological;Pathology;Musculoskeletal System;Alternative Therapies;Human;Students, Health Occupations;Student Attitudes;Methods;Therapeutic Exercise;Yoga;Referral and Consultation","Sulenes, Kari and Freitas, Jillian and Justice, Lauren and Colgan, Dana Dharmakaya and Shean, Margaret and Brems, Christiane",2015.0,0,2
3,School Experiences of an Adolescent with Medical Complexities Involving Incontinence,"The educational implications of chronic illnesses which involve incontinence are not well represented in the literature. The experiences of an adolescent with multiple complex illnesses, including incontinence, were explored via an intrinsic case study. Data were gathered from the adolescent, her mother, and teachers through interviews, email correspondence and school documentation over four months. Analytic memo writing was used to promote reflexivity and address researcher subjectivity. Three prominent themes emerged. There were excessive absences from school which were not always due to the physical implications of the student's incontinence. Some absences were attributed to fear of accidents at school or even fabricated by the student to avoid attendance. Next, an incomplete and inconsistent support and communication system was found which contributed to academic underachievement. Finally, the persona presented by the student led to inaccurate assumptions by school personnel and sometimes her mother regarding her ability to cope with her condition.",H-Reflex;Chronic Disease;Adolescent;United States (Southeast);Emotional Response;Educational Environment;Academic Achievement;Student Attitudes;Physical Disabilities;High School Students;Student Characteristics;Coping;Underachievement;Communication Strategies;Student Needs;Anxiety;Attendance Patterns;Documentation;Interviews;Hygiene;Chronic Illness;Adolescents;Student Experience,"Filce, Hollie Gabler and Bishop, John B.",2014.0,0,3
4,Using Tablet Computers with Elementary School Students with Special Needs: The Practices and Perceptions of Special Education Teachers and Teacher Assistants,"Twelve special education teachers and teacher assistants who have instructional experience using iPads with children with special needs completed a survey that queried their practices and perceptions. In general, teachers and assistants were extremely positive about the value of iPads for children with special needs, particularly for children with autism, attention deficits and limitations of fine motor control. Special education teachers and teacher assistants reported most frequently using iPads to promote student language and literacy skills, although mathematics learning activities were also commonly reported. Enhanced student motivation was the most frequently reported benefit of using tablet computers in school followed by instructional planning advantages. Tablet computers appear to have the potential to be an essential aspect of individual program plans. Teaching tasks might reasonably include downloading and organizing specific applications on specific children's tablets and professional development might increasingly focus of evaluation of tablet applications.",Child;Only Child;Australia;Foreign Countries;Skill Development;Planning;Student Motivation;Mathematics Instruction;Literacy Education;Computer Games;Web Sites;Computer Mediated Communication;Electronic Mail;Teacher Surveys;Educational Technology;Teaching Methods;Laptop Computers;Disabilities;Teacher Aides;Special Education Teachers;Elementary School Students;Computer Uses in Education,"Johnson, Genevieve Marie",2013.0,0,4
5,The Influence of Social Skills Instruction on Sport and Game Related Behaviours of Students with Emotional or Behavioural Disorders,"Background: Many educators assume that students develop appropriate social skills as a by-product of participation in physical education and sports (Hellison 2003). However, it has been demonstrated that appropriate social behaviours improve when interventions are implemented (Balderson and Sharpe 2005). It is known that students with disabilities, especially those with emotional or behavioural disorders, typically do not exhibit appropriate social behaviors (Gresham, Sugai, and Horner 2001). Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of social skills instruction on the sport-and game-related behaviours of students with emotional or behavioural disorders. The study specifically addressed the instruction's influence on appropriate and inappropriate behaviours within both physical education and recess (break time) settings. Participants and setting: Six students (two females and four males) ages 10 through 17 and attending alternative education school programs designed to serve children and youth with emotional or behavioural disabilities participated in the study. Research design and intervention: A multiple baseline across participants design was used. A validated Appropriate Sport and Game Behaviours Curriculum modeled on the one used by Moore, Cartledge, and Heckman (1995) was implemented. The curriculum consisted of 15 lesson plans focusing on appropriate behaviours. Examples of appropriate behaviours consisted of respecting one's own equipment and that of others, congratulating the winner, avoiding blaming teammates, following rules, working cooperatively, and avoiding criticizing the loser. Instructional sessions took place three times per week and were between 20 and 25 minutes in duration. Data collection and analysis: Data were gathered from videotaped sessions for both physical education and recess settings. Observers were trained to code the dependent variables. In addition, interobserver reliability data were collected during randomly selected sessions for all participants across both settings. Procedural integrity was established to ensure that the intervention was implemented as intended. Visual analysis of behaviours was performed using graphical representation of data. Data were subjected to a trend analysis. Mean increases and decreases of appropriate and inappropriate behaviours were presented. Results and recommendations: In general, results were mixed. Five of the six participants (83%) were able to increase appropriate sports/games behaviours and decrease inappropriate behaviours in a physical education (acquisition) setting, and three of the six participants (50%) in a recess (generalisation) setting. While appropriate behaviours were above and inappropriate behaviours were below baseline levels, only one participant (17%) was able to maintain intervention levels. It is recommended that the intervention be extended over a longer period of time.",Emotions;Physical Education and Training;Sports;United States (Midwest);Nontraditional Education;Adolescents;Children;Interrater Reliability;Observation;Games;Outcomes of Education;Behavior Change;Trend Analysis;Equipment;Special Schools;Recess Breaks;Physical Education;Intervention;Team Sports;Teaching Methods;Interpersonal Competence;Disabilities;Emotional Disturbances;Behavior Disorders;Social Behavior,"Samalot-Rivera, Amaury and Porretta, David",2013.0,0,5
6,An Examination of Current Adapted Physical Activity Provision in Primary and Special Schools in Ireland,"The Disability in Sport Taskforce report examining adapted physical activity (APA) in the Irish context (Department of Education and Science, 1999) found that teachers involved in primary mainstream and specialist settings expressed a grave lack of self-confidence, due to lack of training, in the delivery of APA programmes to children with special educational needs (SEN). A further study by Meegan and MacPhail (2006) indicated the need to promote positive attitudes among Irish physical educators toward teaching students with SEN as well as improving initial teacher training and postgraduate training for SEN in physical education (PE). The aim of this study was to examine the current status of APA in primary and special school settings in Ireland, by postal questionnaire. The overall response rate was 42% (n = 171). Key findings indicated that respondents (100%) wished to participate in further specific training in APA leading to a formal qualification. Respondents expressed dissatisfaction with initial teacher training (60%), minimal ongoing in-service provision (70%) and limited teaching resources (68%) for the provision of quality APA to children with SEN.

7,The Quality of Life of a Child with Asperger's Disorder in a General Education Setting: A Pilot Case Study,"This pilot qualitative case study was designed to investigate how the quality of life (QOL) of a child with Asperger's Disorder was impacted by her placement in an inclusive education setting which provided no specialized social skills instruction. Direct and indirect data were gathered and examined regarding themes that centered around QOL dimensions and exemplary indicators derived from the body of literature regarding QOL measurement for persons with disabilities. Positive results included participant satisfaction with physical safety, teacher acceptance, and access to needed materials. Other findings indicated the need for social skills instruction and individualized instruction in non-applied abstract learning activities. Additional findings from the study demonstrated the need for a more comprehensive individualized education program (IEP) and more rigorous implementation of the IEP.

8,Negotiating Normalcy with Peers in Contexts of Inclusion: Perceptions of Youth with Disabilities in India,"The qualitative study reported in this article investigated how youth with disabilities in India described their peer relationships within their educational settings. We situate the aims of this study within the larger context of inclusive education in India and discourses on self-determination for individuals with disabilities. Findings from the study suggest that students with disabilities actively sought membership in their peer communities but had few opportunities within inhospitable schooling contexts to represent themselves in ways other than as needing help. For families of students with disabilities, the onerous demands of making physical environments and curricular materials accessible to their children left them isolated within schools and their communities. The study sheds light on families' reluctance to abandon legal guardianship models in order to support increased self-determination for their children, and also raises important questions for activist educators working within complex conditions such as the Indian context.

9,Sociodemographic analysis of drug use among adolescent athletes: observations-perceptions of athletic directors-coaches.,"Through observations and perceptions of athletic directors/coaches, this study (1) broadly examined substance abuse of adolescent (high school) student-athletes; (2) made comparisons of substance abuse between student-athletes and students comprising the general student body; and (3) made selected comparisons of substance abuse between the regional data of this study and that of a national survey of high school coaches done by George H. Gallup International Institute (1991). Some comparisons were also made with the findings of a survey of drug use patterns among a sample of 10,883 public school students conducted by the Alcohol and Drug Defense (ADD) Section, North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (1991; 1989; 1987a, 1987b) and a survey of drug use patterns among 2,685 high school student-athletes (Shields, 1988). The drug abuse problem for student-athletes was observed-perceived to be of lesser magnitude regionally than nationally and to be less for student-athletes with their peers in the general student body. In virtually every comparison of student-athletes with their peers in the general student body, the drug problem was seen to be less for student-athletes, and in some instances, dramatically less.",Substance-Related Disorders;Sports;North Carolina;Humans;Adolescent Behavior;Adolescent,"Shields, E W",1995.0,0,9
10,Conceptions Associated with Sense of Belonging in Different School Placements for Finnish Pupils with Special Education Needs,"The aim of this study was to examine conceptions associated with sense of belonging (SEBE) in Finnish general and special school placements for pupils with special education needs. Five pupils were selected for this study by means of purposive sampling. They had a history of several school placements prior to arriving at their current special school. Qualitative phenomenographic analyses of interview transcripts revealed numerous conceptions regarding the pupils' SEBE in the different educational placements. The pupils had undergone numerous placements in which their SEBE had been jeopardised, as disturbing relationships with teachers and peers seemed to have affected the pupils' mental and physical well-being, resulting in disturbing behaviours in their earlier educational settings. Despite the various placements and issues of ableism, stigmatisation and exclusion, the pupils felt ""better"" in their current, special, school with a positive climate. Furthermore, the findings of this study provided an initial exploration of the phenomenon, as well as shed light on the several limitations encountered. Hence, further exploration of school cultures and the role of teachers' values and beliefs is needed for a better understanding of how to create a school climate that supports SEBE for all pupils.",Pupil;Finland;Semi Structured Interviews;Educational Environment;Barriers;Reliability;Credibility;Grade 8;Grade 7;Participant Characteristics;Secondary School Students;Federal Legislation;Educational Legislation;Behavior Change;Peer Relationship;Negative Attitudes;Social Bias;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Teacher Student Relationship;Student Attitudes;Transcripts (Written Records);Phenomenology;Qualitative Research;Group Membership;Special Education;Student Placement;Foreign Countries,"Pesonen, Henri and Kontu, Elina and Saarinen, Minna and Pirttimaa, Raija",2016.0,0,10

12,Addition of telephone coaching to a physiotherapist-delivered physical activity program in people with knee osteoarthritis: a randomised controlled trial protocol.,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common and costly chronic musculoskeletal conditions world-wide and is associated with substantial pain and disability. Many people with knee OA also experience co-morbidities that further add to the OA burden. Uptake of and adherence to physical activity recommendations is suboptimal in this patient population, leading to poorer OA outcomes and greater impact of associated co-morbidities. This pragmatic randomised controlled trial will investigate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of adding telephone coaching to a physiotherapist-delivered physical activity intervention for people with knee OA.
168 people with clinically diagnosed knee OA will be recruited from the community in metropolitan and regional areas and randomly allocated to physiotherapy only, or physiotherapy plus nurse-delivered telephone coaching. Physiotherapy involves five treatment sessions over 6 months, incorporating a home exercise program of 4-6 exercises (targeting knee extensor and hip abductor strength) and advice to increase daily physical activity. Telephone coaching comprises 6-12 telephone calls over 6 months by health practitioners trained in applying the Health Change Australia (HCA) Model of Health Change to provide behaviour change support. The telephone coaching intervention aims to maximise adherence to the physiotherapy program, as well as facilitate increased levels of participation in general physical activity. The primary outcomes are pain measured by an 11-point numeric rating scale and self-reported physical function measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscale after 6 months. Secondary outcomes include physical activity levels, quality-of-life, and potential moderators and mediators of outcomes including self-efficacy, pain coping and depression. Relative cost-effectiveness will be determined from health service usage and outcome data. Follow-up assessments will also occur at 12 and 18 months.
The findings will help determine whether the addition of telephone coaching sessions can improve sustainability of outcomes from a physiotherapist-delivered physical activity intervention in people with knee OA.

13,Inclusion of Children with Special Needs in Early Childhood Education: What Teacher Characteristics Matter,"Whereas the inclusion of children with special needs in regular classrooms has gained increasing advocacy, teachers' attitudes vary. Previous studies examining teacher attitudes have focused on primary and secondary schools in the Western world, and little is known about early childhood settings in Eastern countries. This study used MANOVA to examine preschool teachers' attitudes in Hong Kong (N = 410). Teachers reported only modest support for inclusion. Teachers with training in special education were stronger advocates of inclusion, irrespective of their professional roles (administrator or class teacher), for children with intellectual disability, or visual, hearing, and speech and language impairments. However, neither teacher training nor professional role made a significance difference to teachers' support of including children with physical disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific learning difficulty, and the gifted and talented.

14,"The effectiveness of computer-based learning in hospitalized adults with heart failure on knowledge, re-admission, self-care, quality of life, and patient satisfaction: A systematic review protocol","Background Heart failure (HF) is a chronic debilitating disease with a poor prognosis.1 A widely accepted definition of HF is ""a complex clinical syndrome that can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of ventricles to fill with or eject blood which includes diastolic as well as systolic heart failure"".2 This disease may present as complaints of dyspnea, fatigue, orthopnea and peripheral edema.Clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with an echocardiogram, demonstrating decreased ejection fraction, structural changes or hemodynamic abnormalities.3 One of the main goals in treatment of HF is to improve quality of life (QOL) and self-care, while minimizing the healthcare expenditure related to this disease.4 HF is a progressive disease that affects approximately 4% of the population worldwide (about 26 million).5 In the United States (US) nearly 5.7 million people are affected with HF.6 In Europe, it is estimated that over 15 million people suffer from HF and in Australia, the incidence is close to 300,000 (1.5-2%).7 It is difficult to appreciate the global impact of HF due to the lack of a consistent means of accurate reporting, especially from countries in Asia and Africa.8 It is also difficult to obtain an accurate assessment of gender differences in HF due to under-representation of women in clinical trials.9 Due to the persistent and growing incidence of HF, changes have occurred in treatment.Redirecting the focus on post-hospitalization care, patient self-management, and QOL has resulted in decreased hospital re-admission.10 Patient education has become an integral component of HF management.10 Despite these efforts, HF often leads to frequent hospitalizations and impaired QOL.1 According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in 2010 there were one million hospitalizations related to HF in the US.11 It is estimated that approximately 25% of these patients will be readmitted to hospital within 30 days of discharge.4 A major goal of Healthy People 2020, a US initiative to improve national healthcare, is to reduce hospital readmission rates due to HF.12 The mortality rate of HF increases with frequent hospitalizations.4 In the Fall of 2012, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) implemented a program that aims to reduce reimbursement of services based on readmission rates for HF.Currently CMS provides health insurance to almost 48 million Americans.13 This initiative prompted many hospitals to bring HF to center stage, focusing on the quality of care during hospitalization and meticulous discharge planning.The Joint Commission (TJC), a non-profit organization in the US that accredits health care organizations and programs, has identified the importance of discharge instructions/education for HF by including it as a benchmark core quality indicator for hospitals.Failure to meet benchmarks on quality indicators for HF may demonstrate poor quality of care or missed opportunities of coordination of care for patients.14 One of the main purposes of HF education is to assist the patient in learning and thus gaining the knowledge and skills required to adhere to the treatment plan.15 Patient education can facilitate learning and knowledge acquisition to influence the attitudes and behavior required to improve health.16 Therefore, patients are more likely to remain motivated and involved in self-care decisions.17 The patients' HF knowledge can be measured with tools such as the Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test (A-HFKT)18or the Dutch Heart Failure Knowledge Scale19 which are valid and reliable tools.Self-care is a decision making process of performing daily activities to maintain health, prevent illness, and manage chronic disease.15,20 HF self-care management is the ability of the individual to adhere to the prescribed regimen, identify the signs and symptoms, and take action when symptoms occur.15,17 Self-care behavior can be measured with tools such as the European Heart Failure Self-Care Behavior Scale (EHFScBS),21 or the Self-Care Heart Failure Index (SCHFI), Both are valid and reliable tools.22 QOL can be improved with patient education on self-care management.23 QOL is a multidimensional concept that includes self-reported measures of physical, emotional, social, and mental health.24,25 Compared to the general population, the QOL in HF patients is more compromised.26 The distressing symptoms of HF may lead to decreased physical activity, poor QOL and an increase rate of hospital readmissions.27 QOL can be measured with tools such as the European QOL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D),28 the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ),28,29 or the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP),30 all valid and reliable tools.Patient satisfaction has also been linked to better outcomes.Patient satisfaction is demonstrated by how patients value their care.31 It is a comparison between the patient's subjective standards and their healthcare experiences.32 Satisfied patients are more likely to adhere to the treatment plan.33 One of the main goals in the treatment of HF is to provide education that will enhance the patients' knowledge and understanding of the disease process and treatments, thereby improving the patients' ability to engage in self-care and adhere to the treatment plan.34 Adherence to a treatment regimen will improve one's clinical condition which may ultimately lead to greater patient satisfaction.35 Patient satisfaction can be measured by valid and reliable tools such as the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ),36 or the Newcastle Satisfaction with Nursing Scale (NSNS)37 which measures patient satisfaction with nursing care.Hospital readmission is defined as returning to the same hospital or another acute hospital following a prior admission for HF within one year.38 A readmission can be the result of incomplete treatment, providing poor care, poor discharge coordination, or incomplete discharge planning.39,40 Hospital readmission rates can be measured using tools such as the Center for Medicaid and Medicare's Risk Standardized Readmission Rates Model (RSRR).41 The RSRR model is endorsed by the National Health Quality Forum and gives a measure of hospital performance based on readmission rates.41 The American Heart Association (AHA) strongly emphasizes the use of written discharge instructions and educational materials that address diet, activity level, discharge medication use, weight monitoring, and follow-up appointments to be given at the time of discharge.42 Discharge instructions/education facilitates patients and caretakers in their learning process and knowledge acquisition necessary to care for themselves at home.Medical complications and rates of hospital readmission have the potential to be successfully reduced by carefully designed discharge educational interventions.43 Improved patient education at time of discharge may increase knowledge acquisition, decrease hospital readmission, and enhance self-care, QOL, and patient satisfaction.Studies have demonstrated that the addition of illustrations to written discharge instructions can improve patient comprehension and retention of instructions.44, 45 The use of follow-up phone calls 48 hours after discharge in which hospitals call patients to assess their health status and treatment plan is another strategy that has been employed.46 Care transition intervention strategies have been developed utilizing a transition coach to work closely with the patient ensuring that the treatment plan post discharge is effective.47,48,49,50 A relatively new intervention is the use of the computer as a medium to deliver educational materials.Computer-based education, also known as computer-based/assisted-learning, is the application of supportive educational media including simulation, cognitive tools for learning and video-conferencing to aid in knowledge acquisition through teaching, learning and assessment among other modalities.51,52 Computer-based learning considers, facilitates, and integrates the unique needs of the patient population.53,54 Comprehension and retention of knowledge can potentially prevent recurrence of illness and reduce hospital readmission which are dependent on the adaptability of the intervention to the learner's needs.55 HF most often affects older adults who may require specific adaptive educational considerations such as modifications to computer learning including visual and auditory requirements unique to each learner.56 The adaptability of computer-based learning also has the potential to enhance the specific linguistic and cultural preferences for the HF population in order to succeed in building the patient's comprehension.56 A literature review was conducted that focused on computer-based approaches to education for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and asthma across all age groups.This literature review supports the use of a computer-based approach as an effective strategy for patient education pertaining to knowledge transfer and skill acquisition by patients51.",Patient Discharge;Levonorgestrel;Questionnaires;Heart Ventricles;Medicaid;Disease Progression;Hemodynamics;Adult;Dyspnea;Patient

15,Teachers and Coaches in Adolescent Social Networks Are Associated With Healthier Self-Concept and Decreased Substance Use.,"Poor academic (eg, ""I am a bad student"") and behavioral (eg, ""I am a troublemaker"") self-concepts are strongly linked to adolescent substance use. Social networks likely influence self-concept. However, little is understood about the role teachers and athletic coaches play in shaping both academic and behavioral self-concepts.
We analyzed cross-sectional surveys of 929 9th-12th grade low-income minority adolescents in Los Angeles assessing self-concept, social networks, and 30-day use of alcohol, marijuana and other drugs. We performed generalized estimating equations, accounting for clustering at the school level and controlling for family and peer influences and contextual factors. We also tested whether self-concept-mediated associations between relationships with teachers or coaches and 30-day substance use.
More perceived teacher support was associated with lower odds of marijuana and other drug use and better academic and behavioral self-concepts. Behavioral self-concept mediated the associations between teacher support and substance use.
By facilitating relationships with adults and improving teachers' capacity to build supportive environments, schools may positively shape how adolescents see themselves, which might help reduce adolescent substance use.",Social Networking;Cannabis;Cross-Sectional Studies;Adolescent;Social Support;substance use;social networks;self-concept;adolescents,"Dudovitz, Rebecca N and Chung, Paul J and Wong, Mitchell D",2017.0,0,15
16,Using Market Research to Characterize College Students and Identify Potential Targets for Influencing Health Behaviors.,"Marketing campaigns, such as those developed by the tobacco industry, are based on market research, which defines segments of a population by assessing psychographic characteristics (i.e., attitudes, interests). This study uses a similar approach to define market segments of college smokers, to examine differences in their health behaviors (smoking, drinking, binge drinking, exercise, diet), and to determine the validity of these segments. A total of 2,265 undergraduate students aged 18-25 years completed a 108-item online survey in fall 2008 assessing demographic, psychographic (i.e., attitudes, interests), and health-related variables. Among the 753 students reporting past 30-day smoking, cluster analysis was conducted using 21 psychographic questions and identified three market segments - Stoic Individualists, Responsible Traditionalists, and Thrill-Seeking Socializers. We found that segment membership was related to frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, and limiting dietary fat. We then developed three messages targeting each segment and conducted message testing to validate the segments on a subset of 73 smokers representing each segment in spring 2009. As hypothesized, each segment indicated greater relevance and salience for their respective message. These findings indicate that identifying qualitatively different subgroups of young adults through market research may inform the development of engaging interventions and health campaigns targeting college students.",Drinking;Smoking;Smoke;Health Behavior,"Berg, Carla J and Ling, Pamela M and Guo, Hongfei and Windle, Michael and Thomas, Janet L and Ahluwalia, Jasjit S and An, Lawrence C",2010.0,0,16
17,The Academic and Psychosocial Impacts of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome on Postsecondary Students: An Integrative Review of the Literature,"Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a complex, often invisible, connective tissue disorder that has arguably profound psychosocial and academic impact on postsecondary students. It is an underdiagnosed and misunderstood condition that is the focus of little research, particularly within the social sciences. Several factors influence the academic experiences of postsecondary students with EDS, including institutional issues, faculty attitudes, accommodations, school attendance, and technology use. Psychosocially, adjusting to new or changing diagnoses, dealing with the stigmas and misperceptions of others, and the ongoing identity formation of youth are major factors for students. Since there is a notable shortfall in academic literature with the specific focus of EDS in postsecondary education, this review draws from the peripheral fields of chronic illness and disability studies for support.",Connective Tissue;Literature Reviews;Misconceptions;Social Bias;Technology Uses in Education;Attendance Patterns;Accessibility (for Disabled);Academic Accommodations (Disabilities);Teacher Attitudes;Social Influences;Foreign Countries;Educational Legislation;Student Rights;Access to Education;Chronic Illness;Psychological Patterns;Student Needs;Physical Disabilities;College Students,"Giroux, Catherine M. and Corkett, Julie K. and Carter, Lorraine M.",2016.0,0,17
18,Physical activity intervention (Movi-Kids) on improving academic achievement and adiposity in preschoolers with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"The prevention of obesity and improvement of academic achievement in children are concerns of industrialized societies. Obesity has been associated with psychological disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, whose prevalence has been estimated at 6.8 % in Spanish children and adolescents. It is known that physical activity is positively related to academic achievement and negatively related to the risk of obesity in children. However, studies to test the effectiveness of physical activity interventions in improving academic achievement in preschool children are scarce and have some weaknesses that threaten their validity. Moreover, very few studies have examined their effectiveness in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This paper outlines a two-year multidimensional preschool intervention (Movi-Kids) aimed at preventing obesity and improving academic achievement in children with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Twenty-one schools from Ciudad Real and Cuenca, Spain, were randomized to intervention and control groups. In the first academic year, children in the third grade of preschool and the first grade of primary school in the intervention group received the Movi-Kids intervention. In the second academic year, schools were crossed over to the other group. The intervention included children, parents and teachers, and the school environment, and consisted of: (i) three hour-long sessions of recreational non-competitive physical activity after school, weekly, (ii) educational materials for parents and teachers addressing sedentary lifestyle risks and (iii) playground modifications to promote physical activity during breaks. Primary outcome measures of this study were academic achievement (intelligence, cognition, memory, attention and perception), assessed by the Battery of General and Differential Aptitudes, and adiposity measures (body mass index, waist circumference, triceps skinfold thickness and body fat percentage). Secondary outcome measures were: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder risk, motor skills, health-related quality of life and sleep quality. These variables will all be measured in both groups at baseline and at the end of the first and second academic years.
It seems reasonable that an intervention to promote physical activity based on playground games will be useful for simultaneously improving academic achievement and controlling obesity.

19,The preparedness of schools to respond to emergencies in children: a national survey of school nurses.,"Because children spend a significant proportion of their day in school, pediatric emergencies such as the exacerbation of medical conditions, behavioral crises, and accidental/intentional injuries are likely to occur. Recently, both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association have published guidelines stressing the need for school leaders to establish emergency-response plans to deal with life-threatening medical emergencies in children. The goals include developing an efficient and effective campus-wide communication system for each school with local emergency medical services (EMS); establishing and practicing a medical emergency-response plan (MERP) involving school nurses, physicians, athletic trainers, and the EMS system; identifying students at risk for life-threatening emergencies and ensuring the presence of individual emergency care plans; training staff and students in first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); equipping the school for potential life-threatening emergencies; and implementing lay rescuer automated external defibrillator (AED) programs. The objective of this study was to use published guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association to examine the preparedness of schools to respond to pediatric emergencies, including those involving children with special care needs, and potential mass disasters.
A 2-part questionnaire was mailed to 1000 randomly selected members of the National Association of School Nurses. The first part included 20 questions focusing on: (1) the clinical background of the school nurse (highest level of education, years practicing as a school health provider, CPR training); (2) demographic features of the school (student attendance, grades represented, inner-city or rural/suburban setting, private or public funding, presence of children with special needs); (3) self-reported frequency of medical and psychiatric emergencies (most common reported school emergencies encountered over the past school year, weekly number of visits to school nurses, annual number of ""life-threatening"" emergencies requiring activation of EMS); and (4) the preparedness of schools to manage life-threatening emergencies (presence of an MERP, presence of emergency care plans for asthmatics, diabetics, and children with special needs, presence of a school nurse during all school hours, CPR training of staff and students, availability of athletic trainers during all athletic events, presence of an MERP for potential mass disasters). The second part included 10 clinical scenarios measuring the availability of emergency equipment and the confidence level of the school nurse to manage potential life-threatening emergencies.
Of the 675 questionnaires returned, 573 were eligible for analysis. A majority of responses were from registered nurses who have been practicing for >5 years in a rural or suburban setting. The most common reported school emergencies were extremity sprains and shortness of breath. Sixty-eight percent (391 of 573 [95% confidence interval (CI): 64-72%]) of school nurses have managed a life-threatening emergency requiring EMS activation during the past school year. Eighty-six percent (95% CI: 84-90%) of schools have an MERP, although 35% (95% CI: 31-39%) of schools do not practice the plan. Thirteen percent (95% CI: 10-16%) of schools do not identify authorized personnel to make emergency medical decisions. When stratified by mean student attendance, school setting, and funding classification, schools with and without an MERP did not differ significantly. Of the 205 schools that do not have a school nurse present on campus during all school hours, 17% (95% CI: 12-23%) do not have an MERP, 17% (95% CI: 12-23%) do not identify an authorized person to make medical decisions when faced with a life-threatening emergency, and 72% (95% CI: 65-78%) do not have an effective campus-wide communication system. CPR training is offered to 76% (95% CI: 70-81%) of the teachers, 68% (95% CI: 61-74%) of the administrative staff, and 28% (95% CI: 22-35%) of the students. School nurses reported the availability of a bronchodilator meter-dosed inhaler (78% [95% CI: 74-81%]), AED (32% [95% CI: 28-36%]), and epinephrine autoinjector (76% [95% CI: 68-79%]) in their school. When stratified by inner-city and rural/suburban school setting, the availability of emergency equipment did not differ significantly except for the availability of an oxygen source, which was higher in rural/suburban schools (15% vs 5%). School-nurse responders self-reported more confidence in managing respiratory distress, airway obstruction, profuse bleeding/extremity fracture, anaphylaxis, and shock in a diabetic child and comparatively less confidence in managing cardiac arrest, overdose, seizure, heat illness, and head injury. When analyzing schools with at least 1 child with special care needs, 90% (95% CI: 86-93%) have an MERP, 64% (95% CI: 58-69%) have a nurse available during all school hours, and 32% (95% CI: 27-38%) have an efficient and effective campus-wide communication system linked with EMS. There are no identified authorized personnel to make medical decisions when the school nurse is not present on campus in 12% (95% CI: 9-16%) of the schools with children with special care needs. When analyzing the confidence level of school nurses to respond to common potential life-threatening emergencies in children with special care needs, 67% (95% CI: 61-72%) of school nurses felt confident in managing seizures, 88% (95% CI: 84-91%) felt confident in managing respiratory distress, and 83% (95% CI: 78-87%) felt confident in managing airway obstruction. School nurses reported having the following emergency equipment available in the event of an emergency in a child with special care needs: glucose source (94% [95% CI: 91-96%]), bronchodilator (79% [95% CI: 74-83%]), suction (22% [95% CI: 18-27%]), bag-valve-mask device (16% [95% CI: 12-21%]), and oxygen (12% [95% CI: 9-16%]). An MERP designed specifically for potential mass disasters was present in 418 (74%) of 573 schools (95% CI: 70-77%). When stratified by mean student attendance, school setting, and funding classification, schools with and without an MERP for mass disasters did not differ significantly.
Although schools are in compliance with many of the recommendations for emergency preparedness, specific areas for improvement include practicing the MERP several times per year, linking all areas of the school directly with EMS, identifying authorized personnel to make emergency medical decisions, and increasing the availability of AED in schools. Efforts should be made to increase the education of school nurses in the assessment and management of life-threatening emergencies for which they have less confidence, particularly cardiac arrest, overdose, seizures, heat illness, and head injury.","Sports;Craniocerebral Trauma;Questionnaires;Seizures;Hot Temperature;Only Child;Schools, Nursing;United States;Surveys and Questionnaires;Schools;School Nursing;Humans;Guidelines as Topic;Emergency Treatment;Emergency Medical Services;Emergency Medical Service Communication Systems;Emergencies;Disaster Planning;Disabled Children;Child;Adolescent","Olympia, Robert P and Wan, Eric and Avner, Jeffrey R",2005.0,0,19
20,Same but different: Barriers and facilitators to participation in physical activity for children with disability,"Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the barriers and facilitators to participation in physical activity and community sports for children with disability. Design: Qualitative study using focus groups. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants from metropolitan and regional areas in Victoria. Method: Sixty-three participants (37 females, 26 males) took part including 23 children with disability, 20 parents of children with disability and 20 support people who worked in the disability sport sector. Ten, 1-hour focus groups were conducted by an experienced moderator, and were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. A phenomenological theoretical framework and grounded theory method were used to underpin the data analysis. Two reviewers independently read the transcripts to identify emerging themes (thematic analysis) and recorded them using NVivo software. Member checking of the themes generated was used to triangulate the analysis. Results: Five themes were identified; (1) People make the difference, (2) One size doesn't fit all, (3) Sport is expensive, (4) Children with disability are the same and different to children with typical development and (5) Communication and connections for parents and organisations. There were similarities between the factors that influence participation in physical activity for children with disability compared to children with typical development. These include the cost of participation, the involvement of parents and the personal preferences and age of the child. However, children with disability also faced additional barriers to physical activity. Parental support, interest and involvement in activities were influential. Successful participation was also related to an instructor's skills and willingness to include children with disability. Although negative societal attitudes towards disability were considered prevalent, the support and involvement of peers was a strong motivator for children with disability. Meaningful, low cost, and appropriate activities facilitated participation, while the lack of local activity options, waiting lists and a lack of information for parents were barriers to participation. The type of disability also affected participation. The role of schools, sports clubs and disability groups in creating opportunities, building pathways and promoting programs was highlighted. Conclusion: A number of facilitators that can promote engagement in physical activity were identified. Understanding the factors that influence participation can assist clinicians to design interventions to increase engagement in physical activity by children with disability. Further research should explore the practical application of these facilitators by clinicians, schools, community groups and sports groups.",Child;Sports;Focus Groups;Only Child;Motor Activity;Disabled Children;qualitative research;conceptual framework;hospital admission;grounded theory;data analysis;thematic analysis;sampling;software;interpersonal communication;female;skill;male;school;community;information processing;parent;sport;physical activity;cerebral palsy;disability;human;child,"N., Shields and A., Synnot",2012.0,0,20
21,"Sports Specialization, Part II: Alternative Solutions to Early Sport Specialization in Youth Athletes.","Many coaches, parents, and children believe that the best way to develop elite athletes is for them to participate in only 1 sport from an early age and to play it year-round. However, emerging evidence to the contrary indicates that efforts to specialize in 1 sport may reduce opportunities for all children to participate in a diverse year-round sports season and can lead to lost development of lifetime sports skills. Early sports specialization may also reduce motor skill development and ongoing participation in games and sports as a lifestyle choice. The purpose of this review is to employ the current literature to provide evidence-based alternative strategies that may help to optimize opportunities for all aspiring young athletes to maximize their health, fitness, and sports performance.
Nonsystematic review with critical appraisal of existing literature.
Clinical review.
Level 4.
Based on the current evidence, parents and educators should help provide opportunities for free unstructured play to improve motor skill development and youth should be encouraged to participate in a variety of sports during their growing years to influence the development of diverse motor skills. For those children who do choose to specialize in a single sport, periods of intense training and specialized sport activities should be closely monitored for indicators of burnout, overuse injury, or potential decrements in performance due to overtraining. Last, the evidence indicates that all youth should be involved in periodized strength and conditioning (eg, integrative neuromuscular training) to help them prepare for the demands of competitive sport participation, and youth who specialize in a single sport should plan periods of isolated and focused integrative neuromuscular training to enhance diverse motor skill development and reduce injury risk factors.

22,Efficacy of Hand Behind Back Mobilization With Movement for Acute Shoulder Pain and Movement Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hand-behind-back (HBB) Mulligan mobilization with movement (MWM) techniques on acute shoulder pain, impairment, and disability.
This double-blind, randomized, controlled trial recruited 44 patients with acute shoulder pain and movement impairment presenting to an Indian general hospital. Participants were allocated to receive either MWM and exercise/hot pack (n = 22) or exercise/hot pack alone (n = 22). The average duration of symptoms was 4.1 and 4.7 weeks in the exercise and MWM groups, respectively. The primary outcome was HBB range of motion (ROM). Secondary variables were shoulder internal rotation ROM, pain intensity score, and shoulder disability identified by the shoulder pain and disability index. All variables were evaluated by a blinded assessor before and immediately after 9 treatment sessions over 3 weeks.
Paired t tests revealed that both groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements (P < .001) with large effect sizes for all variables. However, for all variables, the MWM-with-exercise group showed significantly greater improvements (P < .05) than the exercise group. Hand-behind-back ROM showed a mean difference of 9.31¬∞ (95% confidence interval, 7.38-11.27), favoring greater improvement in the MWM-with-exercise group.
In this study, the outcomes of patients with acute shoulder pain and disability receiving shoulder HBB MWM with exercise improved greater than those receiving exercise/hot packs alone.","Shoulder;Range of Motion;Pain;Musculoskeletal Manipulations;Articular;Shoulder Pain;Shoulder Impingement Syndrome;Rotation;Range of Motion, Articular;Pain Measurement;Musculoskeletal Manipulations;Male;Humans;Female;Double-Blind Method;Arthralgia;Adult;Acute Disease","Satpute, Kiran H and Bhandari, Prashant and Hall, Toby",2015.0,0,22
23,Inclusion of Children With Disabilities in Physical Education: A Systematic Review of Literature From 2009 to 2015.,"This systematic review examines research published from 2009 to 2015 on inclusion of children with disabilities in physical education according to the PRISMA guidelines. We have used a stakeholder approach as a framework for organizing and discussing the results. The searches yielded 535 studies, of which 112 were included. The systematic review outlines which stakeholder perspectives received the most attention, the main themes and findings, the methodological trends that governed the research contribution, and the country of data collection. The main findings indicated that perspectives of pre- and in-service teachers and studies of attitudes still dominate the research contributions. The strengths and limitations of the research conducted to date highlight that several other perspectives need to be discussed. Especially important is seeking information from children with disabilities themselves. Other barriers and facilitators perceived by those actively involved in the inclusion process need to be sought.

24,Coping of parents with physically and/or intellectually disabled children,"Objective. The aim was to clarify how families with physically and/or intellectually disabled children cope, what kind of coping strategies they use and how the families with good and poor coping capacities differ. Methods. The parents of eight children (aged 8-10 years) with physical and/or intellectual disability were interviewed twice, and the data elicited in these interviews were analysed qualitatively using the grounded theory method. Results. Information and acceptance, good family co-operation and social support were related to the coping strategies most frequently used. Half of the families seemed to have found successful ways of coping, whereas another half had major problems. There were five main domains in which the high- and low-coping families differed most from each other: (1) parents' initial experiences; (2) personal characteristics; (3) effects of the child's disability on family life; (4) acting in everyday life; and (5) social support. Conclusion. The findings can be utilized in developing supportive activities for families with disabled children. By recognizing the coping strategies used by the family, professionals and service providers can find the right ways to support their adaptation. As the role of physicians, nursing staff and other professionals in this process is very important, more attention should be attached to the collaboration between these groups, to enable them to view the situation from the perspective of the whole family.",Physician's Role;Social Support;Only Child;Intellectual Disability;Disabled Children;theory;social support;qualitative analysis;priority journal;physician attitude;physical disability;parental behavior;nursing staff;nurse attitude;medical information;male;interview;intellectual impairment;human;health service;health practitioner;handicapped child;female;family study;family life;experience;daily life activity;coping behavior;cooperation;controlled study;article;adult;adaptive behavior,"A., Taanila and L., Syrj√§l√§ and J., Kokkonen and M.-R., J√§rvelin",2002.0,0,24

26,Inclusion of Children with Disabilities: Teachers' Attitudes and Requirements for Environmental Accommodations,"Teachers in general education are expected to cope with students with diverse needs. They might not always be ready or sufficiently supported to meet these challenges. The current study aims at identifying child, teacher and environmental barriers to inclusion. Specifically it addresses the importance of preschool teachers' attitudes as the human environment factor that may facilitate inclusion of children with disability, and teachers' major concerns about environmental accommodations that inclusion implies. The study assessed how teachers' attitudes towards inclusion of children with disability are affected by the teachers' personal characteristics and are related to the accommodations they deem necessary for admission of such children to their kindergartens. It also examined whether the teachers' attitudes and requirements for accommodations differ in respect of four groups of children's disabilities: learning disabilities, sensory/motor disabilities, ADHD, and emotional disabilities. Fifty-three preschool teachers completed the Attitudes toward Disabled Persons Scale (ATDP-A) and the Environmental Accommodations of School (EAS), which was designed especially for this study (Appendix 1). The teachers' requirements proved to correlate with various teachers' characteristics such as age, experience, education and personal contact with disability. Teacher's requirements for accommodations also highly correlated with environmental working conditions (e.g., working hours, number of children). Teachers were most concerned about accommodations for children with potential behavior problems. Implications for practice and education are discussed.

Teachers completed a behavior problems rating scale and they indicated how frequently they used 15 strategies to address academic, externalizing, and internalizing problems. There were significant differences across environments for only 1 characteristic of emotional disturbance, physical symptoms or fears. Teachers in general education settings mainly addressed academic problems; resource/separate classroom educators used instructional, positive, and reductive strategies for academic and externalizing problems and verbal reinforcement for internalizing problems. Separate school educators used a variety of strategies consistently for all 3 problems. Implications for supporting students with emotional disturbance across educational environments are discussed.

29,Including an Autistic Middle School Child in General Physical Education: A Case Study,"Autism is a brain disorder that affects a person's social, communication, and behavioral skills. Social deficits are noted by the child's lack of interest or inability to interact with peers and family members. This article highlights some of the successful methods and techniques used to include an autistic middle school child in a general physical education class. Methods discussed include support, scheduling, and extra verbal and picture cues. Here, the authors provide a list of general recommendations that GPE teachers can use to include children with autism successfully into general physical education.

30,Acquisition and generalization of activity schedules and their effects on task engagement in a young child with autism in an inclusive pre‚Äìschool classroom,"Efficacy of individualized activity schedules with a 4-year old child diagnosed with autism who attended an integrated public pre-school classroom was examined. Graduated physical guidance and a system of most-to-least prompts were used during skill acquisition stages with teacher proximity and level of prompts being eventually faded. A multiple baseline across activities (work and leisure) assessed performance across baseline, treatment, and maintenance conditions with stimulus generalization being assessed during a third activity (lunch). Results support the findings from G. S. MacDuff, P. J. Krantz, and L. E. McClannahan (1993) in that a child with autism can successfully acquire the skills necessary to independently follow activity schedules and generalize these skills to other settings with minimal training. The study represents an advance in applied research in the use of visual cues with children who experience autism in school settings; most notably an integrated pre-school classroom serving children with disabilities and typical same-aged peers.

31,"An 8-year-old boy with school difficulties and ""odd behavior""","Case. Frankie is an 8-year-old boy seen in consultation because of school difficulties in second grade and ""odd behavior."" His family has been concerned about him for the past 2 years, and he has had psychological testing at school. His parents are seeking another evaluation now because they are concerned that his school performance is declining and his self-confidence is decreasing. Frankie was born at term weighing 7 lb, 3 oz. Delivery was complicated by the ""cord around the neck,"" but Apgar scores were 8 and 9, and he had no difficulties in the neonatal period. He went home with his mother. As an infant he was easily soothed and liked to be held. He sat at 6 months, crawled at 8 months, and walked alone at 14 months. He spoke three intelligible words at 1 year and was speaking in sentences by 2 years. He was fully toilet trained by 2 years, 9 months. He had no significant medical illnesses. His parents began to be concerned about Frankie when his preschool teacher noted a concern about his fine motor skills. She remarked also that, although he had no problems socially, he seemed happy to play alone. From a very early age, he liked ropes and often carried around a length of rope as some children carry a blanket. He was never a difficult child or disruptive at home or in his preschool. The only problem his parents have had is that he tends to get extremely involved in a particular activity (watching TV, building with LEGO blocks), and it is very difficult to turn his attention away from that activity to a family task. At the same time, he is also noted to be easily distracted from tasks in which he has less investment. Frankie's father is said to have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning disabilities, and he is being treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for depression. He works as a successful carpenter and builder. A maternal uncle had Down syndrome and died at the age of 17 years as a result of heart disease. There is no other contributory family history. A 12-year-old sister is successful academically and socially. Frankie's mother is a librarian. The grandparents live nearby and share the parents' concerns about Frankie. He was evaluated a year earlier by his pediatrician and thought to have attention deficit disorder, primarily because of distractibility and easy frustration. He is not oppositional but does have emotional outbursts and cries easily when frustrated. He was noted to carry with him a piece of rope and to play with it repetitively. A trial of methylphenidate was considered unsuccessful. An occupational therapy evaluation revealed low muscle tone and difficulty with visual-motor skills and handwriting. He was said to have ""sensory integration problems,"" and twice-weekly occupational therapy interventions were recommended. His parents requested our opinion about this recommendation. Frankie's academic work was considered average by his teacher in all areas, though weakest in spelling and reading. He was particularly strong in oral expression and noted to have excellent vocabulary and knowledge. He hesitated to participate in group activities and frequently needed considerable encouragement. On the other hand, he was noted to be liked by his peers and was not disruptive. His main weaknesses were considered to be in organization and attentional skills. Handwriting is difficult and slow, and thus written work is a particular challenge. His parents noted that Frankie remembers ""everything"" in detail. He is very talkative and has a great sense of humor. He loves to speak in groups and is ""a ham"" when given a microphone. He enjoys crafts of all sorts and playing with LEGO blocks. He likes music. His favorite TV programs are educational ones, from which he seems to learn a lot of information easily. He has made several extensive presentations to his class based on what he has learned from such programs. Relationships among all members of the family are said to be excellent. Frankie continues to enjoy playing with ropes and similar objects, and his parents have made some rules to keep this from interfering in family activities. He participates in family and classroom activities. The Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC) checklist was completed by both his teacher and his mother. The teacher's responses suggested concerns in the subscales of Anxiety/Depression, Attention, Adaptability, and Atypicality. Social Skills were a notable strength. The mother's responses suggested concerns in Attention, Adaptability, and Social Withdrawal. Frankie's parents and teacher completed a checklist based on the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. Both parents noted three items among the hyperactivity cluster and five among the inattentive cluster to be ""often or very true"" for Frankie. His teacher noted four inattentive items and two hyperactivity items to be true. The Woodcock-Johnson Battery revealed a standard score of 100, with particular strength in Short Term Retrieval and relative weaknesses in Auditory Processing and Processing Speed. Math skills, reading, and written language were average, whereas knowledge in all areas was in the superior range. On the WISC-III, Frankie's Verbal IQ was 104 and Performance was 97. The highest subscales were Vocabulary (13) and Similarities (12); the lowest were Coding (6) and Symbol Search (6). On evaluation, Frankie was a pleasant and cooperative young man who participated in all tasks and related appropriately. His neurological examination was normal. He held a pencil or crayon tensely and wrote slowly and laboriously with tremendous pressure. He did not appear to be anxious during the evaluation. He kept a short piece of rope with him at all times and occasionally fiddled with it. He complied with all requests passively and did not initiate conversation or activities. He had no difficulty making transitions from one activity to another even when specifically challenged. There are several discrete conditions that may be applied in this case. Is it in the child's best interest to define which diagnosis fits him best? Is it acceptable to provide the parents and teachers with some guidelines for helping Frankie to succeed in school and at home, and to ""wait and see"" how he develops over time? Would some practitioners initiate a trial of a pharmacological intervention?.",Motor Skills;Psychological Tests;Neurologic Examination;Only Child;Child;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Humans;teacher;task performance;social interaction;self concept;school child;school;recreation;psychologic test;psychiatric treatment;psychiatric diagnosis;priority journal;primary school;physical activity;peer review;parental behavior;newborn period;neurologic examination;motor development;memory;medical record;male;linguistics;learning;intelligence;human relation;human;family history;family health;differential diagnosis;conversation;controlled study;consultation;clinical feature;clinical examination;child health care;child development;child behavior;case study;case report;behavior disorder;attention deficit disorder;article;academic achievement;serotonin uptake inhibitor;methylphenidate;biological marker,"M.T., Stein and E.C., Perrin and L.M., Wegner",2001.0,0,31

The purpose of this article is to describe how adapted physical educators, as well as general and special educators, can use online videos to develop disability awareness among their students. If used appropriately, online videos can be a powerful way to support disability awareness and they can motivate students to play a more active role in their learning.

34,School-based prevention programs for eating disorders: Achievements and opportunities,"Scarce resources are dedicated to research on school-based prevention programs for eating disorders. Despite this, however, recent years have witnessed an abundance of publications on controlled prevention trials. We now have a cumulative body of knowledge available to guide future developments in the prevention of eating disorders. Medline and PsychInfo were searched for the years 1985-2002 to find relevant publications for this review. Nineteen universal and ten targeted school-based prevention programs were identified and then evaluated. The results obtained by the controlled trials evaluated reassure parents, teachers, and stakeholders in the healthcare sector that school-based eating disorder prevention programs do not have harmful effects on student attitudes and behaviors. Targeted prevention programs have obtained promising results in high-risk individuals. Other positive effects have been obtained using an interactive format. Universal prevention programs have unfortunately been disappointing in their ability to change unhealthy behaviors. Results can be improved by gaining a greater understanding of those risk factors which are most strongly linked to eating disorders and most susceptible to change. A broad range of interventions is needed for further consideration. Promising results from the field of eating disorder prevention and from modern risk factor research could build a new generation of universal prevention trials for eating disorders without the methodological limitations seen in the current literature and with real effectiveness in achieving the goal of reducing the prevalence of eating disorders in the general population.",Eating;Eating Disorders;theory;procedures;teacher;student;stress;social support;social class;skill;self help;school;risk factor;review;race;publication;PsycINFO;prophylaxis;prevalence;parent;onset age;obesity;nutrition;nonhuman;methodology;Medline;medical research;incidence;human;high risk population;health program;health care cost;health behavior;geographic distribution;exercise;eating disorder;disease classification;diet restriction;coping behavior;cognitive therapy;clinical trial;clinical protocol;bulimia;behavior therapy;behavior;attitude;anxiety;anorexia nervosa,"Grave R., Dalle",2003.0,0,34

36,Constraints and facilitators to participation in physical activity in teenagers with Developmental Co-ordination Disorder: an exploratory interview study.,"Despite their movement difficulties, youngsters with Developmental Co-ordination Disorder (DCD) generally have sufficient capability for physical activity. However, they tend to be less physically active and less physically fit than their well co-ordinated age peers. The aim of this study was to use qualitative research methods to understand which factors constrain and facilitate participation in physical activity in teenagers with DCD, in order to help inform future health promotion programmes.
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight teenagers with DCD (aged 13-15) and their parents. The interviews focused on how much physical activity was typically undertaken by the child and the perceived constraints and facilitators to being physically active. Interviews were transcribed and subjected to categorical-content analysis.
Half of the children and all but one of the parents reported that the children did little physical activity. Although most children disliked competitive team games, they reported many physical activities that they did enjoy and they reported wanting to be more physically active. Perceived internal constraints to participation included poor motor skill, lack of motivation and reports of fatiguing easily. Perceived external constraints included difficulty travelling to activities, negative comments from peers and teachers' lack of understanding of DCD.
Reports of low levels of physical activity support previous literature and are a cause for concern for this group. The teenagers expressed the desire to be more active, yet the interviews revealed both personal and environmental constraints to engagement in physical activity. It is clear that these factors interact in a dynamic way and that teachers, schools and communities play an important role in creating a motivational environment for youngsters with DCD to engage in physical activity and learn to maintain an active lifestyle as they move into adulthood.",Sports;Social Environment;Qualitative Research;Parents;Motor Skills Disorders;Motor Skills;Motor Activity;Motivation;Male;Life Style;Interviews as Topic;Humans;Health Promotion;Fatigue;Attitude to Health;Adolescent,"Barnett, A L and Dawes, H and Wilmut, K",2013.0,0,36
37,Determination of school-related problems in children treated for cancer,"This descriptive and case-control study was carried out in a pediatric oncology outpatient clinic to determine the school-related physical, social, and psychological problems and problems experienced in academic achievement of children treated for cancer. The sample of the study consisted of 56 Turkish patients with cancer, aged 7-18 years, who were in remission and attending school as well as their parents, a control group of patients who did not have cancer, and their teachers.

38,Quality of life (QoL) assessment in children with shwachman diamond syndrome (SDS) by child self-reporting and parent reporting using validated child health questionnaires,"SDS is a heterogenous multisystem disorder often resulting in physical features and systemic symptoms which distinguish individuals from their peer group. Neuro-cognitive impairments have been reported in children with SDS. Methods and patients Using validated child health questionnaires (CHQ-CF87 child, CHQ-PF50 parent) we explored QoL in children with SDS aged 5-18 years (followed at SDS multidisciplinary clinic at Leeds) from their own perspective and from that of their parents. 7 children and 1parent for each child completed the self-administered questionnaires. All data was analysed and interpreted as per the scoring and interpretation manual provided with the questionnaires. Results Quantitative data showed below or average scores in more than 50% of the group in the following health concepts -general behaviour; general health perception; parental impact-emotional and family activities. This indicated poor perception of child's general health, parents experiencing a great deal of worry/concern as a result of child's physical or psychosocial health and child's health interrupted family activities or was a source of family tension. Qualitative analysis revealed that children reported good health although a minority worried about their health. They admitted to difficulty in performing activities which required energy (running etc). A minority expressed difficulties with self care. All children experienced mild pain or discomfort. Most were happy and got on with friends. Though most liked themselves but thought others felt badly about them. Most recognised their health/behaviour caused family conflict or tension. The majority admitted to arguing and not wanting to do what parents/teachers said. The majority of parents worried about their child's health and reported behaviour causing tension or disruption of everyday family activities. Most parents expressed uncertainty about their child having a healthy life. A minority of parents (25%) reported limitation of physical activity, but 50% expressed difficulty with school work or activities with friends due to emotional/behavioural problems. Majority of parents reported their child experiencing pain/discomfort. Difficulty concentrating and paying attention was common as was being argumentative.

39,Health and school performance of teenagers born before 29 weeks gestation,"Objective: To ascertain the health and school performance of teenagers born before 29 weeks gestation (extremely low gestational age (ELGA)) and to compare those in mainstream school with classroom controls. Methods: Three geographically defined cohorts of babies born in 1983 and 1984 were traced at the age of 15-16 years. Their health, abilities, and educational performance were ascertained using postal questionnaires to the teenagers themselves, their parents, their general practitioners, and the teachers of those in mainstream school. Identical questionnaires were sent to classroom controls. Results: Of the 218 teenagers surviving to the age of 16 years, information was obtained on 179. Of these, 29 were in special schools and 150 in mainstream school, 10 of whom had severe motor or sensory impairment. Using the Child Health Questionnaire, parents of teenagers in mainstream school reported a higher incidence of problems than controls in physical functioning (difference in mean scores 9.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.9 to 13.1)) and family life (difference in mean scores for family cohesion 7.0 (95% CI 1.6 to 12.4)). In all areas of learning, teachers rated the ability of the ELGA teenagers in mainstream school lower than the control group. Parents of teenagers in special schools reported a higher rate of problems in most areas. Conclusions: One in six ELGA survivors at age 16 years have severe disabilities and are in special schools. Most ELGA survivors are in mainstream school and are coping well as they enter adult life, although some will continue to need additional health, educational, and social services.",Questionnaires;School Health Services;Pregnancy;Adolescent;teacher;survival rate;social work;scoring system;school;questionnaire;priority journal;pregnancy;physical performance;medical information;medical education;male;major clinical study;intellectual impairment;human;female;family life;disease severity;curriculum;controlled study;confidence interval;cohort analysis;article;adolescent;academic achievement,"A., Johnson and U., Bowler and P., Yudkin and C., Hockley and U., Wariyar and F., Gardner and L., Mutch",2003.0,0,39
40,Chronic disruptive pain in emerging adults with and without chronic health conditions and the moderating role of psychiatric disorders: Evidence from a population-based cross-sectional survey in Canada,"Background and aims There has been a growth in the proportion of emerging adults vulnerable to pain-related sequelae of chronic health conditions (CHCs). Given the paucity of research during this important developmental period, this study investigated the association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain among emerging adults and the extent to which psychiatric disorders moderate this association. Methods Data come from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey ‚Äì Mental Health (CCHS-MH). This cross-sectional survey included 5987 participants that were 15‚Äì30 years of age and self-reported their CHCs (n¬†=¬†2460, 41%) and the extent to which pain impacted daily functioning using items from the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI 3). Group comparisons between respondents with CHCs and healthy controls were made using chi-square tests. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed from ordinal logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Product-term interactions between CHCs and psychiatric disorders were included in the models to explore moderating effects. All analyses were weighted to maintain representativeness of the study sample to the Canadian population. Results The mean age of participants was 23.5 (SE 0.1) years and 48% were female. Compared to healthy controls, a greater proportion of participants with CHCs reported having chronic pain (20.3% vs. 4.5%, p¬†<¬†0.001). Among those with chronic pain, respondents with CHCs reported a greater number of activities prevented because of chronic disruptive pain (œá2¬†=¬†222.28, p¬†<¬†0.001). Similarly, in logistic regression models, participants with CHCs had greater odds of reporting chronic disruptive pain (OR¬†=¬†4.94, 95% CI¬†=¬†4.08‚Äì5.99). Alcohol (Œ≤¬†=¬†‚àí0.66; p¬†=¬†0.025) and drug abuse/dependence disorders (Œ≤¬†=¬†‚àí1.24; p¬†=¬†0.012) were found to moderate the association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain. Specifically, the probability of chronic disruptive pain was higher for emerging adults without CHCs and with alcohol or drug disorders; however, among participants with CHCs, probability was higher for those without these disorders. Conclusions There is a robust association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain. The moderating effects suggest that alcohol or drug disorders are especially harmful for emerging adults without CHCs and contribute to higher levels of chronic disruptive pain; however, among those with CHCs, alcohol and illicit drugs may be used as a numbing agent to blunt chronic disruptive pain. Implications Findings from this study have implications for the integration and coordination of services to design strategies aimed at managing chronic disruptive pain and preventing pain-related disabilities later in life. Within the health system, healthcare providers should engage in dialogues about mental health and substance use regularly with emerging adults, be proactive in screening for psychiatric disorders, and continue to monitor the impact of pain on daily functioning. Given the age range of emerging adults, there is tremendous opportunity for clinicians to work cooperatively with colleagues in the education system to support emerging adults with and without CHCs. Overall, clinicians, researchers, educators, and those in social services should continue to be mindful of the complex interrelationships between physical and mental health and chronic disruptive pain and work cooperatively to optimize health outcomes and prevent pain-related disabilities among emerging adults.",Odds Ratio;Logistic Models;Adult;Cross-Sectional Studies;suicidal behavior;self report;priority journal;observational study;mood disorder;mental disease;male;major depression;major clinical study;human;generalized anxiety disorder;female;drug dependence;drug abuse;disease association;cross-sectional study;controlled study;chronic pain;chronic disruptive pain;Canada;bipolar disorder;article;alcoholism;alcohol abuse;adult;adolescent;illicit drug;cannabis;alcohol,"R.A., Qadeer and L., Shanahan and M.A., Ferro",2017.0,0,40
41,Effects of regular exercise vs sedentary after school program on mood and quality of life of overweight children,"Overweight children are at risk for depression, behavior problems, and poor quality of life. Exercise has improved mood and self-worth in several studies of adults and children. However, few studies utilized an attention control condition, or reported quality of life outcomes. 175 overweight children (87% black, 61% female, age 9.7 ¬± 0.9 yrs, 73% obese) were randomized to an aerobic exercise or sedentary (games and artistic activities) after-school program for 8 months. Heart rate monitors were worn daily in the exercise program. Teachers were rotated between conditions to avoid bias, and behavior management strategies were similar between conditions. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, treadmill tests (VO2 peak), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds QL), Pediatric Anger Expression Scale (PAES), and Self-Perception Profile for Children (Global Self-Worth) were completed at baseline and posttest. Intent-to-treat mixed models tested intervention effects. Attendance to control and exercise sessions was similar (64 ¬± 30 vs 59 ¬± 28%, p>.25). In the exercise condition, heart rates were 161 ¬± 7 bpm, indicating vigorous activity. The exercise group lost more fat and gained more fitness than controls (-1.8 vs -0.8%, 2.7 vs 1.3 ml/kg/min, both p=.04). There was a group by time by sex interaction on the CDI (p<.05) such that boys benefited from the sedentary intervention (-3.1 vs 0.5 in exercise, p=.03), while girls showed a nonsignificant benefit from exercise (-2.0 vs -0.4 in control). There was a group by time by sex interaction (p < .05) on the Anger Control scale of the PAES, such that males assigned to exercise reduced their anger control (-1.1 vs 0.6 in control condition, p<.01), with no changes in the girls (-0.5, 0.1 respectively). A group by time by sex interaction (p < .05) on Anger Expression showed changes in opposite directions in boys (-0.1, 0.1) and girls (0.1, -0.1) in control and exercise groups, respectively but with no significant pairwise post-hoc comparisons. No group by time or sex by group by time interaction was detected for Anger Out, Global Self- Worth or PedsQL scale. Exercise did not affect self-worth or quality of life. Sedentary programs providing engaging games and artistic activities and interaction with adults and peers may be more beneficial to boys' mood than comparable exercise programs, perhaps because these are activities boys typically have less exposure to, with more social interaction than exercise. Reduced anger control might be an unwanted side effect of exercise intervention in boys, even with behavioral structure.",Child;Anger;Only Child;Quality of Life;dual energy X ray absorptiometry;side effect;risk;exposure;fitness;teacher;post hoc analysis;monitor;social interaction;model;treadmill test;behavior disorder;depression inventory;self concept;aerobic exercise;intention to treat analysis;heart rate;adult;girl;female;boy;male;exercise;society;psychosomatics;human;child;obesity;quality of life;mood;school,"C.L., Davis and C., Williams and E.E., Bustamante and J.L., Waller",2014.0,0,41
42,Feasibility study of a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of using a humanoid robot to improve the social skills of children with autism spectrum disorder (Kaspar RCT): A study protocol,"Introduction: Interventions using robot-assisted therapy may be beneficial for the social skills development of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking. The present research aims to assess the feasibility of conducting an RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a social skills intervention using Kinesics and Synchronisation in Personal Assistant Robotics (Kaspar) with children with ASD. Methods and analysis: Forty children will be recruited. Inclusion criteria are the following: aged 5-10 years, confirmed ASD diagnosis, IQ over 70, English-language comprehension, a carer who can complete questionnaires in English and no current participation in a private social communication intervention. Children will be randomised to receive an intervention with a therapist and Kaspar, or with the therapist only. They will receive two familiarisation sessions and six treatment sessions for 8 weeks. They will be assessed at baseline, and at 10 and 22 weeks after baseline. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate whether the predetermined feasibility criteria for a full-scale trial are met. The potential primary outcome measures for a full-scale trial are the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Social Skills Improvement System. We will conduct a preliminary economic analysis. After the study has ended, a sample of 20 participants and their families will be invited to participate in semistructured interviews to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the study's methods and intervention. Ethics and dissemination: Parents/carers will provide informed consent, and children will give assent, where appropriate. Care will be taken to avoid pressure or coercion to participate. Aftercare is available from the recruiting NHS Trust, and a phased withdrawal protocol will be followed if children become excessively attached to the robot. The results of the study will be disseminated to academic audiences and non-academic stakeholders, for example, families of children with ASD, support groups, clinicians and charities.","Questionnaires;Child;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive;Autistic Disorder;Only Child;Feasibility Studies;Robotics;study design;social support;social competence;single blind procedure;semi structured interview;robotics;randomized controlled trial;questionnaire;quality of life;psychosocial care;program effectiveness;positive feedback;parallel design;major clinical study;intelligence quotient;human;good clinical practice;follow up;feasibility study;cost effectiveness analysis;controlled study;comprehension;communication disorder;clinical protocol;child;autism;article;ISRCTN14156001","S.E., Mengoni and K., Irvine and D., Thakur and G., Barton and K., Dautenhahn and K., Guldberg and B., Robins and D., Wellsted and S., Sharma",2017.0,0,42
43,Educational and behavioural problems in babies of 32-35 weeks gestation.,"To identify incidence of school and behaviour problems at age 7 years in children born between 32 and 35 weeks gestation, and investigate perinatal risk factors.
The study population consisted of all children born at 32-35 weeks gestation to mothers resident in Oxfordshire in 1990. General practitioners, parents, and teachers were asked about health, behaviour, and education by postal questionnaire. Teachers rated children on level of function in six areas using a five point scale. They also completed the Strengths and Difficulties behaviour questionnaire. Perinatal risk factors were identified for children with poor school performance using a univariate and multivariate analysis.
Teacher responses were obtained for 117 (66%) of the 176 children in the cohort. Twenty nine (25%) required support from a non-teaching assistant, five (4%) had required a statement of special educational needs, and three (3%) were at special school. Poor outcome was reported for 32% in writing, 31% in fine motor skills, 29% in mathematics, 19% in speaking, 21% in reading, and 12% in physical education. On the behaviour questionnaire, 19% of the cohort achieved an abnormal hyperactivity score (population norm 10%). Multivariate analysis showed perinatal variables that remained significant, independent of other variables; they were discharge from the special care baby unit > 36 weeks postconceptional age (odds ratio 4.15; 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 12.05) and male sex (odds ratio 3.88; 95% confidence interval 1.42 to 10.6).
Up to a third of children born between 32 and 35 weeks gestation may have school problems. As there are larger numbers in this gestational category compared with smaller babies, this finding has implications for educational services.","Only Child;Questionnaires;Survivors;Socioeconomic Factors;Sex Factors;Risk Factors;Respiration Disorders;Pregnancy;Pre-Eclampsia;Needs Assessment;Multivariate Analysis;Mothers;Male;Logistic Models;Length of Stay;Intensive Care, Neonatal;Infant, Premature;Infant, Newborn;Humans;Female;Educational Status;Developmental Disabilities;Delivery, Obstetric;Cohort Studies;Child Behavior;Child;Case-Control Studies;Adult","Huddy, C L and Johnson, A and Hope, P L",2001.0,0,43
44,{Strategies to Accommodate Children withDevelopmental Coordination Disorder Strategies to Accommodate Children with in Physical Education Lessons},"{Physical education teachers often face the issue of planning lessons that can challenge students of varying developmental levels. Many children with low motor ability are diagnosed with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), which is considered one of the major health problems among school-age children worldwide (Green, Baird, \& Sugden, 2006). Developmental coordination disorder is categorized by poor motor proficiency that interferes with a child's activities of daily living (Rivilis et al., 2011). Campbell, Missiuna and Vaillancourt (2012) stated that children with DCD are not just low in athletic ability; they struggle to perform the everyday activities that most of us take for granted zipping a knapsack, tying shoes, using scissors, or buttering bread. Typically, the failure to acquire adequate motor skills remains despite children's intelligence levels (Zoia, Barnett, Wilson, \& Hill, 2006). In general, a prevalence of 2-7 percent is likely (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), implying that most school classes have at least one affected child. Common symptoms of the disorder include marked delays in achieving motor milestones, including those associated with balance, coordination and handwriting skills. The movements of children with DCD are often described as ``clumsy{''} and ``uncoordinated,{''} and they frequently lead to performance difficulties in activities of daily living and sports that most typically developing children are able to perform easily (Cacola, 2014). Other general difficulties commonly associated with DCD include poor fine and gross motor control, gross motor sequencing and body awareness, as well as abnormal muscle tone (hypo/hypertonia) and speech fluency. Those general complications can be observed when children with DCD attempt to plan a motor task, organize movements, perform a coordinated action, and adjust movements when demands change, such as moving fast to catch a ball. Initially, it is important for physical education (PE) teachers to be aware that movements in children with DCD have three main characteristics. (1) They are slower: overall, in comparison with typically developing children, children with DCD perform movements at a slower pace. If facing time constraints, children with DCD may be even slower than when they are not in timed situations (the anxiety and pressure may take over, slowing down the movement even more). Giving them more time (or not focusing on the time it takes to perform a movement task - for example, handwriting - at all) can help. (2) Movements are less accurate: in general, movements of children with DCD are more variable, which makes it difficult for them to perform tasks that require a high degree of precision. (3) Movements typically require more effort: children with DCD need to employ more physiological and motor resources than typically developing children do in order to perform the same motor skills. These three characteristics are always present in movements performed by children with DCD, and it is crucial to remember those three features (slower, less accurate, more effort) to understand these students and help them accomplish tasks (Cacola, 2014). Beyond their motor difficulties, a number of studies have shown that children with DCD tend to report lower perceptions of their own physical competence than do children without motor coordination difficulties (Skinner \& Piek, 2001). In addition, teachers report that school-age children with DCD have fewer friends and are more socially isolated than their peers (Piek, Barrett, Allen, Jones, \& Louise, 2005; Poulsen, Ziviani, Johnson, \& Cuskelly, 2008). Children with DCD have lower self-esteem (Cairney et al., 2007; Missiuna, Moll, King, King, \& Law, 2007), possibly because of the fewer social contacts and friendships (Cairney et al., 2007; Poulsen et al., 2008). According to Hands and Larkin (2002), the feelings of inadequacy accompanying poor motor coordination may be constantly reinforced through interactions with peers in school. The long-term consequences of DCD include reduced motivation for participating in physical activity and fewer opportunities for the development of motor skills and fitness (Katartzi \& Vlachopoulos, 2011). The children's desire to withdraw from physical activities may also be reinforced by negative judgments about their overall motor performance by their parents, teachers and peers. According to Katartzi and Vlachopoulos (2011), children with DCD tend to have low social status, which may become evident through situations such as not being able to participate in sport teams. Avoiding sport participation may lead not only to a decrease in children's perceived competence (Stodden et al., 2008) but also to a deterioration of their motor performance due to a lack of practice. This sequence of failures may also have negative consequences in terms of children's physical fitness. That is, most young children develop physical fitness through their daily activities while performing fundamental movements such as running, walking, skipping, climbing, hanging and rolling (Katartzi \& Vlachopoulos, 2011). Most importantly, motor proficiency is positively associated with physical activity and inversely associated with sedentary activity in children, but there may be a threshold of motor proficiency above which children may be the most physically active (Wrotniak, Epstein, Dorn, Jones, \& Kondilis, 2006). Because movements are difficult for children with DCD, they are less likely to participate in physical activities, and the development of their physical fitness and skills may be compromised. Thus, it is not surprising that children with DCD are not as involved in physical activity and sports as are typically developing children (Jelsma, Geuze, Mombarg, \& Smits-Engelsman, 2014). It is well known that developmentally appropriate physical education facilitates the development of motor skills, increases physical activity levels, and motivates positive attitudes toward physical activity and health (Lonsdale et al., 2013). Because of that, we can easily infer that PE lessons are important for children with DCD. The fact that children with DCD report less enjoyment of PE than do other children (Cairney et al., 2007) could possibly be because no accommodations are provided for their motor skill level. With that in mind, the purpose of this article is to provide PE teachers with general strategies to accommodate children with DCD within larger PE classes. These strategies could enhance the participation, enjoyment and motor learning experiences of children with DCD. This article focuses on five themes that are specific to the PE setting: group instruction, cues of learning, goal setting/routines, product-based approach and constraints.}",Handwriting;Sports;Motor Skills Disorders;Child;Only Child;Motor Skills;Physical Education and Training,"Cacola, Priscila and Romero, Michael",,0,44
45,Psychological status of Sarajevo children after war: 1999-2000 survey.,"To make a survey of children's health and psychosocial needs after the 1992-1995 war in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Representative samples of school-age children (n=310) from 6 public schools in the Sarajevo Canton, their parents (n=280), and teachers (n=156) were surveyed by means of self-administered questionnaires and standardized psychometric scale (Ryan-Wengers Schoolagers Coping Strategies Inventory). The survey was conducted in October-November 1999, approximately four years after the war.
At the time of survey, well-being of children in Sarajevo was still heavily impacted by many various unhealthy life conditions and psychosocial stressors. Many school-age children lived in unhealthy and dangerous environment, including overcrowded living conditions (40%), unsafe playgrounds (68%), and no access to sports fields (52%). Most felt unsafe on streets (74%), many (73%) coped with one or more school problems, and even 84% were ill at least once during the past 12 months. General poverty was the prime stressor (common variance explained: 23.5%), followed by school- and health-related risks (common variance explained: 17.0%). At the third place were family-associated risk factors impacting children's health and development, such as overcrowded living conditions and lack of social support within their own family (common variance explained: 10.5%). Parents and teachers also lived and worked in stressful life conditions and were concerned for both their children's and their own well-being. Despite all that, most children tended to use healthy strategies in coping with stressful events in their everyday lives.
The reinforcement of children with positive (healthy) coping skills and strengthening of their social support networks seems to be the most important intervention strategy to help the war-traumatized children in Bosnia and Herzegovina.","Social Support;Only Child;War;Warfare;Urban Population;Stress, Psychological;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Severity of Illness Index;Self Concept;Sampling Studies;Risk Factors;Regression Analysis;Psychology;Prognosis;Probability;Population Surveillance;Male;Humans;Female;Child, Preschool;Child Behavior;Child;Bosnia and Herzegovina;Adolescent;Adaptation, Psychological","Bar√†th, Arp√°d",2002.0,0,45
46,There should be more help out here! A qualitative study of the needs of Aboriginal adolescents in rural Australia.,"Aboriginal adolescents living in or near rural towns have different social and cultural needs than Aboriginal adolescents living in large cities or remote areas. Identification of health needs by the community is an established principle of health promotion for improving community health. The objective of this study was to identify the views of rural Aboriginal adolescents regarding health promotion topics, the most important health problems they faced, their support networks and their beliefs about who should help them meet their health needs.
Ninety-nine adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years were involved in in-depth interviews or focus group discussions using a tested and trialled questionnaire. Data collection took place at three sites in rural Australia from 2006 to 2008: two Aboriginal-controlled communities and one rural town. All locations were de-identified at the request of participants because confidentiality and anonymity were concerns of the adolescents, who felt that identifying their own community would result in stereotyping. After preliminary interviews with parents, teachers, youth and health workers, snowball sampling was used to identify 'vulnerable' adolescents with low school attendance. The mean age of respondents was 13 years. There were 40 male participants and 59 female participants, representing 6 language groups. Informed consent was obtained from both participants and their guardians. Data were analysed using thematic matrices and cross-checked in subsequent interactions with participants.
Alcohol, drugs and violence were identified as the biggest problems facing Aboriginal adolescents in rural areas and the topic they would most like to know about. The youth from a smaller Aboriginal community near a town with a population of 1500 stated that boredom was an equally important problem. Racism and bullying were noted as reasons for poor school attendance. Family members were the most important supports, and the people they felt would help solve their health problems. They strongly identified with sports and were proud to be Aboriginal although there were many adolescents who had no future plans or ambitions. Most participants wanted a 'safe and fun' place to go to in the evenings.
The importance of engaging the community and being sensitive to social and cultural contexts in research and programming was confirmed. Policy-makers, health providers and agencies working with youth need to focus on inclusion of families in youth health promotion and drug and alcohol prevention for Aboriginal adolescents in rural areas. Mentorship and peer-support programs are more effective than health professionals and agencies in working with youth. The expertise of those traditionally working with youth could be channelled into coordinating a mentorship program. Personal wellbeing and safety is an important issue and multipurpose youth centres may provide a secure place for adolescents to learn, interact and develop a vision for their futures.","Violence;Substance-Related Disorders;Social Support;Social Problems;Social Environment;Rural Population;Qualitative Research;Psychology, Adolescent;Oceanic Ancestry Group;Needs Assessment;Male;Interviews as Topic;Humans;Health Promotion;Female;Child;Australia;Adolescent Health Services;Adolescent Behavior;Adolescent","Mohajer, Nicole and Bessarab, Dawn and Earnest, Jaya",2009.0,0,46

Acquisition of VOCA use resulted from a naturalistic intervention strategy that consisted of creating communication opportunities, prompting the participant to engage in the target behavior via a full physical prompt, and facilitating access to natural consequences for appropriate participant responses. Intervention occurred in the context of naturally occurring free-choice activities in inclusive classrooms. Results showed that the intervention strategy was effective in teaching all three participants to use a VOCA to request access to items and/or peers.

49,Peer Coaching Through mHealth Targeting Physical Activity in People With Parkinson Disease: Feasibility Study.,"Long-term engagement in exercise and physical activity mitigates the progression of disability and increases quality of life in people with Parkinson disease (PD). Despite this, the vast majority of individuals with PD are sedentary. There is a critical need for a feasible, safe, acceptable, and effective method to assist those with PD to engage in active lifestyles. Peer coaching through mobile health (mHealth) may be a viable approach.
The purpose of this study was to develop a PD-specific peer coach training program and a remote peer-mentored walking program using mHealth technology with the goal of increasing physical activity in persons with PD. We set out to examine the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of the programs along with preliminary evidence of individual-level changes in walking activity, self-efficacy, and disability in the peer mentees.
A peer coach training program and a remote peer-mentored walking program using mHealth was developed and tested in 10 individuals with PD. We matched physically active persons with PD (peer coaches) with sedentary persons with PD (peer mentees), resulting in 5 dyads. Using both Web-based and in-person delivery methods, we trained the peer coaches in basic knowledge of PD, exercise, active listening, and motivational interviewing. Peer coaches and mentees wore FitBit Zip activity trackers and participated in daily walking over 8 weeks. Peer dyads interacted daily via the FitBit friends mobile app and weekly via telephone calls. Feasibility was determined by examining recruitment, participation, and retention rates. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events during the study period. Acceptability was assessed via satisfaction surveys. Individual-level changes in physical activity were examined relative to clinically important differences.
Four out of the 5 peer pairs used the FitBit activity tracker and friends function without difficulty. A total of 4 of the 5 pairs completed the 8 weekly phone conversations. There were no adverse events over the course of the study. All peer coaches were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with the training program, and all participants were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with the peer-mentored walking program. All participants would recommend this program to others with PD. Increases in average steps per day exceeding the clinically important difference occurred in 4 out of the 5 mentees.
Remote peer coaching using mHealth is feasible, safe, and acceptable for persons with PD. Peer coaching using mHealth technology may be a viable method to increase physical activity in individuals with PD.

50,Coaches' knowledge and management of eating disorders: a randomized controlled trial.,"It has been suggested that programs regarding early identification and prevention of eating disorders (ED) among athletes are unlikely to succeed without their coaches' endorsement and participation. Therefore, we developed a 1-yr intervention aiming to prevent the development of ED among adolescent elite athletes by targeting athletes and their coaches. The separate part of the intervention targeting the coaches was designed to provide knowledge and strategies regarding healthy nutrition, eating behavior, and ED (symptoms, identification, management, and prevention). In this trial, we examined the effect of the educational program on the coaches' knowledge and management index in three content areas (nutrition, weight regulation, and ED). We also examined their subjective evaluation of their ED knowledge.
All Norwegian Elite Sport High Schools were included (intervention group (n = 9) and control group (n = 7)). Seventy-six coaches employed at and coaching first year student athletes at the different schools were followed for three school years (2008-2011). At pretest and posttest (9 months after intervention), they completed a questionnaire regarding nutrition, weight regulation, and ED.
Intervention coaches had higher knowledge index scores than control coaches for weight regulation (6.2 ¬± 1.7 vs. 4.8 ¬± 1.3, P < 0.001), ED (including recognition and management) (19.3 ¬± 4.4 vs. 16.5 ¬± 5.0, P = 0.004), and total knowledge (weight regulation, ED, and nutrition) (35.0 ¬± 7.2 vs. 31.6 ¬± 8.0, P = 0.021) at posttest. Moreover, the coaches likelihood of describing knowledge of ED as ""somewhat good"" or better was seven times higher for intervention than control coaches at posttest (OR = 7.1, 95% CI, 2.2-23.2, P = 0.001).
Intervention coaches had higher index scores on total knowledge, weight regulation, and ED (including recognition and management) than control coaches. The intervention also was successful in producing effects on the coaches' subjective evaluation of their ED knowledge.","Eating;Eating Disorders;Surveys and Questionnaires;Sports;Nutritional Physiological Phenomena;Male;Humans;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Health Education;Female;Feeding and Eating Disorders;Body Weight;Adult;Adolescent","Martinsen, Marianne and Sherman, Roberta T and Thompson, Ron A and Sundgot-Borgen, Jorunn",2015.0,0,50
51,The Inclusion of Pupils with Special Educational Needs in Secondary School Physical Education,"In light of the demands of the revised National Curriculum for Physical Education in England (DfEE/QCA, 1999) and the Special Educational Needs and Disability Discrimination Act (DfES, 2001a), this paper presents some preliminary observations on how PE teachers endeavour to include pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in secondary school physical education (PE). Findings from a small-scale study revealed that whilst teachers expressed a commitment to providing pupils with SEN with ""equal opportunities""--to participate in the same learning contexts as their ""more-able"" peers--in practice, this was not always the case. The paper concludes by suggesting that the apparent tendency of teachers to prioritise ""traditional"" team games within PE serves to exclude, rather than facilitate the full inclusion of many pupils with SEN. Moreover, it appears that these pupils are in effect being integrated into, rather than included in, PE.

52,Conceptualization of physical exercise and keeping fit by child wheelchair users and their parents.,"To gain a better understanding of how children aged 6-18¬†years who use wheelchairs and their families conceptualized physical exercise and keeping fit.
Disabled children with reduced mobility are commonly overweight and unfit. Nurse-led health screening programmes in schools commonly exclude disabled children if they cannot use standard weighing scales or stand against height measuring sticks.
Qualitative interview study at two time points over 6¬†months with children who use wheelchairs and their families.
Framework analysis using the theory of planned behaviour.
Mainly physically active participants were recruited (24 children and 23 parents) 2013-2014. Despite engaging in high levels of physical exercise, children were assessed as fit but had elevated body fat and did not realize how fit they were or that they were slightly overweight and nor did their parents. Children enjoyed the social benefits of exercise. Unlike their parents, children confused the purpose and outcomes of physical exercise with therapy (e.g. physiotherapy) and incorrectly understood the effects of physical exercise on body function and strength, preventing stiffness, increasing stamina and reducing fatigue. A new model was developed to show children's misconceptions.
Proactive parents can overcome barriers to enable their children to benefit from physical exercise. Professionals need to increase communication clarity to improve children's understanding of therapy compared with physical exercise outcomes. Inclusion of children who use wheelchairs in health education policy; routine health screening; physical education classes and teacher training requires improvement.

53,Development of an intervention to stimulate physical activity in hard-to-reach physically disabled people and design of a pilot implementation: an intervention mapping approach.,"Physically disabled people are less physically active compared with healthy people. Existing physical activity (PA) interventions are limited in reach, since they are primarily rehabilitation or school based. The current study aims to develop a community-based intervention for stimulating PA in hard-to-reach physically disabled people.
To systematically develop a PA-stimulating intervention, intervention mapping (six steps) was applied. PA level and health-related quality of life of patients after rehabilitation was determined using questionnaires (step 1). Qualitative research was performed to study professionals' and physically disabled people's ideas about intervention objectives, determinants and design (steps 2 and 3). Since experts expressed no need for a new intervention, the existing intervention 'Activity coach' was adapted to the specific target population. The adapted intervention 'Activity coach+' composes a network of intermediate organisations that refers participants to an activity coach, who coaches participants during 1‚Äâyear. After a preintervention physical assessment by a physiotherapist, participants will be individually guided to existing organised or non-organised activities. An activity tracker will be used to monitor and stimulate PA in daily life (step 4). To support adoption and implementation, meetings between involved parties are organised (step 5). 'Activity coach+' is implemented in community in March 2017, and will be evaluated using a mixed-method analysis. Quantitative evaluation of intervention effects on PA, health and social participation takes place after 0, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months. The implementation process and experiences with the intervention will be determined using qualitative research (step 6).
Insights from this study will be used for dissemination and further development of the intervention. The Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen confirmed that formal ethical approval was not required (METc 2016/630).

54,The socialization of the 2003 United States of America women's wheelchair basketball team.,"The purpose of this research was to identify the socialization process, using the social learning paradigm developed by Kenyon and McPherson (1973), in which personal attributes, significant others, and socializing situations work together in the development of a sporting role. This study was concerned with the introduction into wheelchair basketball and did not consider the attitudes, beliefs, or values one obtains in participation in a sport. The information was obtained from 11 women who were members of the national wheelchair basketball team. Relationships were developed from the researcher's insider role in the sport and their experiences were gathered through a qualitative semi-structured interview.While the study specifically found Kenyon and McPherson's (1973) socialization framework as a useful approach, themes of stereotypes and stigma, and awareness and education leading to the growth of the game were underlying themes throughout the interviews. Findings were consistent with research that considered the socialization framework and named family, school, peer group, and community (Hopper, 1982; Hedrick, 1979; Volger & Schwartz, 1993) as important socialization agents and agencies in the lives of persons with disabilities. This research notes the importance in the coexistence of attributes, agents, and agencies. It was noted that the women had more than one 'most' influential attribute, agent, or agency in their introduction. Although all athletes mentioned onset of disability as significant, those of lower classifications gave situations and examples as to how their low classification limited their participation and could cause frustrations for a person with a severe disability. The changing of roles within one sport (e.g. basketball) or the need to be resocialized into another sport (Bryant & McElroy, 1997; Kenyon & McPherson, 1973) was consistent throughout those with acquired disabilities.Practically, the study encourages practitioners to expand their thoughts on disability and see disability as an opportunity to encounter a new beginning through sport. This study allows administrators, coaches, and other entities of wheelchair basketball to closely consider the active agents and agencies in their recruitment of athletes for the sport. Additionally, the study noted a need to pass along valuable information about wheelchair basketball.","Disabled Persons;Wheelchairs;Sports;United States;Human;Sociological Theory;Semi-Structured Interview;Qualitative Studies;Female;Conceptual Framework;Wheelchair Sports;Socialization;Basketball;Athletes, Female;Athletes, Disabled","JL, Warkins",2004.0,0,54
55,How feasible is the attainment of community ambulation after stroke? A pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate community-based physiotherapy in subacute stroke,"Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial evaluated an assistant-led, community-based intervention to improve community mobility and participation after stroke, and examined the potential for independent community ambulation in people with subacute stroke who present with moderate gait deficit. Design: A multicentre, pilot randomized controlled trial. Setting: Three hospitals and three community settings in New Zealand. Subjects: Thirty post-acute, home-dwelling stroke survivors were randomly allocated to receive intervention in the community (n=14) or as hospital outpatients (n=16) twice a week for seven weeks. Interventions: The community intervention involved practice of functional gait activities in community environments relevant to each participant. Hospital-based physiotherapy was based upon a Motor Relearning approach. Main measures: The primary outcome measure was gait speed (m/min). Secondary outcomes included endurance (six-minute walk time), Activities-specific Confidence Balance Scale, and the Subjective Index of Physical and Social Outcomes measured at baseline, post intervention and six months. Results: Large gains in gait speed were obtained for participants in both groups: community group mean (SD) 16 (16-1) m/min; physiotherapy group mean (SD) 15.9 (16.1) m/min, maintained at six months. There were no significant differences between groups for primary and secondary outcomes after treatment (P=0.86 ANOVA) or at six months (P=0.83 ANOVA). Only 11 participants reported independent community ambulation. Levels of social integration were low to moderate. Conclusions: A community-based gait recovery programme appears a practicable alternative to routine physiotherapy, however independent community ambulation is a challenging rehabilitation goal. ¬© SAGE Publications 2008 Los Angeles, London, New Delhi and Singapore.",Walking;Gait;Physical Therapy Modalities;walking speed;survivor;randomized controlled trial;pilot study;physiotherapy;patient participation;outpatient care;outcome assessment;New Zealand;multicenter study;mobilization;male;integration;human;gait disorder;female;endurance;controlled study;controlled clinical trial;community based rehabilitation;clinical trial;clinical article;cerebrovascular accident;article;aged;adult,"S., Lord and K.M., McPherson and H.K., McNaughton and L., Rochester and M., Weatherall",2008.0,0,55
56,Physical Education for Students with Spina Bifida: Mothers' Perspectives,"This study described the meaning 7 mothers of children with spina bifida ascribed to their children's physical education, the mothers' roles in the schools, and the importance of the IEP in home and school communication. The stories of 4 mothers of elementary and 3 mothers of secondary aged children were gathered using the phenomenological methods of semistructured interviews, artifacts, and field notes. The thematic analysis revealed three themes: a good thing but..., connection to sports, and beyond the curriculum. The mothers valued their children's participation in physical education and provided instrumental support to teachers and teaching associates. They also valued sport as an avenue for developing sport specific skills, which in turn enriched the school experience. The findings are discussed within the context of Peters' (1996) model of disablement.

57,"Supporting Participation in Physical Education at School in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes: Perceptions of Teachers, Youth with Type 1 Diabetes, Parents and Diabetes Professionals","It is not clear how best to support youth with type 1 diabetes to participate in physical education (PE) at school. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of facilitators and barriers to PE in youth with type 1 diabetes and to determine how schools can help these individuals to be physically active. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with youth with type 1 diabetes aged 7-9 (n = 8) and 12-14 (n = 8) years with type 1 diabetes, their parents (n = 16), diabetes professionals (n = 9) and schoolteachers (n = 37). Data were thematically analysed. Four main themes were identified relating to support needs of youth with diabetes in school in general and specifically in PE lessons: (1) differences between primary and secondary schools; (2) areas requiring address in all schools; (3) what teachers can do to help accommodate youth with type 1 diabetes; and (4) what schools can do to help accommodate youth with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes support varied across schools. Primary schools in particular could improve communication between schools and primary specialist PE teachers regarding youth with type 1 diabetes to aid participation in PE. Diabetes knowledge was limited among all teachers. Participants felt that diabetes could be used as an excuse to sit out of PE and that teachers' fears could facilitate this. Improved and consistent diabetes management training and guidance on the responsibilities of teachers is necessary. Better communication between schools, teachers, parents, youth with type 1 diabetes and diabetes professionals is also required. The findings have helped produce suggestions for practice and research on how to improve support for youth with type 1 diabetes in schools in general and specifically in PE lessons.",Physical Education and Training;Adolescent;United States;United Kingdom;United Kingdom;United States;Foreign Countries;Student Attitudes;Capacity Building;School Role;Teacher Role;Accessibility (for Disabled);Elementary Secondary Education;Institutional Characteristics;Qualitative Research;Change Strategies;Articulation (Education);Adapted Physical Education;Needs Assessment;Special Needs Students;Focus Groups;Interviews;Physical Activities;Health Promotion;Barriers;Parent Attitudes;Teacher Attitudes;Student Participation;Health Related Fitness;Diabetes;Youth Problems;Youth Opportunities;Physical Education,"MacMillan, Freya and Kirk, Alison and Mutrie, Nanette and Moola, Fiona and Robertson, Kenneth",2015.0,0,57
58,Children Say the Darndest Things: Physical Activity and Children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,"Background: Physical educators suggested that they are not well-informed about behaviors of children with disabilities, especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children with ADHD represent a significant number of students in school systems worldwide who often experience difficulties in performing fundamental movement skills. Reasons for these challenging movement behaviors are not clearly understood. There were no significant effects of stimulant medication on performance of the ""Test of Gross Motor Development-2"" (""TGMD-2"") for 22 children with ADHD. Six boys with ADHD possessed superficial content knowledge about physical activity (PA) participation. Poor movement skills may be related to a mismatch between content knowledge and specific skill performance, which can be problematic at individual skill levels. Purpose: To explore how children with ADHD regulate PA participation by listening to PA stories. Participants and setting: Ten children with ADHD participated in this study. They were identified by qualified child psychiatrists from an ADHD clinic at a major mental health institute in a large urban Canadian city. Research design: A concurrent mixed methods design explored the PA experiences of the children. The qualitative data were given a higher priority. Data collection: The quantitative research component was individualized assessments of fundamental movement skills with the TGMD-2 and ""Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2"". The qualitative research component included: (1) PA self-reporting where each child recorded daily experiences for a two week period and (2) concurrent scrapbook interviews that enhanced participant recall/reflection to generate rich discussions about individual PA experiences. Data analysis: Quantitative skill assessments provided movement-related descriptions of participants. Individual skill levels were labeled with normative test descriptors linked to each respective assessment instrument. These qualitized descriptors were mixed with interview data only after all movement skill assessments and scrapbook interviews were completed. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a within group thematic analysis was conducted. Findings: Many of the children demonstrated movement skill problems on both tests but skill performance was worse on the TGMD-2. Three qualitative themes emerged. The participants with ADHD spoke about their PA experiences in many different individual physical activities (play theme) and various settings (context theme). All children expressed personal wishes to be included in PA with other children in the community. A range of perceived self-regulatory behaviors emerged for planning PA (organization theme). The findings suggest some of the children with ADHD chose and organized their own PA while other children performed PA that was immediately in front of them with minimal organization of their PA behaviors. Conclusions: Children with ADHD told PA stories that many children without disabilities would tell. However, many of the children with the disorder described experiences related to exclusion from PA. They also lacked conceptual understanding of the purpose and goals related to general participation in various PA. Physical education teacher interventions, leisure counseling and community-based participatory research projects in PA are among the recommendations discussed for children with ADHD.","Child;Motor Activity;Only Child;Physical Education and Training;Disabled Children;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Childhood Attitudes;Urban Schools;Planning;Children;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder;Play;Recall (Psychology);Environmental Influences;Mixed Methods Research;Foreign Countries;Reflection;Physical Education;Semi Structured Interviews;Attitude Measures;Physical Activities;Recreational Activities;Self Control;Diaries;Psychomotor Skills;Student Needs;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);Quebec","Harvey, William J. and Wilkinson, Shawn and Press√©, Cindy and Joober, Ridha and Grizenko, Natalie",2014.0,0,58

60,Community-based walking exercise for peripheral artery disease: An exploratory pilot study.,"Supervised walking exercise is an effective treatment to improve walking ability of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), but few exercise programs in community settings have been effective. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a community-based walking exercise program with training, monitoring and coaching (TMC) components to improve exercise performance and patient-reported outcomes in PAD patients. This was a randomized, controlled trial including PAD patients (n=25) who previously received peripheral endovascular therapy or presented with stable claudication. Patients randomized to the intervention group received a comprehensive community-based walking exercise program with elements of TMC over 14 weeks. Patients in the control group did not receive treatment beyond standard advice to walk. The primary outcome in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses was peak walking time (PWT) on a graded treadmill. Secondary outcomes included claudication onset time (COT) and patient-reported outcomes assessed via the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ). Intervention group patients (n=10) did not significantly improve PWT when compared with the control group patients (n=10) (mean ¬± standard error: +2.1 ¬± 0.7 versus 0.0 ¬± 0.7 min, p=0.052). Changes in COT and WIQ scores were greater for intervention patients compared with control patients (COT: +1.6 ¬± 0.8 versus -0.6 ¬± 0.7 min, p=0.045; WIQ: +18.3 ¬± 4.2 versus -4.6 ¬± 4.2%, p=0.001). This pilot using a walking program with TMC and an ITT analysis did not improve the primary outcome in PAD patients. Other walking performance and patient self-reported outcomes were improved following exercise in community settings. Further study is needed to determine whether this intervention improves outcomes in a trial employing a larger sample size.",Walking;Pilot Projects,"Mays, Ryan J and Hiatt, William R and Casserly, Ivan P and Rogers, R Kevin and Main, Deborah S and Kohrt, Wendy M and Ho, P Michael and Regensteiner, Judith G",2015.0,0,60

Participants were 10 female teachers and 53 mothers. The behaviours of the 53 children (24 boys, 29 girls) were also observed to determine the nature of their eating and exercise behaviours. The results demonstrated that both mothers and teachers expressed concerns about their own bodies. Mothers also communicated messages to their daughters about losing weight and messages to their sons about increasing their muscles. Both girls and boys were concerned about their appearance, particularly their clothes and hair. Girls also demonstrated some concerns about losing weight, and boys with increasing muscles. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of designing education programs for mothers, teachers and children to prevent the development of body image concerns and disordered eating among children.","Eating;Nuclear Family;Only Child;Child;United States;Socialization;Self Concept;Mothers;Mother-Child Relations;Male;Humans;Female;Feeding and Eating Disorders;Feeding Behavior;Faculty;Exercise;Education;Child, Preschool;Body Weight;Body Image;Attitude","McCabe, Marita P and Ricciardelli, Lina A and Stanford, Jacqueline and Holt, Kate and Keegan, Salley and Miller, Louise",2007.0,0,61
62,Using auditory stimulation with students at Lavelle School for the Blind,"This Practice Perspectives essay describes two students attending the REACH program (in which students are actively preparing for adult roles and responsibilities) at the Lavelle School for the Blind. These two students used The Listening Program (TLP), a music-based auditory stimulation program for students with visual impairments, and they also received occupational and speech therapy and orientation and mobility (O&M) services. Although there were a number of students using TLP at the school, Anna and Larry (pseudonyms) were the only two students within the 2009-2010 school year that were able to complete one cycle of TLP. Improvement in the behavior of each student was reported by their teacher and two service providers, who were interviewed informally. Decreased body rocking, better sitting posture, more verbal communication among peers and teachers, better balance on unstable surfaces, and improved learning ability were reported. Although many factors may impact students' progress in school‚Äîincluding other services like O&M, speech and occupational therapy, school curriculum, classroom environment, growth and development of the student‚Äî this positive findings of this essay warrants further study on the use of music-based auditory stimulation with visually impaired students. Integration of TLP into the school curriculum is a necessity in order to ensure daily listening, in addition to use of objective data collection of functional outcomes.

A discussion of changing attitudes and changing children describes the historical development of special education, focusing on recognition and labeling, social indictment, the ""happiness first"" motto, mainstreaming, evidence for needed reform, and the responsibility of the advocacy function. It is pointed out that there are more than 9 million mentally and/or physically handicapped 0-21 yr olds in this country who have difficulties in adjustment or learning and to whom the concept of exceptionality applies. This dynamic and expanding concept is viewed as interacting along 3 dimensions: (a) chronological age, (b) degree of variation from the norm in education-related performance, and (c) environmental and cultural factors affecting the learner's accommodation to school programs. Finally, achieving the goal of education of all is considered in light of federal support, local assistance, the role of technology and the commitment of individual teachers.

64,Monosymptomatic Hypochrondriacal Psychosis (somatic delusional disorder): A report of two cases,"Presents two case reports of monosymptomatic hypochrondriacal psychosis (MHP or somatic delusional disorder); the first, a 29-year-old single woman who presented with a year long history of third person auditory hallucinations, talking and laughing to herself, delusions of reference and a five month history of olfactory hallucinations of bad odor coming from her body and mouth and decline in personal hygiene. She withdrew from social activities, avoided interaction with people (including immediate family members), and stopped attending work She became sad and wished herself dead but never attempted suicide and had no other symptoms suggestive of depressive illness. She was a university graduate and her inability to secure better employment (she was a primary school teacher) four years after her graduation was identified as a major psychosocial stressor that could have precipitated her illness. Her parents sought help from a traditional healer, visited two secondary health facilities, including a dental center and the general out-patient department of our hospital from where she was referred to the psychiatrists. Based on history and examination, she was managed as a case of paranoid schizophrenia (with olfactory reference syndrome) and was treated with haloperidol 15mg daily to which she responded positively after one week. As of when she was seen last in the out-patient clinic, she remained stable on maintenance dose of haloperidol. The second case was a 45-year-old married, Christian saw-miller who presented with a year and a half history of the feeling that insects were crawling all over his body, a mucus substance entering his eyes and a three month history of inadequate sleep The insects were of different sizes and shapes. These insects produced different sensations and were more concentrated on the trunk and the pubic region. He believed that the crawling sensation was a sign that he had contracted Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) because his symptoms started a month after he had sexual intercourse with a female friend. Following this, he stopped having sexual intercourse with his wife because he did not want to transfer the HIV/AIDS infection to her. He was managed as a case of severe depression with psychotic features and delusions of insect infestation as a comorbid disorder. He was treated on an out-patient basis with Amitriptyline and Trifluoperazine. Eleven months after his initial presentation, he was brought by his neighbours on account of poor medication adherence, lack of improvement in his health and serious suicidal intent He was admitted for one month and had six doses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), cognitive and supportive psychotherapy and oral medication He had improved on discharge but a few months later, he defaulted for a year to attempt a religious cure. When he resumed treatment, his condition had deteriorated and his medication was changed to a combination of sertraline and trifluoperazine with minimal improvement. Amitriptyline was recommenced for financial reasons. Despite improvement in sleep and suicidal ideation, the crawling sensation of insects on his body persists. The two cases highlight that MHP can occur in response to, or co-morbid with, a primary psychotic or physical disorder, that it has significant psychosocial impact and causes considerable morbidity and it may not be as rare as presumed.

65,The inclusion of pupils with a chronic health condition in mainstream school: What does it mean for teachers?,"Reports a study investigating the support needs of pupils in mainstream school with a chronic illness or physical disability. The research was carried out in 3 local education authorities covering both rural and urban areas. In-depth, qualitative data were collected from 33 pupils in primary and secondary school; 58 parents of primary and secondary school pupils; and 34 primary and secondary school teachers. Overall, the data suggest variability in the support offered to pupils by teachers, even by teachers within the same school, and highlights the importance of teachers' awareness and understanding of special health needs. A number of areas where students need support from teachers were identified, including: dealing with school absence; taking part in school activities; peer relationships; explaining the condition to other pupils; and having someone to talk to about health-related worries. Data from teachers and parents indicate that school staff need assistance with obtaining health-related information; ensuring health-related information is passed between and within schools; providing emotional support; the provision of medical care; and coordinating support for this group of pupils.

66,Confidence techniques for clinical practice: Anti-anxiety procedures developed in an acting class,"I am a psychologist and was an acting teacher for many years. Some years ago, when I was teaching acting at Lee Strasberg's school, I developed techniques for helping actors overcome stage fright. These techniques turned out to be useful in clinical practice for various anxieties, particularly social and public speaking anxieties. I developed two exercises, the confidence stimulus exercise and the confident character exercise, to help actors overcome their fears, both of which are applicable in a clinical setting. These exercises involved cognitive-behavioral techniques in that students were taught to use anxiety as a cue for coping self-statements. But in the ""confidence"" exercises what they told themselves was to create autonomically arousing imagery selected to counter the effects of the anxiety stimuli. Like the confidence stimulus exercise, Confident Character Exercise exercise adapted a basic tool of the actor's craft to help actors achieve confidence: their character work. While the confidence procedures described here fit into the general framework of cognitive-behavior therapy, they differ from other cognitive-behavioral approaches in that they use imagery to elicit confident, powerful, "" I can do anything"" type feelings in clients, rather than relaxed muscles, pleasant moods, or cognitive reinterpretations of fear stimuli.

67,Differences in problems of motivation in different special groups,"In general, children with a range of special needs have below-average motivation and perceived control. We have investigated whether differences exist between the types of problem in different special groups. Theory distinguishes between 2 types: low motivation and perceived control can be based either on a low perceived contingency, or on a low perceived competence. These 2 types of problems require different intervention strategies. The development of these types is related to several factors that might vary systematically in different special groups: specific histories of experience of success and failure, the possibilities of perceiving contingencies, and the kind of feedback and attributions from important others. We asked teachers to rate their pupils (284 9- and 10-yr-olds) and found, in accord with our expectations, that children with social, emotional and behavioral problems, children with moderate learning difficulties and children with specific learning difficulties have more problems in perceived competence than children with physical or visual impairments. There was a nonsignificant tendency in the expected direction for children with physical impairments to have lower perceived contingency scores than the other groups.

68,Supporting pupils in mainstream school with an illness or disability: Young people's views,"Presents findings from semistructured interviews with 33 mainstream secondary school pupils (aged 11‚Äì16 yrs) with a variety of chronic illnesses or physical disabilities on the impact of their health condition on school life. Results show that Ss valued school and were actively managing the effects of their condition, but needed support from others. Informal support was most frequently cited, including parents‚Äîparticularly mothers‚Äîteachers and close friends. The main difficulties were implications of school absence, exclusion from school life, teachers' reactions to the illness or disability, and peer relationships. The discussion focuses on ways in which health professionals can play a part in supporting pupils both directly and indirectly, through helping others in school understand the condition and its impact on school life.

69,Peer problems of 9- to 11-year-old children with hemiplegia in mainstream schools. Can these be predicted?,"Investigated whether it is possible to predict the development of peer problems of children with hemiplegia based on IQ, neurological severity, visibility of hemiplegia, and parent- and teacher-rated adjustment. 55 children with hemiplegia in mainstream education were followed prospectively from ages 6‚Äì8 yrs (Time 1) to ages 9‚Äì11 yrs (Time 2). Using standardized measures of peer rejection, lack of friends, and victimization, two-thirds of the sample had at least 1 of these problems at Time 2. A greater number of peer problems was primarily predicted by 2 Time 1 variables: lower IQ and more teacher-reported externalizing problems (disruptiveness and hyperactivity). A risk index based on these 2 variables identified a high-risk subgroup that might particularly have benefited from early intervention to reduce behavioral problems, and nurture social skills. It is concluded that as more children with special needs are integrated into mainstream schools, it is increasingly important to remember that supporting these children requires appropriate provision to foster their social as well as their academic and physical development.

70,"Trial Protocol: The use of mindfulness-based intervention for improving bracing compliance for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients: protocol for a randomised, controlled trial.","Introduction Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most prevalent deforming orthopaedic condition; it causes significant disability when spinal curves progress beyond 45 deg. Bracing is the primary treatment prescribed for adolescents with an immature skeleton who have spinal curves between 25 and 45 deg. New evidence suggests that compliance with bracing significantly decreases the progression of high-risk curves to the threshold for surgery. Nonetheless, bracing is a stressful experience. Therefore, interventions that mediate health-related quality of life for AIS patients are of great interest. In the past few decades, numerous studies have documented the benefits of mindfulness training on chronic pain, stress management, anxiety and emotional disorders. Mindfulness might additionally provide AIS patients with psychosocial support. Research questions This study will investigate the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on bracing compliance and quality of life among AIS patients with poor bracing compliance. The study also plans to evaluate if the mindfulness-based intervention effect is sustained after the intervention period. The potential mechanism by which mindfulness affects bracing compliance will be explored. Design Single-blind, two-arm, randomised, controlled trial. Participants and setting The study will recruit 120 AIS patients aged between 10 and 15 years with non-satisfactory bracing compliance. Patients who have previously practised or are currently practising meditation or mindful yoga or who cannot finish the whole intervention will be excluded. The study will take place at the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care building. Intervention Patients in the mindfulness-based intervention group will join weekly sessions for 8 weeks. This program is a short version of a mindfulness-based stress relaxation program to address the specific issues of AIS patients. Two to three experienced instructors will deliver the program. Control Control group patients will participate in an 8-week physiotherapy exercise program as recommended in the International Scientific Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) 2011 guideline. Measurements The primary outcome is the 6-month post-intervention total score of bracing compliance. Secondary measures are non-bracing-specific quality of life, bracing-specific quality of life, self-compassion, emotional regulation, mindful awareness and acceptance, self-efficacy, perception of stress, and general measure of health outcome. Procedure 120 participants will be assigned to either an intervention or control arm by simple randomisation, and the randomisation result will only be revealed once participants have confirmed availability to attend intervention classes. Clinicians of the scoliosis clinic and research staff will be blinded to the treatment allocation. Analysis ANCOVA will be conducted to compare the effect of mindfulness-based intervention versus physiotherapy exercise on the outcome measures. To investigate significant change over time, linear mixed models analyses will be conducted following the intention-to-treat principle. The R-package lavaan will be used to conduct structural equation modelling to study the potential mechanism of mindfulness. Discussion/significance This will be the first psychosocial intervention study conducted on braced AIS patients with the aim of improving patients‚Äô bracing compliance and quality of life. The results from this study will potentially carry significant impact on future AIS treatment by emphasising psychosocial care for braced AIS patients.","Physical Therapy Modalities;Braces;Scoliosis;Adolescent;Data Analysis Software;Analysis of Covariance;Physical Therapy;Adolescence;Child;Quality of Life;Human;Mindfulness;In Adolescence;Orthoses;Scoliosis, Idiopathic, Adolescent;Patient Compliance","Yip, Benjamin Hon Kei and Li, Xue and Leung, Christine Hiu Yan and Gao, Ting and Chung, Vincent Chi Ho and Yu, Fiona Wai Ping and Lam, Tsz Ping and Cheng, Jack Chun Yiu and Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan",2018.0,0,70

J. May and E. J. Furst (1977) and the Student Teacher Anxiety and Concerns Form by M. Sakofs (1984). No effects of the SEC experience were observed. Attitudes toward the regular class teacher's role in the special education evaluation and placement process and confidence in ability to work with the handicapped were more positive in elementary student teachers who were less concerned with their physical and emotional health and with their relationships to public school teachers.

73,Sleep disorders rehabilitation: A new theory and practice field in physiotherapy,"Background: Humans spend approximately 30% of their lifetime sleeping. There is evidence that the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing reaches 10 to 33% of the general adult population. The prevalence of sleep disordered breathing among patients with established cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation and coronary diseases ranges from 30 to 70%. Sleep disordered breathing diagnosis and treatment may change prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease. Sleep medicine is a new promising area for physiotherapists (PT) to work. The knowledge of non-invasive mechanical ventilation in intensive care and emergency must be revised for patients with sleep disorders, where new technologies and new techniques for diagnosis and treatment are unique. Sleep obstructive apnea is a chronic disease that requires continuous assessments to control symptoms and to prevent complications. In this context, the University of S√£o Paulo promoted innovation by inserting Physiotherapy theory and practice in Sleep Disorders. Purpose: To describe implementations in Physiotherapy education with a newtheory and practice-based learning field. Methods: We proposed a change in the Physiotherapy at University of S√£o Paulo and performed academic and scientific agreements between the University and the Sleep Laboratory of the Heart Institute of the Medical School. In 2010, we included theory of sleep physiology, sleep pathophysiology and treatments. They performed 17% of one theorical discipline content. In 2014, we initiated practicebased learning by opening a new Physiotherapy Ambulatory Program at the Sleep Laboratory that performed 25% content of discipline ‚ÄúPractice in Physiotherapy in Cardiovascular Disorders‚Äù that lasts 5-weeks. In 6-months, this content increased to 50%. In this discipline, students had the opportunity (2√ó/week) to discuss cases with the PT-supervisor, to assess patients and their social-economic contexts, to evocate resources, to make clinical decisions, to re-assess treatments, to follow-up patients and to make interactions with a multidisciplinary team (cardiologists, pulmonologists, otolaryngologists, neurologists, psychiatricts, nutritionists and speech therapists). To achieve academic and health care excellence, three students were accompanied by one PTsupervisor and each student took care of one patient per hour (resulting in 30 patients after 5 weeks). The PT-supervisor provided discussions before and after each treatment, considering each patient's history in the context of sleep disorders rehabilitation and each student needs. Results: Three beneficial aspects were implemented: (a) open, reliable and active communication between the University Commission for Graduation, multidisciplinary team, students, PT-supervisor and PT-teacher, (b) a real incentive to the PT-teacher/PT-supervisor to innovate with responsibility, and (c) increased motivation, learning and confidence on this proposal by students, PT-teacher/PT-supervisor and the multidisciplinary team. Conclusion(s): The theory and practice-based discipline of Physiotherapy in Sleep Disorders Rehabilitation was beneficial in several aspects: academic, scientific and health care. Implications: By opening a new promising area of Physiotherapy theory and practice in Sleep Disorders Rehabilitation, the University of Sao Paulo has provided (a) new perspectives for teachers, (b) up-dating competence for students, (c) more competent PT for the population and (d) more accessibility to health care and efficiency with the Sleep Disorders Rehabilitation Program.",Cardiovascular Diseases;Prognosis;Sleep Disorders;Adult;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Physical Therapy Modalities;Humanities;Humans;Humanism;medical history;competence;lifespan;sleep medicine;responsibility;otolaryngologist;neurologist;physiotherapist;dietitian;artificial ventilation;pulmonologist;speech;intensive care;interpersonal communication;emergency;pathophysiology;physiology;adult;motivation;technology;apnea;chronic disease;hypertension;heart;atrial fibrillation;medical school;coronary artery disease;follow up;cardiologist;prognosis;teacher;population;diagnosis;prevalence;laboratory;learning;cardiovascular disease;sleep disordered breathing;health care;university;sleep;student;patient;human;education;rehabilitation;sleep disorder;physiotherapy,"N.K., Nakagawa and J.A., Nascimento and G., Lorenzi-Filho",2015.0,0,73
74,"Supporting successful inclusive practices for learners with disabilities in high schools: a multisite, mixed method collective case study.","The increase in the number of individuals with disabilities in general education has led to an increased interest in how to best provide support. Despite an emphasis on inclusion and participation in policy and practice, defining and describing the support provided for these learners is still an important task.
This multisite, mixed method collective case study reports on 125 education and other staff from seven schools who took part in interviews and focus groups to reflect on a range of topics related to learners with disabilities in high schools. We focused on what the participants did, what they considered to be successful and what their ""best"" practices were.
Descriptions of practices were rich, nuanced and complex. The analysis identified over 200 ""strategies"" which were synthesized into two meta-themes and eight subthemes. We discuss the results in the context of an ecological perspective, and the importance of focusing on the full range of influences and outcomes for young people in designing supports.
We have drawn on evidence from this study as a basis for professional development activities and identified that focusing on the environment and the role of practitioners has a potential to improve the inclusion outcomes for older learners with disabilities. Implications for Rehabilitation Inclusion is influenced by the physical environment, attitudes, expectations and opportunities, in addition to a learner's skills and abilities. Schools should focus on the environment and teachers' practices, rather than on what an individual learner can or cannot do. The practices discussed in this study reflect those that a range of educators and related services personnel agree are realistic, appropriate and effective. Change may be led by the school management team; however, there are many ways in which all staff can contribute; indeed, approaches will not work effectively unless they are understood and implemented by everyone.",young people;teaching;models;Inclusion,"Maciver, Donald and Hunter, Cathleen and Adamson, Amanda and Grayson, Zoe and Forsyth, Kirsty and McLeod, Iona",2018.0,0,74

A modified LSEN (Learners with Special Educational Needs) questionnaire was given to two schools in Vhembe district and the data was analysed quantitatively. The LSEN questionnaire was further modified and used as interview questions which were conducted in five schools in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The data was analysed quantitatively and qualitatively for the Vhembe schools and the Umlazi respectively using a dual framework: the Eco-systemic perspective and Feuerstein theoretical framework. The results indicate that teachers are inadequately trained for IE. Infrastructure and teacher attitude exacerbate the implementation of IE at mainstream schools.

76,Implementing a patient education intervention about Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus prevention and effect on knowledge and behavior in veterans with spinal cord injuries and disorders: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Objectives: To assess the feasibility and effect of a nurse-administered patient educational intervention about Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevention on knowledge and behavior of Veterans with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D). Design: Blinded, block-randomized controlled pilot trial. Setting: Two Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) SCI Centers. Participants: Veterans were recruited March-September 2010 through referral by a healthcare provider from inpatient, outpatient, and residential care settings. Intervention: Thirty participants were randomized to the nurse-administered intervention and 31 to the usual care group. The intervention included a brochure and tools to assist nurses in conducting the education. Outcome measures: Pre- and post-intervention measurement of knowledge and behaviors related to MRSA and prevention strategies and feasibility measures related to implementation. Results: Participants were primarily male (95.1%), white (63.9%), with tetraplegia (63.9%) and mean age and duration of injury of 64.3 and 20.5 years, respectively. The intervention groups mean knowledge score significantly increased between pre- and post-test (mean change score = 1.70, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.25-3.15) while the usual care groups score did not significantly change (mean change score = 1.45, 95% CI -0.08-2.98). However, the mean knowledge change between intervention and usual care groups was not significantly different (P = 0.81). Overall behavior scores did not significantly differ between treatment groups; however, the intervention group was more likely to report intentions to clean hands (90.0% vs. 64.5%, P = 0.03) and asking providers about MRSA status (46.7% vs. 16.1%, P = 0.01). Nurse educators reported that the quality of the intervention was high and could be implemented in clinical care. Conclusions: A targeted educational strategy is feasible to implement in SCI/D clinical practices and may improve some participants' knowledge about MRSA and increase intentions to improve hand hygiene and engagement with providers about their MRSA status. ¬© The Academy of Spinal Cord Injury Professionals, Inc. 2014.",Staphylococcus aureus;Methicillin;Veterans;Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus;Methicillin Resistance;Patient Education as Topic;Spinal Cord Injuries;young adult;veteran;very elderly;spinal cord injury;self report;residential care;randomized controlled trial;quadriplegia;pilot study;patient education;outpatient;outcome assessment;nursing education;nurse;middle aged;methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection;methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus;male;major clinical study;knowledge;intervention study;human;hospital patient;health care personnel;hand washing;follow up;female;feasibility study;disease duration;controlled study;behavior;article;aged;adult,"C.T., Evans and J.N., Hill and M., Guihan and A., Chin and B., Goldstein and M.S.A., Richardson and V., Anderson and K., Risa and S., Kellie and K.A., Cameron",2014.0,0,76
77,Teaching the psychosocial aspects of care in the clinical setting: practical recommendations.,"Communication skills and the psychosocial dimensions of patient care are increasingly taught in medical schools and generalist residency programs. Evidence suggests they are not reinforced or optimally implemented in clinical training. The authors present the product of an iterative process that was part of a national faculty development program and involved both experts and generalist teachers concerning teaching psychosocial medicine while precepting medical students and residents in clinical settings. Using scientific evidence, educational theory, and experience, the authors developed recommendations, presented them in workshops, and revised them based on input from other experts and teachers, who gave feedback and added suggestions. The results are practical, expert consensus recommendations for clinical preceptors on how to teach and reinforce learning in this area. General skills to use in preparing the trainee for improved psychosocial care are organized into the mnemonic ""CAARE MORE"": Connect personally with the trainee; Ask psychosocial questions and Assess the trainee's knowledge/attitudes/skills/behaviors; Role model desired attitudes/skills/behaviors; create a safe, supportive, enjoyable learning Environment; formulate specific Management strategies regarding psychosocial issues; Observe the trainee's affect and behavior; Reflect and provide feedback on doctor-patient and preceptor-trainee interactions; and provide Educational resources and best Evidence. The preceptor-trainee teaching skills that are recommended parallel good doctor-patient interaction skills. They can be used during both preceptor-trainee and preceptor-trainee-patient encounters. Important common psychosocial situations that need to be managed in patients include substance abuse, depression, anxiety, somatoform disorder, physical and sexual abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder. For these problems, where high-level evidence exists, specific psychosocial questions for screening and case finding are provided.","Reinforcement (Psychology);Psychology, Social;Physician-Patient Relations;Mental Disorders;Humans;Humanism;Education, Medical;Clinical Medicine","Kern, David E and Branch, William T and Jackson, Jeffrey L and Brady, Donald W and Feldman, Mitchell D and Levinson, Wendy and Lipkin, Mack and General Internal Medicine Generalist Educational Leadership Group, [Collective Name]",2005.0,0,77
78,Medical personnel survey of social attitude about epilepsy patients,"Rationale: Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic diseases. Its potential adverse effects include physical morbidity, social stigma, and more generally, impaired quality of life. Living with epilepsy in any society should mean living a full life, with no more than absolutely necessary restrictions. The attitude of society can cause more pain than the seizure itself. Due to the patient/caregiver relationship, patients may view their health care professionals' attitudes as especially influential. Thus, it is important that health care professionals express attitudes that provide maximal support for the patient, and reflect appropriate levels of precautions while dispelling myths regarding epilepsy Nursing literature provides guidance on which health care professional perspectives reflect appropriate precautions regarding epilepsy. Methods: Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in November- December 2009,to identify current attitudes of selected health care professionals at UVA Medical Center, Virginia to compare them with best practices.An anonymous survey was distributed by email containing both demographic questions and questions about attitudes toward epilepsy, drawing a distinction between ‚Äúepilepsy in general‚Äù and ‚Äúwellcontrolled epilepsy.‚Äù Specific units were invited to participate, based on their health care professionals' different degrees of training and routine involvement with patients with epilepsy: - Neurology Registered Nurses (RN) and Patient Care assistants (PCAs)/Patient Care Technicians (PCTs) from Acute care neurology(Epilepsy Monitoring Unit included) and neurosurgery units, Neuro ICU; Pediatric ICU, Acute care pediatrics, Kluge Children rehabilitation center inpatient. - As a Control Group comparison, General Medicine RNs and PCAs/PCTs from Acute care medicine units) Results: 130 of 288 invited RNs responded (45%); 33 of 84 invited PCAs/PCTs responded (39%). Of the Control group, 47% of invited RNs and 12% of invited PCAs/PCTs responded; the Control PCAs/PCTs opted to provide responses for the ‚Äúgeneral epilepsy‚Äù but not the ‚Äúwellcontrolled epilepsy‚Äù questions. The 18 questions in each section were divided into 4 categories: Intelligence and Ability to Contribute; Psychiatric Disorder and Suicidal Ideation; Employment and School; Family, Lifestyle and Sexuality. The most desirable outcome (optimal response) was identified for each question. Conclusions: Implications for Practice: The desirable outcome for both the RN and PCA/PCT, both Control and Neuro groups, would be at least 50% favorable towards the optimal answer. In just one category, namely, ‚Äúintelligence and ability to contribute‚Äù, the RN's attitude reflects the current best practice, but still not 50%. In general, it is obvious that there is much room for re-education. We are unable to compare the Control PCAs and the Neuro PCAs because of inadequate responses by the Control PCAs in the controlled epilepsy section.

79,{POSITION STAND ON ANDROGEN AND HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE USE},"{Hoffman, JR, Kraemer, WJ, Bhasin, S, Storer, T, Ratamess, NA, Haff, GG, Willoughby, DS, and Rogol, AD. Position stand on Androgen and human growth hormone use. J Strength Cond Res 23(5): S1-S59, 2009-Perceived yet often misunderstood demands of a sport, overt benefits of anabolic drugs, and the inability to be offered any effective alternatives has fueled anabolic drug abuse despite any consequences. Motivational interactions with many situational demands including the desire for improved body image, sport performance, physical function, and body size influence and fuel such negative decisions. Positive countermeasures to deter the abuse of anabolic drugs are complex and yet unclear. Furthermore, anabolic drugs work and the optimized training and nutritional programs needed to cut into the magnitude of improvement mediated by drug abuse require more work, dedication, and preparation on the part of both athletes and coaches alike. Few shortcuts are available to the athlete who desires to train naturally. Historically, the NSCA has placed an emphasis on education to help athletes, coaches, and strength and conditioning professionals become more knowledgeable, highly skilled, and technically trained in their approach to exercise program design and implementation. Optimizing nutritional strategies are a vital interface to help cope with exercise and sport demands (516-518). In addition, research-based supplements will also have to be acknowledged as a strategic set of tools (e.g., protein supplements before and after resistance exercise workout) that can be used in conjunction with optimized nutrition to allow more effective adaptation and recovery from exercise. Resistance exercise is the most effective anabolic form of exercise, and over the past 20 years, the research base for resistance exercise has just started to develop to a significant volume of work to help in the decision-making process in program design (187,248,305). The interface with nutritional strategies has been less studied, yet may yield even greater benefits to the individual athlete in their attempt to train naturally. Nevertheless, these are the 2 domains that require the most attention when trying to optimize the physical adaptations to exercise training without drug use. Recent surveys indicate that the prevalence of androgen use among adolescents has decreased over the past 10-15 years (154,159,246,253,370,441,493). The decrease in androgen use among these students may be attributed to several factors related to education and viable alternatives (i.e., sport supplements) to substitute for illegal drug use. Although success has been achieved in using peer pressure to educate high school athletes on behaviors designed to reduce the intent to use androgens (206), it has not had the far-reaching effect desired. It would appear that using the people who have the greatest influence on adolescents (coaches and teachers) be the primary focus of the educational program. It becomes imperative that coaches provide realistic training goals for their athletes and understand the difference between normal physiological adaptation to training or that is pharmaceutically enhanced. Only through a stringent coaching certification program will academic institutions be ensured that coaches that they hire will have the minimal knowledge to provide support to their athletes in helping them make the correct choices regarding sport supplements and performance-enhancing drugs. The NSCA rejects the use of androgens and hGH or any performance-enhancing drugs on the basis of ethics, the ideals of fair play in competition, and concerns for the athlete's health. The NSCA has based this position stand on a critical analysis of the scientific literature evaluating the effects of androgens and human growth hormone on human physiology and performance. The use of anabolic drugs to enhance athletic performance has become a major concern for professional sport organizations, sport governing bodies, and the federal government. It is the belief of the NSCA that through education and research we can mitigate the abuse of androgens and hGH by athletes. Due to the diversity of testosterone-related drugs and molecules, the term androgens is believed to be a more appropriate term for anabolic steroids. 1. Androgen administration in a concentration-dependent manner increases lean body mass, muscle mass, and maximal voluntary strength in men. However, the upper concentration for maximum effects remains unknown. 2. Combined administration of androgens and resistance exercise training is associated with greater gains in lean body mass, muscle size, and maximal voluntary strength in men than either intervention alone. 3. Testosterone therapy is approved only for the treatment of hypogonadism in adolescent and adult men. However, the anabolic applications of androgens and selective AR modulators are being explored for the functional limitations associated with aging and some types of chronic illness. 4. The magnitude and frequency of adverse effects among androgen users have not been systematically studied. Potential adverse effects of androgen use in men include suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, mood and behavior disorders, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hepatic dysfunction with oral androgens, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, acne, gynecomastia, and withdrawal after discontinuation. In addition, the polypharmacy of many androgen users (psychoactive and accessory drugs) may have serious adverse effects of their own. 5. The adverse effects of androgen administration in women are similar to those noted in men. In addition, women using androgens may also experience virilizing side effects such as enlargement of the clitoris, deepening of the voice, hirsutism, and changes in body habitus. These changes may not be reversible on cessation of androgen use. 6. In pre- and peripubertal children, androgen use may lead to virilization, premature epiphyseal closure, and resultant adult short stature. 7. Since 1990, the use of androgens for a nonmedical purpose is illegal. Androgens are labeled as a schedule III drug. Possession of any schedule III substance including androgens is punishable by fine, prison time, or both. Prescribing androgens for bodybuilding or enhanced athletic performance is also punishable as noted above. 8. Human growth hormone increases lean body mass within weeks of administration; however, the majority of the change is within the water compartment and not in body cell mass. 9. Human growth hormone is unlikely to be administered as a single agent but often in combination with androgens. 10. Combined administration of hGH and resistance exercise training is associated with minimal gains in lean body mass, muscle size, and maximal voluntary strength in men compared with resistance exercise alone. 11. Human growth hormone is approved for the therapy of children and adolescents with growth hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome, small for gestational age with failure to catch-up to the normal growth curves, chronic kidney disease, Prader-Willi syndrome, idiopathic short stature, Noonan syndrome, and SHOX gene deletion. For adults, hGH is approved for the treatment of GH deficiency, AIDS/HIV with muscle wasting, and short bowel syndrome. 12. The magnitude and frequency of adverse events associated with hGH use are clearly dose related. Potential adverse events include suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary GH/IGF-1 axis, water retention, edema, increased intracranial pressure, joint and muscle aches, and those of needle injection (hepatitis and HIV/AIDS). These should be the same in women as well as in men. 13. Continued effort should be made to educate athletes, coaches, parents, physicians, and athletic trainers along with the general public on androgen and hGH use and abuse. Educational programs should focus on potential medical risks of these illegal performance-enhancing drugs use, optimizing training programs and concurrent nutritional strategies to enhance physiological adaptation and performance. In addition, educating coaches on setting realistic training goals and expectations for their athletes will help reduce the pressures to use illegal PED and assist in potentially identifying potential users of illegal PED. 14. The NSCA supports and promotes additional research funding to be directed toward effective educational programs, documentation of both acute and long-term adverse effects of androgen and hGH abuse, strategies for optimizing athletic performance through training and nutritional interventions, strategies to help athletes discontinue androgen and hGH use, and strategies for the detection of abuse of androgens and hGH.}","Mental Disorders;Adaptation, Physiological;Federal Government;Androgens;Substance-Related Disorders;Adolescent;Virilism;Growth Hormone;Sports;Humanities;Humanism;Human Growth Hormone;Humans","Hoffman, Jay R. and Kraemer, William J. and Bhasin, Shalender and Storer, Thomas and Ratamess, Nicholas A. and Haff, G.

80,The Epidemiology of Overuse Conditions in Youth Football and High School Football Players.,"‚ÄÉ High-intensity sport training at the youth level has led to increased concern for overuse conditions. Few researchers have examined overuse conditions in youth sports.
‚ÄÉ To examine the rates, risks, and distributions of overuse conditions between youth and high school football players.
‚ÄÉ Descriptive epidemiologic study.
‚ÄÉ Youth and high school football teams.
‚ÄÉ The Youth Football Safety Study (YFSS) investigated youth football athletes from age 5 to 14 years. The National Athletic Treatment, Injury and Outcomes Network (NATION) focused on high school football athletes 14 to 18 years old. The YFSS data consisted of 210 team-seasons, and the NATION data consisted of 138 team-seasons.
‚ÄÉ Athletic trainers collected football injury and exposure data during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. Injury rates, risks, and distributions were calculated, with injury rate ratios, risk ratios, and injury proportion ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing youth and high school football players.
‚ÄÉ The YFSS reported 1488 injuries, of which 53 (3.6%) were overuse conditions. The NATION reported 12‚Ää013 injuries, of which 339 (2.8%) were overuse conditions. The overuse condition rate did not differ between high school and youth football (3.93 versus 3.72/10‚Ää000 athlete-exposures; injury rate ratio = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.79, 1.41). However, the 1-season risk of overuse condition was higher in high school than in youth football players (2.66% versus 1.05%; risk ratio = 2.53; 95% CI = 1.84, 3.47). Compared with high school football players, youth football players had greater proportions of overuse conditions that were nontime loss (ie, <24 hours participation-restriction time; 83.0% versus 67.0%; injury proportion ratio = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.07, 1.43) and affecting the lower extremity (92.5% versus 62.5%; injury proportion ratio = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.32, 1.65).
‚ÄÉ Overuse conditions may not present a primary concern in youth and high school football players. However, differences existed between the 2 levels of competition. Although additional research on the incidence of overuse conditions across all youth and high school sports is needed, these findings may highlight the need for programming that is specific to competition level.","Odds Ratio;Sports;time-loss injuries;sports;non‚Äìtime-loss injuries;injury risk;injury rate;injury diagnosis;body part injuries;United States;Seasons;Schools;Male;Incidence;Humans;Football;Female;Cumulative Trauma Disorders;Child, Preschool;Child;Athletic Injuries;Adolescent","Morris, Kevin and Simon, Janet E and Grooms, Dustin R and Starkey, Chad and Dompier, Thomas P and Kerr, Zachary Y",2017.0,0,80
81,Meeting Fears and Concerns Effectively: The Inclusion of Early Childhood Students Who Are Medically Fragile,"Due to advances in medical technology more early childhood students who are medically fragile are entering school and being included in general education. The field of special education lacks a broad research base regarding this unique population. This qualitative study examined the perceptions of nine early childhood teachers on the inclusion of students who are medically fragile in their classroom activities. The teachers voluntarily completed questionnaires and the content was analyzed by looking for themes. The early childhood teachers expressed a general openness toward the inclusion of students who are medically fragile, but the deduction can be made that they need more information and training in order to feel comfortable with the inclusion process. Concerns were expressed throughout regarding litigation and fear of harming the child with medically fragile characteristics.

82,Depression and chronic fatigue in the high school student and athlete.,"By presenting the salient aspects of a case study of a high school student athlete, we have attempted to show how participation in sports can negatively impact on self-concept, self-esteem, physical acceptance, and self-efficacy, thereby contributing to an overall feeling of inadequacy, helplessness, hopelessness, and ultimately leading to depression and chronic fatigue. An early maturer, this student experienced early success in several sports without a great deal of effort and investment, and derived much of his sense of being from the recognition and reinforcement accorded him by significant others, most notably from a father who placed a higher premium on success in athletics than on other equally worthwhile pursuits. When continued success was not forthcoming, and as later-maturing peers caught up to and surpassed his athletic accomplishments, the student sought to protect his sense of self-esteem by rationalizing that his lack of success was due to a physical problem. He became obsessed with the thought that he was gradually losing his athletic identity and he lapsed deeper and deeper into a depressed state. His compulsive overtraining and starvation diet failed to produce his image of the ""ideal body"" that, of course, was unachievable because of his distorted view of reality. Ultimately, this behavior resulted in hospitalization for treatment of an eating disorder and clinical depression. Even a successful senior football season after his psychiatric care could not filter through his distorted perceptions and he could not cope with the thought of participating in another track and field season and having his performance bested by others whom he had once handily beaten. Thus, once again, he engaged in self-protective behavior and sought verification from sportsmedicine professionals. Diagnosis of Tom's condition was possible only through the collaborative efforts of the athletic trainer, physical therapist, sport psychologist, and family physician. Professionals involved in sportsmedicine must be aware of the critical role that highly valued activities like sports play in the psychosocial development of adolescents. To the adult, these activities may seem trivial, frivolous, and removed from the ""real world,"" but to the adolescent, they are an important source of self-esteem during a critical and volatile period of self-concept edification. During a period of awakening sexuality and heightened awareness of their physical being, activities that emphasize the physical aspect of self gain prominence. Those who derive positive experiences benefit from enhanced feelings of physical self-efficacy and self-esteem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Students;Sports;Self Concept;Life Change Events;Humans;Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic;Depression;Child;Body Image;Adult;Adolescent","Lidstone, J E and Amundson, M L and Amundson, L H",1991.0,0,82
83,Gay and Gray Session: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Transgender Aging,"With the overarching goals of improving the healthcare of older transgender individuals and of inspiring pertinent clinical research, a session at the 2017 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry Annual Meeting focused on an interdisciplinary approach to transgender aging. The older the transgender adult, the more likely the individual grew up in a historical context when there was greater social stigma towards their gender identity, even among mental health professionals. In order to provide optimal healthcare to transgender adults, mental health care providers should become familiar with the basic terminology presented in this article. Transgender older adults face greater risks of poor physical health, disability, anxiety and depressive symptoms, victimization, and stigma, and higher rates of smoking, excessive alcohol use, and risky sexual behavior compared with non-transgender older adults. In spite of notable health disparities, some evidence points to resilience among transgender older adults. The mental health professional often serves as the first contact for a patient who is struggling with gender identity. The role of a mental health professional can be divided into five categories: 1) assessment of gender dysphoria; 2) psychoeducation of patients and family members about the diversity of gender identities and various options for alleviating gender dysphoria; 3) referral to and collaboration with other healthcare professionals; 4) treatment of coexisting mental health concerns; 5) advocating for transgender patients and for the transgender community. Recently, the criteria for medical and surgical transition have been simplified. End-of-life preparations are especially important for transgender individuals.","Sexual Behavior;Homosexuality, Male;Aging;Transgendered Persons;transgender;social stigma;sexual orientation;sexual behavior;sexual and gender minority;psychological resilience;psychoeducation;primary medical care;personal trainer;patient referral;nomenclature;mental health care;low level laser therapy;LGBT people;lawyer;interdisciplinary research;human;health practitioner;health disparity;health care personnel;gender identity;gender dysphoria;depression;consultation;article;anxiety disorder;aging","K., Johnson and B.C., Yarns and J.M., Abrams and L.A., Calbridge and D.D., Sewell",2018.0,0,83
84,"The influence of gender and specialty on reporting of abusive and discriminatory behaviour by medical students, residents and physician teachers","Introduction: The perception of whether a given bahaviour is abusive differs between students and teachers. We speculated that attitudes towards reporting abusive and discriminatory behaviour may vary by specialty as well as by gender. Methods: We report a cross-sectional survey of incoming medical students, medical students, residents, and teaching faculty at one Canadian medical school. The discrimination and abuse questions were in the following domains: (i) psychological abuse, (ii) sexual abuse, (iii) physical abuse, (iv) gender discrimination, (v) racial discrimination, (vi) disability discrimination, (vii) derogatory remarks regarding homosexuality. The frequency of self-reported witnessed or experienced abusive and discriminatory behaviour was compared by gender, specialty choice and stage of training. Results: The response rates varied by respondent group: 44/56 (79%) of incoming medical students, 177/218 (81%) of medical students, 134/206 (65%) of residents and 215/554 (38%) of physician teachers. The frequency of these behaviours was perceived to be low by both male and female respondents. Abusive and discriminatory behavior by all teachers, compared with men (P < 0.003). Each response to the abuse/discrimination behaviour by physician teachers was noted more frequently by residents (P < 0.001) and physician teachers themselves (P < 0.001) compared with incoming medical students. As well, in general, women noted more abusive and discriminatory questions was also modelled as the independent variable using stepwise multiple regression. The area of specialization (surgical versus non-surgical) altered the reporting of abusive and discriminatory behaviour by women. Conclusion: We conclude that female surgical residents and medical students undergo a process of acclimatization to the patriarchal surgical culture. As female surgeons become physician teachers they revert to a culture more similar to that of their female non-surgical colleagues. Although a process of deidealization occurs in medical training, these attitudes are not necessarily retained throughout the practising lifetime of physicians as they regain autonomy and more personal control.","Discrimination (Psychology);Cross-Sectional Studies;Students, Medical;teaching;teacher;social psychology;social behavior;sexual harassment;resident;race difference;normal human;medical student;medical profession;medical education;male;human;homosexuality;gender;female;disability;cultural factor;attitude;article;adult","T., Oancia and C., Bohm and T., Carr and B., Cujec and D., Johnson",2000.0,0,84
85,Effects of 2 prevention programs on high-risk behaviors among African American youth: a randomized trial.,"To test the efficacy of 2 programs designed to reduce high-risk behaviors among inner-city African American youth.
Cluster randomized trial.
Twelve metropolitan Chicago, Ill, schools and the communities they serve, 1994 through 1998.
Students in grades 5 through 8 and their parents and teachers.
The social development curriculum (SDC) consisted of 16 to 21 lessons per year focusing on social competence skills necessary to manage situations in which high-risk behaviors occur. The school/community intervention (SCI) consisted of SDC and school-wide climate and parent and community components. The control group received an attention-placebo health enhancement curriculum (HEC) of equal intensity to the SDC focusing on nutrition, physical activity, and general health care.
Student self-reports of violence, provocative behavior, school delinquency, substance use, and sexual behaviors (intercourse and condom use).
For boys, the SDC and SCI significantly reduced the rate of increase in violent behavior (by 35% and 47% compared with HEC, respectively), provoking behavior (41% and 59%), school delinquency (31% and 66%), drug use (32% and 34%), and recent sexual intercourse (44% and 65%), and improved the rate of increase in condom use (95% and 165%). The SCI was significantly more effective than the SDC for a combined behavioral measure (79% improvement vs 51%). There were no significant effects for girls.
Theoretically derived social-emotional programs that are culturally sensitive, developmentally appropriate, and offered in multiple grades can reduce multiple risk behaviors for inner-city African American boys in grades 5 through 8.

86,Ethics teaching in rehabilitation: results of a pan-Canadian workshop with occupational and physical therapy educators,"PURPOSE: Ethical practice is an essential competency for occupational and physical therapists. However, rehabilitation educators have few points of reference for choosing appropriate pedagogical and evaluation methods related to ethics. The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify priority content to cover in ethics teaching in occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) programmes and (2) explore useful and innovative teaching and evaluation methods.     METHOD: Data for this qualitative descriptive study were collected during a 1-d knowledge exchange workshop focused on ethics teaching in rehabilitation.     RESULTS: Twenty-three educators from 11 OT and 11 PT Canadian programmes participated in the workshop. They highlighted the importance of teaching foundational theoretical/philosophical approaches and grounding this teaching in concrete examples drawn from rehabilitation practice. A wide range of teaching methods was identified, such as videos, blogs, game-based simulations and role-play. For evaluation, participants used written assignments, exams, objective structured clinical examinations and reflective journals. The inclusion of opportunities for student self-evaluation was viewed as important.     CONCLUSION: The CREW Day provided ethics educators the opportunity to share knowledge and begin creating a community of practice. This space for dialogue could be expanded to international rehabilitation ethics educators, to facilitate a broader network for sharing of tacit and experiential knowledge. Implications for Rehabilitation According to the study participants, rehabilitation ethics education should include learning about foundational knowledge related to ethical theory; be grounded in examples and cases drawn from clinical rehabilitation practice; and contribute to building professional competencies such as self-knowledge and critical thinking in students. Regardless of the methods used by occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) educators for teaching and evaluation, the value of creating spaces that support open discussion for students (e.g. protected discussion time in class, peer-discussions with the help of a facilitator, use of a web discussion forum) was consistently identified as an important facet. Educators from OT and PT programmes should work with various professionals involved in OT and PT student training across the curricula (e.g. clinical preceptors, other educators) to extend discussions of how ethics can be better integrated into the curriculum outside of sessions specifically focused on ethics. The CREW Day workshop was the first opportunity for Canadian rehabilitation ethics educators to meet and discuss their approaches to teaching and evaluating ethics for OT and PT students. Including international rehabilitation ethics educators in this dialogue could positively expand on this initial dialogue by facilitating the sharing of tacit and experiential knowledge amongst a larger and more diverse group of ethics educators.",Occupational Therapy;teaching;self evaluation;rehabilitation;professional competence;physiotherapist;occupational therapy;multicenter study;medical ethics;male;human;female;ethics;education;curriculum;clinical trial;Canada,"A., Hudon and K., Perreault and M., Lalibert√© and P., Desrochers and B., Williams-Jones and Feldman D., Ehrmann and M., Hunt and E., Durocher and B., Mazer",2016.0,0,86
87,The effects of epilepsy on child education in Sierra Leone,"Epilepsy is associated with a significant burden of false beliefs and social stigma in the setting of Sub-Saharan Africa. To assess the impacts of epilepsy on child education in Sierra Leone (SL), we carried out a cross-sectional descriptive study examining its effects on school attendance, participation in physical activities, and social acceptance among classmates. We also assessed the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes regarding epilepsy of both the children's caregivers and teachers. The data were collected at various epilepsy clinics and schools in Freetown, SL. A total of 50 patients were interviewed and questionnaires administered to their caregivers and teachers, making a total of 150 respondents. Fifty-one percent of the children were absent from school for > 5 days per month. Ninety percent did not participate in games and sports, with the commonest reason being fear of occurrence of seizures. Thirty-six percent claimed having experienced negative attitude from their classmates. Regarding the caregivers, 48% believed that epilepsy was a medical illness, while 34% considered it a demonic manifestation. Forty-eight percent were apprehensive about sending their children to school, with 83% of these caregivers stating fear of seizures and potential injuries. Only 8% of the caregivers did not prevent their children from taking part in any physical activity at school. Regarding the teachers, 16% believed that epilepsy was a demonic manifestation, and 10% thought that it was contagious. Fourteen percent did not think that children with epilepsy should go to school, and 80% would prevent children with epilepsy from participating in games and sports. When faced with a child having a seizure, 48% would hold the child down, 12% would place a hard object in the child's mouth, and 12% would avoid any physical contact. In total, 20% of the children ceased attending school permanently; daily occurrence of seizures (p &#60; 0.05), negative attitude of classmates (p &#60; 0.001), and having an illiterate caregiver (p &#60; 0.02) all showed a significant association with permanent cessation of schooling. The study demonstrates significant negative impacts of epilepsy on child education. Notably, the reasons for permanent exclusion from school appear to be as much related to attitudes as to the medical aspects of the disease itself. The data thus highlight the need for educational programs to address the widely prevalent misconceptions among both caregivers and teachers.",Motor Activity;Africa South of the Sahara;Attitude;Child;Epilepsy;Only Child;witchcraft;urine incontinence;teacher;student attitude;sport;social acceptance;Sierra Leone;seizure;school;questionnaire;provocation;physical activity;male;learning disorder;knowledge;interview;human;game;female;feces incontinence;fear;epilepsy;educational status;education;disease severity;descriptive research;cross-sectional study;convulsion;consciousness level;confusion;clinical article;child;caregiver;article;adolescent,"D.B., Ali and M., Tomek and D.R., Lisk",2014.0,0,87
88,Assessment of quality of life of the children and parents affected by inborn errors of metabolism with restricted diet: Preliminary results of a cross-sectional study,"Introduction: The development in therapeutic strategies has increased survival of children affected by inborn errors of metabolism with restricted diet (IEMRD). These diseases have mild- and long-term consequences on the health. Little is known about the impact on the quality of life (QoL) of children and their families. The aims of this study were: to compare the QoL of the children and parents affected by IEMRD with the QoL of the general population and one pathology associated with long-term consequences.Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study was performed at the French Reference Center for inborn metabolic disorders (Marseille, France). Inclusion criteria were: a child with a diagnosis of organic aciduria, urea cycle defect, or maple syrups urine disease (MSUD). Socio-demographics, clinical data, and QoL were recorded.Results: Twenty-one of 32 eligible families were included during a planned routine visit. Ten (47%, 95% CI 27-69%) children were affected by organic aciduria, six (29%, 95% CI 10-48%) by urea cycle defects, and five (24%, 95% CI 6-42%) by MSUD. Among the younger children, the general well-being was significantly lower in the children with IEMRD than in the leukemia children (58 ¬± 16 versus 76 ¬± 15, p = 0.012), and among the older children, the leisure activities were significantly lower in the children with IEMRD than in the leukemia children (29 ¬± 18 versus 62 ¬± 22, p < 10-3), while the relationships with teachers were better (76 ¬± 23 versus 60 ¬± 23, p = 0.01). The physical QoL score was lower in the parents than in the French norms (66 ¬± 21 versus 75 ¬± 1, p = 0.05). Factors modulating QoL were: eating and neurologic disorders, enteral nutrition, and feeding modalities.Conclusion: The children and the parents of children affected presented altered 'physical' and 'social' QoL scores compared with the norms and patients with leukemia and their families. Future studies based on larger cohort studies should determine the different weights of potential predictive factors of QoL. ¬© 2013 Fabre et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Child;Cesarean Section;Only Child;Cross-Sectional Studies;Metabolism, Inborn Errors;Quality of Life;wellbeing;urea cycle disorder;school child;quality of life;psychological well-being;organic aciduria;neurologic disease;maple syrup urine disease;male;leukemia;leisure;inborn error of metabolism;human;gastrostomy;female;enteric feeding;diet restriction;demography;cross-sectional study;clinical article;childhood leukemia;childhood disease;child;body image;article;academic achievement","A., Fabre and K., Baumstarck and A., Cano and A., Loundou and J., Berbis and B., Chabrol and P., Auquier",2013.0,0,88
89,{Rationale and methods of a cluster-randomized controlled trial to promote active and healthy lifestyles among Brazilian students: the ``Fortaleca sua Saude{''} program},"{Background: Interventions on adolescents' lifestyle are important, but the main mechanisms that explain the changes (mediating variables) on lifestyle are unclear. This paper presents the rationale and methods of an intervention program focused on promoting active and healthy lifestyles (especially physical activity {[}PA] practice and reducing screen time) among Brazilian students-the Fortaleca sua Saude program (Portuguese for ``strengthen your health{''}). Methods/Design: This is a school-based cluster-randomized controlled trial. Three intervention and three control (no intervention) full-time public schools were randomly selected in Fortaleza, northeastern Brazil. Students (n = 1,272) from classes in Grades 7-9 were eligible, and 1,085 (548 in the intervention and 537 in control schools) completed the baseline and follow-up measures. The program duration was approximately four months and took place in 2014. Intervention strategies focused on teacher training, activities on health in the curriculum, active opportunities in the school environment (the availability of equipment for PA), and health education (health materials for students and parents). Data collection was undertaken before and immediately after the intervention. The primary variables included the practice of PA (weekly PA volume, PA behavior change stage and preference for PA during leisure-time) and screen time (TV and computer/video games). Potential intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental mediators of PA and screen time were evaluated by a standardized questionnaire. Other lifestyle components (e.g., eating habits, substance use), psychological (e.g., self-rated health, body satisfaction) and biological (general and abdominal obesity) aspects, as well as academic performance were also evaluated in the total sample. Depressive symptoms, eating disorders, sleep quality, objectively-measured PA, and sedentary time were evaluated in obese students. Discussion: If effective, this program will contribute to the development of public policies for the promotion of active and healthy lifestyles in youth, especially those from low- and middle-income countries. The main intrapersonal, interpersonal and/or environmental mediators of PA and screen time may also be indicated. Finally, we anticipate that the proposed strategies may be adaptable to public schools and may even be extended to the entire school system.}",Mass Screening;Life Style;Adolescent;{Adolescent behavior; Intervention; Motor activity; Mediating variables; Mental health; Obesity; Adolescent health; School; Health promotion; Brazil},"Barbosa Filho, Valter Cordeiro and Lopes, Adair da Silva and Lima, Antonio Barroso and de Souza, Evanice Avelino and Gubert, Fabiane do Amaral and Silva, Kelly Samara and Cunha Vieira, Neiva Francenely and Trompieri Filho, Nicolino and de Araujo, Thabyta Silva and Carvalhedo de Bruin, Pedro Felipe and Mota, Jorge and Grp, Fortaleca Sua Saude Working",,0,89
90,Intellectual disability content within tertiary medical curriculum: how is it taught and by whom?,"Individuals with intellectual disability experience higher rates of physical and mental health conditions compared with the general population, yet have inequitable access to health care services. Improving the workplace capacity of medical professionals to meet the needs of this population is one way to reduce barriers to care and improve health outcomes. Using diverse pedagogy appropriate to learning outcomes to teach medical students about intellectual disability is a necessary step in improving future workplace capacity. However, there is a lack of research into how, and by whom, medical students are taught about intellectual disability. The aim of this study was to investigate this through an audit of Australian medical school curricula.
The Deans of Australian universities that provide accredited medical degrees (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ20) were invited by email to participate in a two-phase audit of intellectual disability content in the curricula. Phase 1 (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ14 schools) involved the Dean's delegate completing a telephone interview or questionnaire regarding medical course structure. If intellectual disability content was identified, a unit coordinator was invited to complete a survey regarding how this content was taught and by whom (Phase 2; n‚Äâ=‚Äâ12 schools).
There was considerable variability across Australian medical schools regarding methods used to teach content about intellectual disability. Didactic teaching methods were most frequently used (62% of units included some form of lecture), but workshops and tutorials were reasonably well represented (34% of units contained one or both). Thirty-six percent of units included two or more teaching methods. Almost all schools (83%) used some problem- and/or enquiry-based learning. Educator backgrounds included medicine, nursing, and allied health. A majority of schools (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ9, 75%) involved people with intellectual disability designing and teaching content, but the extent to which this occurred was inconsistent.
Renewing curricula around intellectual disability across all medical schools by introducing varied teaching methods and the inclusion of people with intellectual disability would assist students to develop knowledge, skills, attitudes, and confidence in intellectual disability health. Such renewal offers the potential to reduce barriers to service this population regularly face, thereby improving their health outcomes.","Health Services Accessibility;Teaching methods;Medical training;Medical education;Intellectual disability;Health inequalities;Curriculum;Teaching;Surveys and Questionnaires;Students, Medical;Schools, Medical;Intellectual Disability;Humans;Health Services for Persons with Disabilities;Faculty, Medical;Education, Medical;Curriculum;Australia","Trollor, Julian N and Eagleson, Claire and Turner, Beth and Tracy, Jane and Torr, Jennifer J and Durvasula, Seeta and Iacono, Teresa and Cvejic, Rachael C and Lennox, Nicolas",2018.0,0,90
91,Intellectual disability content within pre-registration nursing curriculum: How is it taught?,"Despite experiencing higher rates of physical and mental health conditions compared with the general population, people with intellectual disability face inequitable access to healthcare services. Improving education of healthcare professionals is one way to reduce these inequalities.
To determine how intellectual disability content is taught within Australian nursing schools.
A two-phase audit of Australian nursing curricula content was conducted using an interview and online survey.
Nursing schools Australia-wide providing pre-registration courses.
For Phase 1, course coordinators from 31 nursing schools completed an interview on course structure. Teaching staff from 15 schools in which intellectual disability content was identified completed an online survey for Phase 2.
Methods used to teach intellectual disability content and who taught the content were audited using an online survey.
Across the 15 schools offering intellectual disability content, lectures were the most common teaching method (82% of units), followed by tutorials (59%), workshops (26%), then other methods (e.g. e-learning; 12%). Approximately three-quarters of intellectual disability teaching used some problem-and/or enquiry-based learning. Only one nursing school involved a person with intellectual disability in delivering teaching content. Six (19%) participating schools identified staff who specialise in intellectual disability, and seven (23%) identified staff with a declared interest in the area.
While some nursing schools are using diverse methods to teach intellectual disability content, many are not; as a result, nursing students may miss out on acquiring the attributes which enable them to address the significant health inequalities faced by this group. A specific deficit was identified relating to inclusive teaching and clinical contact with people with intellectual disability.","Socioeconomic Factors;School Nursing;Teaching methods;Nursing education;Intellectual disability;Health inequalities;Curriculum design;Surveys and Questionnaires;Schools, Nursing;Problem-Based Learning;Intellectual Disability;Humans;Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate;Curriculum;Clinical Competence;Australia","Trollor, Julian N and Eagleson, Claire and Turner, Beth and Salomon, Carmela and Cashin, Andrew and Iacono, Teresa and Goddard, Linda and Lennox, Nicholas",2018.0,0,91
92,Perceived barriers and facilitators to participation in physical activity for children with disability: a qualitative study.,"Children with disability engage in less physical activity compared to their typically developing peers. Our aim was to explore the barriers and facilitators to participation in physical activity for this group.
Ten focus groups, involving 63 participants (23 children with disability, 20 parents of children with disability and 20 sport and recreation staff), were held to explore factors perceived as barriers and facilitators to participation in physical activity by children with disability. Data were analysed thematically by two researchers.
Four themes were identified: (1) similarities and differences, (2) people make the difference, (3) one size does not fit all, and (4) communication and connections. Key facilitators identified were the need for inclusive pathways that encourage ongoing participation as children grow or as their skills develop, and for better partnerships between key stakeholders from the disability, sport, education and government sectors. Children with disabilities' need for the early attainment of motor and social skills and the integral role of their families in supporting them were considered to influence their participation in physical activity. Children with disability were thought to face additional barriers to participation compared to children with typical development including a lack of instructor skills and unwillingness to be inclusive, negative societal attitudes towards disability, and a lack of local opportunities.
The perspectives gathered in this study are relevant to the many stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of effective interventions, strategies and policies to promote participation in physical activity for children with disability. We outline ten strategies for facilitating participation.",Only Child;Motor Activity;Sports;Social Support;Social Skills;Qualitative Research;Perception;Parents;Motor Skills;Male;Humans;Focus Groups;Female;Exercise;Disabled Children;Child;Adolescent,"Shields, Nora and Synnot, Anneliese",2016.0,0,92

However, there are considerable challenges for all stakeholders involved-especially youth athletes-in trying to maintain inclusive, sustainable and enjoyable participation and success for all levels of individual athletic achievement. In an effort to advance a more unified, evidence-informed approach to youth athlete development, the IOC critically evaluated the current state of science and practice of youth athlete development and presented recommendations for developing healthy, resilient and capable youth athletes, while providing opportunities for all levels of sport participation and success. The IOC further challenges all youth and other sport governing bodies to embrace and implement these recommended guiding principles.","Sports;Training;Sport;Children;Athlete;Adolescent;Youth Sports;Stress, Psychological;Sports Medicine;Sleep;Sex Offenses;Puberty;Phytosterols;Physical Fitness;Physical Education and Training;Physical Abuse;Oxygen Consumption;Nutrition Disorders;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscle Strength;Male;Humans;Health Status;Female;Fatigue;Exercise;Environment;Diosgenin;Clinical Competence;Chronic Disease;Child;Athletic Performance;Athletic Injuries;Aptitude;Adolescent Development;Adolescent;Acute Disease","Bergeron, Michael F and Mountjoy, Margo and Armstrong, Neil and Chia, Michael and C√¥t√©, Jean and Emery, Carolyn A and Faigenbaum, Avery and Hall, Gary and Kriemler, Susi and L√©glise, Michel and Malina, Robert M and Pensgaard, Anne Marte and Sanchez, Alex and Soligard, Torbj√∏rn and Sundgot-Borgen, Jorunn and van Mechelen, Willem and Weissensteiner, Juanita R and Engebretsen, Lars",2015.0,0,93
94,Recreation programming for adolescent girls: rationale and foundations.,"The purpose of this article is to share current literature about adolescent girls and the potential for recreation programming. Using the assumption that something happens to girls at the age of adolescence from which they spend years trying to recover, we offer some ways that recreation programmers might address these challenges. The goal of this programming is positive youth development. Almost all girls growing up in our society today have to address three critical issues: social contradictions, body changes, and sexuality. Recreation programming may have some implications for coming to grips with these issues and turning them into positive youth development. Those girls who are not able to successfully negotiate these challenges chance becoming high-risk individuals. Unfortunately, a risk behavior may compromise psychosocial issues of successful adolescent development, and the risk behaviors that disproportionately affect girls are often not taken into consideration. Some of the behaviors more salient for girls that may make them high risk include depression, eating disorders, and pre- or posttraumatic stress reactions to sexual or physical assaults. Pipher (1994) indicated that girls can be ""saved"" by a good school, a good teacher, and/or a meaningful activity. Recreation programmers can provide that meaningful activity if the developmental needs of girls are taken into account. In general, girls need causes and interests larger than their own lives to get beyond the societal expectations that may unconsciously restrict them. Recreation can be a means for girls to resist negative societal messages, fear of body changes, and lack of perceived control in their lives. When teens attempt to move beyond their TV sets, they often have few places where they are welcome. We need places for girls to go - ball fields, gyms, community centers, halls, and places to play music and ""hang out"" with friends. They need no-cost, informally supervised places where they can be together to talk, dance, and play. The challenges for recreation providers include increasing visibility, providing information effectively, staffing with positive role models, adopting policies of inclusion, advocacy, and giving youth chances to exert leadership in developing a sense of control over their leisure. Growing up female in the millennium is a challenge that recreation programmers must address.",INTEREST (Psychology);Management;HUMAN services;NEEDS;GIRLS;RESTRICTIONS;*PARTICIPATION;TEENAGERS;*SELF-esteem;*SPORTS;*LEISURE,"Henderson, K.A. and King, K.",1998.0,0,94
95,Empowering Adults With Chronic Spinal Cord Injury to Prevent Secondary Conditions.,"To develop and assess the feasibility of My Care My Call, an innovative peer-led, community-based telephone intervention for individuals with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) using peer health coaches.
Qualitative pilot study.
General community.
Convenience sample of consumer advocates with traumatic SCI ‚â•1 year postinjury (N=7).
My Care My Call applies a health empowerment approach for goal-setting support, education, and referral to empower consumers in managing their preventive health needs. For feasibility testing, peer health coaches, trained in brief action planning, called participants 6 times over 3 weeks.
Identified focus areas were acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality. Participant outcome data were collected through brief after-call surveys and qualitative exit interviews. Through a custom website, peer health coaches documented call attempts, content, and feedback. Analysis applied the constant comparative method.
My Care My Call was highly feasible in each focus area for participants. Concerning acceptability, participants were highly satisfied, rating peer health coaches as very good or excellent in 80% of calls; felt My Care My Call was appropriate; and would continue use. Regarding demand, participants completed 88% of scheduled calls; reported that My Care My Call fills a real need; and would recommend it. Considering implementation, peer health coaches made 119% of expected calls, with a larger focus on compiling individualized resources. For practicality, call duration averaged 29 minutes, with 1 hour of additional time for peer health coaches. Participant effects included feeling supported, greater confidence toward goals, and greater connection to resources. Subsequently, several process changes enhanced peer health coach training and support through role-plays, regular support calls, and streamlined My Care My Call support materials.
After process changes, a randomized controlled trial to evaluate My Care My Call is underway.",Telemedicine;Spinal Cord Injuries;Rehabilitation;Feasibility studies;Community-based participatory research;Telephone;Spinal Cord Injuries;Self Care;Secondary Prevention;Program Evaluation;Power (Psychology);Pilot Projects;Physical Therapy Modalities;Peer Group;Patient Education as Topic;Middle Aged;Male;Humans;Goals;Female;Adult,"Houlihan, Bethlyn Vergo and Everhart-Skeels, Sarah and Gutnick, Damara and Pernigotti, Diana and Zazula, Judi and Brody, Miriam and Burnett, Sam and Mercier, Hannah and Hasiotis, Stathis and Green, Christa and Seetharama, Subramani and Belliveau, Timothy and Rosenblum, David and Jette, Alan",2016.0,0,95
96,Simply academic? Why children with special educational needs don‚Äôt like school,"International studies have raised concerns about the academic and social implications of inclusive policies on school engagement and successful learning and, in particular, on the ways in which friendships are formed between students with SEN and other students. This article stems from research findings which show that Irish children with special educational needs like school less than their peers without SEN in mainstream settings. Using data from a large scale longitudinal study of 8578 9-year-olds, this paper uses a child centred research approach to investigate why this is the case particularly when they are in receipt of supports. To do this, we focus on processes underlying their dislike of school such as their academic engagement and social/peer relations. We measure academic engagement by looking at their interest in the subjects mathematics and reading and the extent to which they complete their homework. We examine the social/peer relations of students with special educational needs by assessing the extent to which they report liking their teacher. Using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) Scale and the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale we also examine the nature of peer relations among children with special educational needs in mainstream settings. Both academic engagement and social engagement play a central role in understanding the broader school engagement of children with special educational needs. By simultaneously examining the role of academic and social relations in shaping the engagement of children with SEN, the analysis provides a unique opportunity to fundamentally assess the barriers to true inclusion for children with special needs.","Education, Special;Child;Longitudinal Studies;Only Child;visual impairment;speech disorder;special education;social interaction;school child;school;rating scale;priority journal;Piers Harris Self Concept Scale;physical disability;peer group;mathematics;male;major clinical study;longitudinal study;learning disorder;learning;human;hearing impairment;health care policy;health care need;female;controlled study;child;article","S., McCoy and J., Banks",2012.0,0,96
97,Correlates of psychosocial adjustment in deaf adolescents with and without cochlear implants: A preliminary investigation,"The number of children who have received cochlear implants (CIs) has increased dramatically in the past two decades. In view of potential concerns about their psychosocial adjustment, our aim was to assess the effect of implants on the adolescents‚Äô psychosocial functioning among a group of 57 deaf adolescents with and without CIs, using published and validated measures completed by the adolescents themselves, their parents, and teachers. Adolescents with CI tended to be more hearing acculturated, whereas those without CI tended to be more Deaf acculturated. Despite some differences in background characteristics between the two groups, there were no differences between them on the psychosocial variables assessed in this study, regardless of the reporting sources. Rather than having a direct effect on the psychosocial outcomes assessed in this study, it is through the mediating effect of acculturation and school setting that CI status exerts an influence over many of this study‚Äôs outcomes. Recommendations for future research are made in light of our findings.

98,POWERS forID: Personalized Online Weight and Exercise Response System for Individuals with Intellectual Disability: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. Adults with ID exhibit higher rates of obesity and poorer health status compared to the general population. Continuity of care and barriers to health-related activities may contribute to the poorer health status observed in this population. To address this problem, a tailored weight management online health information and communication technology platform, known as POWERSforID, was developed and is being tested to determine if this delivery mechanism can improve weight maintenance/weight loss in adults with ID.
Obese adults with mild-to-moderate ID (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ70) are randomized to the POWERS forID intervention or control group for a 24-week trial. Each group undergoes an assessment that includes body weight, waist circumference, and percent body fat at baseline and at weeks 6, 12, and 24. Physical activity barriers, healthy eating barriers, food frequency, and psychosocial wellbeing are measured at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24. Blood lipids are assessed at baseline and 24¬†weeks. Participants randomized to POWERS forID receive access to the POWERS forID website and calls from a health coach (weekly during weeks 1-12, biweekly during weeks 13-24). The health coach employs motivational interviewing techniques adapted for individuals with ID to promote behavior change. Participants randomized to the control group receive standard clinical weight-loss care. Differences in weight, waist circumference, blood lipids, percent body fat, and psychosocial self-report will be assessed. Barriers and facilitators of implementation as well as perception of study outcomes will be conducted via qualitative analysis.
POWERS forID is a novel information and communication technology platform designed to address health needs for adults with ID. This article describes the development and components of POWERS forID. The overall aim is to assess usability and feasibility of POWERS forID for promoting weight loss for obese adults with ID over the course of a 24-week randomized control trial.

99,A heart to learn and care? Teachers' responses toward special needs children in mainstream schools in Hong Kong,"Examined the problems associated with introducing integrated education into Hong Kong's mainstream schooling system. The research objectives were to examine the experience of 224 teachers in teaching children with special needs in mainstream schools; to examine the attitude of mainstream teachers towards integrated education, and explore whether the differences in perception of difficulties and attitudes are attributable to types of disability and availability of resources. This was achieved through a research strategy utilizing a questionnaire survey combined with individual and group interviews. Results show a clear hierarchy of preference amongst teachers in relation to special needs children. Students with a learning disability and/or behavioral problems pose more challenges to teachers than those with a physical difficulty. Teachers in schools with extra funding provisions, teachers trained to teach special needs children, additional counselling resources and specialist support expressed more accepting attitudes towards children with special needs and their admission into mainstream schools. Resource classes did not exert a positive effect on acceptance.

101,Overcoming the barriers to including students with visual impairments and deaf-blindness in physical education,"Highlights major barriers that impede the inclusion of students with visual impairments in physical education and to provide strategies for overcoming these barriers. The authors primarily address students with visual impairments, but the barriers and solutions present are also applicable to students who are deaf-blind. Data were collected from surveys completed by more than 170 physical education teachers throughout New York State who attended workshops on how to include children who are blind in physical education. Teachers' barriers included a lack of professional preparation; curriculum and activities provided in general physical education classes; pace of the lessons; and fear, overprotection, and limited expectations. Students' barriers included parental overprotection, lack of opportunities, and lack of confidence. Administrative barriers included time, lack of appropriate equipment, and blanket medical excuses.

103,"Relationships between Physical Education (PE) Teaching and Student Self-Efficacy, Aptitude to Participate in PE and Functional Skills: With a Special Focus on Students with Disabilities","Background: Students with disability show an increasing incidence of school failure. Quality teaching and appropriate support may foster high self-efficacy, a predictive factor for successful school outcomes. Physical Education (PE) can provide students with a context in which self-efficacy and participation are promoted leading to improved academic achievement. The transition into secondary school can be challenging for many students with increased educational demands, developmental changes and individual social identification coinciding. A disability may add to the challenge of success. Methods: Three groups of students, aged 13 years and enrolled in Swedish mainstream schools were targeted (n = 439). Groups included students with (1)¬†A diagnosed disability, (2)¬†Low grades in PE (D-F), and (3)¬†High grades (A-C) in PE. Questionnaires were collected and analyzed from 30/439 students with a diagnosed disability (physical, neuro-developmental and intellectual) from 26 classes, their classmates and their PE-teachers (n = 25). Relationships between student self-reports and PE-teachers' self-ratings were investigated. Also examined was the potential to which students' functional skills could predict elevated general school self-efficacy, PE specific self-efficacy and aptitude to participate in PE. Results were compared with the total sample and between the three target groups (n = 121). Results: For students with disabilities, better self-rated teaching skills were related to lower student perceived general school self-efficacy, PE specific self-efficacy and aptitude to participate in PE. The impact of classroom climate in PE was more obvious among students with disabilities. Perceived functional skills were associated with elevated general school self-efficacy, PE specific self-efficacy and aptitude to participate in PE. Better socio-cognitive functional skills had an overall positive effect on all outcomes. Students with disabilities reported results similar to the total sample, the D-F group scored lower and the A-C group higher than the total sample and the disability group. Elevated self-efficacy in PE is six times less probable in students with disabilities, compared to the A-C group. Conclusions: Our findings that better teacher planning and grading skills, are detrimental to students disadvantaged by disability is contradictive. Improving the establishment and communication of adapted learning standards at the transition to secondary school is a crucial and a predictive factor for promoting positive school experiences for students with disability. Students with disabilities need to be assured that the intended learning outcomes can be reached by doing activities differently than their typically functioning peers. Consideration of class composition is suggested as a means of promoting a positive learning climate, which would particularly benefit students with disabilities. Allocation of resources to support student socio-cognitive skills would improve experiences for the D-F group and likely promote a positive learning environment.",Physical Education and Training;Sweden;Statistical Analysis;Measures (Individuals);Check Lists;Foreign Countries;Teaching Skills;Correlation;Aptitude;Skills;Self Concept;Physical Education Teachers;Questionnaires;High Achievement;Low Achievement;Mainstreaming;Secondary School Students;Self Efficacy;Physical Education;Disabilities,"Bertills, Karin and Granlund, Mats and Dahlstr√∂m, √ñrjan and Augustine, Lilly",2018.0,0,103

This qualitative study primarily used the in-depth interviews of students, augmented by brief interviews with Heads of Education Support, parents, aides and teachers. Students attributed difficulties to time available, accessing e-print and large format materials, assistive technology and access, and exclusion from classes of science, mathematics, and physical education in particular. In Australia, there is an expectation that legally mandated adjustments for students with disabilities will enable equitable, quality, and inclusive education. This was not evident in the experiences of the students in this study. Having aide support did not prevent exclusionary practices.

105,Attitudes of teachers towards inclusion of students with disabilities in physical education: Validity of the ATIPDPE-R instrument in Polish cultural context.,"Background: Following the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools worldwide, legislative changes have recently been introduced in Poland, facilitating educational inclusion of individuals with disabilities. However, practical implementation still requires further action. Attitudes are a major determinant of teachers' behavior. Therefore, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, the instrument Attitudes Toward Teaching Individuals with Physical Disabilities in Physical Education (ATIPDPE) has been developed, and adapted to cultural contexts in several countries (e.g. South Africa, Slovenia, and Greece). Objectives: The aim of this study was to estimate construct validity of the revised ATIPDPE-R instrument to the Polish cultural context (ATIPDPE-R-PL), in order to prepare a reliable scale to measure the attitudes of physical education (PE) teachers towards teaching students with physical disabilities in general PE classes. Methods: Participants were 158 in-service PE teachers (100 women and 58 men, range of age from 25 to 60, from primary and secondary schools) from Polish schools. Construct validity was obtained throughout the principal component analysis method (PCA). Reliability was estimated through Cronbach's alpha coefficient, where the value of at least .7 was accepted as satisfactory. Results: Based on the analysis, the attitudinal scale of ATIPDPE-R-PL measured three psychological components, which came from the PCA, and explained 66% of the variance similar to the original scale. Conclusions: The three components were positive and negative outcomes for students and negative outcomes for teachers, however items in each component varied from the original scale.

106,Inclusive and Accessible Physical Education: Rethinking Ability and Disability in Pre-Service Teacher Education,"This paper identifies and explores emergent themes in inclusive PE in the specific context of pre-service teacher preparation programs. Fully inclusive PE encompasses four areas: knowledge and curricula related to ability and disability, teacher attitudes, pre-service teacher education and a reframing of our understandings of multiple perspectives on physical literacy. Fully accessible PE involves material and attitudinal conditions configured to render these programs actually usable by all those whose 'inclusion' is intended. Access is, indeed, conceptually implied in 'inclusion', however, in practice the latter can easily become more of a slogan naming an aspiration than a realizable state of affairs. Unless an organization or individual brings a universal commitment to access, attitudinal barriers may prevent full inclusion from becoming a reality. The paper uses qualitative case study methodology to examine pre-service teacher education students' preconceptions about 'dis'ability and analyses heuristically how pre-service teachers pre-conceived notions of ability and disability may be challenged through an intervention. 21C PE programs can move towards an emphasis on inclusive activities which are not based on traditional conceptions of physical competence, size, shape, appearance and ability, but instead focus on how all bodies can develop fundamental movement skills, functional fitness and physical literacy. The author challenges pre-service students to address issues of accessibility, normative notions of ability, body equity, social justice and inclusion, as well as the need for multiple definitions of physical literacy. The paper is a case study of the specific phenomenon of 'broadening student teachers' understandings of ability and disability in PE' as a necessary condition for preparing students to work in schools where full inclusion may not have been integral to PE policies, programs and practices.",Physical Education and Training;Canada;Foreign Countries;Adapted Physical Education;Student Teacher Attitudes;Pretests Posttests;Video Technology;Computer Mediated Communication;Focus Groups;Program Descriptions;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Teacher Attitudes;Knowledge Base for Teaching;Accessibility (for Disabled);Inclusion;Preservice Teacher Education;Preservice Teachers;Physical Education,"Barber, Wendy",2018.0,0,106
107,Factors Influencing the Accessibility of Education for Children with Disabilities in India,"The Central and State governments in India have formulated programs and policies over the years for children with disabilities in order to help them to enter mainstream society. However, despite these policies, children with disabilities are amongst the most disadvantaged in terms of access to schooling and completion of elementary education, as their needs are not met effectively. Based on my personal experiences, research, and communication with different stakeholders involved in the field of education for children with disabilities over the last 30 years, this paper explores the broader challenges in the current education system with respect to issues of quality of education and drop-out rates of primary students with disabilities. A number of factors that influence the accessibility of education for children with disabilities are presented including: perceptions of parents of children with disabilities and their difficulties in helping their children with disabilities, the general attitude of society, government officials, school staff and infrastructure, inadequate levels of training of key stakeholders, invisibility of disability in community, poverty, lack of acceptance, lack of interest, gender discrimination, lack of awareness, poor physical access, availability of various support systems, and government policies focusing on the education of children with disabilities in specific.",State Government;Child;Only Child;Disabled Children;India;Poverty;Teacher Attitudes;Social Bias;Civil Rights;Public Opinion;Disability Discrimination;School Personnel;Government Role;Social Attitudes;Parent Attitudes;Educational Quality;Equal Education;Dropout Rate;Barriers;Educational Policy;Disabilities;Access to Education;Foreign Countries,"Limaye, Sandhya",2016.0,0,107

In addition, inclusion can have benefits for students without disabilities. The West African nation of Senegal has pledged to increase inclusive education for students with disabilities by 2015. Issues that affect inclusive education for all in Senegal are access to schooling, community and societal perceptions of individuals with disabilities, poverty, and teacher training and pedagogy. To increase inclusive education for all in Senegal the country must increase access to schooling through physical accessibility and decentralization, create community awareness campaigns that increase knowledge of disabilities, and develop teacher training that fosters a student-centered pedagogy.",Teaching;Self Concept;Senegal;Senegal (Dakar);Senegal (Dakar);Foreign Countries;Elementary Secondary Education;Social Influences;Cultural Influences;Delivery Systems;Educational Quality;Public Opinion;Administrator Attitudes;Teacher Attitudes;Position Papers;Content Analysis;Interviews;Classroom Observation Techniques;Focus Groups;Needs Assessment;Special Needs Students;Teacher Improvement;Teacher Education;Student Centered Curriculum;Poverty;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Case Studies;Comparative Analysis;Inclusion;Accessibility (for Disabled);Access to Education;Disabilities,"Drame, Elizabeth R. and Kamphoff, Kaytie",2014.0,0,108
109,Attitudes of Pre-Service Mainstream Teachers in Singapore towards People with Disabilities and Inclusive Education,"2004 has come to be seen by many in Singapore as a watershed year with the shift in the position of the government towards encouraging greater integration of students with disabilities in mainstream settings. This study investigated the attitudes of 1538 mainstream pre-service teachers towards disability and inclusive education during this period of policy change. Analysis of the data indicated that the pre-service teachers had little or no knowledge and experience with disability, and generally possessed negative attitudes towards people with disabilities. They evinced ambivalent feelings towards inclusive education, and expressed a preference for special school placements for students with disabilities. While they were open to the inclusion of students with social or communication difficulties, they were not favourable to including students with physical disabilities, sensory impairment, learning disabilities and behavioural problems in mainstream settings. Implications of these findings were discussed and recommendations were made for the inclusion of training in special education at both pre-service and in-service levels.",integration; disability; teacher training; pre-service teacher attitude; Singapore,"Thaver, Thana; Lim, Levan",2014.0,0,109
110,Pedagogies for Inclusion of Junior Primary Students with Disabilities in PE,"Background: Laws and legislation have prompted movement from special education towards inclusive education, whereby students with disabilities are included in mainstream physical education (PE) classes. It is widely acknowledged that including students with disabilities in PE presents significant challenges in relation to meeting the diverse needs of all students. Significantly, little is known about how teachers include junior primary students with a disability in PE. Aims: This paper aims to explore pedagogical practices for the inclusion of junior primary students with disabilities in PE as well as environmental accommodations teachers make. In order to address these aims, the research undertaking was guided by the question: ""What pedagogies do teachers draw upon to include junior primary students with disabilities in PE""? Methods: This qualitative research undertaking incorporated a critical case study approach, which utilised semi-structured interviews and field observations as data collection tools. Three teachers of PE in primary schools located in Adelaide, South Australia, participated in the research undertaking. Given this small sample group we make no claims for generalisability, but seek to provide connections for others teaching in PE. Results: Findings are presented in three general themes of: ""Relationships for inclusion, Practices of Inclusion and Complexity and inclusion. Participants' statements are used to illuminate discussions about discourses drawn on and to make links between previous research and theoretical perspectives. In general terms, findings revealed that despite barriers, such as catering for multiple forms of disabilities with minimal assistance from support staff and negotiating school environments, participants embraced inclusion and made pedagogical modifications to ensure meaningful involvement in PE lessons for all students. This research also identified the important role teachers play in terms of relationships, adaptations and safe learning environments, which collectively enable the inclusion of junior primary students with disabilities.

111,What Does Teachers' Perception Have to Do with Inclusive Education: A Bahamian Context,"Bahamian classrooms are comprised of students with varying disabilities (emotional, physical, mental, and learning), and these students are failing to meet the requirements of their various grade levels due to inadequate interventions critical to addressing their individual needs. For these needs to be met in mainstream classrooms, Inclusive Education is inevitable. Consequently, a qualitative phenomenological study was conducted to survey perceptions of primary school teachers towards this practice. The sample included teachers from various schools within New Providence, The Bahamas. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews. Responses were qualitatively analyzed for themes and main concepts through open-coding. The study emphasizes the need to recognize teachers' perceptions towards inclusive education as a fundamental aspect of the practice's success in primary schools. Findings indicated that ninety percent of the teachers interviewed expressed negative perceptions of inclusive education. It was also revealed that the most prevalent influencing factors of the teachers' negative perceptions were lack of training in special education and inclusive education, and lack of resources. Twenty percent of the teachers expressed positive perceptions of inclusive education, stating however, that the success of such a practice depends greatly upon a myriad of elements.",Bahamas;Bahamas;Foreign Countries;Change Strategies;Mainstreaming;Accessibility (for Disabled);Class Size;Educational Resources;Teacher Education;Teaching Experience;Gender Differences;Performance Factors;Best Practices;Educational Practices;Semi Structured Interviews;Elementary School Teachers;Phenomenology;Qualitative Research;Teacher Attitudes;Inclusion,"Hunter-Johnson, Yvonne and Newton, Norissa G.

112,To Assist or Not to Assist? A Study of Teachers' Views of the Roles of Learning Support Assistants in the Provision of Inclusive Physical Education in England,"This paper examines teachers' perceptions of their working relationships with learning support assistants (LSAs) when seeking to incorporate young disabled people and pupils with special educational needs (SEN) within mainstream physical education (PE), an area that has been a largely neglected aspect of research in inclusive education. The findings indicate that teachers spoke positively of these relationships when LSAs were perceived as making a positive contribution to the development of pupils' learning and when they supported teachers as they did in other school subjects. Conversely, when LSAs and other support staff failed to provide teachers with information that was related to pupils' needs in PE, and when LSAs did not possess the required skills, knowledge and expertise of the subject, teachers were rather critical of their relationships with them. In this regard, LSAs were seen as placing a particularly significant constraint on teachers' ability to meet the needs of pupils in PE lessons. It is concluded that teachers' perceptions of the constraints they experience from working with LSAs to help support pupils, and the extent and quality of support they receive, cannot be understood adequately unless they are located within the context of the relational constraints experienced by teachers.

Questions concerned the knowledge about the different kinds of disability, the acceptance of children with special needs in regular classes, the willingness of PE students to work with children with special needs, the objective of special education, and the sources of information about the topic. Results showed that mental retardation was recognized by the highest percentage of students, however, mental retardation was often confused with the general issue of special needs. Disability was correlated with the need for education in special schools. The partial awareness about special needs is related to the moderate willingness of the PE students to work with children with disabilities in their classroom. Assigning children with special needs to regular classes was not yet a familiar issue, due to insufficient information from popular sources. The findings of the study suggest that the limited awareness about schools, special education and integration cannot be dealt only with university efforts. Systematic information and interaction is needed in order to improve the knowledge and attitudes towards children with special needs.

114,"Creating Disability Awareness through Sport: Exploring the Participation, Attitudes and Perceptions of Post-Primary Female Students in Ireland","According to research, negative attitudes and perceptions towards people with disabilities begin to emerge early in one's development creating one of the most difficult barriers encountered by children with disabilities; those expressed by their peers. As a result, young people may begin to label others around them, differentiating between the disabled and the non-disabled. From a physical education (PE) perspective, offering disability awareness experiences to young people through sport is one way in which to positively influence how children understand disability themselves. The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed description of post-primary students' reactions to a disability awareness experience using extended contact theory, Sport Education and the disability sport of sit-volleyball as the framework. Findings suggest that participating in a disability sport was found to be favourable amongst the students. So much so, students expressed an interest in further disability sport experiences as part of their regular PE curriculum. Given the recent announcement by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for the design and implementation of short courses at the junior cycle level, these findings may offer suggestions for teachers on how include other disability awareness experiences at the post-primary level.",Child;Awareness;Only Child;Physical Education and Training;Disabled Persons;Sports;Ireland;Ireland;Focus Groups;Observation;Questionnaires;Peer Relationship;Regular and Special Education Relationship;Student Participation;Team Sports;Inclusion;Single Sex Schools;Foreign Countries;Secondary School Students;Females;Attitude Change;Athletics;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Consciousness Raising,"Tindall, Daniel",2013.0,0,114
115,Perceptions of the Impact of a PEP Grant on Elementary Physical Education Programs in One School District,"A school district received a Physical Education for Progress grant (PEP). PEP grants are part of the Carol M. White Program and are administered by the U.S. Department of Education. These grants are available to local educational agencies to initiate, expand, or improve physical education (PE) programs. The purpose of this study was to determine the perception of the impact of the PEP grant on PE programs of four elementary schools in one school district through interviews with teachers and principals. Qualitative data analysis procedures were used to explore views on how the PEP grant had impacted PE programs. Several themes emerged during the interviews, including (a) the development of an expanded and innovative curriculum, (b) the inclusion of children with special needs, (c) increased motivation levels in students and teachers, (d) a focus on interdisciplinary teaching, (e) increased use of technology, and (f) the PE teachers becoming leaders in the school and district.","Financing, Organized;Physical Education and Training;Elementary and Secondary Education Act;Georgia;Elementary Secondary Education Act;Georgia;Qualitative Research;Teacher Improvement;Rural Schools;Instructional Leadership;Technology Integration;Educational Technology;Interdisciplinary Approach;Motivation;Disabilities;Special Needs Students;Inclusion;Educational Innovation;Curriculum Development;Program Effectiveness;Principals;Administrator Attitudes;Elementary Schools;Teacher Attitudes;Interviews;Educational Improvement;Federal Programs;Grants;Physical Education","Elliott, Steven and McCollum, Starla and Colquitt, Gavin and Pritchard, Tony",2013.0,0,115
116,The School Experiences of Children with Epilepsy: A Phenomenological Study,"In Canada, approximately three out of every 1,000 children have epilepsy, making it one of the most commonly diagnosed neurological conditions affecting children. It is therefore highly probable that educators will work with this population at some point in their careers. Epilepsy is linked to academic underachievement and social isolation, but little is known about how students with epilepsy experience school, making their unique needs less familiar to school personnel. The purpose of this phenomenological study is to identify the school experiences of children with epilepsy. Specifically, this study identified children's perceptions and experiences of having epilepsy at school and acquired insights to inform future studies. Participants were six students (ages 7-12 years) who have a diagnosis of epilepsy and reside in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Data were gathered through open-ended, semi-structured interviews. These interviews were transcribed and analyzed to obtain the essential experiences of school children with epilepsy. Four categories emerged from these interviews: (a) seizures, (b) academics, (c) social belonging and (d) awareness. Implications for schools and directions for future research are discussed.

117,"From the Trenches: Secondary Content Teachers and IEP, Inclusion Students","Secondary content teachers want to accommodate their special education students. They know that their classrooms provide the ""least restrictive environment"" specified by Public Law 94-142. They understand that inclusion is federally mandated and, even more importantly, often seen as necessary for teens to reach their full potential as students and as successful adults. But these teachers face many obstacles, frequently with little or no assistance. Among those obstacles: normal loads of 160 to 180 students; lack of notification of students with IEPs or 504 plans; shortage of inclusion teachers; only a single, broad introductory course in exceptional children. In addition, the bottom line, made clear by the administration, is that they must adhere to pacing guides and prepare students to pass the end-of-course exams to meet the No Child Left Behind requirements. Inclusion must be more than a physical reassignment of students from one classroom to another; to succeed it must include a school-wide philosophical commitment, and it must provide assistance to the secondary content teachers in the trenches. Following a review of literature, this article describes four criteria for successful inclusion (full commitment, in-service training, collaborative planning and teaching, and implementation of research-based, challenging practices) and three impediments to program success.",No Child Left Behind Act 2001;Education for All Handicapped Children Act;Education for All Handicapped Children Act;No Child Left Behind Act 2001;Educational Quality;Equal Education;Federal Legislation;Educational Legislation;Elementary Secondary Education;Evidence Based Practice;Cooperative Planning;Inservice Teacher Education;Persistence;Teacher Attitudes;Teacher Qualifications;Barriers;Regular and Special Education Relationship;Secondary School Teachers;Mainstreaming;Inclusion;Disabilities,"Ginger, Jan",2006.0,0,117

The leadership experience can improve a student's self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-perception, and it is important for all students, including those with disabilities, to have this experience. Leadership opportunities can be provided by teachers and other professionals in a variety of ways, even during physical education class.

120,Emotional Connections and Caring: Ethical Teachers of Physical Education,"The field of physical education (PE), as it exists in teacher education, is dynamic as ways of preparing teachers to meet the needs of young people in contemporary times change. Such endeavours are underpinned by concerns about school-based PE, the alienation of students from PE, and responsibility for producing healthy students. Concerns also exist around a perceived propensity amongst pre-service teachers of PE to steadfastly retain initial beliefs and values and resist more socially critical perspectives and pedagogies. An engagement with socially critical discourses in teacher education is critical if PE is to be a site of inclusion rather than marginalisation and exclusion. This paper examines how a group of pre-service teachers of PE, who experienced a teacher education programme, at an Australian university, that was infused with strong social justice discourses constituted subjectivities and pedagogical practices. We explore how, emotional connectivity, and an ""ethic of care"", instil broadened perspectives and engagement with socially critical pedagogical practices. Whilst emotions and caring are generally perceived as marginal attributes in the field of PE, we suggest that the affective domain is significant to effective pedagogical practices, subjectivities of teachers of PE and the reality of teaching. We seek to trouble ""truths"" disseminated by hegemonic discourses that construct PE teaching as a technical undertaking, founded on disciplinary knowledge and curricular expertise. We close by providing possibilities for others working with PE pre-service teachers around foregrounding affective dimensions of pedagogical practices and teacher subjectivities and propose that these possibilities might address calls for a new type of PE teacher.",Emotions;Physical Education and Training;Australia;Australia;Teaching Methods;Affective Behavior;Student Needs;Social Attitudes;Focus Groups;Semi Structured Interviews;Emotional Response;Ethics;Foreign Countries;Caring;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Social Justice;Student Teacher Attitudes;Preservice Teachers;Inclusion;Preservice Teacher Education;Physical Education Teachers;Physical Education,"Wrench, Alison and Garrett, Robyne",2015.0,0,120
121,Using Self-Efficacy Theory to Facilitate Inclusion in General Physical Education,"Self-efficacy, a situational form of self confidence, is critical in the success of all professionals, including physical education teachers. Most physical educators have confidence in their ability to teach fitness, motor skills, and sport and health concepts. However, their self-efficacy often declines when they face the need to include a student with a disability in a general physical education (GPE) class. This is not surprising, since most physical education teachers have had only one adapted physical education class during their undergraduate training and very little experience with inclusion. The purpose of this article is to show how Bandura's social cognitive theory can help GPE teachers to develop higher levels of self-efficacy in order to successfully include students with disabilities in their classes.",Physical Education and Training;Psychological Patterns;Experience;Teacher Competencies;Social Cognition;Disabilities;Special Needs Students;Mainstreaming;Inclusive Schools;Social Theories;Physical Education Teachers;Self Efficacy;Adapted Physical Education,"Block, Martin and Taliaferro, Andrea and Harris, Natasha and Krause, Jennifer",2010.0,0,121
122,Stories about Physical Education from Young People with Disabilities,"This article focuses on young people with disabilities and mainstream physical education in England. Within this context there have been unprecedented levels of funding and resources directed towards physical education in order to support more inclusive physical education experiences for all young people, including those with disabilities. Physical education holds a unique place within the school curriculum; it is a subject area where the physicality of students is publicly exposed to others (including teachers, classmates, and support staff). There are likely to be some tensions around physical education and its relationship with students with disabilities. In particular, it is claimed that physical education was conceived of, and continues to be practiced, in a normative way. By drawing on interview data from three young people with disabilities, non-fictional narratives are used to re-present their identities at the intersections of schooling, physical education and disability. These narratives offer insights about how physical education impacts on various aspects of social life including home, family, friends and other school subjects.",Disabled Persons;Physical Education and Training;United Kingdom (England);England;Friendship;Family Environment;Social Attitudes;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Personal Narratives;Interviews;Inclusion;Mainstreaming;Foreign Countries;Young Adults;Disabilities;Social Life;Physical Education,"Fitzgerald, Hayley and Stride, Annette",2012.0,0,122
123,Teachers' Perspectives and Experiences of the Contexts of Social Inclusion within Elementary School Classrooms in Canada and China,"This study examined the contexts of social inclusion within elementary school classrooms in Canada and China. Based on interviews, classroom teachers in two metropolitan cities in Canada and China reported their perspectives and experiences with regard to: (a) the state of social inclusion in general; (b) places where social inclusion took place the most; (c) activities which generated the most social inclusion; and (d) places where social inclusion was most challenged. The results showed that: Social inclusion was only half fulfilled in both countries; the classroom was the main place for social inclusion; physical education and group work generated the most inclusion while academic areas proved the challenging aspect of social inclusion. There were, however, cross-national differences along these perspectives. Implications for educational practice and research aimed at improving social inclusion are discussed.",Physical Education and Training;China;Canada;China;Canada;Disabilities;Educational Practices;Questionnaires;Group Activities;Physical Education;Classroom Environment;Cultural Differences;Cross Cultural Studies;Barriers;Learning Activities;Interpersonal Relationship;Social Influences;Teacher Attitudes;Interviews;Elementary Schools;Elementary School Teachers;Elementary School Students;Inclusion;Foreign Countries,"Dyson, Lily",2014.0,0,123
124,Enhancing General Physical Educators' Teacher Efficacy when Working with All Students,"Since the Public Law 94-142 was enacted in 1975, there has been a push for inclusive classes where students with disabilities are educated along with their peers without disabilities in the least restrictive environment (LRE). The general physical education (GPE) teacher is obligated to ensure that all students are successful in their classes. However, one study found that teachers felt illprepared to adapt and modify their lessons, and needed more training and support when working with these combined groups. While districts and schools dictate the type of support available (e.g., itinerant, consultant, or collaborative), improving teacher efficacy may be a universal means of helping GPE teachers provide quality education to all students. Teacher efficacy is a teacher's beliefs in his/her ability to bring out the desired outcomes of student engagement and learning. In this article, the authors discuss how to enhance GPE's teacher efficacy when working with all students.",Physical Education and Training;Teaching Experience;Teacher Education;Self Efficacy;Mainstreaming;Regular and Special Education Relationship;Teacher Competencies;Inclusion;Physical Education Teachers;Physical Education;Teacher Effectiveness;Disabilities,"Umhoefer, Donna and Beyer, Robbi and Vargas, Tiffanye M.",2012.0,0,124
125,Effect of a Physical Education Teacher's Disability on High School Pupils' Learning and Perceptions of Teacher Competence,"Background: To date, most of the work done by those who do research in adapted sport pedagogy (a sub-discipline of sport pedagogy focused on modified forms of physical education that address the needs of pupils with disabilities) has focused on the experience of pupils with disabilities and relatively little work has examined the difficulties faced by physical education teachers who themselves have disabilities and teach ""able-bodied"" pupils. Previous research, conducted in both general education and sport pedagogy settings, indicated that a teacher's attire, physical appearance, and perceived competence influenced pupils' perceptions of the teacher's ability to teach and the degree to which they learned the subject matter. These findings suggest that physical education teachers who have a disability might be in for a particularly difficult time in terms of fighting negative perceptions of their competence and their ability to promote learning among their pupils. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a physical education teacher's disability on high school pupils' learning and perceptions of the teacher's competence. Participants and setting: Participants were 109 (58 boys, 51 girls) 10th and 11th grade pupils (i.e., years 10 to 13 in British terms) enrolled at two high schools situated in the southeastern United States. The pupils ranged from 14 to 18 years in age and were mainly from middle socio-economic status neighborhoods. Research design: A positivistic research design, with quantitative research methods and techniques, was used during this study aimed at determining pupils' learning and perceptions of teacher competence. Data collection: Pupils were randomly assigned to view one of two videotaped swimming lessons. Both lessons were identical with one exception. In the first lesson, the teacher taught as an able-bodied teacher (ABL), while in the second she taught from a wheelchair (WCL) giving the impression that she had a physical disability. Directly following the viewing of their assigned lesson, pupils completed an examination on lesson content and a questionnaire asking them about their perceptions of the teacher. Data analysis: Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) from the content examination and perception questionnaire were computed for those pupils who watched the WCL and those who observed the ABL. The data were also analyzed using various inferential statistical tests (i.e. 2 x 2 repeated measures analysis of variance, paired comparison t-tests, and independent t-tests). Findings: Results indicate that pupils who viewed the ABL scored significantly higher on the technique section of the examination than pupils who watched the WCL. There were no significant differences between the perception scores of those pupils who viewed the WCL and the ABL. Conclusions: While the high school pupils in this study had an equally high regard for the teacher regardless of her apparent physical state, they learned less from her about swimming techniques when she appeared to have a disability than when she was able-bodied. Results of this study suggest that as pupils progress through their schooling, their beliefs about physical education teachers with disabilities gradually change for the worse because they are socialized into believing that sport, physical activity, and physical education are for what appear to be whole and fit bodies.

126,How to Develop Disability Awareness Using the Sport Education Model,"More than ever, students with disabilities are being included in general physical education classes, recess, and extracurricular sports. To ensure successful experiences in these settings, it is important for the teacher to provide an environment of acceptance and for the students without disabilities to have a positive attitude towards students with disabilities. Physical education is considered a natural setting to change students' attitudes by offering disability awareness in the curriculum. The purpose of this article is (1) to show how to use the sport education model as a vehicle for disability awareness and (2) to show how inclusion fits naturally into the sport education model.

127,The Role of Schools in Constructing Self-Perceptions of Sport and Physical Education in Relation to People with Disabilities,"Relatively little work has been carried out upon the effect of educational environment upon the sporting involvement of children with disabilities. This paper is concerned with the educational experiences of a group of athletes who competed in the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. It highlights the major influence that the impact of the educational experiences of a child with a disability can have upon many areas of the child's life. Not only do the experiences of physical education within school have a long-term effect upon the participation, or otherwise, of individuals with disabilities in sport in later life, but they could also possibly affect the competitive strength of future Great Britain teams in the field of disability sport.

128,Coteaching in Physical Education: A Strategy for Inclusive Practice,"Qualitative research methods were used to explore the factors that informed general and adapted physical education teachers' coteaching practices within an inclusive high school physical education program. Two physical education teachers and one adapted physical education teacher were observed over a 16-week period. Interviews, field notes, and documents were collected and a constant comparative approach was used in the analysis that adopted a social model framework. Primary themes included community as the cornerstone for student learning, core values of trust and respect, and creating a natural support structure. Coteaching practices existed because of the shared values of teaching, learning, and the belief that all students should be included. Recommendations include shifting orientations within professional preparation programs to account for the social model of disability.",Physical Education and Training;New England;Disabilities;School Culture;Trust (Psychology);High Schools;Interviews;Regular and Special Education Relationship;Mainstreaming;Inclusion;Team Teaching;Teaching Methods;Physical Education Teachers;Values;Qualitative Research;Adapted Physical Education,"Grenier, Michelle",2011.0,0,128
129,Elements of Successful Inclusion for School-Age Children with Disabilities in Childcare Settings,"When a school-age child with disabilities is accepted into a childcare setting, it is only the first step. The sustenance of the care option depends on whether the setting makes appropriate adaptations to accommodate the child with disability in the setting. Parents face a host of challenges related to adaptations and accommodations. This study focuses on parents' perspectives related to features needed to appropriately accommodate school-age children with disabilities in childcare and other out-of-school settings. Five focus groups attended by 29 parents and eight telephone interviews were conducted. Data were analysed qualitatively using a grounded theory approach and QSR 6, a non-statistical software package for qualitative data. The adaptations identified by parents included adaptations related to physical space and activities, adaptations focusing on socialisation with peers, supervision by staff, safety of children, parent-provider communication, and those focusing on the attitude and skills of childcare providers related to accommodating children with disabilities in childcare settings.",Child;Only Child;Disabled Children;Activities;Playgrounds;Physical Environment;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Caregiver Attitudes;Caregivers;Teacher Attitudes;Parent Teacher Cooperation;Child Safety;Supervision;Peer Relationship;Space Utilization;Environmental Influences;Interviews;Parent Attitudes;Special Needs Students;Young Children;Child Care;Mainstreaming;Disabilities;Focus Groups;Grounded Theory,"Jinnah-Ghelani, Hamida A. and Stoneman, Zolinda",2009.0,0,129

IDEA requires that students who receive services for special needs receive a free appropriate public education, and have access to the general education curriculum, which includes physical education. Like other classroom teachers, physical educators face the challenge of teaching students with a wide range of abilities on a daily basis. However, in classrooms where students with learning disabilities (LD) are included, the challenge is even more magnified. The focus of this article is to present information and strategies for teachers to support students with LD in physical education classrooms. The authors present a discussion of teacher characteristics which support inclusive physical education classrooms. Next, they discuss strategies that support successful inclusion of LD students.

132,Normative Approaches to Justice in Physical Education for Pupils with Physical Disabilities--Dilemmas of Recognition and Redistribution,"Seeking social justice in education for pupils with disabilities creates certain dilemmas. A ""school for all"" means that educators are faced with the dilemma whereby the notion of ""disability"" is perceived as ought not to matter but where in actual fact it seems to matter very much! This article explores ways out of this general educational dilemma using the context of physical education (PE) for pupils with physical disabilities within the compulsory school as an example. Justice theories of resource distribution and cultural recognition affect educational outcomes, where the demand is for justice and equity. Fraser's notion of ""social status"", together with a pluralistic approach to identities where personal experiences are given a place, is used to suggest a solution to the dilemma. It is concluded that a redistribution of economic resources and social recognition is necessary if social justice within PE is to become a reality.

133,Students' Rights and a Response to Legislation,"This is a very special year; it is a Paralympic year featuring the 2012 London Paralympics. So why should teachers consider including disability sport, especially Paralympic sport, in the general physical education (GPE) curriculum? Because students with and without disabilities could benefit from such a curriculum model, and physical education programs across the United States would be working to address the rights of all students related to sport opportunities. Every student has the right to participate in sports and physical education as part of their school experience. Sports, along with physical activity, encompass more than just the benefit of being physically active; they promote good health, increase one's self-esteem, improve mental alertness, create independence, boost self-confidence, and increase socialization skills. Sports are especially important for individuals with disabilities. Having an opportunity to participate in U.S. Paralympic sports in schools and in the community can lead students with disabilities to further aspire to athletic competition, thereby promoting the chances of finding the next generation of Paralympians.

135,The Initial Training of Physical Education Teachers--In Search of the Lost Meaning of Professionalism,"This article re-examines the initial training of physical education teachers with the purpose of pinning down its professional significance. The author maintains that we have lost, in part, its meaning, and, in an attempt to recover it, offers two initial strategies: to revisit two basic concepts--education in general and physical education in particular--and to reformulate four key questions: Question 1. What being a physically educated person means... Professionals are urged to establish the objectives of physical education based on the deficiencies, necessities and interests of the children and young people, which are rooted in the nature of the developed societies in which they live (e.g. the contextualisation of knowledge, emotional development, the learning of values necessary for a pacific coexistence, the promotion of active lifestyles, information about a balanced diet and the disorders that arise out of this, education for a sustainable consumerism, etc.). This information will be provided via an in-depth analysis of the socio-cultural, economical and political macro context. Question 2. What being a real physical educator actually means. ...The emphasis is on three aspects: the complicity that a physical education teacher should feel towards children, which leads him/her to a moral commitment to his/her own training; the capacity of this teacher to respond to the question of what deserves to be taught and learnt within the field of physical education; and the awareness of principles, processes, educational aims and their implications, as well as the contextual aspects that condition their teaching. Question 3. What training a physical educator should receive and how it should be given.... The necessity for a personal, as well as professional, preparation of physical educators is highlighted. Insofar as personal training, the author proposes, as a means of getting to know oneself, the writing down of respective personal stories (to reflect on one's principle and values, how these ideas have been developed, and who they would like to be one day, etc.). With regard to professional preparation (in terms of curriculum and methodology), it is underlined that educators of teachers should contextualise the knowledge they impart, establish connections between the different fragments of said knowledge and with the daily lives of their students, school, education in general and physical education specifically. Moreover, the author highlights the importance of the use of metaphors, real life cases and school anecdotes to facilitate a learning process with meaning. The use of the pedagogy of dialogue is another strategy that is put forward not only as a technique for acquiring knowledge, but also as a means of improving relationships in the classroom. Keeping a journal in which one reflects on the different topics and how he/she is learning is another suggestion offered. Question 4. What those who are responsible for training physical education teachers should be like and how they should behave.... It is argued that an educator of physical education teachers should have a specific knowledge of physical education, but should also be a cultured individual with a wider comprehension of the world and education in general, which allows him/her to contextualise knowledge and establish the aforementioned connections, as well as being emotionally balanced, committed to his/her job, consistent in what he/she says and does and capable of improving his/her teaching through praxis (a process of reflection, action and reflection).

Participants were 26 primary-one children who were assessed by educational psychologists and occupational therapists to have handwriting difficulties. They were matched according to their age and then randomly assigned into either the control group or the experimental group. Subjects in the experimental group (n = 13) would receive eight sessions of computerized visual perception and visual-motor integration training together with a home training program while those in the control group (n = 13) would only receive conventional handwriting training by teachers, which focused mainly on remedial handwriting exercises. Results from repeated measure ANOVA revealed that children in the experimental group showed improvements in their visual perception skills as well as in their handwriting time. Both the ""On Paper"" time and ""In Air"" time of this group were improved when compared to the control group. However, no significant differences were found in visual-motor integration skill and handwriting legibility between the two groups after the intervention. This computerized training program focusing on visual perception and visual-motor integration training appeared to be effective in enhancing the handwriting time among children with handwriting difficulties. However, the training program did not seem to improve the legibility of children.

137,Inclusion in Physical Education: From the Medical Model to Social Constructionism,"The purpose of this discussion is to explore assumptions that have informed constructions of disability and to challenge these as socially constituted judgments that influence the way teachers think and act in general physical education. A secondary purpose is to introduce social constructionism as a discourse that potentially reshapes constructions of disability by highlighting the relational activity between teachers and students. Using this framework, it becomes possible to consider the cultural construction of disability as informing actions that in many cases, further disable students with disabilities. A relevant question here becomes, what are our expectations, and how did we come to hold them? The article concludes with suggested practices that identify competence and context as central features of instruction in which meaningful actions are possible for students with disabilities.",Physical Education and Training;Social Influences;Competence;Regular and Special Education Relationship;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Teacher Attitudes;Physical Education Teachers;Mainstreaming;Inclusive Schools;Teacher Student Relationship;Disabilities;Physical Education,"Grenier, Michelle",2007.0,0,137
138,The Impact of Inclusion in General Physical Education for All Students,"Standards define today's educational landscape. In physical education, standards at both the national and state levels have become a driving force that shapes curriculum and instruction. Although all students are expected to meet the learning standards, teachers are often challenged with offering instruction that allows students with disabilities to achieve the standards. To ensure that students with disabilities do not experience negative interactions and exclusionary attitudes, several important factors should be considered. Through a combination of suggested practices and the use of other resources discussed in this article, teachers can create positive interactions between students with and without disabilities and can create a culture of inclusion that embraces both understanding and acceptance. By implementing practices that promote positive interactions between students with and without disabilities, teachers can enhance the quality of life of all students. In addition, they can teach all students important life lessons about understanding and accepting differences. With appropriate teacher training and support, teachers and students can experience the benefits of a classroom culture that values inclusion.",Physical Education and Training;Faculty Development;Educational Environment;Peer Relationship;Academic Standards;Inclusive Schools;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Physical Education;Quality of Life;Disabilities,"Lieberman, Lauren J. and James, Alisa R. and Ludwa, Nicole",2004.0,0,138

144,What can family medicine providers learn about concussion non-disclosure from former collegiate athletes?,"Background: Despite the risks, concussion symptoms often go underreported by athletes, leading to delayed or forgone treatment and increased potential for concussion recurrence. One of the most serious long-term consequences of sports-related concussions is Chronic Traumatic Encephelopathy (CTE), a disorder associated with progressive neurological deterioration. The purpose of this study was to explore former collegiate athletes' understanding of concussions and motivations behind concussion non-disclosure in order to better assist family medicine providers in screening for and managing a history of concussions. Methods: Informed by the theoretical framework Social Cognitive Theory, we conducted focus groups with former collegiate athletes using a field-tested discussion guide. Discussions were transcribed, coded, and analyzed via content and thematic analyses using NVivo 10 software. Results: Thirty-two former collegiate athletes (24.5 ¬± 2.9 years old, 59.4% female, 87.5% white) participated in 7 focus groups. Three predominant themes emerged: 1) Concussions are Part of the Game: Participants believed that concussions were part of sports, and that by agreeing to play a sport they were accepting the inherent risk of concussions. Importantly, many were not familiar with concussion symptoms and what constituted a concussion; 2) Hiding Concussion Symptoms: Participants said they often hid concussion symptoms from coaches and trainers in order to avoid being taken out of or missing games. Participants were able to hide their concussions because most symptoms were indiscernible to others; and 3) Misconceptions about Concussions in Low Contact Sports: Several participants did not understand that concussions could occur in all sports including low contact or noncontact sports. The former athletes who participated in low contact sports and experienced concussions attributed their concussions to personal clumsiness rather than their sport. Conclusions: Family medicine providers as well as coaches, athletic trainers, teachers, and parents/guardians should reinforce the message that concussions can occur in all sports and inform patients about the signs and symptoms of concussions. Further, providers should ask all patients if they engaged in high school or collegiate athletics; and if yes, to describe their hardest hit to their head in order to obtain a complete medical history.","Disclosure;Sports;Symptoms;Brain Concussion;Reinforcement (Psychology);Contact Sports;Health Beliefs;Sports Participation;Coaches, Athletic;Risk Factors;Brain Concussion;Data Analysis Software;Thematic Analysis;Content Analysis;Focus Groups;Social Learning Theory;Conceptual Framework;Adult;Young Adult;Female;Male;Human;Physician-Patient Relations;Motivation;Physicians, Family;Therapy;Brain Concussion;Diagnosis;Brain Concussion;Self Disclosure;Psychosocial Factors;Athletes, College","Beverly, Elizabeth A. and Fredricks, Todd R. and Leubitz, Andrew and Oldach, Benjamin R. and Kana, Daniel and Grant, Michael D. and Whipps, Jonathon and Guseman, Emily H.",2018.0,0,144
145,Barriers and facilitators of sports in children with physical disabilities: a mixed-method study.,"Purpose: This study explored barriers and facilitators of sports participation of children with physical disabilities from the perspective of the children, their parents and their health professionals. Method: Thirty children and 38 parents completed a questionnaire, and 17 professionals were interviewed in a semi-structured way. Data from the three groups were combined in a mixed-method design, after which the results were triangulated. Results: Mean age (SD) of the children was 14.1 (2.9) years old, 58% were boys. Sixty-seven percent of the children had cerebral palsy and 77% participated in sports after school. Most commonly practiced sports were swimming, cycling and football. Children specifically experienced dependency on others as a barrier, parents did not have enough information about sports facilities, and professionals observed that the family's attitude had influence on the child's sports participation. Facilitators were health benefits, fun and social contacts. Conclusion: Sports participation of children with physical disabilities is a complex phenomenon because children, their parents and professionals reported different barriers. Sports participation is more physically challenging for children with severe physical disabilities, as their daily activities already require much energy. However, the psychosocial benefits of sports are applicable to all children with physical disabilities.","Only Child;Disabled Persons;Thematic Analysis;Mann-Whitney U Test;McNemar's Test;Chi Square Test;Health Personnel;Teachers;Young Adult;Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior;Netherlands;Adolescence;Female;Male;Descriptive Statistics;Parents;Adult;Child;Semi-Structured Interview;Questionnaires;Multimethod Studies;Human;Sports;Athletes, Disabled;Child, Disabled","Jaarsma, Eva A. and Dijkstra, Pieter U. and de Bl√©court, Alida C.

Results from a Hotelling's T2 MANOVA showed a labeling effect. Results from a simple linear regression procedure also showed that of the teacher attributes assessed, only perceived teaching competence (p < .01) predicted favorable intentions. Support for the TpB was demonstrated for the group with the label for the social normative component (p < .000). Further analyses showed that for the group that receive that label information, only the school principal (p < .05) was associated with favorable intentions.","Linear Models;Human;Step-Wise Multiple Regression;Child Behavior;Forecasting;Evaluation;Intention;Multiple Regression;Pearson's Correlation Coefficient;Descriptive Statistics;Coefficient Alpha;Reliability and Validity;Construct Validity;Content Validity;Questionnaires;Vignettes;Psychomotor Disorders;Cerebral Palsy;Male;Random Assignment;Evaluation;Professional Competence;Evaluation;Job Experience;Power Analysis;Purposive Sample;Quota Sample;United States;Aptitude;Self Concept;Linear Regression;Multivariate Analysis of Variance;Schools, Elementary;Child Health;Child;Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior;Adult;Teachers;In Infancy and Childhood;Mainstreaming (Education);In Infancy and Childhood;Physical Education and Training;Attitude to Disability;Faculty Attitudes;In Infancy and Childhood;Students, Disabled;In Infancy and Childhood;Classification;Psychomotor Performance","A, Tripp and T, Rizzo",2006.0,0,146
147,Female athlete triad for the primary care pediatrician.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Female participation in athletics has increased significantly over the past several decades. For most young women, participation in sport fosters self-confidence, positive relationships with peers, and good physical health. However, with growing female representation in athletics, the sport community has become increasingly aware of the syndrome known as 'female athlete triad,' which describes the interplay between low energy availability (LEA), menstrual disturbances, and decreased bone mineral density (BMD). This review aims to discuss the definition and prevalence of the triad and prevention, detection, and treatment strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Current research has elucidated the importance of identifying and treating the triad in young athletes, as adolescence is a critical time for bone development and failure to intervene can lead to long-term problems. First defined in 1992, full characterization of the triad in adolescents has been elusive because of difficulties in diagnosing low BMD in this population and reliance on self-report for menstrual disturbances and LEA. A 2007 reformulation of the triad incorporated research demonstrating that the full deleterious triad is rare and emphasized that its components exist on a spectrum. Removal of the stigma from the triad has the potential to allow earlier detection and treatment, thereby improving outcomes. SUMMARY: The female athlete triad is a problem with important long-term consequences. Education should be geared toward athletes as well as coaches, athletic trainers, school nurses, primary care providers, and others involved in female athletics to allow early identification and intervention.",Female Athlete Triad Syndrome;Sports;Risk Factors;Risk Assessment;Standards;Primary Health Care;Prevalence;Etiology;Menstruation Disorders;Patient History Taking;Psychosocial Factors;Female Athlete Triad;Diet Therapy;Female Athlete Triad;Female;Etiology;Fatigue;Early Diagnosis;Child;Bone Density;Adolescence;Methods;Health Education;Diagnosis;Female Athlete Triad;Dietary Supplements;Athletes,"House, Samantha and Loud, Keith and Shubkin, Catherine",2013.0,0,147
148,INCLUSIVE PE: THE ROLE AND KNOWLEDGE OF SCHOOL PRINCIPALS.,"Introduction: Inclusive physical education (IPE) demands the change of didactic concepts, attitudes and to adapt a team work setting. This study aimed to identify the role, knowledge and responsibility of school principals for an inclusive school. In the frame of investigating the quality of participation of children with disabilities (within the framework of a master thesis conducted in three provinces of Austria) principals of secondary schools were asked about the legal and theoretical background of inclusion in general as well as about the conditions of the facilities and the availability of additional personnel for physical education. Methods: The study was carried out by online questionnaires using the Unipark-Program (EFS Survey software) and was analyzed with IBM Statistics SPSS, Version 21, transferring the results into Excel graphics. The response rate varied in the three provinces between 26 principals (Vienna) and 105 principals (Upper Austria). Among others, the questions addressed basic data about attendance of students with disabilities as well as the importance and knowledge about principles of inclusion in general and IPE in particular. Accessibility, quality of school facilities and the situation of deployed personnel were other areas of interest. Results and Discussion: Big differences between the provinces were reported concerning facilities, accessibility, equipment and availability of additional educators. While Vienna's schools had a high rate of team teaching, they had fewer equipped sport halls and accessible facilities. Better school structures were found in Upper Austria but still insufficient for good IPE.",Sports Equipment;Physical Education and Training;Austria;Role;School Administrators,"DINOLD, MARIA",2015.0,0,148
149,The effect of peer tutoring on interaction behaviors in inclusive physical education.,"This study assessed the effect of peer tutoring on physical, instructional, and social interaction behaviors between elementary school age students with severe and multiple disabilities (SMD) and peers without disabilities. Additional measures addressed the activity time of students with SMD. The study was conducted in inclusive general physical education settings under three instructional support conditions for students with SMD: (a) teacher-directed, (b) peer-mediated, and (c) voluntary peer support. During peer-mediated and voluntary peer support conditions, the instructional and physical interaction behaviors between students with SMD and their peers increased, while social interactions remained low. The activity engagement time data increased for all target students throughout intervention sessions. Interactions between students with SMD and teachers decreased toward the end of intervention.","Interpersonal Relations;Human;Videorecording;United States;Students, Elementary;In Infancy and Childhood;Student Attitudes;Observational Methods;Models, Theoretical;Male;Kappa Statistic;Intrarater Reliability;Intraclass Correlation Coefficient;Interrater Reliability;Female;Faculty-Student Relations;Descriptive Statistics;Data Collection, Computer Assisted;Data Analysis Software;Concurrent Validity;Conceptual Framework;Comparative Studies;Coding;Clinical Assessment Tools;Child, Disabled;Child;In Infancy and Childhood;Teaching Methods;In Infancy and Childhood;Students, Disabled;In Infancy and Childhood;Social Behavior;In Infancy and Childhood;Physical Education and Training;In Infancy and Childhood;Physical Activity;In Infancy and Childhood;Peer Group","A, Klavina and ME, Block",2008.0,0,149
150,An exploratory Delphi study on the integration of disabled students into physiotherapy education.,"Objectives The introduction of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) IV (1995) in the UK requires universities to ensure that they do not discriminate against disabled students. The objectives of this study were to achieve consensus on the attributes required for a competent physiotherapist, and to explore implementation of the DDA into physiotherapy education.Design An exploratory study was performed using the Delphi technique. Respondents were asked to comment on the skills required to be a physiotherapist, and the implementation of the DDA during the admission process.Setting and participants Participation was invited from all physiotherapy admission tutors working on pre-registration physiotherapy courses in England (n = 43). Twenty of these consented to be involved, and 13 completed the whole study.Method The Delphi study consisted of three questionnaires administered sequentially; the results from one questionnaire forming the basis of the next. On analysis of the third questionnaire, consensus and saturation had been achieved.Results The admission tutors showed strong consensus (92%) on the skills necessary to be a physiotherapist, although there was some debate about sensory and physical abilities. Participants were uneasy about the level of support for staff and their knowledge of support systems for disabled students. Respondents also expressed concern over the level of support for disabled students. The possibility of conditional qualification for disabled students was discussed.Conclusion Standards set out by the professional bodies could be used to enable disabled students to self-assess their abilities prior to application for courses. Disability support systems within universities need to include physiotherapy tutors.","Discrimination (Psychology);Physical Therapy Modalities;Human;United Kingdom;Student Recruitment;School Admissions;Questionnaires;Pilot Studies;Multimethod Studies;Exploratory Research;United Kingdom;Legislation and Jurisprudence;Discrimination;United Kingdom;Legislation and Jurisprudence;Disabled;Delphi Technique;Attitude to Disability;Students, Disabled;Education, Physical Therapy;Clinical Competence","J, Opie and MC, Taylor",2008.0,0,150
151,From the field. Physical educators' perceptions of inclusion: a Hawaii school district perspective.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of physical educators in a Hawaii school district on inclusion. The Physical Educators' Perceptions of Inclusion Inventory (Hodge, Murata, & Jansma, 1994) was mailed to all elementary and high school physical educators within a targeted district (N=52). Of the 52 physical educators surveyed, 26 responded (50%). The range of respondents included first year teachers through those with 30 or more years of teaching experience. The majority of the respondents (81%) had experience teaching students with disabilities. Data were analyzed across three factors: (a) years of experience teaching physical education, (b) experience teaching students with disabilities, and (c) educational preparation (i.e., coursework at undergraduate and graduate levels). Significant (p < .05) positive results were revealed for physical educators who had enrolled in graduate level adapted physical education courses. However, indecisiveness was revealed for physical educators who had taken graduate level special education courses. Years of experience teaching physical education and experience working with students with disabilities did not significantly influence the perceptions of the physical educators surveyed.",Human;Male;Female;One-Way Analysis of Variance;Kruskal-Wallis Test;Data Analysis Software;Questionnaires;Research Instruments;Attitude Measures;Hawaii;Physical Education and Training;Attitude to Disability;Mainstreaming (Education);Faculty Attitudes,"JK, Maeda and NM, Murata and SR, Hodge",1997.0,0,151

An adapted physical educator served as a human resource. Participants were a kindergartner (6 years of age) with severe disability, 20 nondisabled peers (5-6 years of age), an adapted physical educator, and a regular physical educator. The research method was case study. Data were collected periodically by systematic observation and by interview during an 18-week period in the fall school semester. Twenty percent, or approximately one class per week (n = 19) were analyzed that were movement exploration in nature. Results indicated that inclusion classes were highly effective in time engagement and management, and the qualitative nature of inclusion was one of widespread social acceptance and successful motor participation. It was concluded that the use of a people resource model, with an adapted educator, is a highly effective educational practice.","Only Child;Physical Education and Training;Humans;Humanism;Humanities;Human;Thematic Analysis;Reliability and Validity;Videorecording;Qualitative Studies;Quantitative Studies;Female;Male;Purposive Sample;Faculty;Observational Methods;In Infancy and Childhood;Attitude to Disability;Interviews;Child;Child, Preschool;Child, Disabled;In Infancy and Childhood;Cerebral Palsy;In Infancy and Childhood;Mainstreaming (Education);In Infancy and Childhood;Physical Education, Adapted","EW, Vogler and P, Koranda and T, Romance",2000.0,0,152
153,An exploratory study on attitudes toward inclusive education in Russia.,"This exploratory study examined the attitudes toward inclusive education among Russian teachers, administrators and parents of students with and without disabilities (n=176). The results indicated that while there were no significant differences among teachers, administrators and parents of students with and without disabilities on overall attitudes toward inclusive education, there were significant differences in perspectives about the possible time-frame for implementing inclusive education. Generally speaking, school administrators and teachers tended to express the belief that inclusive education could be a reality even today, though many of this group thought that it might be a question of the near future or undefined future. Both groups of parents tended to think that inclusive education could occur in an undefined future. There were significant differences among the three groups about perceptions of responsibility for implementing inclusive education. Administrators, teachers and parents of students with disabilities viewed it as a responsibility of the school, while parents of students without disabilities viewed it as the government's duty. Further, the majority of respondents reported the lack of necessary conditions in schools and the lack of government policies and finances as the main barriers to inclusive education. These findings suggest two areas of intervention to promote the implementation of inclusive education in Russia: physical accessibility of schools and government support.","Attitude;Human;Teachers;Surveys;School Administrators;Russia;Questionnaires;Pilot Studies;Parents;Parental Attitudes;Interviews;Goodness of Fit Chi Square Test;Focus Groups;Faculty Attitudes;Exploratory Research;Descriptive Statistics;Child;Attitude to Disability;Adolescence;Students, Disabled;Mainstreaming (Education)","E, Martz",2005.0,0,153
154,The consultation process: adapted physical education specialists' perceptions.,"The purpose was to examine adapted physical education (APE) specialists' perceptions about consultation as a delivery model for individuals with disabilities. Six APE specialists (4 female, 2 male) from California participated in this phenomenological study. Data came from in-depth individual interviews, field observations, researcher notes, and focus group interactions. Analysis revealed distinct categories related to consultation: definition, contextual factors, effectiveness (benefits, barriers, documentation), competency, training, and consultation model preferences. Consultation interactions varied greatly because of the dynamic nature of the educational environment. The use of consultation was more prevalent with middle and high school students. Adapted physical education consultation occurred on a continuum from proximal to distal, dependent on the degree of interaction between the APE specialist, the general education (GE) teacher, and the student. The effectiveness of consultation was dependent upon the GE teacher's attitude and the APE specialist's communication skills and competencies.","Physical Education and Training;Human;Professional Competence;Education;Referral and Consultation;Methods;Referral and Consultation;Collaboration;Constant Comparative Method;Audiorecording;Descriptive Statistics;Middle Age;Adult;Focus Groups;Observational Methods;Interviews;Phenomenological Research;California;Qualitative Studies;Female;Male;Health Care Delivery;Disabled;Referral and Consultation;Attitude of Health Personnel;Physical Education, Adapted","RK, Lytle and D, Collier",2002.0,0,154

The Coaches Attitude Toward Integration Questionnaire (CATIQ) was developed specifically to survey coaches' attitudes about including adolescents with disabilities in interscholastic programs. After preliminary reliability checks were made and content validity established, the CATIQ was mailed to a random sample of 397 public school coaches. Results indicated that coaches tend to show agreement with the statement that adolescents with disabilities 'have a right to sport opportunities' in interscholastic programs. However, coaches felt inadequately trained to address the needs of individuals with disabilities in integrated interscholastic sports settings.","Sports;Adolescent;Human;Male;Female;Step-Wise Multiple Regression;Questionnaires;Multiple Regression;Construct Validity;Coefficient Alpha;Stratified Random Sample;Summated Rating Scaling;Research Instruments;Schools, Secondary;Mainstreaming (Education);Attitude Measures;Attitude to Disability;Coaches, Athletic","FM, Kozub and DL, Porretta",1998.0,0,156
158,Development and evaluation of a group physical activity programme for children with developmental co-ordination disorder: an interdisciplinary approach.,"Developmental Co-ordination Disorder (DCD) affects 6% of children in mainstream primary education. It is often associated with educational, social, and emotional problems that may continue beyond adolescence. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a specific group exercise intervention that has three significant features: (1) it is an interdisciplinary programme co-designed by a physiotherapist and a teacher; (2) it is community-based rather than clinic-based; and (3) it uses standardised tests to measure motor function in terms of general competence, perceived competence, and physical fitness. An A-B experimental design was used. Fourteen subjects aged 7-8 years (11 male; 3 female), recruited from 63 mainstream state primary schools in outer London were assessed before and after attending 10, 1-hour weekly classes at a Leisure centre. Two step identification of DCD was by the Movement Assessment Battery/ Checklist for Children (ABC). Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) was measured as an estimate of ventilatory efficiency. Motor competence was assessed with the Movement ABC. Self-esteem was estimated with the Perceived Competence (Harter) Test. ABC scores decreased significantly following the programme, indicating improved motor competence. There was a significant improvement in FVC.

159,"School-Less or Out-of-School? Re-Thinking Special Needs Education and Practice in Baluchistan, Pakistan","School absenteeism is oftentimes couched in Pakistan's local media and reports of development agencies in terms of ""ghost schools"" and ""ghost teachers."" Little has been written in the scholarly literature of the universal right to education about how this phenomenon is affecting the school attendance of primary and secondary school students with physical disabilities and learning difficulties. We propose the qualitative distinction between being school-less and being out-of-school as a conceptual tool to encourage fresh thinking about special needs education and teacher training in places, where public education is understaffed and underfunded, as in the politically unstable and impoverished province of Baluchistan bordering on Iran to the West and Afghanistan to the North. Instead of critiquing the lagging reform process and lack of service provision for children with special educational needs, we make this theoretical intervention to illuminate opportunities for curricular innovation in this under-researched segment of South Asia's evolving educational landscape.

Students with disabilities can benefit from social interactions during their general physical education (PE) classes, particularly if such interactions are extensive, frequent, meaningful, and positive and if equal-status relationships are encouraged and formed. However, limited research has been conducted on the actual behaviors of students with disabilities regarding social inclusion. Purpose: This study aims to examine the social interactions between students with and without disabilities in general PE in the Chinese context and to explore contextual factors thatmay determine their social interaction. Participants and setting: One student with autism, 2 students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, their 42 classmates without disabilities (17 females and 25 males), and their PE teacher participated in the study. The participants attended a government-granted school in the Yangpu district of Shanghai. Research design: Amixed-methods design was utilized to explore the social interactions between the students with and without disabilities. Data collection: Multiple data collection strategies, including the survey of demographic data, systematic observation, non-participant observation, individual semi-structured interviews, and semi-structured focus group interviews, were used in this study for different purposes. Data analysis: Mean data, including the frequency of occurrence and percentage of time, were used to describe the social interaction behaviors between students with and without disabilities. Qualitative data were reduced, categorized, and thematized by the procedures outlined by Merriam [2009. Qualitative Research: A Guide to Design and Implementation (Revised and Expanded from Qualitative Research and Case Study Application in Education). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass]. Findings: Students with disabilities in a middle school in Shanghai had almost no social interactions with classmates without disabilities in their general PE classes. Based on the social model of disability, contextual factors such as emphasis on differences, conflicting attitudes toward social interaction, and individual class activities determined the limited social interaction. Limited interactions occurred between students with and without disabilities, and these interactions included conversations, demonstrations, and assistance. In addition, the frequency of social interactions among students with disabilities was slightly higher than that of their interactions with their peers without disabilities.

163,FEPSAC position statement: Mental health disorders in elite athletes and models of service provision.,"Mental health disorders (MHD) in elite athletes is a topic that has received increased attention in recent years. The overall aim of this position statement is to enhance awareness of this important topic and to critically discuss optimal service provision for athletes who suffer from MHD. In the first part of the paper a short overview of the research on MHD in elite athletes is provided. Elite athletes seem to have comparable prevalence rates for the most common MHD when compared to non-athletic peers, but there are still many disorders that have not been investigated in athletes. Sport specific situations such as injuries, periods of overtraining and career termination may put athletes at an increased risk of developing MHD. In the second part of the paper, models of service provision for elite athletes suffering from MHD from six European countries are presented, focusing on 1) professional service providers, 2) support systems, 3) diagnostic assessment, 4) clinical treatment, 5) performance during treatment, 6) screening, and 7) education systems. It emerges that competencies, certification issues, and professional boundaries of the involved service providers, as well as the structure of the National Health Care systems differ strongly across European countries, which makes defining a golden standard difficult. In the third part of this paper, the authors provide general recommendations for athletes and coaches, clubs, federations, organizations and scholars that hopefully will inspire stakeholders to optimize their support systems.

164,Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT)-BIG to improve motor function in people with Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Objective: The technique called Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT)-LOUD has previously been used to improve voice quality in people with Parkinson's disease. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an alternate intervention, LSVT-BIG (signifying big movements), to improve functional mobility. Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized trials. Data sources: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AgeLine, Scopus and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to September 2017 using multiple search terms related to Parkinson's disease and LSVT-BIG. Review method: Two researchers searched the literature for studies of the LSVT-BIG intervention of 16 sessions, delivered by a certified instructor over four weeks, to any other intervention. Outcomes related to functional ability were included. Study quality was appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results: Four studies were included, reporting on three randomized trials of 84 participants with mild Parkinson's disease. Compared to physiotherapy exercises, or a shorter training protocol, there was a significant improvement in motor function assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (mean difference = -3.20, 95% confidence interval = -5.18 to -1.23) and a trend towards faster Timed Up and Go performance (mean difference = -0.47, 95% confidence interval = -0.99 to 0.06) and 10-metre walk test (mean difference = -0.53, 95% confidence interval = -1.07 to 0.01). Conclusion: Compared to shorter format LSVT-BIG or general exercise, LSVT-BIG was more effective at improving motor function. This provides preliminary, moderate quality evidence that amplitudeoriented training is effective in reducing motor impairments for people with mild Parkinson's disease.

165,THE OPINIONS OF PARENTS OF DISABLED AND NON-DISABLED STUDENTS CONCERNING INTEGRATED EDUCATION.,"This paper reports the results of a study concerned with the problems of integration in education at an elementary level. 130 parents of students with various types and degrees of disability and 130 parents of students without disabilities were asked to provide feedback in this area. On average, the classes applied in the study involved 17 students without a disability and 5 with a diagnosed disability. The tool used in research was a questionnaire comprising 7 questions combined with a certificate with supplementary information (age of the child, place of residence, type of disability). Parents and teachers of integrated classes also provided information in the form of a completed questionnaire. The parents involved in the research are residents of the Opolskie Voivodeship (county) in the age range of 30-57. The research results indicate that the level of satisfaction within an integrated setting in education is higher within the group of parents of disabled students. Both groups of parents surveyed highly value the presence of two teachers in the classroom, as well as the chance to adapt the curricula to the capabilities of students with disabilities and talented non-disabled students, as well as the opportunities provided for the development of cooperation and mutual help between students. The analysis of research results also indicates poor knowledge on the part of parents regarding the system of integrated education and their lack of confidence in the educational abilities of children with disabilities. A small group of surveyed parents did not observe any positive aspects of integrated education, and stress that the crucial task of schools is informed by the work of teachers and the selection of students. During interviews with parents and teachers in integrated classes, we can note the lack of social education aimed at raising public awareness with regard to the problems of disabled students. An important problem is also associated with the lack of awareness of parents of non-disabled children concerning the values of pupil performance in an informal integrated setting.

166,An exploratory study of self-efficacy and attitudes on selfcare health behaviors among Greek Naval Academy cadets. An application of the Theory of Planned Behavior. / Un estudio exploratorio de la autoeficacia y las actitudes sobre los comportamientos de salud de autocuidado entre los cadetes de la Academia Naval griega. Una aplicaci√≥n de la Teor√≠a del Comportamiento Planificado.,"Many health conditions are caused by risk behaviors, such as problem drinking, substance use, and smoking. Health-compromising behaviors can be eliminated by self-regulatory efforts, and health-enhancing behaviors can be adopted instead, such as physical activity, weight control, and preventive nutrition. Literature review indicated the negative correlation between smoking and exercise, suggesting that smoking status has been positively associated with weight-loss intention, but negatively correlated with use of exercise. Additionally, smoking is negatively associated with readiness for participation in vigorous exercise. Research supports the fact that healthy diet can prevent and manage cardiovascular diseases and orthopaedic disorders. Facts indicate that if interventions foster exercise habits, this could facilitate transfer effects from one health behavior to the other. The aim of the study was to investigate the involvement of self-efficacy and attitudes on self-care health behaviors such as eating, smoking and exercise habits. The sample consisted of 185 cadets of the Greek Naval Academy (165 men, 20 women). They completed the Greek versions of the ""Theory of Planned Behavior"" and ""Health Behavior"" questionnaires. Results indicated that youngest cadets reported healthier habits than the older ones. More specifically, they were more positive oriented on eating healthier, and exercising, and more negatively oriented towards smoking. Overall, results shine for the first time some light on crucial and important aspects of prediction of intentions among healthy and unhealthy behaviors of military personnel. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR
Muchas condiciones de salud son causadas por conductas de riesgo, como problemas con el alcohol, uso de sustancias y fumar. Los comportamientos que comprometen la salud pueden eliminarse mediante esfuerzos de autorregulaci√≥n, y en su lugar se pueden adoptar comportamientos que mejoran la salud, como la actividad f√≠sica, el control del peso y la nutrici√≥n preventiva. La revisi√≥n de la literatura indic√≥ la correlaci√≥n negativa entre el tabaquismo y el ejercicio, lo que sugiere que el tabaquismo se asoci√≥ positivamente con la intenci√≥n de perder peso, pero se correlacion√≥ negativamente con el uso del ejercicio. Adem√°s, fumar est√° asociado negativamente con la disposici√≥n para participar en ejercicios vigorosos. La investigaci√≥n respalda el hecho de que una dieta saludable puede prevenir y controlar las enfermedades cardiovasculares y los trastornos ortop√©dicos. Los hechos indican que si las intervenciones fomentan los h√°bitos de ejercicio, esto podr√≠a facilitar los efectos de transferencia de un comportamiento de salud al otro. El objetivo del estudio fue investigar la implicaci√≥n de la autoeficacia y las actitudes en los comportamientos de salud de autocuidado, como comer, fumar y los h√°bitos de ejercicio. La muestra consisti√≥ en 185 cadetes de la Academia Naval griega (165 hombres, 20 mujeres). Completaron las versiones griegas de los cuestionarios ¬´Teor√≠a del comportamiento planificado¬ª y ¬´Conducta de salud¬ª. Los resultados indicaron que los cadetes m√°s j√≥venes informaron h√°bitos m√°s saludables que los m√°s viejos. M√°s espec√≠ficamente, fueron m√°s positivos orientados a comer de forma m√°s saludable, a hacer ejercicio y a tener una orientaci√≥n m√°s negativa hacia el tabaquismo. En general, los resultados brillan por primera vez sobre los aspectos cruciales e importantes de la predicci√≥n de intenciones entre los comportamientos saludables y no saludables del personal militar.

167,Determinants Of Participation In Sport And Physical Activity For Students With Disabilities According To Teachers And School-Based Practitioners Specialized In Recreational And Competitive Physical Activity.,"Because youth with disabilities participate less in physical activity than young people without disabilities and that schools play an important role in adopting a healthy lifestyle, it is important to deepen our understanding of the elements that foster participation of young people with disabilities in physical activity. The objective of this research is twofold: 1) establish the determinants of participation of youth with disabilities in physical education according to practitioners and 2) document the effects of an initiation and competition program for youth with disabilities on their physical activity. The collection of data using semi-structured interviews was conducted in two phases. The first, among teachers and school-based practitioners (n = 18), aimed to understand their experiences relating to the adoption of healthy lifestyles among their students with disabilities. As for the second, practitioners (n = 12) were interviewed during organized adapted sporting events. Analysis of the interviews shows two categories of determinants, namely determinants relating to school (winning conditions of the environment, the importance of extracurricular activities, and obstacles) as well as determinants relating to the professional competence of teachers (the role of teachers, collaboration between professionals, the benefits of sport and physical activity and obstacles encountered).

168,Perceptions of a Disability Sport Unit in General Physical Education.,"The purpose of this qualitative study was to assess the effectiveness of a disability sport unit in shaping perceptions of disability. Data from interviews, observations, and documents were collected on 87 elementary-aged students, one physical education teacher, and one teaching intern. Comparisons were drawn between fifth graders engaged in a five-week disability sport unit to fourth graders participating in their standard physical education curriculum. Findings revealed differences in the way fourth and fifth graders came to view individuals with disabilities. The results support an analysis of curriculum development that underscores the significance of the social model in positively impacting constructions of disability. Recommendations include the use of disability sports in physical education as an effective strategy for educating students in game play, knowledge of the Paralympics, and the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in a variety of sporting venues.

169,Development Process of Adapted Physical Activities and Reviewing Attitudinal Levels of Turkish Sports Education Administrators towards Sports Activities for Individuals with Mental Disabilities.,"The current study focused on reviewing attitudinal levels of academic and administrative team of Faculty of Sports Sciences (FSS) and School of Physical Education and Sports (SPES) who teach physical education and sports science in Turkish State Universities towards sportive activities for individuals with mental retardation (MR) in terms of various variables in relation to development process of physical activities adapted to disabled individuals. As data collection tools, ""Personal Information Form"" designed by the researcher and Attitude Scale of Individuals Having Mental Disabilities towards Sports Activities (ASIHMDSA) designed by Ilhan, Esenturk, and Yarimkaya (2016) were amployed. Attitudinal levels of the participants were compared in relation to gender, academic title, administrative service, duration of academic service and whether or not receiving sports education for the disabled during their education. Besides, the literature was screened and development process of adapted physical activities and what kind of effects it had upon participants' attitudinal levels were discussed. The population of the study was composed of academic staff (deans, school directors and deputy directors and heads of academic departments) who executed administrative services for FSS and SPES of state universities (36 Universities) during 2016-2017 academic year and sample of the study was consisted of a total of 151 academic administrators (17 female and 134 male administrators) who volunteered to join the study. For the assessment of the data and exploration of calculated values; SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used. Whether or not the data followed a normal distribution was tested through Levene's (variance-ratio) test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and non-parametric tests of Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis H tests were used for those data that did not follow a normal distribution according to normality test. As a result, as far as the results of the current study was concerned, it may be suggested that academic and administrative team of Faculty of Sports Sciences (FSS) and School of Physical Education and Sports (SPES) of who serve in physical education and Sports science in Turkish State Universities had a high and positive attitudes towards supporting establishment of Exercise and Sports Departments for the Disabled and participation of the individuals with mental disabilities in sportive activities.

170,"Perceived motivational factors influencing students with disabilities towards sports participation in Amathole district, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.","The purpose of this study was to identify the motivational factors influencing students with disabilities in participating in sports in the selected special schools in the Amathole district, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Questionnaires, interviews and participant observation were used for data collection. The questionnaire was adapted from DeSwardt's study on leisure functioning of learners with learning and physical disabilities. The observation instrument by Bond on disabled sports was applied with slight modifications. The common types of disabilities affecting the students were physical disability (51%), mental retardation (34%) and hearing impairment (15%). The proportion of students who strongly disagreed (4.2%) was not significantly different (p>0.05) from those who disagreed (2.7%) that their parents actually had a significant influence on their participation in sports. Similarly, the proportion of students who agreed (42.2%) that their parents significantly influenced their inclusion in sports did not vary significantly from those who strongly agreed (40.8%) at 5% level of significance. This shows that more than 80% of the students asserted that their parents had a significant influence on their inclusion in sports. However, 9.8% of the respondents were not sure of their parents' influence on their sports participation. This could be due to inability to interpret the question correctly. Inherent skills had a significant influence on children's participation in sports. Responses regarding reason for participation in sport suggest that students had high self-esteem about their physical condition. Students were motivated to participate in sport because of several factors including enjoyment, competency, need to socialise, for health and psychological benefits. Concerning enjoyment, 22% of male participants strongly agreed that sport is fun and 40% of their female counterparts strongly agreed. About 56% male and 36% female students agreed that enjoyment was a strong motive behind their participation, while 5% male strongly disagree and only 2% of the female disagreed. Both male (78%) and female (76%) agreed that enjoyment was a strong motive behind their participation. On the issue of competency, students (male and female) shared similar view that participating in sports enabled them to enhance their movement skills competencies. The teachers agreed parents were not involved and portrayed lack of interest in their children's' sports participation and achievements. The present study has shown that students with disabilities shared unique and multiple motives for participation in sports. Some of the motives cited were competency, psychological and health benefits. Other motives are related to team sports such as the need to enjoy the camaraderie of fellow students such as friendship, excitement and fun. Parental influence, the students' inherent skills were identified as constraining factors encountered by students with disabilities in participation in sports.

171,How to Structure Group Work? Conditions of Efficacy and Methodological Considerations in Physical Education,"This article is grounded in social constructivist perspectives of learning: its purpose is to provide an overview of the ""Interactions Sociales et Acquisition"" (ISA) [Social Interactions and Acquisition] French group's research that examines how a peer-assisted learning (PAL) group context facilitates students' acquisition of motor and social skills in physical education (PE). Issues addressed include the pairing of students in dyads and how training them to endorse tutor and tutee roles facilitates students to work in small groups. The effects of peer interaction on social relations and the inclusion of students with special needs are also overviewed. Findings regarding the influence of student interactions on learning were derived using a variety of data collection methodologies, including quantitative data used to test the effectiveness of various interactive procedures and qualitative analyses of verbal protocols to better understand the interactive dynamics involved in such learning devices. The ISA work highlights the complementary value of both of these methodological approaches for studying group work effects. ISA findings suggest that PE teachers prepare students for functional interaction group work by taking into consideration the students' characteristics (like gender or desire for control) in the constitution of dyads and then effectively training the tutors to deliver the expected content. Cooperative learning (CL) contexts also provided a viable alternative for facilitating the inclusion of students with disabilities or those with lower initial skill levels.",Interpersonal Relations;Physical Education and Training;Grade 7;Grade 6;Gender Differences;Middle School Students;Physical Activities;Special Needs Students;Disabilities;Inclusion;Group Dynamics;Physical Education Teachers;Cooperative Learning;Peer Relationship;Statistical Analysis;Qualitative Research;Tutors;Tutoring;Peer Teaching;Psychomotor Skills;Interpersonal Competence;Physical Education;Group Activities,"Lafont, Lucile and Rivi√®re, Camille and Darnis, Florence and Legrain, Pascal",2017.0,0,170
172,Physical activities and special educational needs.,"The Ministerial Directive dated December 27, 2012 and the subsequent Circular dated March 6, 2013 for the identification of students with special educational needs (SEN), have planned a school that knows how to respond appropriately to all the difficulties of students by preventing them, in the perspective of a deeply inclusive school. Ianes & Cramerotti (2013) stated that in order to recognize the real needs of a student, it is necessary to understand their current and general situation of functioning; ICF (WHO, 2001), in fact, being fundamentally organic-psycho-social, obliges to consider the totality and complexity of the functionings of the people and not only organic and structural aspects. From this perspective, the didactic setting that is built during Physical Education and Sport, is an excellent valuation framework for the identification of SEN, because physical activity has always been recognized as a disciplinary area that allows students to express their personality, build dynamics of relationships, express motor behavior, etc. (IN 2012). The Personal Factors, in fact, were considered key elements for the construction of instruments with indicators and qualifiers, because according to the latest neuroscience research (Caruana & Borghi, 2013; Damasio, 2009; Gomez Paloma, 2013), they are particularly influencing into the learning process. The research involved 34 schools (2500 students) from four different regions. For data collection has been activated an online platform which allowed to the teachers to download the necessary tools for the assessment and enter the results at the end of the process. From the data analysis it was possible to understand that there is a significant and positive correlation between indicators encoded by ICF and indicators that detect situations, attitudes, behaviors and postures specially created for the identification of difficulties and special educational needs, affirming the validity and reliability of the tool and giving teachers the opportunity to apply strict criteria to identify pedagogically students and act in an inclusive way.

173,Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Secondary School Physical Education: Learning Support Assistants Have Their Say,"Learning support assistants (LSAs) gained more political and academic attention in Britain after Estelle Morris announced that schools of the future would include more trained staff to support learning to higher standards. LSAs, thus, should form an integral part of the culture of all school departments in Britain, including physical education (PE). The paper uses Antonio Gramsci's concept of hegemony to explore the processes and practices that shape the views and experiences of LSAs and ultimately the extent to which they facilitate an inclusive culture in PE. A web survey gathered the views and experiences of LSAs ""vis-√†-vis"" the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream secondary school PE in North-West England. A modified version of the tailored design method participant contact strategy resulted in 343 LSAs starting the web survey, with 154 (45%) following it through to completion. All quantitative data were analysed using Microsoft Excel whilst qualitative data were subjected to thematic analysis. This entailed the identification of recurring themes and patterns present in the data. The findings highlight the hegemonic status of English, maths and science when it comes to the allocation of SEN resources, which most LSAs support and often reinforce. PE is particularly disadvantaged in this hierarchy of subject priority. The majority of LSAs have not received PE-specific training, which brings into question their ability to facilitate inclusion in PE. Moreover, many schools do not appear to value the involvement of LSAs in the planning of differentiated lessons, which could have a negative impact on the PE experiences of some pupils with SEN given that LSAs are perhaps most aware of the specific learning needs of the pupils they support.",Pupil;Physical Education and Training;United Kingdom (England);England;Student Needs;Science Instruction;English Instruction;Mathematics Instruction;Competence;Resource Allocation;Physical Education;Foreign Countries;Qualitative Research;Statistical Analysis;Online Surveys;Secondary School Students;Secondary Schools;Mainstreaming;Inclusion;Paraprofessional School Personnel;Disabilities,"Maher, Anthony John",2016.0,0,172
174,Managing diversity and European policy: Towards a typology for sport pedagogy.,"This article adds to the growing body of knowledge in sport pedagogy and focuses specifically upon the intersection of gender and disability. Its purpose is twofold, to create a typology for examining good practice in sport pedagogy that is reflective and inclusive and raises awareness of the diverse needs of all participants in physical activity ‚Äòregardless‚Äô of gender and ability for all children. We acknowledge that access to physical activity, education and sport are complex and multifaceted, however, the main purpose of this paper is to raise awareness of ‚Äòdiversity‚Äô by focusing specifically upon the role of gender and ability. Through an examination of gender and disability policies in official European Union (EU) policy documents and commercial examples of policy-in-practice we propose a typology for diversity and diversity management. A close look at EU level is instructive because national policies of the member countries vary a lot with respect to diversity issues but should be in accordance in the main areas. Such a reading enables the building of a typology of recommendations for how such policy can be rendered in sport pedagogy practice. We suggest six significant, but related principles that include (1) mainstreaming; (2) teaching and coaching sensitive to difference; (3) empowerment; (4) inclusion; (5) adaptation; and (6) inner differentiation. This holistic typology seeks to ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô issues of gender and disability policy by providing a set of principles that can be applied to a range of teaching and coaching settings.

175,Adapted Physical Education Service Approaches and the Effects on the Perceived Efficacy Beliefs of General Physical Education Teachers.,"The purpose of this study was to determine what effect the type of APE service approach had on GPE teachers' efficacy when working with students with disabilities. The three approaches of APE service delivery chosen for the study were (a) consultation, (b) itinerant, and (c) collaborative. Results indicate significant differences between levels of service: Consult, F(3, 98) = 5.09, p = .003; Itinerant, F(3, 97) = 10.80, p = .000; Collaborative, F(3, 98) = 13.64, p = .000. As well, the collaborative method produced the highest level of efficacy in the participants, F(3, 303) = 19.09, p = .000. The study indicates the collaborative approach of APE service support may be the most effective in increasing GPE teacher efficacy when working with children with disabilities.

176,Barriers and facilitators of sports in children with physical disabilities: a mixed-method study.,"Purpose: This study explored barriers and facilitators of sports participation of children with physical disabilities from the perspective of the children, their parents and their health professionals. Method: Thirty children and 38 parents completed a questionnaire, and 17 professionals were interviewed in a semi-structured way. Data from the three groups were combined in a mixed-method design, after which the results were triangulated. Results: Mean age (SD) of the children was 14.1 (2.9) years old, 58% were boys. Sixty-seven percent of the children had cerebral palsy and 77% participated in sports after school. Most commonly practiced sports were swimming, cycling and football. Children specifically experienced dependency on others as a barrier, parents did not have enough information about sports facilities, and professionals observed that the family's attitude had influence on the child's sports participation. Facilitators were health benefits, fun and social contacts. Conclusion: Sports participation of children with physical disabilities is a complex phenomenon because children, their parents and professionals reported different barriers. Sports participation is more physically challenging for children with severe physical disabilities, as their daily activities already require much energy. However, the psychosocial benefits of sports are applicable to all children with physical disabilities.

177,Teachers' and School Administrators' Preparedness in Handling Students with Special Needs in Inclusive Education in Kenya,"The philosophy of social inclusion is embedded in current legislation of the convention of child rights and the requirement of equal opportunities for those with disability (Salamanca Statement, 1994). Inclusive education entails taking care of all students including those with special needs like physical, mental or developmental. This paper reports the outcome of a study that assessed the level of teachers' and school administrators' preparedness to handle inclusive education. The participants were 140 teachers and 13 Principals of selected secondary schools in Kenya. A questionnaire, interview schedule and classroom observation tool were used for data collection. Data were analysed descriptively and using inferential statistics. Results revealed physical infrastructure and instructional resources are unsuitable to support learners with special needs. There was general lack of teacher training on pedagogy and knowledge on how to handle students with special needs. School management policies regarding learners with special needs were not comprehensive enough to cater for all students. Collaboration among teachers to support learners with special needs falls below expectation. There is need to develop knowledge base on inclusive education, to meet learning needs of individual students. Teachers should undergo periodic refresher courses to develop personalized learning approaches, skills and competences, to effectively handle the heterogeneous nature of contemporary classes.",Kenya;Kenya;Qualitative Research;Statistical Analysis;Accessibility (for Disabled);Teacher Collaboration;Teaching Skills;Educational Facilities;Instructional Materials;Knowledge Base for Teaching;Classroom Observation Techniques;Interviews;Questionnaires;Secondary School Teachers;Principals;Administrator Effectiveness;Teacher Effectiveness;Teacher Competencies;Readiness;Inclusion;Special Needs Students;Foreign Countries,"Gathumbi, Agnes and Ayot, Henry and Kimemia, John and Ondigi, Samson",2015.0,0,176
178,EXERCISE TRAINING IN STUDENTS WITH DIABETES: THE ROLE OF PE TEACHER AT SCHOOL. / FIZIƒåKA AKTIVNOST UƒåENIKA SA DIJABETESOM: ULOGA NASTAVNIKA FIZIƒåKOG VASPITANJA U ≈†KOLAMA.,"Diabetes mellitus is the metabolic disease of disturbed glycemic control and can mainly be divided into two categories: diabetes type I (DMTI) which is more common in students and diabetes type 2 (DMT2). Physical exercise has been shown to have various beneficial effects on diabetic patients and therefore it is strongly recommended for diabetic students at school. The work of physical educator in Greek public schools is obstructed by lack of formal educational seminars, required facilities, and information among society as well as phenomena of school phobia and stigmatization. The role of physical educator is encouraging and supporting diabetic students in regularly taking part in school sport activities, monitoring blood glucose levels and recording exercise plan and response to certain activities. Furthermore, from a psychological point of view, physical educator can help diabetic students to develop their special skills, adopt an optimistic attitude, obtaining selfconfidence and learn to benefit from physical exercise. Finally, physical educator could be viewed as the coordinator of interactions among doctors, parents, school teachers, non-diabetic students and diabetic students regarding participation of diabetic students in school sport activities and their exercise performance along with achieving a balance on glycaemic levels.

179,A project for the education psychomotor for developmental age.,"The school, after the family, is found to be the first educational agency to accommodate the children in developmental age. .The main purpose is the full and harmonious development of personality of the children for their overall education. We chose to implement a project on the body, because we believe that the body is the privileged tool to explore, learn and interact with the environment, and other items. The body is an expression of personality and is a condition relational, communicative, expressive and operational. Each child's experience (both cognitive, sensory, emotional) through the experience of the body, so you should appreciate every situation that will see the protagonist and create contexts in which to build significant and diverse paths. It 'important to establish a positive environment stimulating and emotionally, the availability of structured materials and not allowing the trial, allowing time to live in that context, depending on how you feel and at your own pace. Each child builds their self-image of their body image: the self that matches his body gradually explore and learn through the lived body. ""Then come to the perceptual discrimination and mental representation of the body in motion and in static position. Piaget says, ""arises the question of whether teaching patterns and structures or present to the child in situations where he is active and can be learned alone. The aim of education is to increase the chances of the child to invent and discover The project is Aimed at students with Disabilities at present in the Institute, Students Who Have Learning Difficulties and / or behavior management. As far as we can speak of the general objectives: Setting of communication: - Learn the body language, gestures, mime, dance, - Use appropriate language to describe new experiences and games with the body - Use appropriate language to describe and name known and new materials used to make games, free activities and proposals of the teacher - Repeat verbally and graphically (with different materials), new experiences and knowledge Setting the action and knowledge: - To perceive the body in motion, running games and exercises or invented, with some confidence knowing and developing coordination and motor skills of each - Become aware of their bodies in relation to the presence of other people - Use the body to explore and learn about the environment and the surrounding reality - Known globally in our body through movement, identifying, naming and representing them, the various parts Context of personal and relational - Gain independence, confidence and self esteem, express feelings and represent - Help the child to recognize himself and his personal identity, again through movement activities, experimentation and creation - Share experiences with others, feel good together, meet friends and their work, observe simple rules - Recognize, strengthen and enhance the skills of each child (with the use of different materials each can - create according to his ability and imagination) - Help the child recognize and express their emotions In summary, according to the taxonomic table Frabboni Arrigo-general objectives are: 1. Analyze the various parts of the body. 2. Compare their body structure with that of other children. 3. Groped solutions paths engines (how to overcome an obstacle jump? Crawl ?‚Ä¶). 4. Inventing paths different engines. The project is annual, so we decided to divide the work into several phases.

180,Socialization of elite wheelchair tennis players in South Africa.,"Individuals with physical disabilities are often stigmatized and discriminated against due to their appearance and the assumed variance from the 'norms' of competence. This may lead to impaired social interaction, especially in the mainstream, which may result in a lack of self-esteem. It is, however, evident that sport participation enhances the potential for social support and integration. The purpose of this exploratory study was therefore to collect qualitative data from elite national wheelchair tennis players (n=8). This data was gathered through in-depth semi-structured interviews regarding their socialization processes into and via sport. From the results three main themes were identified, namely, 1. School environment (change and mobilization; inclusion/exclusion), 2. Sport back ground (diversity; acceptance; specialization), 3. Acceptance and relationships (family; friends; coaches; institutions; clubs). The findings indicate that the participants were empowered by taking part in wheelchair tennis (sport for people with disabilities) to facilitate goal attainment and to enhance social integration.

181,ATTITUDES OF STUDENTS IN SPORT EDUCATION TO THE SPORT ACTIVITY OF BLIND PEOPLE IN HUNGARY AND POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THEM. / POSTOJE STUDENT≈Æ SPORTOVN√ç V√ùCHOVY KE SPORTOVN√ç AKTIVITƒî NEVIDOM√ùCH V MAƒéARSKU A JEJICH MO≈æN√â P≈ò√çƒåINY.,"The very low participation of blind people in sport is fundamentally caused by the inappropriate knowledge of experts on disabled - specific areas of sport. Sport coaches and 582 students learning to be PE teachers were asked about their knowledge and ideas of sport for individuals with disabilities, mainly for blind people. Research has proved that good intentions of PE teachers and coaches taking part in disabled sport are basically not missing, thus the main barrier is the lack of topics regarding sport for handicapped people in the curriculum of their studies. Janeƒçka, Kudl√°ƒçek and V√°lkov√° (2003) have emphasized the basic need of specially prepared PE teachers, mainly in the elementary schools. Personal experience and direct contact with blind athletes cannot be replaced by audiovisual methods of education. Blind people cannot be trained to be coaches by the nature of their disability, so blind sport must be developed through the active support and cooperation of sighted sport experts. Sport for the disabled has to be taught as a separate subject, or at least as a separate and stressed section of an already existing, regular subject, such as theory of training. Methodically, personal contact with blind people as well as practical sessions in the course of their education is essential and irreplaceable (Asjborn & Tonjum, 1986). Students should not be allowed to graduate without specific knowledge about sport for the handicapped, and about the possible ways for participation in sport for blind athletes. Such a many sided approach of education is the future and the modern way of teaching.

182,"Work-Related Violence, Lifestyle, and Health Among Special Education Teachers Working in Finnish Basic Education.","BACKGROUND: Studies have reported higher levels of absenteeism due to illness among special education teachers compared to other teachers, but it is not known which factors might contribute to this difference. We examined whether health, health behaviors, and exposure to violence at work differed between special education and general education teachers in Finnish basic education. METHODS: Survey data from 5760 general and special education teachers were analyzed with multilevel logistic models adjusted for individual- and school-level confounding factors. RESULTS: No difference was found between the health behaviors of general and special education teachers. The differences in physical and mental health between the two groups were also relatively small. With regard to work-related violence, however, male special education teachers were 3 times more likely to be exposed to mental abuse, and 5 times more likely to be exposed to physical violence when compared to their male colleagues in general education. Although female special educators were also at an increased risk of mental abuse and physical violence compared to their female general teacher colleagues, their odds ratios for such an encounter were smaller (2- and 3-fold, respectively) than those of male special education teachers. The school-level variance of physical violence toward teachers was large, which indicates that while most schools have little physical violence toward teachers, schools do exist in which teachers' exposure to violence is common. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that special education teachers may benefit from training for handling violent situations and interventions to prevent violence at schools.

Participants were 46 boys with and without Intellectual Disabilities (ID) (23 with ID, mean age=14.5¬±1.19 years, 23 without ID, mean age=14.1¬±0.89 years). The Unified Sport Questionnaire forms were administered to athletes, partners, coaches, and parents as a pretest in the second week of the training and a post test just after the tournaments. There were significant decrease in after program responses of partners in enjoyment of training (p<.05,McNemar's test) and perception of the level of getting along with the other school friends (p<.05,McNemar's test). In athletes, there was a significant increase only in the recommendation of Unified Sports to a friend (p<.05,McNemar's test). Athletes' and partners' parents perceived improvements in abilities, behaviors and relations of their children. All of the coaches believed in the necessity of rule modification during the program. According to the results of this study, Unified Sports would enable to integrate children with intellectual disability into society and increase social awareness of their peers without disabilities.

ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR
Die Absicht dieser Studie war ein Vergleich der Wahrnehmungen von Athleten, Partnern, Extern und Trainer hinsichtlich ihres Engagement f√ºr das Konzept von Unified Sports sowie deren Gesamtzufriedenheit mit dem achtw√∂chigen Unified Fu√üball Programm zu Beginn und am Ende des Programms. Die Teilnehmer waren 46 Jungen mit und ohne intellektuelle Beeintr√§chtigung (IB) (23 mit IB, Durchschnittsalter =14.5¬±1.19 Jahre, 23 ohne IB, Durchschnittsalter=14.1¬±0.89 Jahre). Die Unified Sport Frageb√∂gen wurden den Athleten, Partnern, Extern und Trainer als Pre-Test in der zweiten Trainingswoche ausgefolgt, ein Post-Test fand unmittelbar nach den Wettk√§mpfen statt. In den nach dem Programm erhobenen Antworten der Partner konnte ein signifikanter Abfall in der Trainingsfreudigkeit (p<.05,McNemar's Test) und in der Wahrnehmung des Ausma√ües, sich mit Schulfreunden gut zu verstehen (p<.05,McNemar's Test), festgestellt werden. Bei den Athleten gab es nur in der Weiterempfehlung von Unified Sports an einen Freund einen signifikanten Anstieg (p<.05,McNemar's Test). Die Extern von Athleten und Partnern bemerkten Verbesserungen in F√§higkeiten, Verhalten und Beziehungen ihrer Kinder. Alle Trainer glaubten an die Notwendigkeit von Regel√§nderungen w√§hrend des Programms. Gem√§√ü den Ergebnissen dieser Studie erm√∂glicht Unified Sports die Integration von Kindern mit intellektueller Beeintr√§chtigung in die Gesellschaft und verbessert das soziale Bewusstsein ihrer Peers ohne Behinderung.

184,"Adolescent Online Cyberbullying in Greece: The Impact of Parental Online Security Practices, Bonding, and Online Impulsiveness.","BACKGROUND The introduction of new technological media worldwide has had a number of unfortunate side effects for some adolescents, including cases of bullying others through the new media (cyberbullying) and over-involvement to the point of addiction. We examine the epidemiology of cyberbullying in a Greek setting, compare it with earlier data, determine the impact of any related psychosocial factors, and propose measures to combat the phenomenon. METHODS A cross-sectional study of the entire adolescent high-school student population of the island of Kos examined the relationship between their experiences of Internet cyberbullying and respective parental characteristics, including aspects of psychological bonding and online security measures. The sample consisted of 2017 students (51.8% boys, 48.2% girls). Comparisons are made with results obtained from an earlier survey in the same setting, 2 years earlier. RESULTS There was a significant rise in reported experiences of Internet cyberbullying over the 2-year period. Security practices exercised by parents had a protective role with regards to whether a child had been cyberbullied, yet failed to prevent the perpetration of online victimization. A regression model indicated that impulsive use of the Internet and related online activities were predictive of whether an adolescent victimized others online. CONCLUSION Cyberbullying frequency with regards to both victims and victimizers was high and associated with online impulsiveness, pointing to the possible existence of some commonalities. Further research is necessary to ascertain common underlying psychological factors and neurobiology.

185,Job dissatisfaction among certified adapted physical education specialists in the USA.,"Background: Professionals working in the area of special education are exposed to the unique situation of occupational stress. Adapted physical education teachers are experiencing several symptoms of the burnout phenomenon. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify factors causing job dissatisfaction among certified adapted physical education specialists in the USA. Methods: The survey was developed based on: (a) Herzberg's (1959) theory of job satisfaction, and (b) a pilot study, which examined specific factors of job dissatisfaction among adapted physical education (APE) teachers in the USA. The survey consisted of three parts: (a) demographic information, (b) paired comparison of nine general factors which could cause job dissatisfaction, and (c) paired comparison of ten APE specific factors which could cause job dissatisfaction. The participants were 113 certified adapted physical education specialists (CAPES) (88 females, 25 males), a 38% return rate of all mailed surveys. Results: The results indicated that 39% of CAPES have seriously considered another job outside of APE and 26% of CAPES have actively searched for job outside of APE in the last two years. 113 CAPES indicated the general factors that they found the most dissatisfying in their job (listed accordingly to rank, frequency and percent of times chosen, N for each factor = 1017) were working conditions (644, 71%); policies and administration (619, 68%); interpersonal relationship with supervisors (552, 61%); supervision (484, 54%); salary (404, 45%); interpersonal relationship with subordinates (404, 45%); benefits on job (301, 33%); interpersonal relationship with peers (293, 32%); and job security (245, 27%). 110 CAPES indicated the APE specific factors they found the most dissatisfying on their job (listed accordingly to rank, frequency and percent of times chosen, N for each factor = 990) were paperwork (687, 69%); scheduling (659, 67%); facilities (617, 62%); individualized education plan meetings (464, 47%); travel (450, 45%); number of students (429, 43%); equipment (417, 42%); variability of disabilities (381, 38%); severity of disabilities (357, 36%); and home base (353, 36%). Conclusion: It appears that the efforts should be focused in teacher preparation and in-service support in the areas related to cooperation and communication with school administrators.

186,INCLUSIVE PE: THE ROLE AND KNOWLEDGE OF SCHOOL PRINCIPALS.,"Introduction: Inclusive physical education (IPE) demands the change of didactic concepts, attitudes and to adapt a team work setting. This study aimed to identify the role, knowledge and responsibility of school principals for an inclusive school. In the frame of investigating the quality of participation of children with disabilities (within the framework of a master thesis conducted in three provinces of Austria) principals of secondary schools were asked about the legal and theoretical background of inclusion in general as well as about the conditions of the facilities and the availability of additional personnel for physical education. Methods: The study was carried out by online questionnaires using the Unipark-Program (EFS Survey software) and was analyzed with IBM Statistics SPSS, Version 21, transferring the results into Excel graphics. The response rate varied in the three provinces between 26 principals (Vienna) and 105 principals (Upper Austria). Among others, the questions addressed basic data about attendance of students with disabilities as well as the importance and knowledge about principles of inclusion in general and IPE in particular. Accessibility, quality of school facilities and the situation of deployed personnel were other areas of interest. Results and Discussion: Big differences between the provinces were reported concerning facilities, accessibility, equipment and availability of additional educators. While Vienna's schools had a high rate of team teaching, they had fewer equipped sport halls and accessible facilities. Better school structures were found in Upper Austria but still insufficient for good IPE.

187,Influence of Occupational Socialization on the Perspectives and Practices of Adapted Physical Education Teachers.,"The purpose of this study was to describe and examine the occupational socialization of nine adapted physical educators (APEs). The questions we attempted to answer were (a) What were the perspectives and practices of the APEs? and (b) What factors influenced these perspectives and practices? Data were collected through six qualitative techniques and analyzed by using analytic induction and constant comparison. At the time the study was conducted, the APEs possessed traditional or progressive teaching orientations. They had been attracted to a career as an APE through their participation in sport and physical activity and interactions with persons with disabilities. The quality of adapted physical education teacher education the APEs received varied, but high-quality adapted physical education teacher education appeared to exert a powerful influence on their values and pedagogies. The school cultures and conditions in which the APEs worked on entry into the workforce either served to support or negate their programs. We conclude the paper by providing several hypotheses regarding the influences of occupational socialization on in-service APEs' teaching.",pedagogy; disability; acculturation; teacher education; school culture,"Park, Chan Woong; Curtner-Smith, Matthew D",2018.0,0,186
188,Strategies and Methods for Coaching Athletes with Invisible Disabilities in Youth Sport Activities.,"Children and youth with high incidence disabilities (learning, emotional/behavioral, speech/language, and mild intellectual) make of over 10% of the school age population (U.S. Department of Education, 2007). Although children with these disabilities may receive particular interventions and accommodations within the classroom in the public school setting, there is little training or resources available to accommodate their successful participation in youth sports afterschool. Couple this with their anonymity because they show no outward physical characteristics to suggest they have diverse learning needs, this population could be considered to have ""invisible"" disabilities often assimilating unnoticeably within the general population if given certain accommodations. Participation in organized sport activities has been shown to increase self-concept, social skills, and peer acceptance (Armstrong & Drabman, 2004; Bagwell, Brooke, Peidham, & Hoza, 2001). However athletes with ""invisible"" disabilities may have difficulty participating in such activities due to challenges in one or more areas such as attention, impulse control, language processing, and motor skills. The purpose of this article is to provide youth sport coaches with strategies and methods that will increase the likelihood that athletes with ""invisible"" disabilities have successful team sport experiences and thus reap the benefits of participation.

189,TRAINING AND SYSTEMIC LOGIC IN ADAPTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES.,"Every adaptive participation, whether intended for a transitory or permanent difficulty, requires professional training to the maximum level from the theoretical and concrete point of view. For this reason, therefore, it is not possible to think of a training method that does not contemplate to a practical experience in a specific training. The didactic training, has always featured the internal training programs in the Italian Exercise and Sport Science Degree, and with the last transformation in L-22 Bachelor (Exercise and Sport Science and Health), it is further ""Extended"" to a commitment that exceeds two hundred and fifty hours of activity, born, from the requirement that every training individual has to learn, besides the assumed theory also the ecological information which can only be experienced ?on site?. Didactic knowledge about a motor control problem is entirely different from interacting in the classroom or in the gym with a person who has this type of disorder. In other words, only through a direct experience it is possible to understand how the different conceptuality of the moment, can play direct or against an adequate education and, above all, for how much exhaustive a theory can be, it will never be in the position to supply the changing details that can only be found in that type of environmental report, first of all, the different objective of each individual respect to another's. Under this light, the need of a specific experience that can provide the operational expertise that will, over time, make the difference between an able educator and a superficial one. The making of a good training experience depends, of course, in addition to the personal attitude, ability and willingness to participate, even by the ""quality"" of the structure where the experience is conducted. In fact, besides, institutes of high-value are often others that unfortunately do not always have all the requirements of organization and activities managements which they should offer. The places, whether physical or psychological, which accommodate individuals with difficulties (or structures, such as schools), must have intrinsic features which must not be disregarded. From the adapted architectonic conformations to the professional competences of the operators, the structure that receives this sensitive type of user must have the maximum logistic or operating functionality. Obviously and unfortunately, it is aware that regarding, as an example, the school structures, the problem is not trivial. And although if law foresees it, we live in an unthinkable era, with bureaucracy and general financial difficulties, we don't even hope in an adjustment of all structures which concerns the architectural barriers! However, we expect that where there is at least a disabled person he/she has its classroom on an accessible site, both for the toilets or any educational workshops. Passed experience has shown us many paradoxical situations in which some subjects with motor control difficulties had their classroom on one floor of the school, the laboratories in an other and the toilets still in another!

190,STUDENTS' ATTITUDES TOWARD INCLUDING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN REGULAR PE SETTINGS IN HONG KONG AND TAIWAN.,"The purpose of this study was to compare attitudes of final year students in teacher preparation programs in Hong Kong and Taiwan toward including students with disabilities into regular settings, and to further examine the influences of attitudes on the development of adapted physical education programs. A 15-item questionnaire was used to investigate students' attitudes and concerns toward inclusion. Seventy-seven students from Hong Kong and Taiwan participated in this study. The results of the survey indicated that students in Hong Kong and Taiwan philosophically support inclusion, although there were many concerns and different opinions regarding inclusion. The survey indicated that students from both locations thought special schools and teachers with special training will provide better education for students with disabilities than general teachers, and indicated the needs for more academic preparation for inclusion. The findings also suggest that without well prepared support services and other accommodations, students with disabilities will not benefit from these educational environments.

A multi-agency inclusion programs designed to provide assistance to community recreation providers and families of children with disabilities by developing a cadre of trained ""leisure companions"" who accompanied the children to programs was studied. While everyone supported the inclusion process, they indicated they would have liked more disability training and the leisure companions were more confident in their training than the coaches or instructors.

Subjects were 470 school building representatives and 62 adapted physical education professors throughout the nation. Confidence interval estimates (95 percent) of school building data correlated highest on relative importance with university census data on 8 of 37 total variables: motor ability test scores, developmental scale scores, reaching individualized education program instructional objectives, special education teacher recommendation, regular physical educator recommendation, activity offerings, classroom physical accessibility, and safety considerations. These represent those variables that should be used in some ""best practices"" combination by school personnel in making decisions regarding relevant students' class placement within physical education least restrictive environment alternatives.

193,Social Inclusion of Students With Physical Disabilities in General Physical Education: A Behavioral Analysis.,"The purpose was to describe the behaviors of eighth-grade students with and without physical disabilities relative to social inclusion in a general physical education program. Participants were 3 girls with physical disabilities and 19 classmates *(11 females. 8 males) without disabilities. The method was case study. Data for a 6-week softball unit were collected using videotapes, live observations, and interviews. Findings indicated that students with and without disabilities infrequently engaged in social interactions. Average percentage of rime that classmates gave to students with disabilities was 2% social talk and less than 1% in each category for praise, use of first name, feedback, and physical contact. Two themes emerged in this regard: segregated inclusion and social isolation. Students with disabilities interacted with each other to a greater degree than with classmates without disabilities. Analysis of use of academic learning time revealed different percentages for students with and without disabilities.

194,Physical-activity coaching and health status in rheumatoid arthritis: A person-oriented approach.,"Purpose. No interventions to promote physical activity can succeed for all participants. Insights into the specific characteristics of those who do succeed are needed. One aim was to investigate whether a selection of correlates of general health perception creates cluster typologies in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Another was to evaluate whether magnitude of change in health status differs between clusters after a 1-year coaching intervention targeting health-enhancing physical activity. Method. Two hundred and twenty-eight patients (74% women, mean age 56 years, disease duration 1 year) with RA, from 10 rheumatology clinics in Sweden, participated. The patients were assigned at random to intervention or control. The intervention group underwent 1 year of coaching to adopt health-enhancing physical activity (moderately intensive, 30 min/day, > 4 days/week). The cluster analysis included five correlates of general health perception: disease activity; pain; timed standing; activity limitation; and self-reported physical activity. The primary outcome of the coaching intervention was self-reported health status. Results. One-hundred and forty-six patients were eligible for inclusion in the cluster analysis. The eight clusters identified both at baseline and post interventions were operationalized according to the number of cluster variables affected: less (LE) affected or more (MO) affected, respectively. Clusters with LE affected variables had significantly better general health perception at baseline than those with MO affected variables. Further, coached individuals in MO affected clusters significantly improved self-reported health status compared both to those coached in LE affected clusters and to those in MO affected clusters in the control group. Conclusion. This person-based approach contributed more than did the results in a previous randomized controlled trial to the understanding of which patients benefit most from the present physical-activity coaching intervention. The intervention may thus be most beneficial for individuals more severely affected by their disease at baseline.

195,Examination of a Clinical Prediction Rule to Identify Patients With Neck Pain Likely to Benefit From Thoracic Spine Thrust Manipulation and a General Cervical Range of Motion Exercise: Multi-Center Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Background. A clinical prediction rule (CPR) purported to identify patients with neck pain who are likely to respond to thoracic spine thrust manipulation has recently been developed, but has yet to be validated. Objective. The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of this CPR. Design. This was a multi-center randomized clinical trial. Methods. One hundred forty patients with a primary report of neck pain were randomly assigned to receive either 5 sessions of stretching and strengthening exercise (exercise-only group) or 2 sessions of thoracic spine manipulation and cervical range of motion exercise followed by 3 sessions of stretching and strengthening exercise (manipulation + exercise group). Data on disability and pain were collected at baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 6 months. The primary aim (treatment group X time X status on the prediction rule) was examined using a linear mixed model with repeated measures. Time, treatment group, and status on the rule, as well as all possible 2-way and 3-way interactions, were modeled as fixed effects, with disability (and pain) as the dependent variable. Effect sizes were calculated for both pain and disability at each follow-up period. Results. There was no 3-way interaction for either disability or pain. A 2-way (group X time) interaction existed for both disability and pain. Pair-wise comparisons of disability demonstrated that significant differences existed at each follow-up period between the manipulation + exercise group and the exercise-only group. The patients who received manipulation exhibited lower pain scores at the 1-week follow-up period. The effect sizes were moderate for disability at each follow-up period and were moderate for pain at the 1-week follow-up. Limitations. Different exercise approaches may have resulted in a different outcome. Conclusions. The results of the current study did not support the validity of the previously developed (-PR. However, the results demonstrated that patients with mechanical neck pain who received thoracic spine manipulation and exercise exhibited significantly greater improvements in disability at both the short- and long- term follow-up periods and in pain at the 1-week follow-up compared with patients who received exercise only.

197,Dieting and body image in aesthetic sports: A comparison of Dutch female gymnasts and non-aesthetic sport participants,"Abstract: Objectives: To examine the relationship between dieting behavior and body image in female aesthetic athletes. Methods: Seventeen elite gymnasts, 51 non-elite gymnasts and a control group of 85 schoolgirls, participating in non-elite, merely recreational non-aesthetic sports, completed self-report measures of dieting behaviors and body image. Results: After controlling for BMI, the results showed that elite gymnasts dieted more often than controls, although they were not more negative about their body. Furthermore, non-elite gymnasts dieted as much as controls and had a more positive body image. Despite what general theories predict, the gymnasts‚Äô dieting was not so much related to a negative body image but rather to weight-related causal attributions or perceived weight-related coach pressure. Conclusions: Whereas controls believe that ‚Äòthin is beautiful‚Äô, gymnasts seem more convinced or persuaded that ‚Äòthin is going to win‚Äô. Future research should take into consideration that dieting and body image are likely to be developed differently in the context of aesthetic sports.

198,Determinants of Satisfaction With Community Reintegration in Older Adults With Chronic Stroke: Role of Balance Self-Efficacy.,"Background and Purpose: Many people with stroke have a low level of satisfaction with community reintegration. Although previous studies focused on the effect of physical factors on community reintegration, the effect of psychological factors, such as balance self-efficacy, has been ignored. The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of balance self-efficacy to satisfaction with community reintegration in older adults with chronic stroke. Subjects: A sample of 63 community-dwelling older adults (50 years of age or older) with chronic stroke (onset of 1 year or more) participated in this study. Methods: This study involved a secondary analysis of data collected from a stroke exercise clinical trial. Satisfaction with community reintegration was measured with the Reintegration to Normal Living (RNL) Index, and balance self-efficacy was measured with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale. Results: Bivariate correlation analysis showed that the RNL Index scores were moderately correlated with the ABC Scale scores. In a multiple regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, depression, and other impairments after stroke, balance self-efficacy remained independently associated with the RNL Index scores, accounting for 6.5% of the variance in the RNL Index scores. Discussion and Conclusion: Balance self-efficacy is an independent predictor of satisfaction with community reintegration in older adults with chronic stroke. Improving balance self-efficacy may be instrumental in enhancing community reintegration in this population.

200,Social Inclusion: What It Is and Why It's Important?,"Social inclusion for students with disabilities builds on steps taken for physically and academically inclusive learning environments and highlights the need for all students having frequent opportunities to interact with a broad range of peers in a variety of settings within and outside the classroom setting. This article presents some suggestions from students with disabilities, who participated, along with their non-disabled partners, in a listening session conducted for the federal government's Interagency Working Group effort to develop a national Strategic Plan to Improve Outcomes for All Youth. The suggestions for social inclusion needed to: (1) Provide equal treatment, equal opportunities to learn, and more activities for youth with disabilities; (2) Give youth with disabilities time and opportunities to find things they love doing; (3) Provide opportunities for youth to engage in the arts so they can express themselves and have something to look forward to; (4) Provide mentors, tutors, and coaches to help youth with disabilities participate and do well in school; (5) Provide more opportunities for youth with and without disabilities to interact with one another; and (6) Involve more people in Special Olympics, and align Special Olympics sports with school sports to build shared activities among students with and without disabilities. When these suggestions are integrated into a safe, equitable, nurturing, and engaging school climate, social inclusion can improve special and general education students' sense of well-being and help them develop positive attitudes toward those different from them.",Developing Countries;Sports;Adolescent;Athletics;Consciousness Raising;Well Being;Peer Relationship;Regular and Special Education Relationship;Interaction;Success;Student Needs;Coaching (Performance);Tutors;Mentors;Art Activities;Student Participation;Social Justice;Equal Education;Educational Improvement;Strategic Planning;Educational Environment;Disabilities;Social Attitudes;Inclusion,"Osher, David and Pickeral, Terry",2013.0,0,198

205,Reported School Experiences of Young People Living with Sickle Cell Disorder in England,"A survey of 569 young people with sickle cell disorder (SCD) in England has found such pupils miss considerable periods of time from school, typically in short periods of two or three days. One in eight has school absences equating to government-defined ""persistent absence"". Students with SCD report that they are not helped to catch up after these school absences. Half the children reported not being allowed to use the toilet when needed and not being allowed water in class; a third reported being made to take unsuitable exercise and being called lazy when tired. Children perceived both physical environment (temperature, school furniture) and social environment (being upset by teachers or other pupils) as triggers to episodes of their illness. Policy initiatives on school absences; preventive measures to ensure maintenance of good health; and measures to prevent perceived social attitudes precipitating ill health would also support children with other chronic illnesses at school.

206,Healthier Students Are Better Learners: A Missing Link in School Reforms to Close the Achievement Gap,"Objectives: This article provides an introduction to the October 2011 special issue of the ""Journal of School Health"" on ""Healthier Students Are Better Learners."" Methods: Literature was reviewed and synthesized to identify health problems affecting school-aged youth that are highly prevalent, disproportionately affect urban minority youth, directly and indirectly causally affect academic achievement, and can be feasibly and effectively addressed through school health programs and services. Results: Based on these criteria, 7 educationally relevant health disparities were selected as strategic priorities to help close the achievement gap: (1) vision, (2) asthma, (3) teen pregnancy, (4) aggression and violence, (5) physical activity, (6) breakfast, and (7) inattention and hyperactivity. Research clearly shows that these health problems influence students' motivation and ability to learn. Disparities among urban minority youth are outlined, along with the causal pathways through which each adversely affects academic achievement, including sensory perceptions, cognition, school connectedness, absenteeism, and dropping out. Evidence-based approaches that schools can implement to address these problems are presented. These health problems and the causal pathways they influence have interactive and a synergistic effect, which is why they must be addressed collectively using a coordinated approach. Conclusions: No matter how well teachers are prepared to teach, no matter what accountability measures are put in place, no matter what governing structures are established for schools, educational progress will be profoundly limited if students are not motivated and able to learn. Particular health problems play a major role in limiting the motivation and ability to learn of urban minority youth. This is why reducing these disparities through a coordinated approach warrants validation as a cohesive school improvement initiative to close the achievement gap. Local, state, and national policies for implementing this recommendation are suggested.

207,Physical Education and Implications for Students with Asperger's Syndrome,"In this article, James Williams, a young man with Asperger's syndrome (AS) shares his experiences taking physical education in a generalized education setting and discusses the implications for students with AS. He was diagnosed with AS when he was 9 years old. School was tough at times, especially when social interactions came into play. One of the toughest areas for him was physical education. Here, he was bullied, ridiculed, and forced to face up to some of his biggest fears. His experiences in physical education (PE) were mostly negative. The negativity relates to the fact that most tasks in PE were difficult for him. The authors believe that understanding the specific characteristics of students like James can help educators create a supportive physical education environment for individuals with AS. They added that successfully educating children with AS involves a deeper understanding of the disability and the implications for how the child's disability may directly affect his or her ability to participate to the fullest extent possible in the physical education setting.",Physical Education and Training;Humans;Interpersonal Competence;Psychomotor Skills;Teaching Methods;Cognitive Ability;Academic Ability;Emotional Problems;Behavior Problems;Inclusive Schools;Adapted Physical Education;Difficulty Level;Peer Relationship;Mainstreaming;Special Needs Students;Asperger Syndrome;Physical Education,"Simpson, Cynthia G. and Gaus, Mark D. and Biggs, Mary Jo Garcia and Williams, James, Jr.",2010.0,0,203
208,{Health Education for Musicians},"{Context and aims: Many musicians suffer for their art, and health is often compromised during training. The Health Promotion in Schools of Music (HPSM) project has recommended that health education should be included in core curricula, although few such courses have been evaluated to date. The aim of the study was to design, implement and evaluate a compulsory health education course at a UK conservatoire of music. Methods: The course design was informed by a critical appraisal of the literature on musicians' health problems and their management, existing health education courses for musicians, and the HPSM recommendations. It was delivered by a team of appropriately-qualified tutors over 5 months to 104 first-year undergraduate students, and evaluated by means of questionnaires at the beginning and end of the course. Thirty-three students who had been in their first year the year before the course was introduced served as a control group, completing the questionnaire on one occasion only. Items concerned: hearing and use of hearing protection; primary outcomes including perceived knowledge and importance of the topics taught on the course; and secondary outcomes including physical and psychological health and health-promoting behaviors. The content of the essays written by the first-year students as part of their course assessment served as a guide to the topics they found most interesting and relevant. Results: Comparatively few respondents reported using hearing protection when practicing alone, although there was some evidence of hearing loss, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. Perceived knowledge of the topics on the course, and awareness of the risks to health associated with performing music, increased, as did self-efficacy; otherwise, there were negative effects on secondary outcomes, and few differences between the intervention and control groups. The topics most frequently covered in students' essays were managing music performance anxiety, and life skills and behavior change techniques. Conclusion: There is considerable scope for improving music students' physical and psychological health and health-related behaviors through health education, and persuading senior managers, educators and students themselves that health education can contribute to performance enhancement.}",Music;Health Behavior;School Health Services;Health Education;Health Promotion;Health Educators,"Matei, Raluca and Broad, Stephen and Goldbart, Juliet and Ginsborg, Jane",,0,204
209,{Initial Teacher Preparation for Teaching Students with Exceptionalities: Teacher Education Students' Knowledge and Perceived Competence},"{This research study surveyed 100 undergraduate teacher education students in a regional university in Australia, explored self-reported perceptions of their knowledge about students with exceptional needs, and their competence to be effective educators of these students in an inclusive classroom. Additionally, we included a measure of general attitude toward teaching in an inclusive classroom. What made this exploratory study atypical was broadening the concept of `exceptionality' to the inclusion of items related to students with physical and cognitive challenges, superior academic gifts and those deemed to be twice exceptional. The results were unexpected in that teachers' age, parental status and exposure to units of study in special and inclusive education did not differentiate their knowledge, perceived competence, or general attitude.}",,"Bannister-Tyrrell, Michelle L. and Mavropoulou, Sofia and Jones, Marguerite and Bailey, Jeffrey and O'Donnell-Ostini, Anne and Dorji, Rinchen",,0,205
210,{Unveiling Issues Limiting Participation of Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder: From Early Identification to Insights for Intervention},"{Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a motor skill disorder affecting motor development in children. Part I employed a quantitative approach to validate the DCDQ-C. A total of 123 children in mainstream schools were recruited. Reliabilty analysis, Rasch model analysis, and exploratory factor analysis were conducted. Part II tested the hypothesis that the correlation between movement skills and sensory processing patterns of children with motor coordination problems was different to that for children without motor coordination problems. Fisher's r-to-z transformation was used to compare the correlation between the two groups. Part III used a case study approach to describe the activity participation of children with DCD. The motor performance, sensory problems, self-efficacy, and participation of the children at home, at school, and in the community were examined thoroughly. The DCDQ-C was confirmed to have favourable internal reliability and construct validity. The factor structured identified in this study was the same as the original scale. Through comparing the significant correlations between the DCD and typically developing groups, significant correlations were evidenced between poor fine motor and handwriting skills and low registration sensory processing pattern in the DCD group. The commonly reported difficulties among children with DCD were low emotional efficacy, low social self-efficacy, and difficulty participating in home- and community-based activities requiring fine motor, communication, or organizational skills. This study is significant as it assists therapists, teachers, and parents to a greater understanding of the underlying issues that may interfere with children's participation at home, at school, and in the community.}",Motor Skills;Child;Only Child;Motor Skills Disorders,"Chung, Eva Yin-han",,0,206
211,{Training tomorrow's doctors to explain `medically unexplained' physical symptoms: An examination of UK medical educators' views of barriers and solutions},"{Objective: Co-occuring physical symptoms, unexplained by organic pathology (known as Functional Syndromes, FS), are common and disabling presentations. However, FS is absent or inconsistently taught within undergraduate medical training. This study investigates the reasons for this and identifies potential solutions to improved implementation. Methods: Twenty-eight medical educators from thirteen different UK medical schools participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis proceeded iteratively, and in parallel with data production. Results: Barriers to implementing FS training are beliefs about the complexity of FS, tutors' negative attitudes towards FS, and FS being perceived as a low priority for the curriculum. In parallel participants recognised FS as ubiquitous within medical practice and erroneously assumed it must be taught by someone. They recommended that students should learn about FS through managed exposure, but only if tutors' negative attitudes and behaviour are also addressed. Conclusion: Negative attitudes towards FS by educators prevents designing and delivering effective education on this common medical presentation. Whilst there is recognition of the need to implement FS training, recommendations are multifaceted. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

212,{Removing Barriers and Facilitating Access: Increasing the Number of Physicians With Disabilities},"{Nearly one-fifth of the U.S. population has a disability, and many of these Americans experience disparities in the health care they receive. In part, these health care disparities result from a lack of understanding about disability by health care providers. The education of physicians is grounded in a biomedical model that emphasizes pathology, impairment, or dysfunction, rather than a social model of disability that focuses on removing barriers for individuals with disabilities and improving their capabilities. According to a recent report, only 2.7\% of medical students disclosed having disabilitiesfar fewer than the proportion of people with disabilities in the U.S. population. Including students and other trainees with disabilitiesthose with lived experiences of disability who can empathize with patients and serve as an example for their peersin medical education is one mechanism to address the health care disparities faced by individuals with disabilities. At present, medical students and residents with disabilities face structural barriers related to policies and procedures, clinical accommodations, disability and wellness support services, and the physical environment. Additionally, many face cultural barriers related to the overarching attitudes, beliefs, and values prevalent at their medical school. In this Commentary, the authors review the state of disability in medical education and training, summarize key findings from an Association of American Medical Colleges special report on disability, and discuss considerations for medical educators to improve inclusion, including emerging technologies that can enhance access for students with disabilities.}","Students, Medical","Meeks, Lisa M. and Herzer, Kurt and Jain, Neera R.",,0,208

Participation and appropriate support in school are complex concepts, although few studies have investigated all stakeholders' perspectives. Methods: Phenomenology informed the study that centered on the concept of a successful school experience. In-depth interviews occurred with students (n = 7), parents (n = 11), teachers (n = 10), school principals (n = 9) and allied health practitioners (n = 10) to gain the perspective from multiple vantage points. Specific research questions, interview guides and demographic questionnaires were configured for each group. Interviews were analyzed thematically within and between groups. Results: Three key themes emerged: Collaborative partnerships between families, schools and outside organizations; School culture and attitude is key; and, allied health practitioners are part of home and school teams. Conclusions: Student and school success was impacted substantially by the capacity of adults in the student's life to collaborate - family, school professionals and allied health practitioners. An inclusive school culture was crucial to students with cerebral palsy. All parties needed to prioritize promotion of an open and positive school culture built around problem-solving inclusive practices. Involved people, such as allied health practitioners, bring knowledge and skills that are not otherwise readily available in school environments.}",Cerebral Palsy,"Bourke-Taylor, Helen M. and Cotter, Claire and Lalor, Aislinn and Johnson, Lindy",,0,210
215,{Gendered experiences of inclusive education for children with disabilities in West and East Africa},"{Background. Education is a fundamental human right, yet many children with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries remain deprived of educational opportunities. The movement towards quality inclusive education (IE) aims to support all children at school. Although gender and disability are key factors influencing IE, limited research explores their combined influence. Purpose. This study explored the gendered experiences of IE for children with disabilities in West and East Africa. Methods. A qualitative interpretive secondary analysis was conducted on studies from Guinea, Sierra Leone, Togo, Niger, Zambia, and Malawi. Interviews with children, community members, and policy stakeholders were thematically analysed to explore intersections among gender, disability, and education. Findings. Boys and girls with disabilities experienced similar cases of social exclusion at school. However, girls with disabilities were further hindered by societal biases against their educational potential and by sexual abuse. While boys with disabilities were stereotyped as more capable, their experiences of emotional and physical violence were often overlooked. Implications. To achieve quality IE for all, strategies should aim to foster inclusive and safe school environments for all children, empower girls with disabilities to pursue education, and challenge gendered societal attitudes that hinder educational opportunities.}","Africa, Eastern;Child;Only Child;Humanism;Humanities;Disabled Children;Humans","Hui, Neva and Vickery, Emily and Njelesani, Janet and Cameron, Debra",,0,211
216,{Between a rock and a hard place: the impact of the professionalization of the role of the teaching assistant in mainstream school physical education in the United Kingdom},"{National surveys of the role of the teaching assistant (TA) in the United Kingdom and the para-educator in the USA have explored and revealed trends in the recruitment, training, deployment and perception of their roles. Recent subject-specific research in the UK has further considered how TAs construct their role when supporting disabled pupils in a specific curriculum subject in a mainstream setting. In light of the implementation of a new code of practice in England from 2014 which changes the way in which a child with special educational needs and disabilities is supported in schools and beyond, this paper explores the roles of TAs working in secondary mainstream schools in the UK who are employed to support disabled children in Physical Education. It considers the way in which the role of the TA has evolved and developed in England following `Workforce Reform' in 2003 and draws on research and literature from a number of sources to explain and update the nomenclature and responsibilities of the para-professional who seems to work `subdoceo' (from the Latin meaning `to teach as an assistant'). It is an attempt to consolidate what we know about these roles in a specific subject and to reaffirm the trends identified from the existing small body of work in the UK. In doing so, this paper aims to provide a platform for further research but will also remind teachers of their role in ensuring that their collaboration with and deployment of these `paraprofessionals' is paramount to the best interests of the child.}",England;Child;Only Child;Great Britain;Physical Education and Training,"Farr, Jackie",,0,212
217,{Risk and Safety in Physical Education for Children With Disabilities: Adapted Physical Education Textbook Review and Primer for Teachers},"{Purpose: Much of the information physical educators learn about children with disabilities occurs in an introduction to adapted physical education course. Because disabilities often have concomitant medical conditions, it is critical that PE teachers are knowledgeable about risks and safety measures for children with special needs. The purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which authors of APE textbooks address risk and safety issues and how accessible the information is. Method: The authors examined eight textbooks in print for APE courses. Topics examined included asthma, atlantoaxial instability, diabetes, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, obesity, spina bifida, and abuse. Results: None of the textbooks covered safety procedures for every topic. In general, the longer books provided more coverage of the topics. Discussion: PE teachers should not rely solely on APE textbooks for appropriate management of medical conditions. The authors present symptoms and appropriate management of targeted conditions. Eight recommendations are made to improve safety for students at risk.}",Child;Only Child;Disabled Children;Physical Education and Training,"Hughes, Patricia Paulsen and Ramos, Nilo and Mwarumba, Njoki",,0,213
218,{Infant Neuromotor Development and Childhood Problem Behavior},"{With this prospective population-based study, we showed that infant neuromotor development, including muscle tone and senses, predicted internalizing problems but not externalizing problems through age 10 years. BACKGROUND:Research of adults and school-aged children suggest a neurodevelopmental basis for psychiatric disorders. We examined whether infant neuromotor development predicted internalizing and externalizing problems in young children. METHODS:In Generation R, a population-based cohort in the Netherlands (2002-2006), trained research assistants evaluated the neuromotor development of 4006 infants aged 2 to 5 months by using an adapted version of Touwen's Neurodevelopmental Examination (tone, responses, and senses and other observations). We defined nonoptimal neuromotor development as scores in the highest tertile. Mothers and fathers rated their children's behavior at ages 1.5, 3, 6, and 10 years with the Child Behavior Checklist (n = 3474, response: 86.7\%). The associations were tested with generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS:Overall, neuromotor development predicted internalizing scores, but no association was observed with externalizing scores. Nonoptimal muscle tone was associated with higher internalizing scores (mothers' report: = .07; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.01 to 0.13; fathers' report: = .09, 95\% CI: 0.00 to 0.16). In particular, nonoptimal low muscle tone was associated with higher internalizing scores (mothers' report: = .11; 95\% CI: 0.05 to 0.18; fathers' report: = .13; 95\% CI: 0.04 to 0.22). We also observed an association between senses and other observations with internalizing scores. There was no relationship between high muscle tone or reflexes and internalizing scores. CONCLUSIONS:Common emotional problems in childhood have a neurodevelopmental basis in infancy.

219,"{Sexuality education including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues in schools}","{Should children and adolescents be educated in school about gender diversity, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues? This is a question many governments and educational policymakers discuss in their process of reforming relationships and sex education. However, these reform plans face resistance from parents, religious groups, and political parties. Specifically, opponents argue that (a) children who learn about LGBT issues in school will engage in same-sex practices or even become homosexual, bisexual, or trans{*} themselves; (b) schools force a particular view on children that stands in contrast to the heteronormative, religious, and/or political views of parents; and (c) teachers act as role models and change the sexual orientation and gender identity of their students. This systematic literature review aims to offer evidenced based answers to these arguments on the grounds of biological, sociological, psychological, and educational research. First, twin studies and genome scans in behavioral genetics research unveil strong biological roots of sexual orientation and identity that will not change through inclusive sexuality education. Second, psychological and sociological research signals that heteronormativity, homosexuality non-acceptance, and negative attitudes toward LGBT people in general are associated with lower levels of education and intelligence as well as higher levels of religious belief and political conservatism. For at-risk sexual minority students who show gender nonconforming and gender atypical behavior, schools can create a safe climate and protect adolescent health if they succeed in reducing homophobic and transphobic discrimination, bullying, peer victimization, and verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Third, action research and ethnographic narratives in educational research tend to indicate that queer educators as role models in classrooms do not change the sexual orientation and gender identity of their pupils. In summary, based on this systematic review, governments and policy makers can expect that reforming the teaching of sex education to include LGBT issues in schools will have positive effects for heterosexual students and for students belonging to a sexual minority.}","Sexual Behavior;Homosexuality, Female;Transgendered Persons;Child;Homosexuality, Male;Only Child;Adolescent;Bisexuality","Gegenfurtner, Andreas and Gebhardt, Markus",,0,215

A convenience sample of four elite male goalball athletes with visual impairment voluntarily participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured telephone interviews and reflective field notes, and an interpretive phenomenological analysis was conducted for theme development. Member checking, peer debriefing, and communicative validity were utilized to ensure trustworthiness. Even though the participants' experiences varied due to their personal and contextual characteristics, four interrelated themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) PE teachers are central to PE experiences; (b) internalized exclusion; (c) athletic identity struggle; and (d) extracurricular opportunity. These themes are discussed in relation to the existing literature.

221,{Implementing the adapted physical education E-learning program into physical education teacher education program},"{According to the Ministry of Education Korea (2014), the approximately 70.4\% of all students with disabilities are included in general schools in Korea. However, studies show that Korean GPE teachers do not feel comforatble or prepared to include students with disabilities (Oh \& Lee, 1999; Roh, 2002; Roh \& Oh, 2005). The purpose of this study was to explore whether an APE e-learning supplement would have an impact on the level of self-efficacy and content knowledge of pre-service teachers related to including students with intellectual disabilities. An APE supplement was developed based on the Instructional Design Model (Dick, Carey, \& Carey, 2005) to provide three sources of self-efficacy, mastery experience, vicarious experience, and social persuasions. Three groups of pre-service teachers (N = 75) took the same content supplement with different delivery system, E-learning group (n = 25) with online, traditional group (n = 25) with printed handout, and control group (n = 25) without supplement. Two instruments, the Physical Educators' Situation-Specific Self efficacy and Inclusion Student with Disabilities in Physical Education (SE-PETE-D) and the content knowledge test, were given to all participants twice (i.e., pretest and posttest). A 3 x 2 mixed effect ANOVA revealed that pre-service teachers' perceived self-efficacy (p = 0.023) improved after taking the e-learning supplement. However, there was no significant difference in the level of content knowledge (p = 0.248) between the learning group and tranditional group.}",Korea;Physical Education and Training,"Kwon, Eun Hye and Block, Martin E.",,0,217
222,{Knowledge of asthma and anaphylaxis among teachers in Spanish schools},"{Introduction: Allergic diseases affect 15-20\% of the paediatric population in the industrialised world. Most educational centres in Spain do not have health professionals among their staff, and the teachers are in charge of child care in school. The advisability of specific training of the teaching staff should be considered, with the introduction of concrete intervention plans in the event of life-threatening emergencies in schools. Material and methods: Evaluation of the training needs constitutes the first step in planning an educational project. In this regard, the Health Education Group of the Spanish Society of Clinical Immunology, Allergology and Paediatric Asthma (Grupo de Education Sanitaria de la Sociedad Espanola de Inmunologia Clinica, Alergologia y Asma Pediatrica {[}SEICAAP]) assessed the knowledge of teachers in five Spanish Autonomous Communities, using a self-administered questionnaire specifically developed for this study. The data obtained were analysed using the SPSS statistical package. Results: A total of 2479 teachers completed the questionnaire. Most of them claimed to know what asthma is, and almost one half considered that they would know how to act in the event of an asthma attack. This proportion was higher among physical education teachers. Most would not know how to act in the case of anaphylaxis or be able to administer the required medication. In general, the teachers expressed interest in receiving training and in having an interventional protocol applicable to situations of this kind. Discussion: It is important to know what the training requirements are in order to develop plans for intervention in the event of an emergency in school. Teachers admit a lack of knowledge on how to deal with these disorders, but express a wish to receive training. (C) 2017 SEICAP. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

223,"{Three Effective Ways to Nurture Our Brain Physical Activity, Healthy Nutrition, and Music. A Review}","{A growing body of research suggests that physical activity, healthy eating, and music can, either directly or indirectly, have positive effects on our brain and cognition. More specifically, exercising and eating seem to enhance cognitive abilities, such as memory, creativity, and perception. They also improve academic performance and play a protective role from many degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Concerning music, research has shown that there exists a general positive relation between music aptitude and cognitive functioning. Furthermore, the presence of music seems to create a positive mood and a higher arousal, which translates into better performance in many cognitive tasks. This literature review provides an overview of the major empirical findings in this domain. Studies on both healthy and clinical individuals are reviewed and discussed. We conclude with suggestions for educators, policymakers, people in helping professions, and any others interested in making informed decisions about possible ways to nurture their own brain or the brain of the people they are trying to help.

224,{Physical Education Experiences at Residential Schools for Students Who Are Blind: A Phenomenological Inquiry},"{Structured abstract: Introduction: Recently, researchers have explored the perspectives of those with disabilities to better understand their experiences in physical education. However, little has been done with focusing on those with visual impairments. Utilizing a qualitative interpretive phenomenological analysis framework, the purpose of this study was to examine the meaning that adults with visual impairments who attended residential schools for students who are blind ascribed to their physical education experiences. Methods: A group of five adult males who attended physical education at residential schools in the United States were purposely selected for this study. Data were collected via semistructured telephone interviews and reflective interview notes. Data were analyzed using a five-step analytical process, and recurring themes were summarized and presented as results. Results and discussion: Two broadly defined interrelated themes emerged from the participants' narratives. One theme, ``being the only blind guy, to being one of the crowd,{''} explained how differences in school settings contributed to the differences experienced by participants when attending residential and public or community schools. Cumulatively, participants described their residential school experiences as more inclusive and explained feelings of ``being normal.{''} The second theme, ``the bullies and the bullied,{''} explained the lived experiences of participants within the social dynamics of physical education environments and showed perceptions of those who were ``able{''} and ``less able.{''} Implications for practitioners: Listening to the voices of individuals with disabilities can afford researchers and teachers with a better understanding of how they experience classes and help identify strategies to improve instruction. Two important implications for physical education teachers derived from this study were to ensure that adaptations are made to meet students' needs, and that students are afforded choices within their physical education curriculum. Furthermore, in addition to experiences of bullying in inclusive settings, practitioners must be aware of these instances in residential schools as well.}",Vision Disorders;Physical Education and Training,"Haegele, Justin A. and Sato, Takahiro and Zhu, Xihe and Avery, Timothy",,0,220
225,"{DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A TEACHING-LEARNING SEQUENCE ABOUT CELIAC DISEASE IN PRIMARY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS} - {10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI2017)}","{Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic immune-mediated disorder caused by gluten and related prolamins in genetically predisposed individuals. People suffering this disorder (1-2\% of the population) must avoid gluten in diet. Even if it seems to be easy, celiac people is frequently misunderstood and the poor knowledge of society worsens their quality of life. Celiac children are especially vulnerable. It ` s important to make efforts in order to integrate them completely in the school and friends group and guarantee them a proper physical and psychological grow up. Then, enhancing the knowledge of children about these limiting disorders would affect the integration and quality of life of this collective. Both Primary Education (PE) graduates and Human Nutrition and Dietetics (HND) graduates have the responsibility to give nutritional education among children and society. Nevertheless, these students do not commonly develop this competence during the Degree. Therefore, it is interesting to carry out multidisciplinary and collaborative projects during the Final Year Dissertation (FYD) that make students put together the capabilities of both professionals on this social responsibility. Following this idea, in the previous course (2015-2016), students from PE and HND Degrees from the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) collaboratively developed an inquiry-oriented teaching-learning sequence (TLS) that aims to introduce elementary students and teachers to CD and gluten free diet (GFD). Scientific contents were adapted to the cognitive capability of children and laboratory experiments were designed to make them learn about gluten and GFD through an interactive workshop performed during one day at the university laboratories. This first approach was successful, as demonstrated by the results obtained in the questionnaires filled in by the students before and after the activity. In this course (2016-2017), we adapted the TLS to the primary school classroom, in order to design useful material that can be worked at schools in an autonomous way (i.e. without experts support). The adapted TLS consisted of an interactive talk with classroom response systems about gluten and CD and a number of collaborative experimental activities in the classroom, following an inquiry-based learning approach (sensory analysis of gluten containing and not containing bread, interpretation of the label information of different food products and cosmetics, comparative analysis of different cereals flours, and detection of gluten in biscuits with immunocromatographic columns). The TLS offers a student-centered approach in which the teacher plays the role of supervisor, seeking to encourage the development of scientific competences and to facilitate the significant learning about gluten and GFD concepts. Before and after the intervention, students fulfilled a questionnaire in order to detect any change in their comprehension of the topic. Questionnaires responses were statistically analyzed (by McNeman or Wilcoxon tests). Results were positive in terms of identification of potential gluten containing foods and in the comprehension of the concepts such as ``gluten{''} and CD, among others. These results confirmed the success of the designed TLS, and highlighted the usefulness of developing collaborative projects during the FYD. The TLS could be implemented at any primary school autonomously with simple material.}",Child;Only Child;Questionnaires;Phenylpropanolamine;Glutens;Celiac Disease;Humanism;Humanities;Humans,"Navarro, Virginia and Ruiz-Gonzalez, Aritz and Garcia, Adrian and Churruca, Itziar and , Mir and a, Jonatan and Bustamante, Marian and Simon, Edurne and Lasa, Arrate",,0,221

Method: An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) research approach was used and 16 adults (ages 21-48 years; 10 women, 6 men) with visual impairments acted as participants for this study. The primary sources of data were semistructured audiotaped telephone interviews and reflective field notes, which were recorded during and immediately following each interview. Thematic development was undertaken utilizing a 3-step analytical process guided by IPA. Results: Based on the data analysis, 3 interrelated themes emerged from the participant transcripts: (a) feelings about ``being put to the side,{''} frustration and inadequacy; (b) ``She is blind, she can't do it,{''} debilitating feelings from physical educators' attitudes; and (c) ``not self-esteem raising,{''} feelings about peer interactions. The 1st theme described the participants' experiences and ascribed meaning to exclusionary practices. The 2nd theme described the participants' frustration over being treated differently by their PE teachers because of their visual impairments. Lastly, ``not self-esteem raising,{''} feelings about peer interactions demonstrated how participants felt about issues regarding challenging social situations with peers in PE. Conclusions: Utilizing an IPA approach, the researchers uncovered 3 interrelated themes that depicted central feelings, experiences, and reflections, which informed the meaning of the participants' PE experiences. The emerged themes provide unique insight into the embodied experiences of those with visual impairments in PE and fill a previous gap in the extant literature.}",Independent Practice Associations;Retrospective Studies;Physical Education and Training;Vision Disorders,"Haegele, Justin A. and Zhu, Xihe",,0,223
229,{Spatializing Student Learning to Reimagine the ``Place{''} of Inclusion},"{Background/Context: The goal of inclusive education is universally recognized as the fundamental restructuring of schools to engage hospitably with all forms of difference, including ability. However, inclusion, at least in practice, has come to mean the physical placement of students with disabilities in general education classrooms. The conundrum of inclusion as currently implemented is that its entanglement with place weakens the possibility of the required large-scale transformation of school spaces. Additionally, analyses of place and disability/inclusion generally assume the concept of place to represent a fixed, stable entity with determinate boundaries, making it difficult to disrupt the linkage between place and disability. Purpose/Objective: This article is an attempt to explore a new conception of place that would permit educators to engage with student learning differences without associating them with fixed environments. Rather than consider place as a fixed, naturalized entity, I draw on theorists who develop the spatial dimension of human experience alongside the social and temporal. Within this theoretical perspective, school places are not merely containers within which events take place; rather, they are formed in the interaction of webs of ideas and people. The research questions for this article, therefore, were as follows: How is place constructed within the discourse of teachers? To what extent do such constructions reflect prevailing notions of special education or inclusion as a place? Research Design: Data for this article drew primarily on 19 interviews I conducted with nine educators during the course of a series of ethnographically-oriented studies conducted between 2005 and 2014. Each of the studies addressed in this article was conducted in schooling sites in the U.S. where general and special education teachers were supporting students with a range of disabilities in inclusive classrooms. Teacher interview data from a nine-month professional development sequence in inclusive practices were also used for this article. The development of categories during data analysis for this article emerged from triangulating interview data with extensive field notes maintained for each site. Findings: Data analysis disclosed that teachers participated in maintaining the boundaries of places through their conceptions of students as learners, even as their own professional identities were produced via the historically mediated beliefs and practices that were implicated within those places. As educators struggled to create places of inclusion, the identities of such places differed depending on the logic in which they were anchored: student connectedness or learning need. Conclusions: Supported by an alternate conceptualization of learning need, I draw on the linkage between teacher identity and place to propose that a diasporic sensibility can enable different relations between the two, making inclusion a spatially fluid project involving changing networks of people and experiences.}",Humanism;Humanities;Humans,"Naraian, Srikala",,0,224
230,{Outdoor Play Decisions by Caregivers of Children with Disabilities: a Systematic Review of Qualitative Studies},"{Outdoor play offers children vast benefits for development and well-being. However, children with developmental disabilities participate less in outdoor play than their typical peers. Typically, adults make decisions about children's play routines, especially for children with developmental disabilities. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the results from qualitative studies on decision making processes of caregivers around outdoor play in children with developmental disabilities using ecocultural theory. Studies addressing decision making of parents, teachers, and other caregivers of primary school-aged children with developmental disabilities relating to outdoor play were searched in CINHAL, Medline, Web of Science, ERIC, Scopus, PsycINFO, and SocINDEX from 1990 to May 2015. Eleven predominately qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. The CASP quality of reporting quality checklist was used to evaluate the transparency of reporting for included studies. An ecocultural framework was used for thematic analysis and synthesis. Results showed caregivers, families, schools, and communities consider many factors when deciding about when, where, how, and if outdoor play occurs. Factors comprised: motivation for participation in outdoor play; social and built environments; familial and school considerations including time and finances; caregivers' awareness of opportunities; and child considerations such as their skills, health, and interests. A dynamic interaction exists between and within the ecocultural environment of a child with developmental disabilities to determine decision outcomes in outdoor play. Consequently, to increase the opportunities for benefits associated with outdoor play, each ecocultural layer must be targeted.}",Decision Making;Child;Developmental Disabilities;Only Child;Caregivers;Disabled Children,"Sterman, Julia and Naughton, Geraldine and Froude, Elspeth and Villeneuve, Michelle and Beetham, Kassia and Wyver, Shirley and Bundy, Anita",,0,225

It examined the effect of TPB variables and personality on reported inclusive teaching behaviours for learners with ID. SampleThe sample comprised 145 primary school teachers (85\% female) from mainstream schools across Scotland. MethodParticipants completed a TPB questionnaire assessing attitudes (instrumental and affective), subjective norms (injunctive and descriptive norms), perceptions of control (self-efficacy and controllability), and behavioural intentions towards using inclusive strategies. The Big Five Personality Index, measuring extraversion, conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism, and agreeableness, was also completed. Teaching practices were reported 2weeks later. ResultsInstrumental attitudes, descriptive norm, self-efficacy, and neuroticism predicted teachers' intentions to use inclusive strategies. Further, conscientiousness had indirect effects on intentions through TPB variables. These intentions, however, did not predict reported behaviour expected by TPB. Instead, self-efficacy was the only significant predictor of reported behaviour.

235,"{`The Move', an innovative simulation-based medical education program using roleplay to teach neurological semiology: Students' and teachers' perceptions}","{Introduction. Neurological disorders are frequently being managed by general practitioners. It is therefore critical that future physicians become comfortable with neurological examination and physical diagnosis. Graduating medical students often consider neurological examination as one of the clinical skills they are least comfortable with, and they even tend to be neurophobic. One way to improve the learning of neurological semiology is to design innovative learner-friendly educational methods, including simulation training. Methods. The feasibility of mime-based roleplaying was tested by a simulation training program in neurological semiology called `The Move'. The program was proposed to third year medical students at Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris during their neurology rotation. Students were trained to roleplay patients by miming various neurological syndromes (pyramidal, vestibular, cerebellar, parkinsonian) as well as distal axonopathy, chorea and tonic clonic seizures. Using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, the students' and teachers' emotional experience and views on the impact of the program were then investigated. Results. A total of 223/365 students (61\%) chose to participate in the study. Both students and teachers felt their participation was pleasant. Students stated that The Move increased their motivation to learn neurological semiology (78\%), and improved both their understanding of the subject (77\%) and their long-term memorization of the teaching content (86\%). Although only a minority thought The Move was likely to improve their performance on their final medical examination (32\%), a clear majority (77\%) thought it would be useful for their future clinical practice. Both students (87\%) and teachers (95\%) thought The Move should be included in the medical curriculum. Conclusion. - Mime-based roleplaying simulation may be a valuable tool for training medical students in neurological semiology, and may also help them to overcome neurophobia.

This study investigated factors influencing alcohol consumption in adolescent football players in Germany. Structural equation modeling was used to understand how the different predictors work together, thereby improving alcohol prevention in the field of football. The hypothesized model was largely confirmed and the most significant predictive factor of alcohol consumption was the drinking behavior of friends. Alcohol expectancies and drinking refusal self-efficacy (DRSE) were also shown to impact alcohol use. Friend norms regarding alcohol use had little influence on alcohol consumption. There was no direct association between alcohol consumption and the motivational climate during football training (task and competitive orientation) and support provided by the coach. This highlights the importance of focusing on adjusting the perception of alcohol use in friends and alcohol use norms as well as social self-efficacy in resisting peer pressure to drink in alcohol prevention strategies in team sport.}",Sports;Drinking Behavior;Alcoholics;Football;Germany;Alcohol Drinking;Adolescent,"Kroeske, Bjoern",,0,232
238,{HOW TO DEVELOP COGNITIVE STRATEGIES IN CLASS} - {EDULEARN16: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},"{Inclusion in education is an essential human right for all children and young persons. The principle of inclusive education was employed for the first time at the Salamanca World Conference on Special Needs Education (SEN), where inclusive education means that: ``School should accept all children without considering their physical, intellectual, emotional, linguistic or other condition, including disabled and gifted children, street and working children, children from remote or nomadic population, children from linguistic, ethnic or cultural minorities and children coming from other disadvantaged or marginalized areas or groups. In Italy there's an increasing number of children being labelled as having ``special needs{''}. Particularly children from ethnic minorities or socio-economically less favourable circumstances are at risk of underachieving and early exclusion from educational system, preventing them from successful educational chances. Children with SEN are regularly tested all their lives. Thus it seems as if life-long testing prevails over life-long learning. According to the test results, decisions are made concerning special needs provisions, help, curricula, therapy, work, income, etc. Testing often starts early in life; this takes place as soon as deviation from the standard is suspected. The impact of testing is extremely high: it may be directed towards diagnosis of medical underlying ethology, developmental profile, neuropsychological functioning and learning performance. But it cannot adjust the learning problem at school, nor can support teacher in the classroom, and above all help students to become part of the class. This study aims at going through and studying the effects of a mediated intervention program that was carried out in a primary school. This program regarded 120 students aged 8-9, attending the 3rd class, half of them Italian and half immigrants of first or second generation. Some of their teachers joined as mentors. The tasks were focused on the participants' cognitive enhancement through Feuerstein Instrumental Enrichment, and on a task concerning the body awareness and mediated learning experience. The Feuerstein's Instrumental Enrichment Program (FIE) is a series of activities concentrating directly on the development of thinking skills. The implementation of the instruments effectively needs a distinct teaching style called Mediated Learning Experience (MLE). The intention is to improve students' social adaptability that ultimately contributes towards real-life problem solving skills. The Enrichment Program is developed on the idea according to which intelligence is dynamic and modifiable and not static or fixed. Thus, the program tries to sharpen critical thinking with concepts, skills, strategies, operations, and techniques necessary for autonomous learning. It is an instrument to identify and improve deficiencies in thinking skills, in addition to helping students to learn how to learn. The task content is specially designed to foster autonomous thinking in the learner. As there are limited studies on learners in remedial schools, this study intended to assume that students exposed to mediation would get a significant improvement in cognitive functioning.

The literature shows a growing evidence that teachers play a key role in the development of high-quality inclusive systems (European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education, 2015). This paper presents findings from a cross-national survey conducted among 147 teachers from mainstream schools in Poland. The authors investigated the teachers' attitudes towards inclusive education of children with different types of special educational needs as well as several factors associated with them: gender, age, work experience, and special education training. To examine the problems Attitudes Toward Inclusive Education Scale (Wilczenski, 1995) was used. The analysis was prepared in SPSS program and statistical tests were used to find correlations. Overall, the participants supported inclusion of children with mild emotional problems, mild learning difficulties, physical disabilities and communication disorders but were not so much in favor of accommodating students with sensory disabilities (deaf and blind), very low academic achievements (2 or more years below other students) and challenging behaviors in regular classes. These students presumably have high support needs. Furthermore, correlations between the attitudes of teachers toward inclusion and demographic features were examined and compared with other research available in current databases. In the discussion part benefits and drawbacks of the research and its implications for practice were discussed. A special emphasis is put on the need to support teachers in providing high-quality education for all children.}",Mainstreaming (Education);Child;Poland;Attitude;Only Child,"Cwirynkalo, Katarzyna and Mysliwczyk, Iwona",,0,234
240,{Utilising a Leadership Blueprint to Build the Capacity of Schools to Achieve Outcomes for Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder} - {LEADERSHIP IN DIVERSE LEARNING CONTEXTS},"{Leadership is an important facet of all organisations, but it is a particularly complex and critical component in schools, which can be seen as microcosms of the societies and communities they represent. School leaders are faced with ever more daunting tasks as the expectations for improved student outcomes place increasing pressure on school staff. In addition, with the advent of the inclusion of increasingly diverse populations in schools, encompassing students with a range of educational, physical, and behavioural needs, school leaders are having to play an expanded role in guiding staff, facilitating collaboration with parents, and forming relationships with and mentoring individual students. Amongst students with identified disabilities, the number diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has increased, placing demands on both teachers and school leaders to address the specific needs of these individuals in areas such as social skills, adaptive behaviours, communication, and academic skills. Researchers have suggested that few principals or school leaders have received any training in special education (Praisner CL, Except Children 69(2):135-145, 2003), and yet they are increasingly being called upon to fulfil leadership roles related to educational programs for students with ASD and other developmental disabilities. Needless to say, this mismatch between knowledge and roles has been found to create tension and stress for all stakeholders (Emam MM, Farrell P, Eur J Spec Needs Educ 24(4):407-422, 2009). In addition, parents and educators have pushed for schools to develop better whole-school processes to enable teachers to set high expectations for students with ASD (Starr EM, Foy JB, Remedial Spec Educ 33(4):207-216, 2012) and to support these students to achieve quality outcomes and life goals commensurate with their neurotypical peers. The role of principals in developing and leading these processes is an important point of consideration, and has been highlighted as crucial to the successful development of inclusive cultures in schools (Kugelmass J, Ainscow M, J Res Spec Educ Needs 4(3):133-141, 2004). In addition, researchers have stressed that principals are most successful if they lead their school communities in systematic steps to develop a positive school ethos which promotes the learning of students with a range of needs, including those with ASD (Humphrey N, Lewis S, J Res Spec Educ Needs 8(3):132-140, 2008). Despite these findings, little research has examined how principals and school leaders can combine the research on promoting inclusive schools and student outcomes, with the research on best practice for students with ASD.}","Child Development Disorders, Pervasive;Autistic Disorder","Webster, Am and , a",,0,235
241,{Developing mainstream resource provision for pupils with autism spectrum disorder: staff perceptions and satisfaction},"{The majority of children and young people with autism spectrum disorder are educated in mainstream schools. The diverse needs of this group of pupils has led to a continuum of provision being promoted in the UK and other countries, and developed at a local level. This continuum includes mainstream schools with resource provision which can offer enhanced physical and staffing resources beyond those normally provided in mainstream schools. How teaching staff perceive such provisions and their development over time have not previously been investigated. The current study was designed to explore the perceptions of staff working in five primary and three secondary school resource provisions in one local authority throughout the first year of the provisions and at three-year follow-up. Sixty-six interviews with senior teachers, mainstream teachers and resource provision staff took place during the initial year, with 21 three-year follow-up interviews. Data were analysed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Data provide tentative support for Bronfenbrenner's bio-ecosystemic theory as a framework for representing the complex interactions within the resource provision schools, between systems and their development over time.

An extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was utilised as the theoretical framework. Three secondary and two high school PE teachers participated in the study. Data collection consisted of systematic and non-participant observations of teaching behaviour of PE teachers, as well as semi-structured interviews on the factors that determine their behaviours. Results revealed that four of five participants interacted more verbally and less physically with students with special needs. Peer partners were used to enhance the learning of students with special needs. Only two teachers modified their instruction and equipment for students with special needs. Sometimes, teachers excluded this group of students from cooperative activities. Extended TPB components, including attitude, moral norm, affective beliefs, social norm, and perceived behaviour control, were identified to determine the intention of PE teachers to teach students with special needs and their inclusive teaching practice. The study has important implications for policy and practice of inclusive PE.}",Physical Education and Training,"Wang, Lijuan and Wang, Min and Wen, Hongwei",,0,237

The authors recruited students from four of the 11 dental schools in Korea to participate in a survey; these schools were selected for regional balance. The Scale of Attitudes toward Disabled Persons (SADP) was used as the primary survey instrument, and ten independent variables were included. Of the 1,100 possible participants, 1,057 responded to the survey, for a response rate of 96.1\%. The results showed that although the students' attitudes did not differ significantly by gender, their attitudes did show statistically significant differences on nine other variables: age, year, religion, self-esteem, friends with a disability, volunteering, admission course, concern for individuals with SHCNs, and intention to treat individuals with SHCNs (all p<0.05). The attitudes of these Korean dental students toward individuals with SHCNs were relatively unfavorable, showing lower SADP scores than reported in Western countries and likely reflecting Eastern cultural values in general. Future efforts should place greater emphasis on special care dentistry education and encourage the development of more favorable attitudes regarding the treatment of individuals with SHCNs.

The stories of four teachers (two females, two males) between 27 and 57years of age were gathered using the phenomenological methods of semi-structured interviews, photographs, school documents, and field notes. Bandura's social-cognitive theory provided a conceptual framework to interpret the findings of this inquiry. Three themes emerged from the thematic analysis: engaging in learning; adapting strategies to meet students' needs; and moving beyond the educational goals. The findings suggest that inclusion practices (teacher's behaviours) in GPE were constructed by the dynamic interactions between teachers' knowledge of disability and motivation to learn about their students (personal factors) and children's needs and learning goals (environment).}",Cognition;Physical Education and Training,"An, Jihoun and Meaney, Karen S.",,0,240

A deeper understanding of the context-related experiences of sport is a prerequisite for teachers and leaders to be able to provide adequate, inclusive and meaningful activities. The aim of this qualitative case study was to examine how young people with disabilities made sense of sport, within both the compulsory school system and the voluntary sports movement. The study involved 10 young adults (aged 16 to 29 years) with disabilities, five males and five females. All the participants had rich experiences of sport. An inductive approach to qualitative content analysis of semi-structured interviews was used to enable individuals to explain and give meaning to their experiences of sport including those pertaining to gender and inclusion. The findings illustrated that dominating gender and ability norms influenced the interviewees' understanding of themselves in relation to sport; as a consequence, some of the female interviewees had a more diverse, sometimes contradictory experience of sport than the male interviewees. The basic premise of this study is that researchers can develop more insightful understandings of inclusion by studying the subjective meanings that are constructed by people with disabilities in their sport experiences.}",Adult;Sports;Disabled Persons,"Wickman, Kim",,0,241

Inductive thematic analysis was undertaken to provide a comprehensive account of the data. Three key themes emerged, each a compilation of a set of subthemes. The first theme, individual challenges, was comprised of physical ability, sensory challenges and a fear of injury. The second theme, peer interactions, encapsulated subthemes of initiation of friendship, camaraderie, social comparison and bullying. The final theme that emerged from the data was exclusion, which attends to children's experiences of being excluded by the teacher or as a result of activities being too difficult. Most notably, however, this theme relates to children requesting to be excluded. These findings are discussed in relation to research on the perspectives of students with and without disabilities.

This study examined relationships between weight status and health for US children. METHODS: We performed cross-sectional analysis of data on 43,297 children aged 10 to 17 from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health. Weight status was calculated from parent report of child height and weight. Logistic regression models assessed associations between weight status and 21 indicators of general health, psychosocial functioning, and specific health disorders, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: Using body mass index (BMI) percentiles for age and sex, 15\% of US children were considered overweight (BMI 85th to <95th percentile), and 16\% were obese (BMI >= 95th percentile). Compared with children classified as not overweight, obese children were more likely to have reported good/fair/poor health (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] 2.18, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.76-2.69), activity restrictions (AOR 1.39, 95\% CI 1.10-1.75), internalizing problems (AOR 1.59, 95\% CI 1.04-2.45), externalizing problems (AOR 1.33, 95\% CI. 1.07-1.65), grade repetition (AOR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.24-1.99), school problems, and missed school days. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, depression, learning disability, developmental delay, bone/joint/muscle problems, asthma, allergies, headaches, and ear infections were all more common in obese children. CONCLUSIONS: Obese children have increased odds of worse reported general health, psychosocial functioning, and specific health disorders. Physicians, parents, and teachers should be informed of the specific comorbidities associated with childhood obesity to target interventions that could enhance wellbeing. Future research should examine additional comorbidities and seek to confirm associations using longitudinal data and clinical measures of height and weight.}",Aged;Aging;Logistic Models;Child;Ethnic Groups;Obesity;Cross-Sectional Studies;Only Child;Comorbidity,"Halfon, Neal and Larson, K and , yce and Slusser, Wendy",,0,244
250,{Specific predictors of disordered eating among elite and non-elite gymnasts and ballet dancers},"{Gymnasts and ballet dancers are considered at-risk groups for developing eating disorders. However, specific variables enrolled in this risk and the relative contribution of each one remain unclear. The present study investigated correlates of disordered eating (DE) among young female and male aesthetic performers (N = 249, mean age = 15.41, SD = 2.55) and the relation between potential individual and contextual predictors of DE. Ballet dancers (n = 113; 88.5\% female) and gymnasts (n = 136; 75\% female) from elite and non-elite levels completed questionnaires measuring DE, body image dissatisfaction (general and activity-specific), self-esteem, pressure to be thin and social support in their dance schools and gymnastics clubs. Differences between males and females (elite and non-elite) were analyzed among ballet dancers and gymnasts. A usefulness analysis showed that dissatisfaction with body image specific to the practice of a particular aesthetic activity is the best predictor of DE compared to dissatisfaction with body image in general, especially in dancers. In addition to self-esteem and activity-specific body image dissatisfaction, hierarchical regression analysis showed that the pressure to be thin was more important than the competitive level for understanding aesthetic performers' DE. Social support was not predictive of DE. Structural equation modeling confirmed that self-esteem and body image dissatisfaction partially mediate the influence of pressure to be thin on DE. Some clues to possible systemic actions for preventing DE in gymnastics clubs and dance schools, which should include both aesthetic performers and coaches/teachers, are discussed.}",Eating;Whole Body Imaging;Body Image;Eating Disorders,"Francisco, Rita and Narciso, Isabel and Alarcao, Madalena",,0,245

The motor disorders of CP are frequently accompanied by impaired cognition, communication, and sensory perception, behavioural abnormalities, seizure disorders, or a combination of these features. CP is thought to affect three to four individuals per 1000 of the general population. The incidence, prevalence, and most common causes of CP have varied over time because of changes in prenatal and paediatric care. Medical management of children and adults involves care from primary-care physicians with input from specialists in neurology, orthopaedics, and rehabilitation medicine. Physicians should also work in conjunction with rehabilitation therapists, educators, nurses, social care providers, and schoolteachers. The focus of rehabilitation treatment has recently shifted to neurological rehabilitation in response to increasing evidence for neuroplasticity. This approach aims to improve development and function by capitalising on the innate capacity of the brain to change and adapt throughout the patient's life.

255,{Extra-curricular sport participation: A potential buffer against social anxiety symptoms in primary school children},"{Objectives: Social anxiety (SA) is characterized by high anxiety in social situations and can be significantly debilitating in its long-term duration. In the case of children it additionally has a negative impact on the child's social and cognitive development. As reported in Wipfli, Rethorst, and Landers' (2008) meta-analysis, exercise does have an anxiolytic effect. In this study, the role of sport as a mediating variable in the onset or development of SA symptoms is investigated, where a similar effect on this specific anxiety-type is expected. Design: This repeated-measures cohort study includes two data collections. The first data collection was carried out in 2007 and the second a year later in 2008. Method: Two hundred and eight 7- to 8-year old Swiss primary school children participated in structured interviews. Parents and teachers completed questionnaires regarding children's SA symptoms and classroom behaviour respectively. Parents also provided information about their children's extracurricular sport activities. The same information was gathered a year later. Results: Although most differences were not statistically significant a pattern emerged: children practising sport tended to score lower on all instruments in both 2007 and 2008. Repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated a reduction in social anxiety over time in children practising a team sport. Conclusion: These results are interpreted in reference to a potential positive effect of team sport on a child's experience of anxiety in social situations based on Antonovsky's (1997) salutogenesis model and Bandura's (1977) social learning theory.

The empirical research that is presented in the main part of the article analyses attitudes of a representative sample of Slovene teachers (n = 1360) regarding four domains of impact (impact of inclusion on pupils with SN, on peers, on teachers and on the classroom environment). In this, we controlled the role of the following two relevant characteristics of the sample: the category of SN (physical impairments, mild intellectual disabilities, learning difficulties and behavioural/emotional disorders) and the category of professional expertise of teachers in working with pupils with SN. We applied the Impact of Inclusion Questionnaire. The results show that teachers' attitudes towards inclusion are determined by the type of SN the integrated pupils have. In the case of pupils with physical impairments, teachers expressed the highest level of consent and the lowest in the case of pupils with behavioural and emotional disorders. Our study shows that besides the type of SN, teachers' professional expertise in working with pupils with SN is another important factor that determines the level of agreement with inclusion. It turned out that the teachers who had taken part in different forms of education and training had a more positive attitude towards all domains of impact.}",Attitude;Pupil,"Cagran, Branka and Schmidt, Majda",,0,251

There is an inherent assumption that we have not arrived as yet, and research suggests a continuing scepticism and lack of confidence amongst educators in mainstream settings to support children with disabilities in their schools and classrooms. This article focuses on research which shows that learners with disabilities are in fact being successfully included within one of these mainstream schools, by default and with a range of available support, despite not being designated as a `full-service school'. The study is based on interviews with students with physical disabilities in a Black rural secondary school, as well as observations and interviews with staff and non-disabled students. Findings reveal an existence of teacher, peer and community support, including from a neighbouring special school, suggesting a notion of inclusion which was about naturally putting values into action. Such practice, I argue, remains obscure and off the policy radar in South Africa.}",South Africa;Radar,"Pather, Sulochini",,0,252
258,"{Children with special educational needs in the Netherlands: number, characteristics and school career}","{Background: Several barriers are hampering the provision of adequate education to students with special educational needs in mainstream primary schools. It is not clear how many and which students in the Netherlands are considered children with special educational needs. The problems that make teachers consider children to have special educational needs and the effect of different types of problems on the school career have not often been addressed in research studies. Furthermore, contextual factors, like teachers' attitudes on inclusion and the number of students with special needs in the class may influence the school career of children with special educational needs. Purpose: This study aimed to examine the proportion of Dutch students in mainstream primary schools with special educational needs, their literacy and numeracy attainment levels, the likelihood of referral to special education and effects of teachers' attitudes towards inclusion and of the percentage of students with special needs in class. Sample: We use data on 8237 students with special educational needs in mainstream primary education from two consecutive measurements of a large cohort study in the Netherlands called PRIMA. Results: We found that, according to the teachers, on average 26\% of the students in their classes had special educational needs. Cognitive problems had a much stronger effect on the school career than social-emotional and physical problems. As expected, teachers with a positive attitude towards the inclusion of students with special educational needs referred fewer children to special education than teachers with less positive attitudes towards inclusion. Furthermore, the likelihood of a student being referred to a special school was reduced as the number of students with special needs in the class increased. Conclusions: Depending on factors in the learning context, special educational needs of a child may or may not be recognised. Consequently, children's special educational needs may not always be sufficiently catered for.}",Child;Only Child;Netherlands,"van der Veen, Ineke and Smeets, Ed and Derriks, Mechtild",,0,253
259,{Inclusive education reform in Queensland: implications for policy and practice},"{In Queensland, Australia, the school system is being reformed to be more `inclusive'. However, the enthusiasm for `inclusive education' in Queensland seems to be waning amongst practitioners, and the `confusion, frustration, guilt and exhaustion' that has emerged with teachers and support practitioners in the UK is emerging amongst support practitioners and teachers in Queensland. This paper argues that this is happening because inclusive education reforms that intend to provide an equitable education for all students regardless of cultural, physical, social/emotional and behavioural differences are being introduced, but these policies, procedures and structures continue to label, isolate and segregate students within schools in the way in which segregated special education facilities did in the past. Also, new policies and structures are being introduced without practitioners having the time and support to examine critically the underlying assumptions about disability, difference and inclusion that underpin their practices. These reforms need to be reviewed in terms of their effectiveness in achieving their `inclusive' goals, i.e. in terms of the impacts that these reforms are having on the students themselves, and on the educational practitioners who support the students.}",Australia;Queensland,"Bourke, Patricia E.",,0,254

Five hundred and seventy-six young athletes of Elite Sports Schools in the German state of Thuringia and a reference group consisting of 291 non-athletes from regular high schools completed a questionnaire regarding eating behavior and attitudes, dietary history, body image and demographics. The Eating Attitude Test was used to measure disordered eating. Athletes did not show a higher frequency of disordered eating than non-athletes. A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that gender and dietary experience, but not group (athletes vs non-athletes), were significant predictors of disordered eating. It can be concluded that dietary experience and female gender proved to be important risk factors of disordered eating. Participation in sports seems to be protective for developing serious eating problems, especially in girls. Potentially, regular monitoring of athletic performance by coaches might be a reason for this finding.}",Eating;Logistic Models;Feeding Behavior;Sports;Eating Disorders,"Rosendahl, J. and Bormann, B. and Aschenbrenner, K. and Aschenbrenner, F. and Strauss, B.",,0,255
261,{The social position of pupils with special needs in regular schools},"{Inclusive education places much value on implementing the conditions that foster good relationships between students. Research has shown that pupils with special needs can have difficulty in building relationships with peers without special needs. This study describes their social position in regular education. It applies different indexes for social position and compares these with each other and with other judgments of the social position of pupils with special needs. The analyses show that pupils with special needs are less popular, have fewer friendships and participate less often as members of a subgroup. Compared with their peers, pupils with special needs are over-represented in these at-risk categories by a factor of two to three. Teachers have a more positive view on the relationships in the group and the number of friendships pupils with special needs have. Also pupils' own subjective experiences are more positive. The results of the present study stress that physical inclusion only is a very basic condition, that becoming part of the group is not an automatism and that especially pupils with special needs may need extra support in participating in the group.}",Pupil,"Pijl, Sip Jan and Frostad, Per and Flem, Annlaug",,0,256
262,{Perceptions of Secondary School Students with Mild Disabilities to the Academic and Social Support Mechanisms Implemented in Regular Classrooms},"{The Student Perceptions of Classroom Support Scale (SPCS), which measures the perceptions of students with mild disabilities of academic and social support mechanisms implemented in regular classrooms, was administered to 60 secondary school-aged students. Data were obtained with reference to curricular, instructional, physical and peer support mechanisms. Item affectivity and multivariate analysis of variance revealed that significant differences were evident in student's perceptions in regard to academic versus social support mechanisms. Support mechanisms rated highly by students in terms of positive academic and social outcomes often represented traditional teaching values. Conversely, support mechanisms such as one-to-one assistance from teacher assistants or volunteers were perceived as positive in terms of completing classroom activities, but of limited value in establishing friendships with peers. The SPCS not only provides researchers, clinicians and educators with a method of objectively evaluating students' perceptions of support mechanisms, but also as a method of developing effective practical applications for students included in regular classrooms.}",Multivariate Analysis;Social Support,"O'Rourke, John and Houghton, Stephen",,0,257
263,{The impact of placing pupils with special educational needs in mainstream schools on the achievement of their peers},"{Background Over the past 20 years or so policy and practice on the education of children with special educational needs (SEN) has been aimed at placing increasing numbers of children in a mainstream school environment. Although this policy has been supported in principle by many teachers, parents and local authority officers, there has been much less agreement about whether this principle can be realized in practice, and even if it can, about what the impacts might be on the achievements of pupils with SEN in mainstream schools and, in particular, on their peers. Purpose This paper discusses the key findings from a systematic review of the literature carried out by the Inclusion Review Group, on behalf of the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (EPPI)Centre, the purpose of which was to review research evidence on whether the placement of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) within mainstream schools has an impact on academic and social outcomes for pupils without SEN. Design and methods The methodology followed the procedures adopted by the EPPI-Centre. Having agreed on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies that could be included in the review, an initial pool of 7137 papers were identified through electronic databases. After having screened all their titles and/or abstracts and having marked out possible papers to be included in the review, 119 paper copies were obtained-all of which were read by one or more of the authors of this paper. This led to a further reduction to 26 studies that were subjected to the EPPI data extraction process and synthesis. Conclusions Overall, the findings suggest that there are no adverse effects on pupils without SEN of including pupils with special needs in mainstream schools, with 81\% of the outcomes reporting positive or neutral effects. Despite concerns about the quality of some of the studies that were reviewed and the fact that the great majority were carried out in the USA, these findings should bring some comfort to headteachers, parents and local authority officers around the world at a time when concerns have been raised about the problems that schools face in responding to the twin agenda of becoming more inclusive and, at the same time, raising the achievements of all their pupils.}","Mainstreaming (Education);Education, Special;Child;Only Child;Pupil","Kalambouka, Afroditi and Farrell, Peter and Dyson, Alan and Kaplan, Ian",,0,258

265,{Students with mild disabilities in regular classrooms: The development and utility of the Student Perceptions of Classroom Support scale},"{Background There is a dearth of empirical research pertaining to the perceptions of students with mild disabilities of the academic and social outcomes of classroom support mechanisms. The absence of suitable measures is a primary issue contributing to this situation. Method The present study reports the development and utility of the Student Perceptions of Classroom Support (SPCS) scale, which was specifically designed to assess students' perceptions of curricular, instructional, physical, and peer support received in regular classrooms from both an academic and social perspective. The SPCS was administered to 60 secondary school-aged students with mild disabilities who experienced both regular classroom and traditional special education. Results Person and item discrimination analyses, and calculation of internal consistencies (Cronbach's alpha) revealed the SPCS to have excellent psychometric properties (alpha = 50.92 for academic outcomes and alpha = 50.87 for overall social outcomes). Internal consistencies for each of the subscales are also reported. Conclusions The SPCS provides educators with a valid method of assessing students' preferred support strategies, which can then be articulated within Individual Education Plans (IEPs).}",,"O'Rourke, John and Houghton, Stephen",,0,260

More schools slowly adopting integration models and principles, some of research studies showed positive effects for students with disabilities included in general schools. But during the realisation of physical education teaching exists many problems, for example: non adequete recommendation from doctors, low level of RE professional preparation, lack of material conditions, non adequete content of education, etc. The aim for increasing the quality of P.E. teaching is oriented to offer adequete and sufficient range of opportunities for pupils with disability. We wanted to find some of factors for development of integrative P.E.teaching hours at schools. We analysed pupils and faculty students answers from questionnairy and dates from teachers, evaluated their attitudes about integration. Research study included 45 secondary schools, 102 faculty students, 142 P.E. teachers. Results showed that only 9-10\% pupils with health impairments from primary schools, 8-13 \% from secondary schools, 5-7\% from universities had regulary physical education teaching. 39,6\% of boys and 48 \% of girls from secondary schools do not exercise at P.E.hours. Students of our faculty answered that they have a lack of knowledge about integration, 91\% of them spoke about organize demanding of integrative teaching. 19,6\% of P.E.teachers directed towards realisation of professsional preparation, 47 \% at missing of study materials, documents. This aspects were the impuls for preparation new study plans for adapted physical education and integrative physical education at schools and for inovation of faculty curriculum.

267,{Integration versus segregation: the experiences of a group of disabled students moving from mainstream school into special needs further education},"{Although the latest education policy for disabled students is one of inclusion, some students are moving out of mainstream schools into specialist colleges for their further education. This research uses a combination of group and individual interviews to explore why this move away from mainstream education is made. Results show that these students' moved into specialist education because of the inadequate physical accessibility of their mainstream colleges, the quality of disability services available to them and their previous experiences whilst in mainstream school. These students were able to identify both strengths and weaknesses within mainstream and special education for disabled students, and believed that educational placement should therefore be a matter of choice depending on the physical, academic and emotional needs of the individual. It would appear, however, that for the students participating in this research, their local mainstream colleges were unable to cater for their needs, indicating that their decision to move into a special needs college was not based on a real choice. Mainstream colleges are challenged to create a truly inclusive environment so that disabled students are offered a real choice.}",,"Pitt, V and Curtin, M",,0,262

Injuries in competitive youth bandy: an epidemiological study of a league season. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 34, No. 6, pp. 993-997, 2002. Purpose: Bandy, with a century-long tradition in northern Europe, is a winter team-sport similar to ice hockey. To investigate the occurrence of injuries during competitive youth bandy games, injury incidence, injury types, and age-related risks were analyzed for one youth league season. Methods: The National Athletic Injury/Illness Reporting System (NAIRS) definition of sports injury was used for the injury registration. All 416 games during the 1999-2000 season in the Swedish southeastern youth bandy league were included in the study. Primary data was collected by a questionnaire and completed by the team coaches after each game. At the end of the season, physician interviews with each team coach were performed to assure that no injuries had been missed as well as to ascertain whether there was any remaining disability. Results: In total, 2.0 injuries (95\% confidence interval 1.2-2.9 injuries) per 1000 player game hours were recorded. Sixty-eight percent of the injuries caused the injured player to be absent from bandy play for more than a week. Collision was the most common cause of injury (36\%), and contusion was the most common injury type (41\%). The injury incidence in the leagues for older players (Youth 14-Youth 16) was slightly higher than in the leagues for the younger players (Youth 12-Youth 13), while participation by under-aged players in games organized for older players led to an almost four-fold increase of injury risk. For severe injuries, the mean rehabilitation time away from bandy practice or competition was 27 d (range 8-56 d). Conclusion: The overall injury incidence during youth bandy games is low, but the injuries that occur cause extensive absences from the only four months long bandy season. From a public health perspective, bandy can be recommended for consideration when physical exercise is to be promoted among school-age children in countries with a winter climate.}",Epidemiologic Studies;Athletic Injuries;Sports;Seasons;Adolescent,"Timpka, T and Risto, O and Lindqvist, K",,0,263
269,{Uncertainty and opposition of medical students toward assisted death practices},"{To explore medical students' views of assisted death practices in patient cases that describe different degrees and types of physical and mental suffering, an anonymous survey was administered to all students at one medical school. Respondents were asked about the acceptability of assisted death activities in five patient vignettes and withdrawal of life support in a sixth vignette. In the vignettes, actions were performed by four possible agents: the medical student personally; a referral physician; physicians in general; or non-physicians. Of 306 medical students, 166 (54 \%) participated. Respondents expressed opposition or uncertainty about assisted death practices in the five patient cases that illustrated severe forms of suffering which were secondary to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, treatment-resistant depressive and somatoform disorders, antisocial and sexually violent behavior, or AIDS. Students supported the withdrawal of life support in the sixth vignette depicting exceptional futility secondary to AIDS. Students were especially opposed to their own involvement and to the participation of non-physicians in assisted death activities. Differences in views related to sex, religious beliefs, and personal philosophy were found. Medical students do not embrace assisted death practices, although they exhibit tolerance regarding the choices of medical colleagues. How these attributes of medical students will translate into future behaviors toward patients and peers remains uncertain. Medical educators must strive to understand the perspectives of physicians-in-training. Expanded, empirically informed education that is attuned to the attitudes of medical students may be helpful in fulfilling the responsibility of imparting optimal clinical care skills.

The social experiences of four children with fragile X syndrome were described using ethnographic methods that included participant observation at `special' and regular schools and in-depth interviews with parents, teachers and occupational therapists. An environmental perspective is presented here to complement existing individualist perspectives that address the social problems faced by children with disability. The environmental perspective involves (i) perceptions of disability, (ii) the child's family (relations, advocacy, encouragement, education, identity creation, dependence and separation), and (iii) the child's school (physical environment, other children, principal, teachers, therapists, policy and ethos).

271,{Knowledge and attitudes of high school pupils towards children with special health care needs: an Israeli exploration},"{One hundred seventy-one pupils of a high school in Holon (Israel) were questioned regarding their attitudes towards chronically disabled individuals who have special health-care needs. The level of pupils' knowledge concerning the etiology, symptoms and complications of these chronic conditions was approximately 72\%; it did not increase in four years of study. Previous personal knowledge of a child or adolescent with a chronic disease or handicap influenced the understanding of that particular ailment. The pupils' attitude towards handicapped individuals become more positive and tolerant with increasing age (and class level). A correlation was found between the level of knowledge about special medical-health needs and tolerant attitudes toward chronic patients. Most of the pupils think that the following occupational and recreational interests for the disabled will help to increase their self-image and improve their feelings of acceptance: computers, music (playing and listening), sports and domestic pets. The pupils believe the topics of chronic diseases and patients should be studied as a regular part of the school curriculum and these subjects should be taught with the participation of both physicians and teachers. The pupils stressed the role of the teacher in handling children with the chronic disease. Only half of the pupils think that their class peers should also know about the chronic disease of this individual pupil. The information sources of pupils concerning chronic disease are mainly TV, newspapers, adolescent periodicals, books, physicians and nurses, and lastly, the school. Conclusions are presented concerning health promotion activities in the school. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Results indicated that teacher attributes and beliefs, student characteristics, and school climate relate to both dimensions. Specifically, recepticity toward inclusion was associated with higher teacher efficacy, inclusion of students with physical rather than cognitive or behavior disorders, use of differentiated teaching practices, and teacher collaboration. Findings further suggest that with experience, teachers become more hostile toward inclusion. Lower anxiety was associated with the inclusion of students with learning or behavior disorders, high teacher efficacy, and small class size. Results demonstrate the complex nature of teachers' thinking about inclusion and suggest that teacher, student, and school factors need to be considered in the analysis of teachers' willingness to support this innovation.}",Anxiety;Mental Disorders;Hostility,"Soodak, LC and Podell, DM and Lehman, LR",,0,268

Further, the internal consistency properties of the TIAQ (Cronbach's alpha was .77 for both samples) were satisfactory. We conclude that the psychometric properties of the TIAQ were adequate, and it can be used as a valid assessment in evaluating the status of inclusion for students with disabilities as perceived by music education and physical education teachers.

However, adolescents with physical disabilities participated in fewer social activities and had less intimate relationships with their friends. They had more positive attitudes toward school, teachers, and their fellow classmates than the national sample, but fewer had plans for postsecondary education. The majority of adolescents with physical disabilities reported that they had not received information on parenthood, birth control, and sexually transmitted diseases.

This can act as a barrier to the successful implementation of therapy. To address this problem, we developed a novel training programme to improve knowledge and confidence in providing postural care and evaluate the impact of the training programme in parents and school staff.METHODSThe postural care training programme included three elements: a 2-h interactive workshop facilitated by physiotherapists and occupational therapists, a follow-up home/school visit and a follow-up telephone call. The Understanding, Knowledge and Confidence in Providing Postural Care for Children with Disabilities questionnaire was utilized to evaluate the impact and includes subscales assessing knowledge and understanding, concerns and confidence in providing postural care. The Understanding, Knowledge and Confidence in Providing Postural Care for Children with Disabilities questionnaire was completed at baseline and 6¬†weeks later.

Interviews were transcribed and inductively analyzed by a team of 3 athletic trainers with 32 combined years of professional experience. Themes were negotiated through a consensual review process. Participant checks were completed to ensure trustworthiness of the results.RESULTSFour major themes emerged from the interviews: (1) significant effect of symptoms, (2) feelings of frustration, (3) influence on school attendance and activities, and (4) nature of interpersonal and team relationships. Participants indicated that the physical symptoms of the concussion substantially affected their emotional and academic function. The influence of the concussion on social interactions seemed to depend on the nature of interpersonal relationships.CONCLUSIONSSport-related concussion can negatively influence physical and emotional function, academics, and interpersonal interactions as perceived by adolescent student-athletes and their parents. Education of parents and their children, school professionals, coaches, and teammates remains critical to effectively recognize and manage sport-related concussion. Secondary school districts also play a critical role in the concussion-management process by establishing and implementing accommodation policies that alleviate student concerns about falling behind while ensuring a healthy return to normal school routines.

280,"Macromolecular crowding: chemistry and physics meet biology (Ascona, Switzerland, 10-14 June 2012).","More than 60¬†years of biochemical and biophysical studies have accustomed us to think of proteins as highly purified entities that act in isolation, more or less freely diffusing until they find their cognate partner to bind to. While in vitro experiments that reproduce these conditions largely remain the only way to investigate the intrinsic properties of molecules, this approach ignores an important factor: in their natural milieu , proteins are surrounded by several other molecules of different chemical nature, and this crowded environment can considerably modify their behaviour. About 40% of the cellular volume on average is occupied by all sorts of molecules. Furthermore, biological macromolecules live and operate in an extremely structured and complex environment within the cell (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, cytoskeletal structures, etc). Hence, to further complicate the picture, the interior of the cell is by no means a simply crowded medium, rather, a most crowded and confining one. In recent times, several approaches have been developed in the attempt to take into account important factors such as the ones mentioned above, at both theoretical and experimental levels, so that this field of research is now emerging as one of the most thriving in molecular and cell biology (see figure¬†1). [Formula: see text] Figure 1. Left: number of articles containing the word 'crowding' as a keyword limited to the biological and chemical science domains (source: ISI Web of Science). The arrow flags the 2003 'EMBO Workshop on Biological Implications of Macromolecular Crowding' (Embo, 2012). Right: number of citations to articles containing the word 'crowding' limited to the same domains (bars) and an exponential regression curve (source: Elsevier Scopus). To promote the importance of molecular crowding and confinement and provide researchers active in this field an interdisciplinary forum for meeting and exchanging ideas, we recently organized an international conference held in Ascona from 10 to 14 June 2012. In the unique scenario of the Maggiore lake and absorbed in the magic atmosphere of the Centro Stefano Franscini (CSF) at Monte Verit√†, we enjoyed three-and-a-half days of intense and inspiring activity, where not only many of the most prominent scientists working on macromolecular crowding, but also experts in closely related fields such as colloids and soft matter presented their work. The meeting was intended and has been organized to bring theoreticians and experimentalists together in the attempt to promote an active dialogue. Moreover, we wanted different disciplines to be represented, notably physics and chemistry, besides biology, as cross-fertilization is proving an increasingly fundamental source of inspiration and advancement. This issue of Physical Biology (PB) features a selection of the oral contributions presented at the conference, expanded in the form of research or review articles. PB, one of the scientific journals of the Institute of Physics (IOP), is one of the most dynamic and lively forums active at the interface between biology on one side, and physics and mathematics on the other. As its mission is stated by IOP, PB 'focuses on research in which physics-based approaches lead to new insights into biological systems at all scales of space and time, and all levels of complexity'. For these reasons, and also in view of its high reputation and broad readership, PB appears to be the ideal place for disseminating the thriving pieces of research presented at the conference. We are extremely grateful to PB and its kind and efficient editorial staff who helped make this issue a great scientific follow-up to the conference. The opening lecture of the conference, the first of four day-opening keynote lectures, was given by Allen P Minton from NIH (USA), possibly the most influential among the pioneers in the field. He provided a lucid and well-thought-out overview of the concept of macromolecular crowding through an exhaustive chronological account of the major milestones. It is clear that the concept of excluded volume as a key factor remains central to the concept of molecular crowding. As a consequence, simple descriptive paradigms borrowed essentially from colloid physics may still provide useful tools to understand the subtle effects of crowding and confinement in living matter. The contiguity between crowding, colloids and soft matter further emerged as an important concept in the course of the conference in several theoretical lectures and a few experimental ones. Dave Thirumalai, from the University of Maryland (USA), one of the most active theoreticians in the field of theoretical biophysics, outlined scaling theories, concepts from colloid literature and different simulation techniques to describe scenarios for crowding-induced changes in the structure and dynamics of proteins and RNA. In particular, he showed the importance of the shape of crowding particles in affecting folding oligomerization of amyloidogenic peptides. Johannes Sch√∂neberg, from IMPRS, Mathematics Institute (Germany), illustrated ReaDDy , a newly developed particle-based simulation software tool for reaction-diffusion dynamics, developed in the group of Frank Noe at EMPRS. He showed that ReaDDy makes it possible to bridge the gap between soft matter and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the one hand and particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations on the other. We asked Johannes to organize a tutorial session to lead interested participants into the package and 'get their hands wet' under the guidance of the developers. The tutorial session was indeed successful and the broad possibilities offered by the simulation toolkit appeared to be clear to the participants. Paolo De Los Rios, from the Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland), examined the complexity of the effects caused by crowding conditions from the point of view of statistical physics. Starting from a modification of the well-known Smoluchowski approach to calculate the encounter rate of diffusion-limited reactions, he showed how more realistic situations accounting for crowding effects could be treated equally well on the same theoretical grounds. This talk marked an important point in the conference as it reinforced the idea that simple models of theoretical physics still have the power to provide inspiring results in spite of the intrinsic simplifications of such theoretical approaches. Along the same lines, Nicolas Dorsaz, from the University of Cambridge (UK), proposed an extension of the Smoluchowski framework that incorporates repulsive and attracting interactions between the reactants. This approach was illustrated by reaction rates obtained from event-driven Brownian dynamics and dynamical Monte Carlo simulations. Another striking example of the physical subtleties associated with modelling crowding effects was provided by Jeffrey Skolnick, from the Georgia Institute of Technology (USA). He examined the role of hydrodynamic interactions in the self-organization of biological assemblies in the presence of crowding. His results strongly suggest that hydrodynamic interactions greatly affect the kinetics of self-assembly reactions, so that including them in the picture appears crucial for understanding the dynamics of biological systems in vivo . Margareth Cheung, from the University of Houston (USA), emphasized that how the crowded environment inside a cell affects the structural conformation of a protein with a spherical shape is a vital question because the geometry of proteins and protein-protein complexes are far from globules in vivo . Her work demonstrates the malleability of 'native' proteins and implies that crowding-induced shape changes may be important for protein function and malfunction in vivo . Huan-Xiang Zhou, from the Florida State University (USA), focused on atomistic simulations of protein folding and binding under crowding conditions. His lab has developed a post-processing method that allows the atomistic representation of proteins in folding and binding processes under crowding. A comparison with experimental results was also presented. Other lecturers pointed out that there are still aspects not entirely explored in the effects of both crowding and confinement. As suggested in the talk by Gary Pielak, from the University of North Carolina (USA), the currently used synthetic crowding agents are far from being satisfactory in replicating naturally occurring effects associated with crowded environments. For example, non-specific binding seems to play a subtle role in the cell, as natural macromolecules can induce both stabilization and destabilization when used as crowders. It is indeed possible to fine-tune the effect of proteins, as crowders, on the stability of other proteins. Another aspect that became clear is that new, more powerful methods need to be developed to study the effect of crowding, but even more to compare crowding and confinement. Indeed, it appeared clear from the lecture by Pierandrea Temussi, from the University of Naples (Italy), that a reliable comparison of the effects of crowding and confinement on the stability of proteins can only be based on the measurement of the whole stability curve of the same protein. Controversial aspects do not pertain only to the influence of crowding on protein stability, but also to aggregation phenomena in natural fluids. Domenico Sanfelice, from NIMR (London, UK), reported an interesting case of the apparent influence of crowding on aggregation. Hen egg white, a possible natural medium to study macromolecules in crowded conditions can dramatically increase the aggregation kinetics of proteins with an inbuilt tendency to associate. By carefully dissecting the phenomenology, it was shown that only part of this effect is due to crowding, while another factor playing an¬†important role is the interaction with proteins from the milieu . In other words, high-molecular-weight glycoproteins can act as efficient molecular seeds for aggregation. A special topic of great relevance in the conference appeared to be the direct study of crowding in living systems. Alan Verkman, from the University of California, San Francisco (USA), one of the world's leading scientific personalities in the field of experimental investigation of crowding and confinement, was invited to give the second plenary lecture devoted to the experimental study of crowding effects in vivo . In his keynote lecture, Dr Verkman led us on a wide and compelling tour, exploring the main experimental approaches to study molecular crowding in and around cells. After a thorough examination of methods such as fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, photo-activation localization microscopy and stochastic reconstruction microscopy, he concluded that the general consensus emerging from experimental studies is that the notion of universally anomalous diffusion in and around cells as a consequence of molecular crowding may not be correct, and that the slowing of diffusion in cells is less marked than has been widely assumed and can be simply described through a five- to sixfold reduction of the normal diffusion coefficient. A Soranno, from the University of Z√ºrich (Switzerland), described how, by employing FRET measurements, it is possible to quantify the effect of molecular crowding on the dimensions of the highly charged, intrinsically disordered protein human prothymosin alpha. For a large variety of polymeric crowders (PEG, PVP, Ficoll, Dextran, PVA, PAA), a collapse of the polypeptide chain is observed with increasing polymer size and polymer concentration. The largest extent of collapse is observed for polymer radii comparable to the dimensions of the protein, in agreement with theoretical considerations. For his contribution, A Soranno was awarded the CSF Award for the best contributed talk. In his most inspiring talk, Clifford Brangwynne, from Princeton University (USA), drew attention to very important objects, namely Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) bodies. These are non-membrane-bound macromolecular assemblies that form from the dynamic interactions of RNA and proteins. The assembly of RNP bodies may sensitively depend on the biophysical features of the surrounding cytoplasm, including the degree of crowding, transport coefficients and mechanical properties. This dependency may have important implications for the RNA processing reactions involved in fundamental biological processes such as developmental cell growth. Remarkably, Brangwynne showed how RNPs behave in the cell as liquid droplets, pointing to a possible entirely new means that the cell could use to control and fine-tune its internal processes, in fact, more than that, a completely unexplored, new state of organization of living matter, and a functional one. Giuseppe Zaccai, from Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble (France), showed that protein dynamics is more sensitive than structure to environmental factors such as crowding, solvent, temperature or pressure. Furthermore, he convincingly explained how neutron scattering provides unique experimental data to underpin MD calculations in this context. Following up on environment-induced modulations of protein functional dynamics, Ruth Nussinov, from Tel Aviv University (Israel), addressed the important problem of whether cellular signals can travel long distances in a crowded environment. She proposed a model based on the evolution of at least three properties: a modular functional organization of the cellular network, sequences in some key regions of proteins, such as linkers or loops, and compact interactions between proteins, possibly favoured by a crowded environment. The workshop ended on a keynote lecture by Jean-Marie Lehn, from the Universit√© de Strasbourg (France). Lehn, 1987 Nobel Laureate in chemistry, offered a 'supramolecular view' of the field of molecular interactions. Supramolecular chemistry explores the design of systems undergoing self-organization , i.e. systems capable of generating well-defined functional supramolecular architectures by self-assembling from their components, thus behaving as programmed chemical systems . Chemistry may therefore be considered an information science , the science of informed matter. Supramolecular chemistry is intrinsically a dynamic chemistry in view of the ability of the interactions connecting the molecular components of a supramolecular entity and the resulting ability of supramolecular species to exchange their constituents. The same holds for molecular chemistry when the molecular entity contains covalent bonds that may form and break reversibly, so as to allow a continuous change in constitution by the reorganization and exchange of building blocks. These features define a constitutional dynamic chemistry (CDC) on both the molecular and supramolecular levels. CDC takes advantage of dynamic constitutional diversity to allow variation and selection in response to either internal or external factors to achieve adaptation . The merging of the features-information and programmability, dynamics and reversibility, constitution and structural diversity-points towards the emergence of adaptive and evolutive chemistry . The whole workshop could have not taken place without the help of the Centro Stefano Franscini. The CSF is the congress centre of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Zurich (ETH Zurich) and has been situated at Monte Verit√† since 1989. It is an ideal meeting point for all members of the international scientific community who wish to discuss the state-of-the-art and new challenges of any field of research. The CSF supports 20-25 international conferences every year and, since 2010, up to ten winter doctoral schools1. The competence and professionalism of the staff were at the same level of beauty and inspiring character as that of Monte Verit√†. A meeting of this sort, if successful, leaves the audience with more open questions than settled answers, and this was definitely the case for Crowding 2012. Excluded volume is clearly a fundamental concept that has allowed crowding, a very familiar concept in soft matter, to enter into the domain of biological sciences. However, the complexity of the biological milieu calls for more refined descriptions. What is the role of electrostatic and electrodynamic interactions? What is the role of hydrodynamics interactions? To what extent does the strong spatial inhomogeneity (clustering of molecules, cellular compartmentalization, etc) have to be taken into account? Or, more generally, what are the minimal elements that prove crucial to describe reactions within a cell? How does the diffusion proceed (diffusion, slow diffusion, sub-diffusion) given that the experimental evidences are still controversial? In conclusion, we knew that allowing scientists with very different backgrounds and ideas to mingle was a hazardous attempt. Despite that, the workshop turned out to be a very successful experiment, which was highly enjoyed both by the participants and the organizers. Discussions sparked regularly among ever-changing groups, comprising senior scientists and students, despite the rather tight schedule, adding to the sense of fulfilment ignited by the outstanding level of the presentations. Given the success of the meeting Crowding 2012, a new event has been organized and will take place on the same themes during fall 2013, this time in the beautiful scenery of the Loire valley in France. The workshop 'Macromolecular crowding effects in cell biology: models and experiments' will be held on the CNRS campus in Orl√©ans, France, on 24-25 October 2013.

281,The ambiguous role of the paraeducator in the general physical education environment.,"The use of paraeducators has increased as a main mechanism to include more students with disabilities in the public schools in the U.S. Although the utilization of paraeducators is intended to be a supportive service delivery option, many concerns and challenges have resulted. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the paraeducator in the general physical education environment from the perspectives of special education, physical education, and adapted physical education teachers and paraeducators. Data were collected from a phenomenological approach using questionnaires, interviews, and observations. Results indicate concerns about the clarity of the role of the paraeducator in physical education. Emerging themes include elastic definitions of student protection and teacher backup, contradictory expectations and mixed acceptance, and paraeducators' role ambiguity. Findings regarding the role of the paraeducator are essential in determining both best practice and legal policy for the appropriate utilization of paraeducators in physical education.","organization & administration;Education, Special;Professional Role;organization & administration;Faculty;organization & administration;Physical Education and Training;education;Disabled Children;Cohort Studies;Child;Educational Status;Male;Female;Adult;Humans;Attitude;Index Medicus","Bryan, Rebecca R and McCubbin, Jeffrey A and van der Mars, Hans",2013.0,0,276
282,A path to greater inclusivity through understanding implicit attitudes toward disability.,"Individuals with visible disabilities are underrepresented in nursing and have been denied admission to nursing education and discriminated against based on their disability, although nurse educators have been found to hold positive explicit attitudes toward disabled individuals. This study examines nurse educators' implicitly held attitudes toward individuals with disabilities through the use of the Disability Attitude Implicit Association Test. Findings demonstrated that nurse educators are strongly biased toward individuals without disabilities (N = 132, D = 0.76, SD = 0.46) and demonstrated a stronger preference than the general population (N = 38,544, D = 0.45, SD = 0.43). Study results suggest the need for a timely critique of the continuing focus on physical abilities as a prerequisite for admission to nursing programs. In addition, faculty in schools of nursing and practicing nurses must engage in discussions of attitudes toward individuals with visible disabilities for the discipline to be more inclusive.","Attitude;Education, Nursing;Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate;psychology;Students, Nursing;Prejudice;psychology;Disabled Persons;statistics & numerical data;Faculty, Nursing;Attitude of Health Personnel;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Nursing Education Research;Nursing;Index Medicus;27T1I13L6G;amineptin;0;Dibenzocycloheptenes","Aaberg, Vicki A",2012.0,0,277

284,Health and physical education as an important part of school curricula: a comparison of schools for the deaf in the Czech Republic and the United States.,"The authors describe and compare how physical education classes and healthy lifestyle concepts are taught in selected Czech and U.S. schools for the deaf. Professionals who participated in the study included principals and teachers employed by 4 schools for the deaf. Data from schools were collected during the summer and fall semesters, and subsequent interviews were conducted with the principals and physical education teachers. Unique characteristics were exhibited by each of the 4 schools. The settings for extracurricular physical and sports activities varied by school type (residential or nonresidential). Findings indicated that the general trend in physical education has changed from a focus on sports performance to health-promoting activities. There were opportunities for teachers to revise curriculum programs to further promote the health and academic success of students who are deaf or hard of hearing.","Sports;Health Education;psychology;Deafness;Education of Hearing Disabled;Correction of Hearing Impairment;Students;Physical Education and Training;rehabilitation;Deafness;Health Behavior;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Surveys and Questionnaires;Curriculum;Humans;United States;psychology;Persons With Hearing Impairments;Diet;Exercise;Life Style;Czech Republic;Index Medicus","Kurkova, Petra and Scheetz, Nanci and Stelzer, Jiri",2010.0,0,279

286,Educational and behavioural problems in babies of 32-35 weeks gestation.,"AIMTo identify incidence of school and behaviour problems at age 7 years in children born between 32 and 35 weeks gestation, and investigate perinatal risk factors.METHODThe study population consisted of all children born at 32-35 weeks gestation to mothers resident in Oxfordshire in 1990. General practitioners, parents, and teachers were asked about health, behaviour, and education by postal questionnaire. Teachers rated children on level of function in six areas using a five point scale. They also completed the Strengths and Difficulties behaviour questionnaire. Perinatal risk factors were identified for children with poor school performance using a univariate and multivariate analysis.RESULTSTeacher responses were obtained for 117 (66%) of the 176 children in the cohort. Twenty nine (25%) required support from a non-teaching assistant, five (4%) had required a statement of special educational needs, and three (3%) were at special school. Poor outcome was reported for 32% in writing, 31% in fine motor skills, 29% in mathematics, 19% in speaking, 21% in reading, and 12% in physical education. On the behaviour questionnaire, 19% of the cohort achieved an abnormal hyperactivity score (population norm 10%). Multivariate analysis showed perinatal variables that remained significant, independent of other variables; they were discharge from the special care baby unit > 36 weeks postconceptional age (odds ratio 4.15; 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 12.05) and male sex (odds ratio 3.88; 95% confidence interval 1.42 to 10.6).CONCLUSIONUp to a third of children born between 32 and 35 weeks gestation may have school problems.

288,The role of physical education in the development of active lifestyles.,"If elementary physical education existed just to achieve ""present"" goals, especially regular exercise, the nature of the program would be clearer and the need for trained teachers less. It is the ""future"" goal that complicates the debate over the elementary program. It is the ""future"" goal that requires a broader range of experiences and a developmental approach. Because we are preparing students to implement an active lifestyle in adulthood, the development of sport and dance skills through age/ability-appropriate and sequential lessons is an important as the ""present"" opportunity for physical activity. Teachers must be knowledgeable in the subdisciplines of physical education and well versed in those teaching methods that promote vigorous activity and maximum participation. The lifetime public health goal dictates we help students develop a knowledge base about exercise and health. This goal requires us to learn more than we presently know about promoting positive attitudes toward and fostering appreciations for healthful living. The hope for improved adult health also requires a K-12 curricular model in which every year continues previous experiences and moves students closer to the goal as those students are changing physically, mentally, and socially. The next debate should focus on the role of secondary school physical education in linking health-related elementary programs to healthy adult lifestyles. Even though we do not fully understand the relationship between school physical education and active adult lifestyles, our best bet is developing a continuous, developmental K-12 curriculum.",Schools;methods;Physical Education and Training;Exercise;Life Style;Child;Hemodynamics;Physical Fitness;methods;Health Promotion;Adolescent;Humans;Play and Playthings;etiology;Cumulative Trauma Disorders;Index Medicus,"Haywood, K M",1991.0,0,283
289,Psychiatric service dogs as a tertiary prevention modality for veterans living with post-traumatic stress disorder,"Objective: To document the usability of psychiatric service dogs (PsySDs) as a tertiary prevention modality from the perspective of veterans who have been using a PsySD 2 to 4 years as an assistive aid for post-traumatic stress disorder symptom (PTSD) management. Method: A case series study with PsySD primary users was carried out with 10 Canadian veterans recruited from 4 different dog training schools. Researchers conducted semi-structured telephone interviews and asked questions pertaining to four domains addressing the PsySD‚Äôs ‚Äòusability‚Äô. A content and thematic analysis were realized using an inductive and deductive approach. Results: Our conceptual framework proposes four main themes with their associated subthemes:: 1-Service dog‚Äôs roles and tasks (8 subthemes, e.g. acting as a socializing agent, maintaining an appropriate free space around the veteran), 2-Personal advantages and Environmental impacts (8 subthemes, e.g. alleviating symptoms; increasing outings and physical activities, enabling social interactions and relationship building), 3-Obstacles (4 subthemes, e.g. high costs of dog maintenance, dog‚Äôs presence attracted unwanted public attention, prompting intrusive questions), and 4-Recommendations for PsySD programs (16 subthemes, e.g. creating a national registry for PsySD, encouraging mental health practitioners‚Äô involvement). Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Themes 1 and 2 are positive perceptions, and theme 4 suggests relevant potential improvements. The current study offers insights into how PsySDs concretely assist primary users and can help addressing PTSD chronicity. It presents the roles professionals may play when dealing with patients using PsySDs for PTSD. The proposed conceptual framework can be useful to policy makers, dog trainers and caregivers.

290,ADHD and comorbid developmental coordination disorder: Implications and recommendations for school psychologists,"Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is frequently comorbid with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). DCD results in functional impairment in activities of daily living, and children‚Äôs physical activities with peers. Children with DCD report fewer friendships, more bullying, and less confidence in their ability to participate in peer activities. DCD is frequently associated with depressive and anxiety disorders. Because of its relationship with lower level of physical activity, DCD is a risk factor for obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. The developmental outcomes of DCD persist through adolescence and into adulthood. Consequently, school psychologists should incorporate screening for DCD when evaluating students with ADHD diagnoses or suspected of having ADHD. This paper provides a review of the underlying brain-behavior relationships between ADHD and DCD, a description of developmental trajectories associated with DCD, and recommended screening and assessment strategies.

Methods: We used data from Porter Novelli's 2014     YouthStyles survey that is conducted each year to gather insights about American consumers. Results: Of the 1,005 respondents, 57% reported sports participation. Fourteen percent reported they may have had a previous concussion, and among them 41% reported having a concussion more than once while playing sports. Males (17.7%) were significantly more likely to report having a concussion than females (10.0%; œá¬≤ (1) = 7.01, p = 0.008). Fifty-five percent of respondents reported having learned about what to do if they think they may have a concussion, and 92% reported that they would tell their coach if they thought they sustained a concussion while playing youth or high school sports. Youth from higher income families ($75,000‚Äì$124,999) were significantly more likely than youth from lower income families (less than $35,000) to report that they learned about what do if they suspected that they had a concussion. Conclusion: Age of athlete, parental income level, athlete's sex, and living in a metro versus non-metro area led to disparities in athletes' concussion education. There is a need for increased access to concussion education and an emphasis on customizing concussion education efforts to meet the needs of different groups. Practical application: We identified athletes' self-reported previously sustained concussions and predictors of education related to concussion. Further research is needed to explore the age, gender and income gaps in concussion education among athletes.

The study presented here examined victimization among middle- and high school students from SK (n = 3343) and the US (n = 4990). Personal victimizations (bullying, physical assaults, and threats) were examined. Youth activities included participation in sports, school clubs, non-school clubs, and employment in part-time jobs. A youth‚Äôs perceptions of friends and of teachers‚Äô attachments to students were also examined, possibly influencing guardianship and vulnerability to victimization. Findings revealed inverse effects of school athletics and positive effects of non-school club participation and part-time jobs on victimization risks in both countries. Perceptions of stronger attachments to friends and between teachers and students were also associated with lower victimization risks in the US. Common themes in findings across the two countries are identified but with important caveats regarding our inability to make direct comparisons in model estimates between the samples. Nonetheless, these themes should help guide hypotheses in future research capable of making direct comparisons.

293,"Autonomy, eating disorders and elite gymnastics: Ethical and conceptual issues","Participation in elite sport, and in particular those sports with special demands in terms of weight and shape, is associated with a higher risk for eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa [Sundgot-Borgen, J., & Torstveit, M. K. (2010). Aspects of disordered eating continuum in elite high intensity sports.     Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 20, 112‚Äì121]. We report upon research exploring eating attitudes and behaviours within elite gymnastics. The study comprised 42 semi-structured interviews with gymnasts and support staff‚Äî34 gymnasts and 9 staff/support staff. The majority of those interviewed were acrobatic gymnasts (22; 16 males and 6 females) with 7 rhythmic gymnasts (all female) and 5 tumblers (all female). The mean age of those gymnasts interviewed was 17.4. A difficulty in precisely delineating extreme eating patterns (disordered eating) from having an eating disorder was noted. Within an elite sports context behaviours thought to be pathological in a more general setting might be fairly commonplace and even functional to the athlete's performance. The extent to which the athlete consents to these patterns of behaviour is problematic given their age and development. We argue that conceptualising consent as ‚Äòauthority to be cared for by a trustworthy coach‚Äô, more felicitously applies to the child/adolescent elite sporting context, helping us understand not only the focus of the elite gymnast, but also their relationship with the coach and the coaches' responsibilities.

294,Physical activity and motivational predictors of changes in health behavior and health among DM2 and CAD patients,"This study tested a physical activity intervention and the self‚Äêdetermination theory (SDT) process model of health‚Äêbehavior change and health among 108 adult patients with both diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients were randomly assigned to an organized physical activity intervention group (led by instructors) or a non‚Äêphysical activity control group. At baseline and after 12 months, we measured the following: needs satisfaction, autonomous and controlled motivation for physical activity, perceived competence for physical activity and blood sugar testing, physical activity and blood sugar testing, body weight, glucose control (HbA1c), and self‚Äêperceptions of general health and vitality. The intervention produced, as hypothesized, significant changes in all study variables in favor of the experimental group (Cohen's     d effect sizes: 0.23‚Äì0.72), except the non‚Äêsignificant result for controlled motivation and body weight. The data supported the SDT process model, in which the effect of the intervention significantly predicted indirect changes in behavior and health through motivation variables. Considering the moderate to large effects on increases in motivation, behavior, and health, promoting organized physical activity programs that are perceived as need‚Äêsupportive may have important health implications for patients with DM2 and CAD.

295,How to succeed? Physical activity for individuals who are blind,"The aim of our case study was to examine the perceived experiences of participation in physical activity (PA). The cases comprised two individuals with blindness (a girl aged 12 years and a man aged 23 years), both of whom lived in Norway and had succeeded in becoming physically active. Both participants were recruited from Statped, the Norwegian support service for special needs education. Data were gathered from individual structured interviews with open and closed questions. A narrative descriptive analysis was used to analyse the data. The results showed that important factors for the blind participants‚Äô PA participation were having good instructors, support or visual interpreters, active family members, a safe sports environment, having tried many sports, private transportation to the exercise facilities, and a positive social environment, with peers, friends, and family members. Although some differences were found between the participants‚Äô responses, important reasons for them to engage in PA were stated as the sense of fun, energy, and self-esteem that they derived from it, in addition to physical fitness. In conclusion, the study provides knowledge of factors that could increase PA adherence of individuals with blindness being included in PA and sports together with sighted peers.

296,Who really wins? Efficacy of a Croatian youth gambling prevention program,"This paper reports on the development and pilot evaluation of a Croatian school-based youth gambling prevention program ‚ÄúWho really wins?‚Äù. The program is aimed at minimizing risk and enhancing protective factors related to youth gambling. A short-term evaluation of the program was conducted with a sample of 190 first and second year high-school students (67.6% boys, aged 14‚Äì17 years; average age 15.61). An experimental design with two groups (Training vs. No Training) and two measurement sessions (pre-test and post-test sessions) was used to evaluate change in problem gambling awareness, cognitive distortions, knowledge of the nature of random events as well as in social skills. Results showed significant changes in the post-test sessions, which can be attributed to changes in the Training group. We observed a decrease in risk factors, namely better knowledge about gambling and less gambling related cognitive distortions. Immediate effects on protective factors such as problem solving skills, refusal skills, and general self-efficacy were not observed. Findings also show program effects to be the same for both boys and girls, students from different types of schools, for those with different learning aptitudes, as well as for those at different risk levels with regard to their gambling, which speaks in favour of the program‚Äôs universality. The program had no iatrogenic effects on behaviour change and shows promise as an effective tool for youth gambling prevention. Future research and a long-term evaluation are needed to determine whether the observed changes are also linked to behavioural change.

297,"A review of the literature on pediatric concussions and return-to-learn (RTL): Implications for RTL policy, research, and practice","Objective: While reintegration of concussed youth back into sports has been increasingly studied over the past decade, a noticeably lacking yet growing body of research has begun to focus on issues surrounding return to academics or ‚Äúreturn-to-learn‚Äù (RTL). The objective of this article was to conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify the full range of themes and gaps in the current body of RTL research. Study design: Researchers analyzed PubMed, PsycINFO, and ERIC databases to identify all recent (January 2000 through May 2016) empirical publications on the RTL process following youth concussions. In addition to the database searches, bibliographies of selected manuscripts were hand-searched for additional sources. Results: A total of 35 articles met inclusion criteria. Key themes identified from the RTL literature centered on academic outcomes, physician recommendations, length of time to complete RTL, concussion-related symptom difficulties, and academic accommodations/guidelines. Across these areas, the research was fairly inconsistent in terms of providing clear conclusions, likely because of the small number of studies conducted within these areas as well as variability in methodology and terminology. Gaps in the research include a lack of the following: consensus on RTL protocols, agreement on prescription of cognitive rest, guidance for RTL legislation, understanding of communication between systems of care, concussion-related education for systems of care, evidence-based programs or interventions for RTL, and the impact on RTL outcomes. Conclusions: Given the inconsistencies in RTL literature, more rigorous research is needed to inform concussion policy and practice to assist with pediatric concussion management. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)      (Source: journal abstract) Impact statementImpact and Implications‚ÄîAlthough returning to school is a commonly faced obstacle among children with concussion, research on factors associated with this reintegration is limited. This comprehensive review article synthesizes themes and gaps from the emerging return-to-learn (RTL) research among concussed youth to provide direction for RTL research and policy decisions. This review confirms that the RTL process among children with concussion can be challenging and indicates the need for RTL protocols to foster transition back into full participation in academic tasks. Existing data are sparse and offer mixed evidence in terms of key issues, including how much cognitive rest is needed, whether children achieve better outcomes with active versus passive learning recommendations, median length of time needed for complete RTL, and so on. Systems of care involved in pediatric concussion rehabilitation would benefit from mandated policies and consensus guidelines regarding RTL. Specifically, RTL policies/guidelines should introduce an agreed upon stepwise RTL protocol, provide guidelines on cognitive rest, recommend frequent communication between providers, and mandate RTL training and education programs for stakeholders.

298,Problem gambling among adolescent girls in Croatia‚ÄîThe role of different psychosocial predictors,"Although, compared to boys, adolescent girls gamble less often and less problematically, prevalence studies still show significant numbers of at risk/problem gamblers among girls. However, girl gambling has been on the sidelines of adolescent gambling research. The available studies usually focus only on a narrow set of correlates often ignoring that adolescent gambling is a complex phenomenon determined by various factors. Also, they often measure gambling related consequences with instruments that are not specifically developed for use on adolescents. In order to contribute to a better understanding of adolescent gambling this study focuses on problem gambling among girls. We consider different social, cognitive, motivational and behavioral factors as predictors of girl problem gambling. A total of 1,372 high-school girls from 7 Croatian cities participated in the study. They provided data on their gambling activities, peer gambling, cognitive distortions related to gambling, motivation for gambling, and levels of general risky behavior. As the only instrument developed specifically for use on adolescents, the Canadian Adolescent Gambling Inventory was used to examine adverse gambling consequences. Results show 7.4% of girls can be considered regular gamblers, and out of those who gambled at least once in their lifetime (     n = 862), 11.2% already experience mild adverse consequences because of their gambling (at risk gamblers), with 3.2% experiencing serious consequences (problem gamblers). In general, girls seem to prefer lotto and scratch cards, but sports betting seems to be the preferred game of choice among regular girl gamblers. A hierarchical regression model confirmed the importance of much the same factors identified as risky for the development of problem gambling among adolescent boys‚Äîcognitive distortions, motives to earn money, to be better at gambling and to relax, the experiences of winning large and the drive to continue gambling, together with social factors such as having friends who also gamble, being involved in other risky and delinquent behavior and higher gambling frequency. Results call into question the importance of the motive to feel better for adolescent girls problem gambling. We discuss implications of our findings for both universal and indicated youth gambling prevention programs.

299,Physical activity engagement in young people with down syndrome: Investigating parental beliefs,"Background: Despite the wide documentation of the physical/psychological benefits derived from regular physical activity (PA), high levels of inactivity are reported among people with Down syndrome. This study aims to explore parental beliefs concerning involvement, facilitators/barriers and benefits of PA in young people. Method: Semi‚Äêstructured interviews were conducted with 13 parents of young people with Down syndrome. Results: Three facilitation themes were identified: (i) the support derived from family; (ii) the availability of APA (Adapted Physical Activity) expert instructors and coaches; (iii) the challenging nature of sport activities. Three barrier themes were identified: (i) the lack of APA expert coaches and specialized gyms; (ii) the characteristics of Down syndrome; and (iii) the parental beliefs and worries. Conclusions: Family plays a key role, as facilitator and barrier, to the participation of their children with Down syndrome in PA. Crucial is the implementation of evidence‚Äêbased exercise programmes involving people with Down syndrome and their families.

A qualitative interpretivist approach facilitated understanding of the experiences of eight children with different disabilities between the ages 6 and 10 who participated in dance in general education classrooms. Two one-on-one semi-structured interviews, children‚Äôs art work, class observations, and researcher field notes facilitated gaining access to the children‚Äôs experiences. Data were interpreted through a relational ethics conceptual framework. Data analysis followed the procedures of interpretive thematic analysis. Interview and observation data revealed three themes: (a) peer acceptance, (b) bodily learning, and (c) engaged support continuum. Relationships with teachers, educational assistants, and classmates created a dance education environment that enabled these children to participate alongside their classmates, experience joy and success, and gain a sense of belonging.

301,A qualitative exploration of a community-based singing activity on the recovery process of people living with mental illness,"Introduction: This study first aims to qualitatively explore the benefits of a community-based singing activity taking place in Montreal, Canada. The second aim is to identify the activity‚Äôs essential components that potentially explain these benefits. Method: An exploratory evaluative design involving qualitative descriptive methods was used. Thirteen individuals with various mental illnesses, the voice teacher and the activity coordinator participated in a group interview. Findings: Four main benefits emerged from the participants‚Äô interviews: (1) rediscovering identity and gaining self-confidence; (2) resuming and engaging in meaningful occupations and projects; (3) learning to collaborate with others and improving social skills; (4) improving physical condition and cognitive skills. The essential components of the activity were identified as: a normalizing environment and the absence of stigma; high expectations and support for participants; teacher-led stress relief exercises and activities; the use of singing as an activity to express emotions and stimulate cognitive functions. Conclusion: This community-based singing activity appears to have contributed to the recovery process of its participants. There is a clear role for occupational therapists to promote, facilitate and support such activities outside traditional mental health services, since the participants were looking for occupational participation opportunities in normalizing community contexts.

302,Examining academic support after concussion for the adolescent student-athlete: Perspectives of the athletic trainer,"Context: Student-athletes may require cognitive rest and academic support after concussion. Athletic trainers (ATs) in secondary schools are uniquely positioned to provide medical care and to collaborate with school professionals while managing concussions. However, little is known regarding return-to-learn policies and their implementation in secondary schools. Objective: To examine ATs‚Äô perspectives on return to learn, cognitive rest, and communication with school professionals after concussion. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Web-based survey. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 1124 secondary school ATs completed the survey (28.5% response rate). The majority of participants were employed full time (752/1114 [67.5%]) in public schools (911/1117 [81.6%]). Main Outcome Measure(s): School and AT employment characteristics, demographics, number of concussions evaluated annually, and perceptions of school professionals‚Äô familiarity with ATs‚Äô responsibilities were independent variables. Results: Of the ATs, 44% reported having an existing return-to-learn policy. The strongest predictor of a return-to-learn policy was frequent communication with teachers after concussion (odds ratio ¬º 1.5; 95% confidence interval ¬º1.2, 1.7). Most ATs recommended complete cognitive rest (eg, no reading, television; 492/1087 [45.3%]) or limited cognitive activity based upon symptoms (391/1087 [36.0%]). Common academic accommodations were postponed due dates (789/954 [82.7%]), rest breaks (765/954 [80.2%]), and partial attendance (740/954 [77.6%]). Athletic trainers self-reported as primary monitors of health (764/1037 [73.7%]) and academic progression (359/1011 [35.5%]). The strongest predictor of ATs‚Äô communication with school professionals was their perception of school professionals‚Äô understanding of ATs‚Äô roles. Conclusions: Overall, ATs followed best practices for cognitive rest and return to learn after concussion. Although ATs are central to the management of student-athletes‚Äô physical health after concussion, school professionals may be better suited to monitor academic progress. Increased communication between the AT and school professionals is recommended to monitor recovery and facilitate academic support for symptomatic student-athletes.

303,Music and dyslexia: A new musical training method to improve reading and related disorders,"Numerous arguments in the recent neuroscientific literature support the use of musical training as a therapeutic tool among the arsenal already available to therapists and educators for treating children with dyslexia. In the present study, we tested the efficacy of a specially-designed Cognitivo-Musical Training (CMT) method based upon three principles: (1) music-language analogies: training dyslexics with music could contribute to improve brain circuits which are common to music and language processes; (2) the temporal and rhythmic features of music, which could exert a positive effect on the multiple dimensions of the ‚Äútemporal deficit‚Äù characteristic of some types of dyslexia; and (3) cross-modal integration, based on converging evidence of impaired connectivity between brain regions in dyslexia and related disorders. Accordingly, we developed a series of musical exercises involving jointly and simultaneously sensory (visual, auditory, somatosensory) and motor systems, with special emphasis on rhythmic perception and production in addition to intensive training of various features of the musical auditory signal. Two separate studies were carried out, one in which dyslexic children received intensive musical exercises concentrated over 18 h during 3 consecutive days, and the other in which the 18 h of musical training were spread over 6 weeks. Both studies showed significant improvements in some untrained, linguistic and non-linguistic variables. The first one yielded significant improvement in categorical perception and auditory perception of temporal components of speech. The second study revealed additional improvements in auditory attention, phonological awareness (syllable fusion), reading abilities, and repetition of pseudo-words. Importantly, most improvements persisted after an untrained period of 6 weeks. These results provide new additional arguments for using music as part of systematic therapeutic and instructional practice for dyslexic children.

304,Neural correlates of visuomotor learning in autism,"Motor impairments are prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorder. The Serial Reaction Time Task, a well-established visuomotor sequence learning probe, has produced inconsistent behavioral findings in individuals with autism. Moreover, it remains unclear how underlying neural processes for visuomotor learning in children with autism compare to processes for typically developing children. Neural activity differences were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a modified version of the Serial Reaction Time Task in children with and without autism. Though there was no group difference in visuomotor sequence learning, underlying patterns of neural activation significantly differed when comparing sequence (ie, learning) to random (ie, nonlearning) blocks. Children with autism demonstrated decreased activity in brain regions implicated in visuomotor sequence learning: superior temporal sulcus and posterior cingulate cortex. The findings implicate differences in brain mechanisms that support initial sequence learning in autism and can help explain behavioral observations of autism-associated impairments in skill development (motor, social, communicative) reliant on visuomotor integration.

305,Inclusion of children with special needs in early childhood education: What teacher characteristics matter,"Whereas the inclusion of children with special needs in regular classrooms has gained increasing advocacy, teachers‚Äô attitudes vary. Previous studies examining teacher attitudes have focused on primary and secondary schools in the Western world, and little is known about early childhood settings in Eastern countries. This study used MANOVA to examine preschool teachers‚Äô attitudes in Hong Kong (     N = 410). Teachers reported only modest support for inclusion. Teachers with training in special education were stronger advocates of inclusion, irrespective of their professional roles (administrator or class teacher), for children with intellectual disability, or visual, hearing, and speech and language impairments. However, neither teacher training nor professional role made a significance difference to teachers‚Äô support of including children with physical disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific learning difficulty, and the gifted and talented.

306,Overcoming clinical inertia: A randomized clinical trial of a telehealth remote monitoring intervention using paired glucose testing in adults with type 2 diabetes,"Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a worldwide challenge. Practice guidelines promote structured self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) for informing health care providers about glycemic control and providing patient feedback to increase knowledge, self-efficacy, and behavior change. Paired glucose testing‚Äîpairs of glucose results obtained before and after a meal or physical activity‚Äîis a method of structured SMBG. However, frequent access to glucose data to interpret values and recommend actions is challenging. A complete feedback loop‚Äîdata collection and interpretation combined with feedback to modify treatment‚Äîhas been associated with improved outcomes, yet there remains limited integration of SMBG feedback in diabetes management. Incorporating telehealth remote monitoring and asynchronous electronic health record (EHR) feedback from certified diabetes educators (CDEs)‚Äîspecialists in glucose pattern management‚Äîemploy the complete feedback loop to improve outcomes. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a telehealth remote monitoring intervention using paired glucose testing and asynchronous data analysis in adults with type 2 diabetes. The primary aim was change in glycated hemoglobin (A     1c)‚Äîa measure of overall glucose management‚Äîbetween groups after 6 months. The secondary aims were change in self-reported Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA), Diabetes Empowerment Scale, and Diabetes Knowledge Test. Methods: A 2-group randomized clinical trial was conducted comparing usual care to telehealth remote monitoring with paired glucose testing and asynchronous virtual visits. Participants were aged 30-70 years, not using insulin with A     1c levels between 7.5% and 10.9% (58-96 mmol/mol). The telehealth remote monitoring tablet computer transmitted glucose data and facilitated a complete feedback loop to educate participants, analyze actionable glucose data, and provide feedback. Data from paired glucose testing were analyzed asynchronously using computer-assisted pattern analysis and were shared with patients via the EHR weekly. CDEs called participants monthly to discuss paired glucose testing trends and treatment changes. Separate mixed-effects models were used to analyze data. Results: Participants (N = 90) were primarily white (64%, 56/87), mean age 58 (SD 11) years, mean body mass index 34.1 (SD 6.7) kg/m2, with diabetes for mean 8.2 (SD 5.4) years, and a mean A     1c of 8.3% (SD 1.1; 67 mmol/mol). Both groups lowered A     1c with an estimated average decrease of 0.70 percentage points in usual care group and 1.11 percentage points in the treatment group with a significant difference of 0.41 percentage points at 6 months (SE 0.08, t‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ‚Çâ = ‚Äì2.87,      P = .005). Change in medication (SE 0.21, t‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ‚Çá = ‚Äì3.37,      P = .009) was significantly associated with lower A1c level. The treatment group significantly improved on the SDSCA subscales carbohydrate spacing (     P = .04), monitoring glucose (     P = .001), and foot care (     P = .02). Conclusions: An eHealth model incorporating a complete feedback loop with telehealth remote monitoring and paired glucose testing with asynchronous data analysis significantly improved A1c levels compared to usual care.

307,Voices of girls with disabilities in rural Iran,"This paper investigates the interaction of gender, disability and education in rural Iran, which is a relatively unexplored field of research. The responses of 10 female students with disabilities from Isfahan indicated that the obstacles they faced included marginalization, difficulties in getting from home to school, difficulties within the school building itself, and discrimination by teachers, classmates and school authorities. The data collected for the study contain a wide range of conservative gendered discourses, and show how traditional gender beliefs interact with disability to aggravate the problems faced in education by young women with disabilities. It is hoped that the findings will raise awareness among policy-makers of the many formidable obstacles that make it difficult for young women with disabilities to achieve their full potential in education.

308,Exploring minor hockey players' knowledge and attitudes toward concussion: Implications for prevention,"Objective: To evaluate minor hockey players‚Äô attitudes and knowledge about sport concussions. Participants: Male and female Pee Wee, Bantam, and Midget level players (n = 183) participating in minor hockey and a comparison group of non‚Äìhockey players (n = 57). Design: Survey. Main Measures: Player knowledge and attitudes were evaluated with a standardized questionnaire developed for the purpose of this study. Descriptive statistics including cross-tabulations and proportion comparisons were used to report the data. Results: Players had foundational knowledge about concussions; however, more than half underestimated the prevalence and more than 30% were unaware of return to play protocols. Although nearly all players knew what they ‚Äúshould‚Äù do when concussed, 33% did not follow recommendations. Players reported more concern and appreciation of the seriousness of concussion than non-players, but they tended to minimize their vulnerability. The most common and helpful information sources were parents, doctors, and coaches, and therefore knowledge translation efforts should target theses audiences. Conclusion: Young athletes continue to demonstrate gaps in their knowledge of concussions. In addition, attitudes toward concussion suggest a developmental trajectory with younger athletes being most likely to ignore current recommended guidelines.

Knowledge change is measured by the distribution and mean of pre- and posttest scores by sex, primary role (eg, coach, student, and parent), and sport coached. Results: Between May 2010 and July 2013, the online concussion course was completed 819 223 times, reaching 666 026 unique participants, including residents from all US states and the District of Columbia. The distribution of overall scores improved from pre- to posttests, with 21% answering all questions correctly on the pretest and 60% answering all questions correctly on the posttest. Conclusion: Online training can be effective in reaching large audiences and improving knowledge about emerging health and safety issues such as concussion awareness.

310,Developing programmes to promote participation in sport among adolescents with disabilities: Perceptions expressed by a group of South African adolescents with cerebral palsy,"Adolescents with disabilities in developing countries frequently have limited access to sporting opportunities and comparatively little is known of their lived experiences and preferences. We set out to understand what a group of adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) living in South Africa perceive to be important components of programmes developed to increase their participation in sport. We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 adolescents with CP. Data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Congruent with existing research, our findings suggest that sporting programmes should allow participants choice, provide physical challenges and present opportunities to socialise and experience mastery. Participants ask for: variety and a wider range of sports; greater recognition; coaching; and competition within programmes which are inclusive and fair. The data highlights the need for advocacy work and draws attention to the challenges of responding to participants‚Äô requests when developing sports programmes for adolescents with disabilities in resource-scarce countries.

311,Influence of health locus of control on recovery of function in recently hospitalized frail older adults,"Aim: To investigate the influence of health locus of control on physical function, quality of life, depression and satisfaction with care transition in a sample of older adults after a hospital admission. Methods: A total of 230 older adults referred for transition care after a hospital admission (mean length of stay 25.7 days, SD 17.2) were recruited into a randomized controlled intervention trial investigating the effect of specialized coaching compared with usual care. Older adults completed the multidimensional health locus of control (MHLC) survey at baseline. Self‚Äêrated quality of life, depression and physical function were assessed at baseline and 12 months using the EuroQol five‚Äêdimension, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI), respectively. Results: Results from hierarchical multiple regression analysis in 136 participants (70 usual care and 66 specialized care) with complete data showed that higher scores on the MHLC internal subscale were related to better quality of life, and better physical function in the usual care group at 12 months, but not depression or transition process satisfaction at 3 months. No relationships between MHLC subscales and outcome measures were observed in the specialized care group, where the coaching intervention might have precluded any relationship observed. Conclusions: A stronger sense of personal control over health was associated with better maintenance of quality of life and physical function at 12 months in older adults undergoing usual care transition after acute hospitalization. Modification of control beliefs has the potential to promote resilience and impact on health outcomes in older adults during care transitions.

312,"The relationship between sports teachers‚Äô reports, motor performance and perceived self-efficacy of children with developmental coordination disorders","Background: Children with developmental coordination disorders (DCD) express fine and gross motor problems, reduced fitness, and low self-efficacy. Yet, the relationship between these characteristics as expressed in daily environments including school, is not well understood. The aim of this study is to examine the relationships between sports activity performance as reported by the sports teacher, gross and fine motor abilities, and self-efficacy among school aged children. Methods: This study included 61 children, aged 6.10‚Äì9 years, divided into two groups: 37 children with DCD, and 24 children with typical development and adequate motor performance. The sports teacher of each child filled the Teacher Estimation of Activity Form (TEAF). Each child performed the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC) and then completed the Perceived Efficacy and Goal Setting System (PEGS). Results: Based on teachers‚Äô reports, the study group showed significantly lower sports performance than the controls. Significant differences between the groups were also found in fine and gross motor abilities as manifested in the M-ABC. Among children with DCD, sports performance significantly correlated with M-ABC and PEGS scores. The teacher‚Äôs report regarding the child‚Äôs sports performance significantly predicted children‚Äôs motor abilities and self-efficacy. Conclusions: The study highlights that sports teachers may contribute to the screening of children with DCD and emphasize motor aspects that reduce a child‚Äôs self-efficacy.

313,Validity and reliability evidence of the TOCA‚ÄìC in a sample of Greek students,"Validity and reliability evidence of the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation‚ÄìChecklist (TOCA‚ÄìC) was examined in 186 Greek students through exploratory factor analysis, divergent and concurrent validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. The TOCA‚ÄìC showed a high internal consistency for the three factors of Concentration Problems, Disruptive/Aggressive Behaviour, and Prosocial Behaviour (Œ±s = .89‚Äì.96), and acceptable two-week test-retest reliability. The three-factor solution explained 74.50% of the total variance. Regarding divergent validity, a significant Sex √ó Disability interaction was evident for Disruptive Behaviour, with women scoring higher in ‚Äòspecial‚Äô and lower in ‚Äògeneral‚Äô schools compared to men. Main effects were significant across disability, but not across sex. Correlations with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire suggested convergent and divergent validity evidence. The TOCA‚ÄìC should be useful in testing Greek students with and without disabilities.

314,Impact of end-stage kidney disease on academic achievement and employment in young adults: A mixed methods study,"Purpose: Young adult kidney patients are at an important stage of development when end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) may adversely influence progress in education and employment. This study is designed to assess the impact of ESKD on education and employment outcomes in young adults. Method: This cross-sectional study was a mixed methods design. Education and career achievements in young adults with ESKD were recorded quantitatively using a questionnaire survey (     n = 57): 14 of 57 representative participants were subsequently selected for semistructured interview. Results: Questionnaire survey was conducted in 57 young adults (median age 25): 8.8% (     n = 5) were predialysis; 14.0% (     n = 8) dialysis; and 78.9% (     n = 45) were kidney transplant recipients. Median school-leaving age was 16 (interquartile range = 15‚Äì19). Of 57 young adults, 10 (17.5%) were still studying, 43 (75.4%) had completed education, 34 (59.7%) were employed (23 full time and 11 part time), and 19 (33.3%) were unemployed. Twenty-seven of 45 transplanted patients were employed (60.0%). Of these 27, 21 were full time (77.8%). Five of eight dialysis patients were employed: only one of eight was full-time employed (12.5%). Themes impacting on education and employment included low energy levels, time missed, loss of self-esteem, and feelings of loneliness and isolation, which may progress to depression and recreational drug use. Lack of understanding from educators and employers resulting in lost work, and career ambitions changed or limited because of dialysis. Conclusions: Dialysis has a major negative impact on education and reduced employment rates of young adults. There is a general lack of understanding among educators and employers of the impact of ESKD. Low energy levels, lack of self-esteem, and depression are key factors. There is a need for health care providers to recognize this issue and invest in supporting young adults with ESKD.

315,A feasibility study to develop a diabetes prevention program for young adults with prediabetes by using digital platforms and a handheld device,"Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an age-specific diabetes prevention program in young adults with prediabetes. Methods: A one-group pretest-posttest design was used. The inclusion criteria were age 18 to 29 years and the presence of prediabetes (either impaired fasting glucose of 100-125 mg/dL [5.55-6.94 mmol/L] or A1C of 5.7%-6.4%). Fifteen participants were enrolled in the study. A technology-based lifestyle coaching program focused on diet and physical activity and incorporating a handheld device and digital platforms was developed and tested. Psychosocial factors (health literacy, illness perception, self-efficacy, therapeutic efficacy) based on social cognitive theory, changes in diet and physical activity, and cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed at baseline and week 12 after the intervention. A paired-samples     t test was performed to examine changes between baseline and postintervention on each psychosocial and physical variable. Results: Participants‚Äô (n = 13 completers) mean age was 24.4 ¬± 2.2 years, 23.1% were male, and 53.8% were African American. Overall, the participants were satisfied with the intervention (mean score, 4.15 on a 5-point, Likert-type scale). Between pre- and posttesting, mean body mass index and mean A1C decreased from 41.0 ¬± 7.3 kg/m¬≤ and 6.0 ¬± 0.5% to 40.1 ¬± 7.0 kg/m¬≤ and 5.6 ¬± 0.5%, respectively, whereas mean fasting glucose did not significantly change (from 92.6 ¬± 11 to 97.6 ¬± 14.3 mg/dL [5.14 ¬± 0.61 to 5.42 ¬± 0.79 mmol/L]). Conclusions: The intervention resulted in reduced A1C and a trend toward decreased body mass index in obese sedentary young adults with prediabetes after 12 weeks. Further study through a randomized clinical trial with a longer intervention period is warranted.

316,Differences in adolescent relationship abuse perpetration and gender-inequitable attitudes by sport among male high school athletes,"Purpose: School-based athletic programs remain an important context for violence prevention efforts although a better understanding of how gender attitudes and abuse perpetration differ among athletes is needed. Methods: We analyzed baseline survey data from the ""Coaching Boys into Men"" study‚Äîa school-based cluster-randomized trial in 16 high schools in Northern California. We describe relationships among gender-inequitable attitudes, sport type, and recent adolescent relationship abuse perpetration among a sample of male athletes (n = 1,648). Results: Gender-inequitable attitudes (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.56, 4.15), participation in both high school football and basketball (AOR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.37, 3.18), and participation in football only (AOR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.02, 2.22) emerged as independently associated with recent ARA perpetration. Conclusions: Findings warrant targeted violence prevention efforts among male high school athletes that incorporate discussions of gender attitudes and healthy relationships, especially among sports teams at greater risk of adolescent relationship abuse perpetration.

317,The impact of Hispanic ethnicity on knowledge and behavior among patients with diabetes,"The survey population reported a high understanding of dietitian roles. However, the roles of other midlevel providers were not as well understood by youth with type 1 diabetes and their parents, which could represent a missed opportunity for care. A cross-sectional survey measured demographic data, personal behaviors/health factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) history, and knowledge of 7 components of ideal cardiovascular health (smoking, obesity, exercise, diet, cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose). A subset of 331 Hispanic and white patients with diabetes was surveyed. Knowledge scores were dichotomized between full knowledge (7 components) and less than full knowledge and compared between ethnicities using multiple logistic regression. Seventy-nine percent of surveys were returned; 50.5% of subjects were Hispanic. Median age was 64.5 years with 60.7% being female. Two-thirds of the sample completed high school and 26% reported comorbid CVD. Recognition of diabetes as a risk factor didn‚Äôt differ by ethnicity. Thirty-five percent of respondents identified 7 American Heart Association risk factors. Hispanics were less likely to identify 7 components. After adjustment for education and English literacy, the difference disappeared. Better knowledge was positively associated with healthier behaviors for high cholesterol, hypertension, and exercise only among white patients. Hispanic patients with diabetes exhibit less knowledge about CVD risk/protective factors due to lower education and English literacy. Educational interventions should be tailored to those with less education/limited English proficiency.

318,Lessons learned in community research through the Native Proverbs 31 Health Project,"Background: American Indian women have high rates of cardiovascular disease largely because of their high prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. This population has high rates of cardiovascular disease-related behaviors, including physical inactivity, harmful tobacco use, and a diet that promotes heart disease. Culturally appropriate interventions are needed to establish health behavior change to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Community Context: This study was conducted in Robeson County, North Carolina, the traditional homeland of the Lumbee Indian tribe. The study‚Äôs goal was to develop, deliver, and evaluate a community-based, culturally appropriate cardiovascular disease program for American Indian women and girls. Methods: Formative research, including focus groups, church assessments, and literature reviews, were conducted for intervention development. Weekly classes during a 4-month period in 4 Lumbee churches (64 women and 11 girls in 2 primary intervention churches; 82 women and 8 girls in 2 delayed intervention churches) were led by community lay health educators. Topics included nutrition, physical activity, and tobacco use cessation and were coupled with messages from the Proverbs 31 passage, which describes the virtuous, godly woman. Surveys collected at the beginning and end of the program measured programmatic effects and change in body mass index. Outcome: Churches were very receptive to the program. However, limitations included slow rise in attendance, scheduling conflicts for individuals and church calendars, and resistance to change in cultural traditions. Interpretation: Churches are resources in developing and implementing health promotion programs in Christian populations. Through church partnerships, interventions can be tailored to suit the needs of targeted groups.

319,Childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms are risk factors for obesity and physical inactivity in adolescence,"Objective: To prospectively investigate the association and directionality between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and obesity from childhood to adolescence in the general population. We examined whether obesogenic behaviors, namely, physical inactivity and binge eating, underlie the potential ADHD symptom‚Äìobesity association. We explored whether childhood conduct disorder (CD) symptoms are related to adolescent obesity/physical inactivity. Method: At 7 to 8 years (n = 8,106), teachers reported ADHD and CD symptoms, and parents reported body mass index (BMI) and physically active play. At 16 years (n = 6,934), parents reported ADHD symptoms; adolescents reported physical activity (transformed to metabolic equivalent of task [MET] hours per week) and binge eating; BMI and waist‚Äìhip ratio (WHR) were measured via clinical examination. Obesity was defined using the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) cut-offs for BMI and the 95th percentile cut-off for WHR. Results: Childhood ADHD symptoms significantly predicted adolescent obesity, rather than the opposite. Inattention-hyperactivity symptoms at 8 years were associated with indices of obesity at 16 years (obese BMI: odds ratio [OR] = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10‚Äì3.33; 95th percentile WHR: OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.05‚Äì2.78), adjusted for gender, baseline BMI, physical activity, family structure change, and maternal education. Child CD symptoms associated with indices of adolescent obesity. Reduced physically active play in childhood predicted adolescent inattention (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.16‚Äì2.24). Childhood ADHD and CD symptoms were linked with physical inactivity in adolescence (inattention-hyperactivity; OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.20‚Äì2.13), but not binge eating. Physical inactivity mediated the associations. Conclusions: Children with ADHD or CD symptoms are at increased risk for becoming obese and physically inactive adolescents. Physical activity may be beneficial for both behavior problems and obesity.

320,Occupational performance coaching adapted for stroke survivors (OPC-Stroke): A feasibility evaluation,"ABSTRACT. Background: The majority of stroke survivors experience participation restrictions, that is problems with meaningful involvement in life situations. Effective interventions to promote participation following stroke are needed. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the acceptability, potential effectiveness, and essential elements of Occupational Performance Coaching adapted for stroke survivors (OPC-Stroke). Methods: A case study approach was used. Four participants were recruited to receive OPC-Stroke. Outcome measures were administered pre and postintervention. Semistructured interviews were conducted postintervention to explore participants‚Äô experiences of OPC-Stroke. Results: Two participants reported improvements in goal performance, goal satisfaction, and overall participation. Two participants appeared to have difficulty understanding the approach and withdrew from the study. Conclusion: OPC-Stroke was feasible to deliver and shows promise as an intervention for improving participation following stroke. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of OPC-Stroke and characteristics of stroke survivors who may benefit most from this intervention.

321,Outcomes of a church-based diabetes prevention program delivered by peers: A feasibility study,"Purpose: This purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and potential health impact of a church-based diabetes prevention program delivered by peers. Methods: Thirteen at-risk African American adults were recruited to a peer-led diabetes prevention program adapted from the National Diabetes Education Program‚Äôs Power to Prevent curriculum. The program consisted of 6 core education sessions followed by 6 biweekly telephone support calls. Components of feasibility examined included recruitment, attendance, and retention. Baseline, 8-week, and 20-week assessments measured clinical outcomes (percentage body weight change, waist circumference, lipid panel, blood pressure) and lifestyle behaviors (eg, physical activity and diet). Results: Of the 13 participants enrolled at baseline, 11 completed the intervention. Mean attendance across 6 core sessions was 5.2 classes (87%). At 8 weeks, significant improvements were found for physical activity (     P = .031), waist circumference (     P = .049), serum cholesterol (     P = .036), systolic blood pressure (     P = .013), and fat intake (     P = .006). At 20 weeks, not only did participants sustain the improvements made following the core intervention, but they also demonstrated additional improvements for HDL (     P = .002) and diastolic blood pressure (     P = .004). Conclusion: Findings suggest that it is feasible to conduct a peer-led diabetes prevention program in a church-based setting that has a potentially positive impact on health-related outcomes.

322,Development of the physical educators‚Äô judgments about inclusion instrument for Japanese physical education majors and an analysis of their judgments,"The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the Physical Educators‚Äô Judgments about Inclusion (PEJI) survey for analysing the judgments of Japanese (361 male, 170 female) physical education teacher education majors. A secondary purpose was to examine group differences in judgments as a function of gender and past experiences. Data were collected and psychometric properties of the PEJI were assessed using a maximum-likelihood extraction method. Confirmatory factor analysis resulted in salient loadings for all items on three hypothesised dimensions, resulting in 47% explained variance for measuring judgments about:     Inclusion versus Exclusion, Acceptance of Students with Disabilities, and      Perceived Training Needs. Supported by the three interpretable factors that emerged, construct validity evidence is presented. Although most of the physical education teacher education majors sampled had yet to teach students with disabilities, they had formed preliminary judgments about doing so.

323,The effectiveness of a fundamental motor skill intervention in pre-schoolers with motor problems depends on gender but not environmental context,"This study evaluated the effect of a 10-week fundamental motor skill programme in pre-schoolers with motor problems. Alongside the general effect of the intervention, we also explored possible gender differences and the role of the environmental context (living community, socio-economic status, and recreational space inside/outside the house). The intervention group (     n = 47; 20 ‚ôÇ and 27 ‚ôÄ) received twenty 60-min motor skill sessions (2 per week) in addition to the regular physical education curriculum for pre-schoolers; the control group (     n = 46; 21 ‚ôÇ and 25 ‚ôÄ) did not receive additional practice. General motor competence, and locomotor and object control subscales, were assessed before and after the intervention using the Test of Gross Motor Development 2nd edition (TGMD-2). Data regarding environmental factors were gathered through a questionnaire. A Group√óGender√óTime ANOVA revealed that the intervention group benefited significantly from the intervention and scored better than the control group at the post-test for general motor competence and both sub-categories (locomotor and object control skill). Moreover, the intervention programme was found to be effective in helping 49% of the intervention group to achieve an average motor skill level, according to the TGMD-2 norms, while a further decline in motor competence was observed in the control group. Interestingly, the effect appeared to be gender-specific, since object control skill improved only in girls of the intervention group. Considering the environmental context, none of the above-mentioned factors was found to have an influence on the effectiveness of the intervention. The present study highlights the need for an early motor skill programme with a gender-specific approach in order to help low skilled boys and girls master a diverse set of motor skills.

324,Children‚Äôs social relationships and motivation in sledge hockey,"The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore children with disabilities‚Äô social relationships and motivation to take part in sledge hockey. Harter‚Äôs (1978) theory of Competence Motivation was used as the conceptual framework. Ten children (1 girl and 9 boys) between ages 11‚Äì16 years, who experienced a range of disabilities, participated. Primary data were collected using semistructured interviews, participant observations, and field and reflective notes. The thematic analysis led to four themes: (a) coach feedback, (b) parental involvement, (c) skill and belonging, and (d) (dis)ability sport. The findings revealed that interactions with significant others contributed extensively to the participant‚Äôs perceptions of competence and motivation to participate, as did the sport‚Äôs competitive nature. The findings are discussed in the context of Harter‚Äôs theory and the children‚Äôs sport and adapted physical activity inclusion literature.

325,"Tone, rhythm, and timbre perception in school-age children using cochlear implants and hearing aids","Background: Children with hearing impairments, especially those using hearing devices such as the cochlear implant (Cl) or hearing aid (HA), are sometimes not encouraged to attend music classes, as they or their parents and teachers may be unsure whether the child can perform basic musical tasks. Purpose: The objective of the current study was to provide a baseline for the performance of children using CIs and HAs on standardized tests of rhythm and pitch perception as well as an Instrument timbre identification task. An additional aim was to determine the effect of structured music training on these measures during the course of a school year. Research Design: The Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation (IMMA) Tonal and Rhythmic subtests were administered four times, with 6 wk between tests. All children in the study were also enrolled in ""Music Club"" teaching sessions. Measures were compared between groups and across the four testing sessions. Study Sample: Twenty children from a single school in Melbourne, Australia, were recruited. Eleven (four girls) had impaired hearing, including six with a unilateral Cl or Cl and HA together (two girls) and five with bilateral HAs (two girls). Nine were normally hearing, selected to match the age and gender of the hearing-impaired children. Ages ranged from 9-13 yr. Intervention: All children participated in a weekly Music Club‚Äîa 45 min session of musical activities based around vocal play and the integration of aural, visual, and kinesthetic modes of learning. Data Collection and Analysis: Audiological data were collected from clinical files. IMMA scores were converted to percentile ranks using published norms. Between-group differences were tested using repeated-measures analysis of variance, and between-session differences were tested using a linear mixed model. Linear regression was used to model the effect of hearing loss on the test scores. Results: In the first session, normally hearing children had a mean percentile rank bf ~50 in both the Tonal and Rhythmic subtests of the IMMA. Children using CIs showed trends toward lower scores in the Tonal, but not the Rhythmic, subtests. No significant improvements were found between sessions. In the timbre lest, children generally made fewer errors within the set of percussive compared to nonpercussive instruments. The hearing loss level partially predicted performance in the Tonal, but not the Rhythmic, task, and predictions were more significant for nonpercussive compared to percussive instruments. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of temporal cues in the perception of music, and indicate that temporal cues may be used by children with CIs and HAs in the perception of not only rhythm' but also of some aspects of timbre. We were not able to link participation in the Music Club with increased scores on the Tonal, Rhythmic, and Timbre tests. However, anecdotal evidence from the children and their teachers suggested a wide range of benefits from participation in the Music Club that extended from increased engagement and interest in music classes into the children's social situations.

326,Promoting social inclusion through Unified Sports for youth with intellectual disabilities: A five‚Äênation study,"Background: Although the promotion of social inclusion through sports has received increased attention with other disadvantaged groups, this is not the case for children and adults with intellectual disability who experience marked social isolation. The study evaluated the outcomes from one sports programme with particular reference to the processes that were perceived to enhance social inclusion. Method: The Youth Unified Sports programme of Special Olympics combines players with intellectual disabilities (called athletes) and those without intellectual disabilities (called partners) of similar skill level in the same sports teams for training and competition. Alongside the development of sporting skills, the programme offers athletes a platform to socialise with peers and to take part in the life of their community. Unified football and basketball teams from five countries‚ÄîGermany, Hungary, Poland, Serbia and Ukraine‚Äîparticipated. Individual and group interviews were held with athletes, partners, coaches, parents and community leaders: totalling around 40 informants per country. Results: Qualitative data analysis identified four thematic processes that were perceived by informants across all countries and the two sports to facilitate social inclusion of athletes. These were: (1) the personal development of athletes and partners; (2) the creation of inclusive and equal bonds; (3) the promotion of positive perceptions of athletes; and (4) building alliances within local communities. Conclusions: Unified Sports does provide a vehicle for promoting the social inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities that is theoretically credible in terms of social capital scholarship and which contains lessons for advancing social inclusion in other contexts. Nonetheless, certain limitations are identified that require further consideration to enhance athletes‚Äô social inclusion in the wider community.

327,Evaluation of a community health worker pilot intervention to improve diabetes management in Bangladeshi immigrants with type 2 diabetes in New York City,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the impact and feasibility of a pilot Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention to improve diabetes management among Bangladeshi-American individuals with type 2 diabetes living in New York City. Methods: Participants were recruited at clinic- and community-based venues. The intervention consisted of 6 monthly, CHW-facilitated group sessions on topics related to management of diabetes. Surveys were collected at baseline and follow-up time points. Study outcomes included clinical, behavioral, and satisfaction measures for participants, as well as qualitative measures from CHWs. Results: Improvements were seen in diabetes knowledge, exercise and diet to control diabetes, frequency of checking feet, medication compliance, and self-efficacy of health and physical activity from baseline to 12 months. Additionally, there were decreases in A1C, weight, and body mass index. Program evaluation revealed a high acceptability of the intervention, and qualitative findings indicated that CHWs helped overcome barriers and facilitated program outcomes through communal concordance, trust, and leadership. Conclusions: The intervention demonstrated high acceptability and suggested efficacy in improving diabetes management outcomes among Bangladeshi immigrants in an urban setting. The US Bangladeshi population will continue to increase, and given the high rates of diabetes, as well as linguistic and economic barriers faced by this community, effective and culturally tailored health interventions are needed to overcome barriers and provide support for diabetes management.

328,Quality of life domains affected in children with developmental coordination disorder: A systematic review,"The quality of life (QOL) of children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is largely unknown, but evidence suggests that multiple QOL domains are affected by the disorder. While DCD is primarily considered a motor disorder, multiple studies have reported psychological and social concerns in children with this condition. Our primary aim was to present the current state of the evidence regarding the physical, psychological, and social QOL domains that can be affected in children with DCD. Systematic review of articles from seven databases through November 2010 (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, CDSR, DARE) was conducted. Search terms included developmental coordination disorder, dyspraxia, quality of life, life satisfaction, well-being, activities of daily living, and participation. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Studies meeting the following criteria were selected: (1) sample comprised solely of individuals with coordination difficulties consistent with DCD; (2) outcome measures related to physical, psychological, or socials domains of QOL; and (3) articles published in English. Data were extracted by one author and verified by a second. Outcomes were categorized according to physical, psychological and social domains of QOL and study quality was rated by case definitions of DCD based on diagnostic criteria as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual‚Äî4th edition. Forty-one articles were included.Most studies reported significantly poorer results in physical, psychological and social functioning in children with DCD compared with peers. Despite the impact of DCD on multiple domains, only one study used a QOL measure as an outcome. Although DCD impacts several QOL domains, the QOL of children with this disorder remains largely unknown. The next critical step is for clinicians and researchers to use QOL measures to gather information on how DCD may affect the QOL of children with this disorder.

329,"Risk, fitness to practice, and disabled health care students","The United Kingdom Equality Act of 2010 poses challenges to regulators, educators, and employers to ensure that disabled people are not excluded from health care professions on the basis of their impairment. Professional bodies must also anticipate the needs of disabled people and facilitate inclusion. In this article, we discuss some of the current tensions that exist between U.K. antidiscrimination legislation and the professional and statutory regulatory bodies that govern registration of health and social care practitioners in the United Kingdom. We present research that used a mixed methods approach to explore the tensions between higher education and placement providers in the health sector. Disabled students and health professionals engaged in semistructured interviews, and a survey explored the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of professional staff from a range of disciplines and institutions. Findings suggest that the negative feelings disabled students report are also evident in responses from health care professionals. Notions of risk emerge as a key issue from the data. We discuss whether the risk is perceived or actual and develop models to challenge existing preconceptions about the risk posed by disabled students when training as health care professionals. Finally, we suggest that while work clearly needs to be done in this area, some of this work can be addressed through the development of an inclusive curriculum for all health care practitioners. This article proposes an educational model of risk with which to guide this process.

330,Learning needs of youth with type 2 diabetes,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine reports of diabetes learning needs by youth with type 2 diabetes and their family support person (FSP) and to examine correlations of these perceptions with demographic variables. Methods: Data were analyzed from the Participant Needs Assessment (PNA), a routinely self-administered questionnaire designed to assess learning needs, in 191 youth (mean age = 14.0 ¬± 1.9 years, duration 8.78 ¬± 6.30 months; 36% black, non-Hispanic; 40% Hispanic; 20% white) enrolled in the TODAY (Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) study. Youth and their FSPs completed the PNA at scheduled study visits, rating their learning needs on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating higher needs. Paired     t tests and ANOVA were used. Results: There were no differences in reported learning needs by gender, although scores on the Teen Issues scale approached significance, with girls reporting higher needs than boys. Youth and FSPs were similar on their reports of needs on 3 scales (Ordinary Day, Nutrition, and Living With Diabetes), but youth reported higher needs than FSPs on Focus and Teen Issues. Controlling for duration of diabetes, these differences between youth and FSPs persisted. In general, learning needs for both youth and FSPs decreased over time. Conclusions: Youth with type 2 diabetes and their FSPs have high levels of ongoing learning needs despite completion of a standard diabetes education program. Continued assessment of learning needs, follow-up education, and behavioral approaches are warranted for these high-risk youth.

331,A systematic review of disability awareness interventions for children and youth,"Purpose: Children‚Äôs lack of knowledge about disability can adversely impact their attitudes toward people with disabilities. The purpose of this study is to review the common elements of effective disability awareness interventions. Methods: A systematic review of disability awareness interventions for children and youth was conducted to assess the effective components of these interventions. Electronic searches were conducted using OVID, CENTRAL, PsychInfo, ERIC, Social Science Citation Index, GreyNET Scopus and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria included (i) an intervention raising awareness about disability, (ii) school-age children with the average age between 5‚Äì19 years old, (iii) at least one measurable outcome focusing on knowledge about disability or attitudes towards and/or acceptance of people with a disability and (iv) published article or grey literature. Results: Of the 1031 articles that were identified in the search, 42 met the criteria to be included in the review. We classified the disability awareness interventions into 5 broad types including (i) social contact, (ii) simulation, (iii) curriculum, (iv) multi-media curriculum and (v) multiple components. Thirty-four studies showed an improvement in attitudes towards and/or acceptance of peers with disabilities. Eight of these studies also demonstrated an improvement in knowledge of people with disabilities. Five of the interventions found no support for improving knowledge about, or acceptance of people with disabilities. Conclusion: Disability awareness interventions can successfully improve children‚Äôs knowledge about and attitudes towards peers with a disability; they should include several different components over multiple sessions. Relevance: These findings are being used to further develop disability awareness interventions to help improve the social inclusion and participation of children with disabilities within mainstream classrooms.

332,Parents‚Äô perceptions of physical activity for their children with visual impairments,"Introduction: Ongoing communication with parents and the acknowledgment of their preferences and expectations are crucial to promote the participation of physical activity by children with visual impairments. Purpose: The study presented here explored parents‚Äô perceptions of physical activity for their children with visual impairments and explored barriers to physical activity. Methods: The 11 parents of children with visual impairments took part in one-on-one semistructured interviews that were transcribed and then analyzed through a constant comparative analysis. Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis of the data: the holistic benefits of physical activity, barriers to physical activity, and solutions to physical activity. Discussion: The results revealed that the parents valued and had high expectations for physical activity for their children; however, they believed that there were multiple barriers to overcome. Implications for practitioners: Adapted physical education and recreational professionals must include parents in planning and implementing physical education and physical activity programs. Infusing information about physical activity and physical education in the professional preparation of teachers of students with visual impairments is also part of this important solution. Last, pre-teaching basic foundational skills for movement and sports is important to ensure the participation of children with visual impairments in physical education and recreational activities later in life.

333,Adequacy of the regular early education classroom environment for students with visual impairment,"This study describes the classroom environment that students with visual impairment typically experience in regular Australian early education. Adequacy of the classroom environment (teacher training and experience, teacher support, parent involvement, adult involvement, inclusive attitude, individualization of the curriculum, physical environment, and vision aids) for students with visual impairment in early regular education was assessed at the start and the end of one year. A total of 20 students with visual impairment (age     M = 5.4 years) attending regular early education participated. In general, teacher-reported curriculum individualization and the physical environment were adequate. However, support provided for staff, teacher training, adult involvement, access to visual aids, and inclusive attitudes were less than adequate. More than 40% of students experienced fewer than four out of nine adequate environmental features. These results indicate that strategies to improve teacher training, support, attitudes, and access to vision aids are needed.

334,A community-based participatory diabetes prevention and management intervention in rural India using community health workers,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a 6-month community-based diabetes prevention and management program in rural Gujarat, India. Methods: A community-based participatory research method was used to plan and tailor the intervention by engaging trained community health workers as change agents to provide lifestyle education, serve as community advocates, and collect data from 1638 rural Indians (81.9% response rate). Ten culturally and linguistically appropriate health education messages were provided in face-to-face individual and group sessions (demonstrations of model meals and cooking techniques). Results: Mean age was 41.9 ¬± 15.9 years. Overall point prevalence of diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, and hypertension were 7.2%, 19.3%, 16.7%, and 28%, respectively, with significant differences between the low socioeconomic status (SES) participants (agricultural workers) and the high SES participants (business community) due to differing diet and activity levels. The intervention significantly reduced blood glucose levels by 5.7 and 14.9 mg/dL for individuals with prediabetes and diabetes, respectively, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 8 mm Hg and 4 mm Hg, respectively, in the overall population. Knowledge of diabetes and cardiovascular disease improved by 50% in the high SES group and doubled in the low SES group; general and abdominal obesity also decreased by ‚â§ 1%. High rates of undiagnosed hypertension (26.1%) were surprising. Among individuals with diabetes, metabolic complications such as diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease were noted. Conclusions: Through collective engagement of the community, participatory programs can serve as a prototype for future prevention and management efforts, which are rare and underutilized in India.

335,Stories about physical education from young people with disabilities,"This article focuses on young people with disabilities and mainstream physical education in England. Within this context there have been unprecedented levels of funding and resources directed towards physical education in order to support more inclusive physical education experiences for all young people, including those with disabilities. Physical education holds a unique place within the school curriculum; it is a subject area where the physicality of students is publicly exposed to others (including teachers, classmates, and support staff). There are likely to be some tensions around physical education and its relationship with students with disabilities. In particular, it is claimed that physical education was conceived of, and continues to be practiced, in a normative way. By drawing on interview data from three young people with disabilities, non-fictional narratives are used to re-present their identities at the intersections of schooling, physical education and disability. These narratives offer insights about how physical education impacts on various aspects of social life including home, family, friends and other school subjects.

336,Inclusion in physical education: A review of literature,"The purpose of this review was to analyse empirical studies on inclusion in physical education (PE) over the past 20 years and then propose recommendations for future research. A systematic process was used to search the literature for this review. First, a total of 75 research-based articles from computerised education databases were included in this review. Second, the publication descriptor data were summarised and analysed according to the geographic distribution, study period, research theme, and research method. Results showed that the number of studies on inclusive PE increased in the past 20 years, and most of these studies were contributed by authors in developed countries. Quantitative methods were the major research method employed in the reviewed studies. Third, we performed a content analysis on the descriptive data and identified three recurring themes from the empirical research. These included: stakeholder (e.g., teachers and parents) perspectives of inclusive PE, effective inclusive practices, and the impacts of inclusion on students with and without disabilities. Of the 75 studies reviewed, 49 (65%) focused on stakeholder perspectives on inclusive PE. The data indicated that stakeholders philosophically support inclusive PE, but numerous concerns and different opinions exist. Only 12 (16%) studies examined the effects of different inclusive strategies. The studies suggested that strategies such as peer tutoring and cooperative learning can provide useful support within inclusive PE. A total of 14 (19%) studies focused on the effect of inclusion on students with and without disabilities. The data indicated that inclusion in PE does not affect the learning outcome of students without disabilities when given support (e.g., using paraprofessionals and adapted PE specialists) or when a solid curriculum is used. However, students with disabilities experienced less motor engagement than their peers without disabilities. The findings of these studies also indicated that although students with disabilities can gain benefits from social interactions in inclusive PE, social isolation of students with disabilities also exists. In conclusion, this review has enhanced our knowledge of the type of studies undertaken in the field of inclusive PE for students with disabilities and some of the outcomes for these students.

This article describes the h…ôli?dx     w/Healthy Hearts Across Generations project, an AIAN-run, tribally based randomized controlled trial (January 2010‚ÄìJune 2012) designed to evaluate a culturally appropriate CVD risk prevention program for AI parents residing in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. At-risk AIAN adults (n = 135) were randomly assigned to either a CVD prevention intervention arm or a comparison arm focusing on increasing family cohesiveness, communication, and connectedness.

338,"The dominance behavioral system and psychopathology: Evidence from self-report, observational, and biological studies","The dominance behavioral system (DBS) can be conceptualized as a biologically based system that guides dominance motivation, dominant and subordinate behavior, and responsivity to perceptions of power and subordination. A growing body of research suggests that problems with the DBS are evident across a broad range of psychopathologies. We begin by describing psychological, social, and biological correlates of the DBS. Extensive research suggests that externalizing disorders, mania proneness, and narcissistic traits are related to heightened dominance motivation and behaviors. Mania and narcissistic traits also appear related to inflated self-perceptions of power. Anxiety and depression are related to subordination and submissiveness, as well as a desire to avoid subordination. Models of the DBS have received support from research with humans and animals; from self-report, observational, and biological methods; and use of naturalistic and experimental paradigms. Limitations of available research include the relative lack of longitudinal studies using multiple measures of the DBS and the absence of relevant studies using diagnosed samples to study narcissistic personality disorder and bipolar disorder. We provide suggestions for future research on the DBS and psychopathology, including investigations of the potential usefulness of DBS in differentiating specific disorder outcomes, the need for more sophisticated biological research, and the value of longitudinal dynamical research. Implications of using the DBS as a tool in clinical assessment and treatment are discussed.

339,Effectiveness of a diabetes education and self management programme (DESMOND) for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus: Three year follow-up of a cluster randomised controlled trial in primary care,"Objective: To measure whether the benefits of a single education and self management structured programme for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus are sustained at three years. Design: Three year follow-up of a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial in primary care, with randomisation at practice level. Setting: 207 general practices in 13 primary care sites in the United Kingdom. Participants: 731 of the 824 participants included in the original trial were eligible for follow-up. Biomedical data were collected on 604 (82.6%) and questionnaire data on 513 (70.1%) participants. Intervention: A structured group education programme for six hours delivered in the community by two trained healthcare professional educators compared with usual care. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was glycated haemoglobin (HbA     1c) levels. The secondary outcomes were blood pressure, weight, blood lipid levels, smoking status, physical activity, quality of life, beliefs about illness, depression, emotional impact of diabetes, and drug use at three years. Results: HbA     1c levels at three years had decreased in both groups. After adjusting for baseline and cluster the difference was not significant (difference ‚àí0.02, 95% confidence interval ‚àí0.22 to 0.17). The groups did not differ for the other biomedical and lifestyle outcomes and drug use. The significant benefits in the intervention group across four out of five health beliefs seen at 12 months were sustained at three years (P < 0.01). Depression scores and quality of life did not differ at three years. Conclusion: A single programme for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus showed no difference in biomedical or lifestyle outcomes at three years although there were sustained improvements in some illness beliefs.

340,Psychometric properties of a motor skill checklist for 3‚Äê to 5‚Äêyear‚Äêold children,"Background Early identification of children with developmental co‚Äêordination disorder is important. Teachers may be very useful in this identification process. The objective of this study was to develop a motor skill checklist (MSC) for 3‚Äê to 5‚Äêyear‚Äêold children to be completed by teachers, and to establish the psychometric properties of this new instrument. Methods An MSC of 28 functional items was constructed in close consideration with clinical experts and teachers. In regular schools, 366 pre‚Äêschool children were rated with the MSC by their teachers (     n = 111). To determine test‚Äìretest reliability, each teacher completed 4 weeks later the MSC again for one randomly selected child. In 22 classes with two teachers sharing the job, both teachers were asked to fill in the questionnaire. A subgroup of children was also tested with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M‚ÄêABC;      n = 122). All teachers were invited to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the MSC. Results The internal consistency of the MSC was high. The test‚Äìretest reliability was good. Inter‚Äêrater reliability was adequate except in the 5‚Äêyear‚Äêold children. There was a strong correlation between the checklist and the M‚ÄêABC, establishing concurrent validity. Most teachers judged the MSC as easy or rather easy to complete. Conclusions The MSC is a reliable, valid and useful instrument to identify and assess young children with motor difficulties.

341,"Motor skills, haptic perception and social abilities in children with mild speech disorders","Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate motor skills, haptic object recognition and social interaction in 5-year-old children with mild specific expressive language impairment (expressive-SLI) and articulation disorder (AD) in comparison of age- and gender matched healthy children. Methods: Twenty nine children (23 boys and 6 girls) with expressive-SLI, 27 children (20 boys and 7 girls) with AD and 30 children (23 boys and 7 girls) with typically developing language as controls participated in our study. The children were examined for manual dexterity, ball skills, static and dynamic balance by M-ABC test, haptic object recognition and for social interaction by questionnaire completed by teachers. Results: Children with mild expressive-SLI demonstrated significantly poorer results in all subtests of motor skills (     p < 0.05), in haptic object recognition and social interaction (     p < 0.01) compared to controls. There were no statistically significant differences (     p > 0.05) in measured parameters between children with AD and controls. Children with expressive-SLI performed considerably poorer compared to AD group in balance subtest (     p < 0.05), and in overall M-ABC test (     p < 0.01). Conclusions: In children with mild expressive-SLI the functional motor performance, haptic perception and social interaction are considerably more affected than in children with AD. Although motor difficulties in speech production are prevalent in AD, it is localised and does not involve children‚Äôs general motor skills, haptic perception or social interaction.

Thirty students completed sociometric nominations and identified a preferred best friend. Additionally, students with disabilities completed a self-competence questionnaire and teachers rated them on social and behavioral dimensions. Students with disabilities showed adequate self-competence and tended to nominate other peers with disabilities on sociometric assessments, but did not select a peer with a disability as a preferred best friend. Teachers ranked students with disabilities higher on behavior problems and rated them lower on classroom adjustment, social integration, and academic performance when compared to non-disabled peers. Although students with disabilities identified preferred friends, they may be at risk for a number of negative socio-behavioral outcomes, suggesting the need for both social skills and academic-related interventions.

344,Role of neuropsychologists in the evaluation and management of sport-related concussion: An inter-organization position statement,"Over the past 20 years, clinical neuropsychologists have been at the forefront of both scientific and clinical initiatives aimed at developing evidence-based approaches to the evaluation and management of sport-related concussion. These efforts have directly impacted current policy on strategies for injury assessment and return-to-play by athletes after concussion. Many states are considering legislation requiring (a) education of athletes, parents, coaches, and school/organization officials on the recognition, evaluation, and management of sport-related concussions; (b) removal from play of any youth athlete that is suspected of having sustained a concussion; and (c) not allowing the student to return to participation until the student is evaluated and cleared for return to participation in writing by an appropriate healthcare professional. It is the official position of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN), American Board of Neuropsychology (ABN), Division 40 (Neuropsychology) of the American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN) that neuropsychologists should be included among the licensed health care professionals authorized to evaluate, clinically manage, and provide return to play clearance for athletes who sustain a sport-related concussion.

345,Self-determination theory and diminished functioning: The role of interpersonal control and psychological need thwarting,"Drawing from self-determination theory, three studies explored the social-environmental conditions that satisfy versus thwart psychological needs and, in turn, affect psychological functioning and well-being or ill-being. In cross-sectional Studies 1 and 2, structural equation modeling analyses supported latent factor models in which need satisfaction was predicted by athletes‚Äô perceptions of autonomy support, and need thwarting was better predicted by coach control. Athletes‚Äô perceptions of need satisfaction predicted positive outcomes associated with sport participation (vitality and positive affect), whereas need thwarting more consistently predicted maladaptive outcomes (disordered eating, burnout, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms). In addition, athletes‚Äô perceptions of psychological need thwarting were significantly associated with perturbed physiological arousal (elevated levels of secretory immunoglobulin A) prior to training. The final study involved the completion of a diary and supported the relations observed in the cross-sectional studies at a daily level. These findings have important implications for the operationalization and measurement of interpersonal styles and psychological needs.

346,Postural responses to a suprapostural visual task among children with and without developmental coordination disorder,"We sought to determine the effects of varying the perceptual demands of a suprapostural visual task on the postural activity of children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), and typically developing children (TDC). Sixty-four (32 per group) children aged between 9 and 10 years participated. In a within-participants design, each child performed a signal detection task at two levels of difficulty, low (LD) and high difficulty (HD). During performance of the signal detection tasks we recorded positional variability of the head and torso using a magnetic tracking system. We found that task difficulty had a greater effect on task performance among the TDC group than among children with DCD. Overall positional variability was greater the DCD group than in the TDC group. In the TDC group, positional variability was reduced during performance of the HD task, relative to sway during performance of the LD task. In the DCD group, positional variability was greater during performance of the HD task than during performance of the LD task. In children, DCD may reduce the strength of functional integration of postural activity with the demands of suprapostural visual tasks.

347,Prevalence of eating disorder risk and body image distortion among National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I varsity equestrian athletes,"Context: Participation in appearance-based sports, particularly at the collegiate level, may place additional pressures on female athletes to be thin, which may increase the likelihood of their resorting to drastic weight control measures, such as disordered eating behaviors. Objectives: (1) To estimate the prevalence and sources of eating disorder risk classification by academic status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior) and riding discipline (English and Western), (2) to examine riding style and academic status variations in body mass index (BMI) and silhouette type, and (3) to examine these variations across eating disorder risk classification type (eg, body image disturbances). Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Seven universities throughout the United States. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 138 participants volunteered (mean age = 19.88 ¬± 1.29 years). They represented 2 equestrian disciplines: English riding (n = 91) and Western riding (n = 47). Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants self-reported menstrual cycle history, height, and weight. We screened for eating disorder risk behaviors with the Eating Attitudes Test and for body disturbance with sex-specific BMI silhouettes. Results: Based on the Eating Attitudes Test, estimated eating disorder prevalence was 42.0% in the total sample, 38.5% among English riders, and 48.9% among Western riders. No BMI or silhouette differences were found across academic status or discipline in disordered eating risk. Overall, participants perceived their body images as significantly larger than their actual physical sizes (self-reported BMI) and wanted to be significantly smaller in both normal clothing and competitive uniforms. Conclusions: Disordered eating risk prevalence among equestrian athletes was similar to that reported in other aesthetic sports and lower than that in nonaesthetic sports. Athletic trainers working with these athletes should be sensitive to these risks and refer athletes as needed to clinicians knowledgeable about disordered eating. Professionals working with this population should avoid making negative comments about physical size and appearance.

348,What should we include in a cultural competence curriculum? An emerging formative evaluation process to foster curriculum development,"Purpose: To identify, prioritize, and organize components of a cultural competence curriculum to address disparities in cardiovascular disease. Method: In 2006, four separate nominal group technique sessions were conducted with medical students, residents, community physicians, and academic physicians to generate and prioritize a list of concepts (i.e., ideas) to include in a curriculum. Afterward, 45 educators and researchers organized and prioritized the concepts using a card-sorting exercise. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and hierarchical cluster analysis produced homogeneous groupings of related concepts and generated a cognitive map. The main outcome measures were the number of cultural competence concepts, their relative ranks, and the cognitive map. Results: Thirty participants generated 61 concepts; 29 were identified by at least two participants. The cognitive map organized concepts into four clusters, interpreted as (1) patient's cultural background (e.g., information on cultures, habits, values), (2) provider and health care (e.g., clinical skills, awareness of one's bias, patient centeredness, professionalism), communication skills (e.g., history, stereotype avoidance, health disparities epidemiology), (3) cross-culture (e.g., idiomatic expressions, examples of effective communication), and (4) resources to manage cultural diversity (e.g., translator guides, instructions, community resources). The MDS two-dimensional solution demonstrated a good fit (stress = 0.07;     R¬≤ = 0.97). Conclusions: A novel, combined approach allowed stakeholders' inputs to identify and cognitively organize critical domains used to guide development of a cultural competence curriculum. Educators may use this approach to develop and organize educational content for their target audiences, especially in ill-defined areas like cultural competence.

349,Coming of age with sickle cell disease and the role of patient as teacher,"Objective: Patients with chronic conditions are encouraged to optimize their health care experience by educating themselves regarding their condition and care. This study sought to explore the ways in which adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) educate others about their condition and the meanings they give to their experiences with health care professionals. Methods: Seventeen individuals with SCD participated in in-depth interviews regarding their experiences as an individual with SCD seeking health care. Results: Our analysis revealed participants' belief in the ignorance concerning SCD by others, including health care professionals. Additionally, the participants suggested significant consequences of such a lack of knowledge and the strategies they used to overcome this barrier‚Äîprimarily the development of the identity of patient-as-teacher. Conclusion: Sickle cell patients in general and adolescent sickle cell patients in particular are often underestimated and discounted as they relate the details of their pain. This study demonstrates that these participants are not only keepers of knowledge but also must work to educate authority figures and peers in their lives to ensure they are properly cared for and that those around them understand their disease.

350,Immediate and follow-up effects of a brief disability curriculum on disability knowledge and attitudes of PM&R residents: A comparison group trial,"Background: Humanistic attitudes are essential in physicians and therefore supporting them is a key component in graduate medical education (GME). The importance of a physician‚Äôs attitude toward people with disability is especially relevant within the rehabilitation discipline, as prevailing attitudes and misconceptions can be potential barriers to successful diagnosis and treatment. Aim: This study was designed to examine the relationship between participation in a brief disability sensitivity training and knowledge of disability and attitudes of physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) residents toward people with disability. Methods: A daylong training for residents consisted of lectures and a panel presentation that covered (1) disability facts, (2) personal stories of people with disabilities, and (3) medical evaluation of disability. The presentations were followed by a simulation experience where resident pairs (one assigned to a wheel chair, the other a ""caretaker"") performed various tasks. This was followed by a group discussion of their experience. Three instruments were administered prior to the training: (1) a brief demographic questionnaire, (2) 30 multiple choice questions measuring various aspects of knowledge about disability, and (3) the Scale of Attitudes toward Disabled Persons, Form R (SADP). After the training experience, the knowledge instrument and the SADP were re-administered along with a series of items to measure various aspects of students‚Äô satisfaction with the training. The three instruments described were re-administered 3 months post-training. Results: There was significant immediate gain in both the disability knowledge and the attitude scores among trainees as compared to a control group of physiatry residents in standard medical training. Knowledge gains of the disability sensitivity training group did not persist, but attitude toward disability gains remained at the 3 months follow up. Conclusion: After a brief curriculum in disability knowledge and sensitivity for PM&R physicians in training, there was a short-term improvement in disability knowledge and an improvement in disability attitudes sustained at 3 months.

351,Description of an academic community partnership lifestyle program for lower income minority adults at risk for diabetes,"Purpose: Translating strategies and approaches from the successful clinically based Diabetes Prevention Program‚Äôs lifestyle intervention to community settings is a key next step. This article describes a lifestyle program developed in partnership by researchers at a major university and public health professionals at a local health department. Methods: The Live Well, Be Well (LWBW) program was designed to meet the needs of lower income, minority, and low-literacy adults at risk for diabetes. It was adapted from interventions with demonstrated efficacy and delivered in Spanish and English by health department staff. The program consisted of a 6-month active phase and a 6-month maintenance phase and was primarily telephone based, with one in-person planning session and several group workshops. In-person and group sessions were held in convenient community-based settings. Counselors provided education and skills training to modify diet and increase physical activity. Self-selected and attainable goal-setting and action plans were emphasized to enhance self-efficacy. LWBW is the intervention component of a randomized trial with primary outcomes of fasting glucose, weight, and other clinical measures. Conclusions: The program provides a unique translational model for implementing diabetes risk reduction programs for underserved populations. Individually tailored and nonprescriptive, it utilized existing health department infrastructure, focused on telephone counseling, used culturally appropriate, low-literacy materials, and was delivered in local, community-based facilities.

352,Concurrent and construct validation of the short form of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency and the Movement-ABC when administered under field conditions: Implications for screening,"Rationale: Among the most widely used instruments to assess developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) in children are the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP) and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC). However, there is little research on agreement between these tests, when administered to children in field-based settings by trained non-clinicians. Method: Ten of 75 schools participating in a larger study were randomly selected. All children in grade 4 (     n = 340) in each of these schools were assessed at the same time using both the BOTMP-SF and the M-ABC in May of 2005. The order of tests was balanced, with an average gap in time between tests of 10‚Äì15 min. All tests were administered by trained research assistants. Results: The correlation between tests was moderate (     r = 0.50,      P < 0.01). Kappas were low at the fifth (     k = 0.19) and 15th (     k = 0.29) percentile cut-points, which are generally used to identify cases of DCD. Re-analysis using the relative improvement over chance (RIOC) statistic, however, revealed slightly better agreement at both cut-points (fifth percentile, RIOC = 0.29; 15th percentile, RIOC = 0.47). Children who scored as probable for DCD on both motor tests, as well as on only the BOTMP-SF, had higher body mass index, poorer physical fitness and lower levels of teacher-reported physical ability than those positive for DCD on the M-ABC only or those who scored negatively on both tests. Discussion: In general, the agreement between tests, even after adjustment for RIOC, was poor. Children identified with poor motor competence by both tests or by the BOTMP-SF only are at particular risk for poor physical fitness, overweight/obesity and physical inactivity. It appears that each assessment measures different dimensions of motor ability but that under field-based conditions the M-ABC may be less useful when applied by non-clinicians.

353,Efficiency of the home parental programme in visual motor home activity among first-grade children,"Background The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of the home parental programme (HPP) in improving children's visual motor skills, and to assess parent satisfaction with the programme.     Methods Forty-five children and their parents participated in the study: 23 children and their parents in the study group (children receiving consultation in the classroom and whose parents participated in the HPP) and 22 children and their parents in the control group (children receiving consultation in the classroom only). All children were recruited based on their scores on the Visual Motor Integration test or upon teacher referral. The Developmental Test of Visual Perception-2 administered before and after intervention served as an outcome measure. HPP lasted approximately 12 weeks and included relevant visual motor activities carried out at home by the parents with their children.      Results The study failed to prove that HPP improved children's visual motor skills beyond the other service delivery methods used in the present study.      Conclusions Parent satisfaction was significantly higher among those who participated in the HPP. Parents showed high compliance with the friendly programme despite their low socio-economic status.

354,Using positive relationships to engage the disengaged: An educational psychologist-initiated project involving professional sports input to a pupil referral unit,"Increasingly large numbers of students who experience emotional, social and behavioural difficulties are subject to exclusion from mainstream schools and consequently receive their education in pupil referral units (PRUs). Common perceptions of PRUs are that they are places where high levels of conflict and relatively few constructive relationships occur. In the regular educational psychologist input to an inner city secondary PRU, ideas from a range of psychological models and theories including humanist psychology, personal construct psychology, solution-focused brief therapy and systemic theory were used to highlight some exceptions to these social difficulties. More constructive social interaction and reduced levels of conflict were observed when students engaged in sports activities together and, therefore, the professional coaching input of a local premiership football club's (XFC's) 'Sport in the Community' programme (SiC) was negotiated and an initial eight-week evaluation project constructed. This paper considers the importance of relationships within the rationale, planning, implementation and evaluation of the project which developed. One of the central aims of this project was to utilise and support the development of more positive relationships between the pupils, the PRU staff and the professional sports coaches in order to engage the pupils more constructively in their educational experience and to support their social and emotional development and their learning in general. The consistently positive feedback from the students, PRU staff and coaches, which emphasised the importance of the relational aspects of the project is considered in relation to further possible interventions and research undertaken by applied psychologists working in education.

355,Access to music education: Nebraska Band Directors' experiences and attitudes regarding students with physical disabilities,"Students with physical disabilities frequently are excluded from participation in instrumental music programs, yet the obstacles band directors face that preclude integration of these students have not been documented systematically. The primary purpose of this study was to measure Nebraska High School band directors' concerns regarding the integration of students with physical disabilities into their band programs. Results of a survey of 221 Nebraska high school music programs suggested that awareness of options for ways to include students with physical disabilities, availability of adapted instruments, and the cost of acquiring such instruments are among band directors' primary concerns. Conclusions drawn from this survey serve as evidence that there is a need for adapted instruments and suggest that integration of students with disabilities and without disabilities in band would provide benefits for all.

356,Psychopathological manifestations of children with intellectual disabilities according to their cognitive and adaptive behavior profile,"Children with intellectual disabilities show deficits in cognitive abilities and adaptive behavior which increase the risk of psychopathological disorders. This exploratory study aims at delineating profiles of children based on their cognitive functioning and adaptive behaviors, and to compare them on psychopathological manifestations. A cognitive assessment and an evaluation of adaptive behaviors are conducted with 52 school-age children receiving services from a rehabilitation center for people with intellectual disabilities. Adaptive behaviors are evaluated by a special educator and a questionnaire concerning psychopathology is filled out by a parent and a teacher. Cluster analyses highlight three profiles among children: Performing, Uncooperative and Non-performing. They differ on cognitive functions, collaboration and in terms of practical abilities of adaptive behaviors. Chi-square tests show significant differences in social competences, but not in problematic behaviors, according to the viewpoint of parents and teachers. Potential explanations are provided to understand the absence of significant differences in problematic behaviors between the three profiles.

357,What can I learn from this interaction? A qualitative analysis of medical student self-reflection and learning in a standardized patient exercise about disability,"Patients with disabilities receive fewer health services than the general population, yet they have greater health needs. Similarly, physicians report limited training in disability. The current project examines medical students' learning about disability in a project using individuals with disabilities as medical educators. Family medicine clerkship students (     N = 138) across an academic year were videotaped during interviews with standardized patient educators with disabilities and during feedback sessions following the interactions. Qualitative analysis of feedback transcripts identifies three primary areas of integrating learning, reflective practice, and disability: (1) learning how disability impacts the treatment plan, (2) self-reflection and recognizing attitudes about disability, and (3) learning about the practice of medicine generally from the disability exercise. Themes are identified within each of the primary learning areas. Medical student reflection provides evidence of learning to connect disability with pain, everyday life, and treatment. Medical students learned to recognize patients' expertise in their own condition and in health care navigation. Medical students also examined how their language implies attitude. The current investigation provided evidence of the ways examining disability can serve as a cornerstone for building relationship-centered patient care and encouraging reflective practice overall.

358,Effect of a physical education teacher's disability on high school pupils' learning and perceptions of teacher competence,"Background: To date, most of the work done by those who do research in adapted sport pedagogy (a sub-discipline of sport pedagogy focused on modified forms of physical education that address the needs of pupils with disabilities) has focused on the experience of pupils with disabilities and relatively little work has examined the difficulties faced by physical education teachers who themselves have disabilities and teach 'able-bodied' pupils. Previous research, conducted in both general education and sport pedagogy settings, indicated that a teacher's attire, physical appearance, and perceived competence influenced pupils' perceptions of the teacher's ability to teach and the degree to which they learned the subject matter. These findings suggest that physical education teachers who have a disability might be in for a particularly difficult time in terms of fighting negative perceptions of their competence and their ability to promote learning among their pupils. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a physical education teacher's disability on high school pupils' learning and perceptions of the teacher's competence. Participants and setting: Participants were 109 (58 boys, 51 girls) 10th and 11th grade pupils (i.e., years 10 to 13 in British terms) enrolled at two high schools situated in the southeastern United States. The pupils ranged from 14 to 18 years in age and were mainly from middle socio-economic status neighborhoods. Research design: A positivistic research design, with quantitative research methods and techniques, was used during this study aimed at determining pupils' learning and perceptions of teacher competence. Data collection: Pupils were randomly assigned to view one of two videotaped swimming lessons. Both lessons were identical with one exception. In the first lesson, the teacher taught as an able-bodied teacher (ABL), while in the second she taught from a wheelchair (WCL) giving the impression that she had a physical disability. Directly following the viewing of their assigned lesson, pupils completed an examination on lesson content and a questionnaire asking them about their perceptions of the teacher. Data analysis: Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) from the content examination and perception questionnaire were computed for those pupils who watched the WCL and those who observed the ABL. The data were also analyzed using various inferential statistical tests (i.e. 2 √ó 2 repeated measures analysis of variance, paired comparison t-tests, and independent t-tests). Findings: Results indicate that pupils who viewed the ABL scored significantly higher on the technique section of the examination than pupils who watched the WCL. There were no significant differences between the perception scores of those pupils who viewed the WCL and the ABL. Conclusions: While the high school pupils in this study had an equally high regard for the teacher regardless of her apparent physical state, they learned less from her about swimming techniques when she appeared to have a disability than when she was able-bodied. Results of this study suggest that as pupils progress through their schooling, their beliefs about physical education teachers with disabilities gradually change for the worse because they are socialized into believing that sport, physical activity, and physical education are for what appear to be whole and fit bodies.

360,Providers‚Äô experiences with young people‚Äôs cognitive representations and emotions related to the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections,"Objective: The Common Sense Model (CSM) was used as the organizing framework to examine providers‚Äô experiences with young people‚Äôs cognitive representations and emotions related to the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study was conducted to develop insights into potential avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of STI education and counseling for young people. Design: This was a qualitative investigation using semi-structured focus group interviews. Sample: The 5 focus groups were comprised of 30 providers of STI education and counseling: public health nurses, peer educators, and nurse practitioners. Measurement: Content of transcribed focus group interviews was coded using a predetermined coding scheme based on the five dimensions of representational beliefs and emotions defined by the CSM. Results: The providers identified that young people hold a number of STI misconceptions within each dimensions of the CSM. Anger and embarrassment about STIs are common emotions experienced by young people. Conclusions: This investigation suggests that providers are able to elicit and identify STI-related misconceptions held by young people, and that the CSM model is a useful classification method. Identifying misconceptions could be useful in developing tailored STI education and counseling interventions by public health nurses.

361,"Screening for dyslexia, dyspraxia and Meares-Irlen syndrome in higher education","This study reports a comparison of screening tests for dyslexia, dyspraxia and Meares-Irlen (M-I) syndrome in a Higher Education setting, the University of Worcester. Using a sample of 74 volunteer students, we compared the current tutor-delivered battery of 15 subtests with a computerized test, the Lucid Adult Dyslexia Screening test (LADS), and both of these with data on assessment outcomes. The sensitivity of this tutor battery was higher than LADS in predicting dyslexia, dyspraxia or M-I syndrome (91% compared with 66%) and its specificity was lower (79% compared with 90%). Stepwise logistic regression on these tests was used to identify a better performing subset of tests, when combined with a change in practice for M-I syndrome screening. This syndrome itself proved to be a powerful discriminator for dyslexia and/or dyspraxia, and we therefore recommend it as the first stage in a two-stage screening process. The specificity and sensitivity of the new battery, the second part of which comprises LADS plus four of the original tutor delivered subtests, provided the best overall performance: 94% sensitivity and 92% specificity. We anticipate that the new two-part screening process would not take longer to complete.

362,Assistance to pupils with physical disabilities in regular schools: Promoting inclusion or creating dependency?,"Drawing on the perspectives of pupils with physical disabilities, their parents and teachers, this study explored the adult support provided to pupils with physical disabilities in regular schools. Data were collected through observations at schools and qualitative interviews. In all, 49 individuals participated in this study: 14 pupils with physical disabilities, 17 parents, and 18 teachers. Six themes emerged that characterised the provision of assistance: (1) roles and responsibilities; (2) quantity and content of support (3) proximity to the pupil, (4) school priorities, (5) independence and autonomy of the child; and (6) the relationship between the teacher and the assistant. An over-reliance on adult support was found for some pupils and contexts, while this support appeared to be under-utilised or ineffectively delivered in other situations. Lack of modifications of the traditional curriculum, teacher instructions, and educational activities increased the pupils' need for adult support in school. While it is acknowledged that teacher assistants can make valuable contributions in promoting participation and learning among pupils with disabilities, it is argued that the constant presence of an assistant can result in limited use of the children's strengths and may possibly create unnecessary or unhealthy dependencies. The findings signify that the education system must align with important stakeholders - the pupils, their parents, and external support services - to identify alternative ways to promote participation and learning of pupils with disabilities in regular schools.

363,A case of bullying: Bringing together the disciplines,"Randy is a 9-year-old boy who was frequently bullied at school. The bullying stemmed from various issues, including his weight and an identified learning disability. His parents and teachers expressed concern about his low self-esteem and inability to develop and maintain friendships. Upon hearing of the situation, the school social worker, Ms. Davis, facilitated a team meeting to develop an intervention plan for Randy. Using a multidisciplinary approach, Ms. Davis invited Randy's general education teacher, special education teacher, physical education teacher, school counselor, and campus administrator to take part in the meeting. The school social worker, using the multidisciplinary approach, can assist the school system in reducing the incidents by creating a strengths-based perspective and team approach in resolving issues by facilitating team member support for one another, acting as a consultant by sharing feedback, and disseminating valuable resources and information among the various disciplines.

364,Nutrition care for adult cardiac patients: Australian general practitioners' perceptions of their roles,"Background: Australia has implemented systematic managed care for patients with chronic disease. Little is known about how GPs perceive their nutrition care role in this system. Objective: To examine GPs‚Äô perceptions of their roles in the nutrition care of cardiac patients and to identify factors that influence their role. Methods: Multi-methods research design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample (n = 30) GPs Victoria, Australia. The resulting narratives were used to develop a quantitative questionnaire to survey a random sample of GPs. Principal components analysis was conducted to reduce the role items to a small number of underlying dimensions. The association between roles and demographic variables were examined using stepwise multiple regressions. Results: In all, 248 GPs (30% response) participated. Three main roles were established: Influencing, Coordinating and Nutrition Educator role. Together, the roles explained 54% of the total variance. Demographic variables were not associated with these roles. The majority (mean = 88%) endorsed the items which loaded on to the Influencing and Coordinating (mean = 49%) roles. Short consultation time, use of prescribed medications and perception of patient attendance at cardiac rehabilitation reduced the priority for nutrition education. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of developing more effective team care arrangements for patients with chronic disease and working with the medical education colleges to develop education resources for doctors that include an explanation of the non-pharmaceutical as well as the pharmaceutical treatment for each chronic disease condition.

365,Participation in college sports and protection from sexual victimization,"Some sport sociologists have argued that sport is a male-dominated institution and sexist culture in which female athletes experience various forms of discrimination, including sexual victimization from coaches and male athletes. Previous research does indicate that female athletes suffer higher rates of sexual victimization from authority figures in sport than their non-athletic counterparts in education and the workplace, although many studies fail to differentiate adequately between sexual harassment, sexual abuse, sexual assault, and other descriptions that imply variations in the severity of victimization. Researchers have also speculated that athletic participation can protect female athletes from sexual victimization through a variety of social-psychological mechanisms such as team membership, physical strength, and self-confidence. This paper reports on the first descriptive analysis to test the ""sport protection hypothesis"" among both female and male athletes, using cross-tabulation secondary analyses of data from the National College Health Risk Behavior Survey, conducted in 1995 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (N = 4,814). United States college students of traditional undergraduate age (18-24) were included in the sample (N = 2,903). Limited support for the protection hypothesis was found. Student athletes were significantly less likely to report sexual victimization during their late high school and early college years than their non-athletic counterparts. A gender gap in the pattern of reported sexual victimization also appeared between males and females across all student age groups, with females reporting more sexual victimization than males. However, no significant gender gap was found among athletes. The results are discussed in relation to student gender, athletic status, and concomitant health benefits and also to debates about agency and resilience among athletes (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)      (Source: journal abstract)",Sports;3230:Behavior Disorders & Antisocial Behavior;3720:Sports;US;article;College Athletes;Health Behavior;Victimization;Sexual Abuse;Risk Assessment;Athletic Participation;Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs);Adulthood (18 yrs & older);Female;Male;Human;Quantitative Study;Empirical Study;victimization;health risk behavior;sexual victimization;college sports;athletic participation,"Fasting, Kari and Brackenridge, Celia H. and Miller, Kathleen E. and Sabo, Don",2008.0,0,360
366,Predictive validity and early predictors of peer-victimization trajectories in preschool,"Context: From the time of school entry, chronic levels of victimization by one's peers predict a multitude of psychiatric and physical health problems. However, developmental trajectories of peer victimization, from the time children first begin to socially interact, are not currently known nor are early familial or child predictors. Objectives: To describe preschool trajectories of peer victimization, assess continuity of preschool victimization after school entry, and examine early child- and family level predictors of preschool trajectories of victimization. Design: A longitudinal, large-scale, multiple-informant, population-based study. Setting: Qu√©bec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. Participants: One thousand nine hundred seventy children (51% boys). Main Outcome Measures: Developmental trajectories were described using mothers' reports of peer victimization at 4 times from 3‚Öì to 6¬π‚ÅÑ‚ÇÜ years of age. In first grade (mean age, 7.2 years), teacher and child reports of peer victimization were collected. Family-level predictors, mostly at age 17 months, included measurements of family adversity (insufficient income [when the infant was aged 5 months], single-parent family, low education, or teenaged mother) and harsh, reactive parenting. Child-level predictors at age 17 months were the mother's ratings of physical aggression, hyperactivity, and emotional problems. Results: Three preschool trajectories of peer victimization were identified (low/increasing, moderate/increasing, and high/chronic). In first grade, children following high/chronic and moderate/increasing preschool trajectories were highest in teacher- and child-rated peer victimization. High levels of harsh, reactive parenting predicted high/chronic peer victimization over and above other child- and family-level variables. Insufficient parent income and child physical aggression predicted the high/chronic and moderate/increasing peer-victimization trajectories. Conclusions: Early childhood preventive interventions should target parenting skills and child behaviors, particularly within families with insufficient income. Together, these risks confer a heightened likelihood for continued peer victimization as rated by mothers, teachers, and the children themselves.

367,Survey of attitudes and behaviors toward alcohol and other drug use in allied health and physician assistant students,"Attitudes and behaviors toward alcohol and other drug (AOD) use were assessed among a subgroup of allied health (AH) and physician assistant (PA) students within two university-based health professions educational institutions in a midwestern state in 1999. AH/PA student response was 423 (77.5%); this included occupational therapy (     n = 81; 60.4%), physical therapy [PT] (     n = 222; 98.7%), PA (     n = 68; 85.0%), and other AH programs (     n = 52; 48.1%). In this AH/PA group, a family history of alcohol-related problems was reported by 40.1% and drug-related problems by 11.3%, with 42.5% of respondents reporting one or both.

368,fMRI of intrasubject variability in ADHD: Anomalous premotor activity with prefrontal compensation,"Objective: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) consistently display increased intrasubject variability (ISV) in response time across varying tasks, signifying inefficiency of response preparation compared to typically developing (TD) children. Children with ADHD also demonstrate impaired response inhibition; inhibitory deficits correlate with ISV, suggesting that similar brain circuits may underlie both processes. To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying increased ISV and inhibitory deficits in children with ADHD, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine the neural correlates of ISV during Go/No-go task performance. Method: Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study 25 children with ADHD and 25 TD children ages 8 to 13 years performing a simplified Go/No-go task. Brain-behavior correlations were examined between functional magnetic resonance imaging activation and ISV within and between groups. Results: For TD children, increased rostral supplementary motor area (pre-supplementary motor area) activation during No-go events was associated with less ISV, whereas the reverse was true for children with ADHD for whom increased pre-supplementary motor area activation was associated with more ISV. In contrast, children with ADHD with less ISV showed greater prefrontal activation, whereas TD children with more prefrontal activation demonstrated more ISV. Conclusions: These findings add to evidence that dysfunction of premotor systems may contribute to increased variability and impaired response inhibition in children with ADHD and that compensatory strategies eliciting increased cognitive control may improve function. However, recruitment of prefrontal resources as a compensatory mechanism for motor task performance may preclude the use of those prefrontal resources for higher order, more novel executive functions with which children with ADHD often struggle.

369,Bodysense: An evaluation of a positive body image intervention on sport climate for female athletes,"The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a selective prevention program designed to reduce pressures to be thin in sport, and to promote positive body image and eating behaviors in young female athletes. Participants were competitive female gymnasts (aged 11 to 18 years), parents, and coaches from 7 gymnastic clubs across Ontario, Canada. Four of the seven clubs were randomized to receive the 3-month intervention program (IG) aimed at increasing awareness and positive climate change of body image pressures for athletes in their clubs. Three clubs were randomized to the control group (CG). A total of 62 female gymnasts (IG n = 31; CG n = 31) completed self-report questionnaires examining perceptions of pressure to be thin within their sports clubs, self-efficacy over dieting pressures, awareness and internalization of societal pressure to be thin, body esteem, and eating attitudes and behaviours before and following the intervention. A total of 32 mothers (IG n = 24; CG n = 8) completed measures examining their perceptions of their daughter's pressure to be thin, awareness and internalization of societal pressures to be thin, daughter's self-efficacy over dieting pressures, in addition to mothers' beliefs regarding thinness and success for women in society, before and following the intervention. The findings revealed that participation in the BodySense program resulted in athletes perceiving a reduction in pressure from their sports clubs to be thin, though no changes were found in body esteem, the EAT, or the SATAQ. No significant change was observed over time on mothers' measures. The role of climate change for prevention of eating disorders in athletes is discussed.

370,School impairment in adolescents with chronic pain,"The purpose of this study was to assess and describe school functioning among adolescents presenting for evaluation in a tertiary care pediatric chronic pain clinic. Adolescents (n = 220, aged 12-17) and their parents participated in the study, providing self-reported data on school attendance, school performance, and perceived academic competence. Participants' schools provided official attendance records, descriptions of accommodations implemented to address the student's pain problems in the school setting, and teacher ratings of academic competence. Results show that many adolescents with chronic pain miss a significant amount of school, experience a decline in grades, and perceive pain to interfere with their school success. Various indicators of school impairment are highly intercorrelated, suggesting that impairment or success in 1 domain is typically associated with similar patterns in other domains of school functioning. However, as a group, adolescents with pain are viewed by themselves and their teachers as academically competent. Strong correlations emerged between different reporters of school functioning indicators such as attendance, suggesting that reliance on parent or adolescent reporting may be sufficient when assessing these domains. Findings underscore the importance of broadly assessing school functioning in adolescents with chronic pain. Perspective: This study extends our understanding of school functioning among adolescents with chronic pain. It highlights the need to assess both school attendance and performance in this population as well as how schools respond to pain problems. Devising summary indicators of school impairment can be useful in both clinical and research contexts.

371,Effectiveness of the diabetes education and self management for ongoing and newly diagnosed (DESMOND) programme for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: Cluster randomised controlled trial,"Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a structured group education programme on biomedical, psychosocial, and lifestyle measures in people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Design: Multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial in primary care with randomisation at practice level. Setting: 207 general practices in 13 primary care sites in the United Kingdom. Participants: 824 adults (55% men, mean age 59.5 years). Intervention: A structured group education programme for six hours delivered in the community by two trained healthcare professional educators compared with usual care. Main outcome measures: Haemoglobin A     1c levels, blood pressure, weight, blood lipid levels, smoking status, physical activity, quality of life, beliefs about illness, depression, and emotional impact of diabetes at baseline and up to 12 months. Main results: Haemoglobin A     1c levels at 12 months had decreased by 1.49% in the intervention group compared with 1.21% in the control group. After adjusting for baseline and cluster, the difference was not significant: 0.05% (95% confidence interval -0.10% to 0.20%). The intervention group showed a greater weight loss: -2.98 kg (95% confidence interval -3.54 to -2.41) compared with 1.86 kg (-2.44 to -1.28), P=0.027 at 12 months. The odds of not smoking were 3.56 (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 11.45), P=0.033 higher in the intervention group at 12 months. The intervention group showed significantly greater changes in illness belief scores (P=0.001); directions of change were positive indicating greater understanding of diabetes. The intervention group had a lower depression score at 12 months: mean difference was -0.50 (95% confidence interval -0.96 to -0.04); P=0.032. A positive association was found between change in perceived personal responsibility and weight loss at 12 months (Œ≤=0.12; P=0.008). Conclusion: A structured group education programme for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes resulted in greater improvements in weight loss and smoking cessation and positive improvements in beliefs about illness but no difference in haemoglobin A     1c levels up to 12 months after diagnosis.

372,Participation in daily life of children with asthma,"Asthma can have a negative effect on psychological and social well-being in childhood. Sports participation, school attendance, and quality of life are important issues for children with asthma and their parents. However, a structural evaluation of these factors is not always incorporated in the routine medical approach of children with asthma. Moreover, goals in asthma treatment, such as minimal symptoms and normal activity levels, are achieved in a minority of children. This review describes determinants that are important for the well-being of children with asthma and their parents. Besides the control of symptoms, factors such as sports participation, socializing in peer groups, school attendance, and quality of life must be considered. These issues are relevant when evaluating the management of children and adolescents with asthma. A multidisciplinary evaluation by a pediatrician, school nurse, gym teacher, and psychologist might contribute to an important decrease in the impact of asthma on daily life.

373,"Asthma care issues in kindergarten teachers: An evaluation on knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of asthma","As frequently there is no school nurse in a kindergarten setting, teachers receiving non-medical training take the primary roles of symptom assessment and management of young children with asthma. This article presents the knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of asthma in kindergarten teachers in Taiwan. A total valid sample of 460 teachers was recruited from 70 kindergartens. Results showed most teachers understood the basic facts about asthma rather than the complex issues; they demonstrated positive attitudes toward having asthmatic children in class. Regarding self-efficacy, teachers lacked confidence in their ability to manage asthma attacks. Teachers‚Äô asthma knowledge showed a significant positive correlation with attitude (r = 0.27,     p < 0.001) and self-efficacy knowledge (r = 0.23,      p < 0.001). Given the need to help kindergarten teachers take care of children with asthma, the implications of kindergarten teachers‚Äô in-service education and training to asthma care are also discussed.

374,The role of family in the development of social skills in children with physical disabilities,"This study aims to identify the family characteristics that promote the development of social skills in children with physical disabilities. Parents and teachers completed a range of questionnaires in an Australia-wide study of 212 parents of children (5-12 years of age) with physical disabilities who attend mainstream schools. The relationships between parental attitudes, parental involvement, family relationships, teachers' opinions, disability severity, and children's social skills were tested using structural equation modelling. The results of this study show the importance of family characteristics for the development of social skills in children with physical disabilities. A strong link was found between aspects of healthy family relationships, especially high levels of parental involvement with schooling, and greater social skills development in children. In short, families with highly cohesive, idealised, and democratic family styles strongly influence children's social skills by providing a safe and sound foundation for children to explore their social environment. Practical implications arising from this study are discussed.

375,The relationship between relative weight and school attendance among elementary schoolchildren,"Objective: To determine the relationship between relative weight and school attendance among elementary schoolchildren. Research Methods and Procedures: A total of 1069 fourth to sixth graders from nine elementary schools in the inner city of Philadelphia, PA, were part of an ongoing randomized control trial to assess prevention strategies for obesity. The mean rate of students eligible for free/reduced meals was 82.9 ¬± 11.5%. Weight was measured in the second semester of the academic year. Absentee data for the entire academic year were recorded by homeroom teachers. Participants were classified into relative weight categories described by the Institute of Medicine: underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese. Results: ANOVA showed that overweight children were absent significantly more than normal-weight children (12.2 ¬± 11.7 days vs.10.1 ¬± 10.5 days) (p < 0.05). Linear regression showed that the obese category remained a significant contributor to the number of days absent even after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and gender. Discussion: These data suggest that in addition to the medical and psychosocial consequences of being overweight, heavier children have greater risk for school absenteeism than their normal-weight peers. As the rate of childhood obesity increases, parallel increases in school absenteeism should be expected.

376,The self-concept of children and adolescents with neurofibromatosis type 1,"Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder associated with cognitive deficits, learning problems, medical complications and cosmetic disfigurement. Despite the wide-ranging impact of NF1, very few studies have examined the psychosocial adjustment of individuals with NF1, and in particular, self-concept. The aims of this study were threefold: (i) to examine the self-concept of children and adolescents with NF1; (ii) to compare the self-concept of children with NF1 (NF1 only), children with NF1 and learning difficulties [NF1 + LA (low achievement)], and children with NF1 and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (NF1 + ADHD); and (iii) to examine the academic self-concept of these three groups relative to objective criteria - academic achievement and teacher ratings of academic competence. Methods: Measures of self-concept, academic achievement and intelligence were administered to 49 children and 26 adolescents with NF1. Parents and teachers completed behavioural rating scales. Results: The majority of children and adolescents with NF1 reported positive global self-concept, with some exceptions on specific domains. Children and adolescents with NF1 reported significantly poorer self-concept for physical abilities. Adolescents also reported significantly poorer self-concept for mathematics and general self when compared with normative mean values. Clinical severity of NF1 was not a significant predictor of self-concept for physical appearance or physical abilities. Despite a significant difference between NF1 only, NF1 + LA and NF1 + ADHD groups on measures of academic achievement and teacher ratings of academic competence, there was no significant difference between the groups for academic domains of self-concept, or any other domain of self-concept. All three groups reported inflated academic self-perceptions relative to objective criteria. Conclusion: Children and adolescents with NF1 are most likely to develop negative self-concepts about their physical and sporting abilities. Inflated academic self-perceptions are discussed in light of the positive illusory bias, which may serve as an adaptive or protective function.

377,Integration of education and care given to children with profound multiple disabilities in Switzerland,"The authors studied how care provision and educational and therapeutic support for children with profound multiple disabilities are organized and coordinated in the German-, French-, and Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland. Study questions were: (a) how do the care and educational elements of support coexist in the everyday life of these children, and (b) at the organizational level, who provides the respective support in schools and institutions? The study was conducted via questionnaires sent to 103 schools and institutions, and involved 177 children with profound multiple disabilities, 150 teachers or ""special educators,"" and two subgroups made up of 26 pairs of healthcare professionals and teachers. Results showed a significant correlation between the allocation of health and personal care and personalized educational and therapeutic support, and that teaching staff undertake tasks relating to health and personal care, just as healthcare professionals also have an educational capacity. However, these two groups of professionals have differing perceptions of their roles and functions in caring for children with profound multiple disabilities. The complementarities of care provision and educational support in Switzerland can be confirmed to some extent. The nature of the support required often forces staff to work outside of their traditional fields of expertise. The authors note that there is a genuine distribution of tasks between different professionals, but they do not confirm a common perception of such tasks.

379,Glucose and cardiac risk factor control in individuals with type 2 diabetes: Implications for patients and providers,"Purpose: The purpose of this descriptive study was to describe attainment of glucose and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor goals and to identify factors that were associated with successful goal achievement. Methods: A cross-sectional survey enrolled 110 subjects with type 2 diabetes undergoing screening for asymptomatic myocardial ischemia. Results: Many participants had HbA1c levels ‚â•7% (45%), and 46% to 79% were not meeting goals for CHD risk reduction. Individual factors of age, gender, and anxiety; the illnessrelated factor of lipid-lowering therapy; and the familyrelated factor of living alone were independently associated with 1 of the 7 outcomes under study. Illnessrelated factors of a longer duration of diabetes were strongly associated with glucose and blood pressure control, insulin use with glucose control and waist circumference, and antihypertensive use with blood pressure, triglycerides, and body mass index. Family-related factors of higher income were significantly associated with poorer glucose control and higher body mass index, while higher levels of perceived support by family and friends were associated with a lower risk of not meeting lipid goals. However, individual factors, represented by several aspects of personal model beliefs (exercising regularly, testing glucose, and checking one's feet) and physical activity, were consistently related to lipid and weight control. Conclusions: A variety of factors were associated with control of blood glucose and CHD risk factors, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all approach to multiple risk factor reduction efforts may not result in goal attainment.

380,Developmental Course of Very Preterm Children in Relation to School Outcome,"Objective: Developmental course of preterm and term children is studied within a prospective longitudinal design in relation to school outcome at 10 years of age. Methods: Differences between the term and preterm children were studied in somatic, neuro- motor, cognitive and socio-emotional development. In addition, comparisons were made concerning the developmental course of the subgroup of preterm children attending age appropriate school classes at 10 years of age, and the subgroup of preterms that showed school problems, reflecting a history of grade retention or attendance of special education school. Results: Term and preterm children differed in all developmental domains. The subgroup of preterms without school problems is characterized by less serious neonatal difficulties, better drinking capacities in the first month, faster early head growth and better early mental and motor development. Cognitive developmental course gradually diverged during the first two years between the preterm subgroups and seemed to stabilize thereafter.

Data were collected from four primary sources over a six-month period: interviews, observations, document review, and journals. Boyzaitis's (1998) five-step process was utilized in the data analysis, which uncovered three primary themes: the teacher's belief in the development of social skills for students with and without disabilities, the teacher's use of purposeful strategies to accommodate students with disabilities, and student learning shaped by personal experience. Student and teacher experiences were interpreted within the conceptual framework of social construction as a means of describing relevant and meaningful relationships.

382,The efects of sports participation on young adolescents' emotional well-being,"This study examined the relationship between children's sports participation and emotional well-being including self-reported emotional and behavioral problems and multidimensional aspects of self-concept. Data were collected from 203 young adolescents using a multitrait-multimethod assessment methodology. Information was obtained using a sports questionnaire concerning participation in and perceptions of sporting activities. Emotional well-being was assessed by the Youth Self-Report (Achenbach, 1991) and the Self-Perception Profile for Children (Harter, 1985). The study found that increased levels of sports participation had a positive relationship with aspects of emotional and behavioral well-being, particularly self-concepts. Results also showed that children with increased perceptions of sport-related competencies reported significantly fewer emotional and behavioral problems than did children who were, by external standards (e.g., teacher rating, number of sporting achievements), actually competent at sport. The study also found particular areas of sports participation to be positively associated with self-concept. Evidence suggests a similar beneficial association with some aspects of behavior problems.

383,The Contribution of Academic Skills to the Successful Inclusion of Children with Disabilities,"Data relating to academic ability were collected for 24 students with disabilities who had been included in regular education classes for 18 months or more. Norm-referenced literacy measures were collected for all 24 students and for 19 of them peer-micronormed literacy and numeracy work samples were obtained and compared to samples collected on average teacher-nominated peers in each of their classes. In addition, teachers were interviewed for their perceptions of the literacy and numeracy skills of the students compared with typical grade peers and their perceptions of the success of the integration. While most of the students performed below their age peers on all measures, some students (even students who had been diagnosed as having a moderate intellectual disability) performed close to and occasionally above what would be expected for their age/grade. There was a positive and statistically significant relationship between the direct measure of academic skills and class teacher perception of those skills and between the perceptions of independent observers who rated the work samples and the direct measure of academic skills. While a relationship was found between teacher rating of success and academic ability, no clear relationship was found between level of disability, as measured at the preschool level, and academic ability. Implications of these findings are discussed.

384,Assessment of Factors Affecting Quality of Life in Diabetic Patients in Iran,"Objective: Assess the pattern of relationships between personal-background characteristics and dimensions of quality of life (QOL) in diabetic patients. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Sample: 117 adults with type 2 diabetes (100 female, 17 male) randomly selected from outpatients referred to Sina hospital (Tabriz, Iran). Methods: Participants answered a three-part questionnaire including (1) sociodemographic and medical (diabetes-related) personal-background characteristics; (2) general health-related QOL instrument based on Swedish Health-Related QOL; (3) disease-specific instrument for diabetic patients. Nine QOL dimensions were covered: physical function, pain, daily activities, feelings, sleep, relationships with relatives, overall health, problems with diabetes, satisfaction with diabetes treatment methods. Data were analyzed with inferential statistics, correlation, and multi-stage stepwise regression. Results: Personal background characteristics (age, presence of medically educated people in family, whether patient was family breadwinner, unemployment, complications of diabetes) accounted for 27% of variance in the physical function dimension of QOL dimension. Other QOL dimensions (daily activities, overall health, sleep, satisfaction with diabetes treatment.) were also related to personal background characteristics. Conclusions: Diabetic patients face great challenges in many dimensions of QOL. Nursing instructors and nursing educators in educational centers for diabetics can use the findings of this research to assess their patients more effectively.

385,Perceptions and Attitudes of Athletic Training Students Toward a Course Addressing Psychological Issues in Rehabilitation,"In 1999, athletic training adopted new educational competencies and clinical proficiencies addressing the following domains: (1) risk management, (2) assessment and evaluation, (3) acute care, (4) general medical conditions and disabilities, (5) pathology of illness and injury, (6) pharmacologic aspects of injury and illness, (7) nutritional aspects of injury and illness, (8) therapeutic exercise, (9) therapeutic modalities, (10) health care administration, (11) professional development and responsibilities, and (12) psychosocial development and responsibilities. These newly adopted competencies and proficiencies have improved the academic preparation of future certified athletic trainers. However, the addition of the 12th domain, psychosocial development and responsibilities, still may not provide athletic training students with a thorough understanding of the complex issues surrounding psychological adjustment to injury. This research study examined athletic training students' perceptions and attitudes before and after completing a new course addressing psychological issues of injury.

386,Access nature,"Access Nature‚Ñ¢ (by Bethe Gilbert Almeras and David Heath,2001) is an inclusive curriculum created by the National Wildlife Federation. The main premise for designing this curriculum was to offer educators a tool that would aid in formulating quality environmental education programs that would reach and stimulate all participants with and without disabilities. This curriculum is designed around objectives in outdoor and environmental education with a main theme of habitat. Each of the activities in this sixty-hour curriculum is geared towards youth and teens ages 6-14. Specific adaptations are incorporated that address four categories of disabilities: hearing, learning/cognition, motor, and visual. invaluable. This manual is a very useful resource for gaining awareness into the little things that can be done to create a safe and stimulating environment for all participants regardless of their abilities. The suggestions and guidelines for including participants with disabilities transcend the scope of the listed activities to programming in general. The Access Nature‚Ñ¢ curriculum encourages facilitators to increase their comfort level working with inclusive audiences by offering all students the opportunity to explore nature.

387,Childhood predictors of self reported chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis in adults: National birth cohort study,"Objective: To study childhood risk factors for chronic fatigue syndrome in adult life. Design: Examination of data from the 1970 British birth cohort. Participants: 16 567 babies born 5-11 April 1970, followed up at 5, 10, 16, and 29-30 years. Main outcome measures Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) identified by self report at age 30 years. Data from childhood from questionnaires given to parents and teachers. Maternal mental health assessed with the malaise inventory. Results: 93 (0.8%, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.0) of 11 261 participants reported ever having CFS/ME, and 48 (0.4%, 0.3 to 0.6) had the condition currently. Higher risk of CFS/ME was associated with having a limiting longstanding condition in childhood (odds ratio 2.3, 1.4 to 3.9), female sex (2.3, 1.4 to 2.6), and high social class in childhood (2.2, 1.4 to 3.5). Higher levels of exercise in childhood were associated with lower risk (0.5, 0.2 to 0.9). Maternal psychological disorder, psychological problems in childhood, birth weight, birth order, atopy, obesity, school absence, academic ability, and parental illness were not associated with risk of CFS/ME. Conclusions: We identified no association between maternal or child psychological distress, academic ability, parental illness, atopy, or birth order and increasing risk of lifetime CFS/ME. Sedentary behaviour increased the risk.

It was hypothesized that the skill theme program would improve targeted skills and perceived physical competence, whereas the movement concepts program would improve self-esteem and creativity. The seven children were taught individually by the same student teachers twice a week for a period of five weeks in one of the teaching methods. After a vacation, the teachers changed their teaching strategies and taught the same children using the alternative method. Although the hypothesis was generally supported, the children's response to and progress in the programs varied. Possible factors influencing the variation were discussed.

389,The inclusion of pupils with special educational needs in secondary school physical education,"In light of the demands of the revised National Curriculum for Physical Education in England (DfEE/QCA, 1999) and the Special Educational Needs and Disability Discrimination Act (DfES, 2001a), this paper presents some preliminary observations on how PE teachers endeavour to include pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in secondary school physical education (PE). Findings from a small-scale study revealed that whilst teachers expressed a commitment to providing pupils with SEN with 'equal opportunities'--to participate in the same learning contexts as their 'more-able' peers--in practice, this was not always the case. The paper concludes by suggesting that the apparent tendency of teachers to prioritise 'traditional' team games within PE serves to exclude, rather than facilitate the full inclusion of many pupils with SEN. Moreover, it appears that these pupils are in effect being integrated into, rather than included in, PE.

To determine the effectiveness of a community-based Chronic Disease Self-management Course (CDC) for UK participants with a range of chronic diseases. Design. The study was a multiple baseline, pre-test post test design with a sample of 185 participants who attended a CDC delivered in community settings by lay tutors, in the UK. Method. Data were collected by self-completed questionnaires before attendance and at four-month follow-up. Results. The sample comprised 72% women (mean age = 53 years, mean disease duration = 16 years). The main chronic diseases included endometriosis, depression, diabetes, myalgic encephalomyelitis, osteoporosis and polio. Adjusting for baseline values and gender, small to moderate increases were found on cognitive symptom management, self-efficacy (disease and symptoms) and communication with physician. A similar sized decrease was found on fatigue, and small decreases were evident on anxious and depressed moods, and health distress. There were no changes in the use of health care resources, or on self-reported exercise behavior. Conclusion. The results of this exploratory study suggest that self-management training for people with chronic diseases can offer benefits in terms of enhanced self-efficacy, greater use of cognitive...

391,Integration of students with severe and profound intellectual disabilities into the comprehensive school system: Teachers' perceptions of the education reform in Finland,"In Finland compulsory education has been organised within the comprehensive school system since 1970. However, until August 1997, the students with the most severe intellectual disabilities were educated by social welfare authorities outside the school system. This study evaluates the transition from the social service system into the comprehensive school system one year after the reform. Nationally representative data was gathered in 1998 from 125 teachers who taught 591 (65%) of all school age children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities in Finland The results of the study indicated that while physical integration had increased, individual integration into the full-time mainstream classroom occurred only seldom. Further, only a few teachers thought that the best placement for children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities was in full-time general education classes. About 80% of the respondents thought that the best placement was in full- or part-time special classes located in mainstream schools.

392,Physical educators' judgments about inclusion: A new instrument for preservice teachers,"The purpose of this study was to develop an instrument for use in physical education teacher education (PETE) programs that would yield valid evidence of the judgments of PETE preservice teachers toward the inclusion of students with disabilities into the general PE classes. Both the conceptualization that judgments represent the cognitive expressions of attitudes and focus group discussions were used to create the     Physical Educators' Judgments About Inclusion (PEJI) instrument. Following content validation procedures, the PEJI was administered to 272 PETE preservice teachers. Subsequent principal component analysis to generate construct validity evidence indicated that 15 items should be retained; they collectively explained 53% of the variance using a 3-component model. Dimensions of the PEJI pertained to judgments about inclusion, acceptance, and perceived training needs. Alpha coefficients for the 3 subscales ranged from .64 to .88.

393,Externalizing and internalizing problems at school as signs of health-damaging behaviour and incipient marginalization,"This study investigated whether behavioural or emotional problems in adolescents detected by their teachers are signs of a common psychosocial maladjustment and of the beginning of social marginalization. 171 pupils (aged 15 yrs) from Finland participated in the survey. Pupils filled in a questionnaire about alcohol use, smoking, physical exercise and fitness, self-rated health, psychosomatic symptoms, social relationships and future educational plans. Results showed that poor success at school and the absence of or limited educational plans were associated with both externalizing and internalizing problems. Externalizing problems were associated with health-damaging behaviour and with bullying others. Internalizing problems were associated with poor perceived health and a low level of exercise, with mental symptoms, and with problems in social relationships. Thus, the pupils in both problem groups had a clustering of different risk factors. The authors conclude that the accumulation in adolescents of self-reported health-damaging behaviour, problems related to school, to future educational plans and to social relationships are already obvious in pupils with externalizing and/ or internalizing problems detected by their teachers at the age of 15 yrs.

With few common misconceptions, the general agreement on the unacceptability of suicide and the rejection of the notion of non-intervention provided grounds for optimism. The uncertain views on risks of suicide threats and concrete planning and on the ethical and religious issues were areas for concern. Implications of the findings related to cultural beliefs and to teacher training for school-based prevention programs as well as the caution needed to be exercised in interpreting the present findings based on a sample of young teachers and prospective teachers in Hong Kong are discussed.

Due to an error in the original article, the published last name of author Helena Hemmingsson was incorrect. The correct author names for the article should appear as: H. Hemmingsson and L. Borell.] The aim of this study was to identify the barriers to participation in Swedish mainstream schools, from the personal perspective of students with physical disabilities. The study also investigated how gender, diagnosis, level of mobility, academic years and availability of an assistant were related to student-environment fit. A total of 34 students with physical disabilities, aged between 10 and 19 years, participated in the study. The students were assessed by 'The school-setting interview'. Results show that two-thirds of the students experienced barriers to participation in both the physical and the social environment. A majority of the barriers originated from the way in which school activities were organized and carried out in schools. Failure to provide adequate environmental adjustments resulted in restricted participation or exclusion from some of the activities in class. Older students experienced significantly more barriers than younger ones because the school organization was less favorable. The results suggest that the way in which activities are organized in school is the area in need of most improvements to promote participation of students with physical disabilities.

396,Integration of children with visual impairment in regular preschools,"Asked 72 regular preschool teachers about their experiences in integrating 24 children who were blind and 16 who were partially sighted. Results show that integration seemed to be unproblematic except for greater emotional difficulties in children who are partially sighted. According to preschool teachers, integrating children who are blind is far more complex and difficult than integrating the partially sighted. One fifth of the blind exhibited marked to serious problems in 10 out of 28 preschool activities surveyed. Most of these difficulties involved manual, cognitive, interactive and daily living skills. When asked about difficulties that had not been anticipated before integration commenced, preschool teachers emphasized 4 domains: the increase in their own workload; the children's problems with concentration and motivation; fixation on one preschool teacher; and difficulties in the fine- and gross-motor domain as well as in daily living skills. Findings indicate the need for improved preparations and support when integrating the blind into regular preschool.

A national survey was completed by 1,180 teachers of students with disabilities describing student participation in school activities encompassing involvement in social activities, sports, academic and artistic/creative endeavors. Multivariate analysis reveals that school life in elementary, middle, and high school could be defined by 6 distinct factors describing individual and group roles. Structural equation modeling yielded a 2nd order latent variable that captured the complex and multi-dimensional aspect of participation, accounting for availability, eligibility, student characteristics/status, and student choice within a larger framework of participation.

398,Teachers' problem-solving about children with moderate and severe disabilities in elementary classrooms,"This ethnographic study investigated the ways general and special education elementary school teachers and school staff worked to identify and solve their concerns about children with disabilities in their classrooms. Educators collaborated to resolve concerns by following problem-solving steps somewhat similar to traditional approaches. Teachers used this process (a) primarily during the school day whenever they had a free moment; (b) in pairs, small groups, or alone; and (c) repeated it until feasible solutions were determined. The demands of these teachers' jobs seemed to require that solutions be refined through repeated applications rather than developed optimally as a whole team before acting. These teachers' propensity for collaboration seemed motivated by their realization that cooperation was necessary to meet the educational needs of these children.

The included children were all Year 2 children. One had physical and developmental disabilities and language difficulties; one was diagnosed with spastic paraplegia with mild mental retardation; and one had hearing and language problems and mild mental retardation. Individual interviews and observations were conducted with parents and teachers involved in the project. Results indicated that teachers maintained discrete role boundaries, while parents' views were more positive regarding mutual social benefits, acceptance, and treatment of the included child. Discussions relate to special education reform and effective strategies to facilitate collaboration among teachers who work within and to promote inclusive environments.

400,Analyzing special educators' views on community-based instruction for students with mental retardation and developmental disabilities: Implications for teacher education,"Although community-based instruction (CBI) has been advocated as an important instructional approach for students with mild mental retardation (D. E. Brolin, 1995; J. McDonnell et al., 1993), the relationship has not been very clearly established between CBI and the general education curriculum emphasizing traditional academic skills. This investigation, an interview of 23 24‚Äì49 yr old teachers, was designed to gather relevant findings related to the process of community-based instruction and to translate these findings into implications that the implementation of this innovation may have on teacher education and future research in special education. Findings indicate differing attitudes between teachers who engage in CBI programming and those who do not. There also appears to be some indication that teachers who have characteristics as risk takers appear to be more able to develop CBI activities. In addition, the need for administrative support, both at the outset of program development and during the instructional process, appears to be a major indicator of success. Future research should investigate the effects of administrator perceptions and attitudes, CBI effects on the learning of more traditional academic skills, and the development of high-quality CBI activities.

401,Perceptions of mainstreaming: A systems approach,"Examined the experiences and perceptions of 6 adolescents with physical disabilities (aged 13‚Äì18 yrs) in a mainstream school, and the combined influence of the school community and education system on them and their families. Ss (aged 13‚Äì18 yrs), their parents, and teachers provided their views concerning issues perceived to determine successful mainstreaming. Results show that schools were generally not able to meet the psychological, social, and clinical needs of the pupils with physical disabilities. The school did not meet physical requirements of a ramp and lift, teachers felt undertrained, and Ss were socially isolated and subject to bullying. Ss indicated a deteriorating situation in relation to their disability during their school years, indicating that integration is not a static process. It is concluded that mainstreaming in its current form is a discriminatory process as pupils with disabilities do not have access to the same friendship networks, physical resources, and academic curriculum as their peers.

402,Evaluation of a first-year inclusion program: Student perceptions and classroom performance,"This article summarizes the 1st-year evaluation of an inclusive education program at an urban elementary school. 60 primary-level (Grades K‚Äì2) students and 60 intermediate-level students (Grades 3‚Äì5) were evaluated using individualized and teacher report measures. At the primary level, results showed significant increases in self-perceptions of cognitive competence for both students with disabilities and students without disabilities. Self-perceptions of physical competence were higher for the students-with-disabilities group. No significant differences were found in preferred playmates. At the intermediate level, students without disabilities reported higher perceptions of their academic and social abilities than did students with disabilities. Teacher ratings showed improved social skills for both primary and intermediate students with disabilities. Finally, report card ratings and teacher comments suggested different expectations for students with disabilities and their typical peers.

403,"Self-monitoring and self-recruited praise: Effects on problem behavior, academic engagement, and work completion in a typical classroom","Examines the relationship between self-monitoring plus self-recruited attention and problem behaviors, on-task behavior, overall teacher perception of student performance, task completion, and frequency of teacher praise. The research design employed an ABAB withdrawal analysis coupled with a two-series multiple baseline design across class periods for one fourth-grade student (aged 9 yrs) with learning disabilities and problem behavior in a general education classroom. The results indicate that implementation of self-monitoring combined with self-evaluation and self-recruitment of teacher attention was functionally related to a decrease in the frequency of problem behaviors, an increase in on-task behavior, and an increase in task completion. In addition, the intervention was associated with increased positive teacher perceptions of student performance. Results are discussed in terms of the application of (a) comprehensive, positive behavioral support in typical classrooms; (b) self-management strategies to reduce problem behaviors; and (c) expanded research outcomes to document behavior change with social significance.

Ss were 22 high school students with learning disabilities, orthopedic impairments, emotional disturbances, or multiple disabilities. Data sources included IEPs, observations of pupils and teachers in content area, special area, and special education settings, and interviews. Analysis indicated that the IEP accurately characterized peer interactions, but that instructional practices to foster peer interaction were not appropriate, and were provided only to a limited extent. General education settings were somewhat more likely than special education settings to foster peer interaction, providing support for claims that inclusion fosters social integration.

Teacher interviews and observations revealed 4 main themes: (1) multiple teaching styles, (2) student outcomes, (3) teacher frustrations, and (4) differences in inclusion practices. Results indicate that schools provided little support, and teachers reported that they were inadequately prepared to teach effectively with inclusive classes. These teachers had strong feelings of guilt and inadequacy as they continued to try to be effective for all children.

The impact of screening on the perceptions that teachers have of their role in promoting heart health at school and the frequency of discussing heart health issues with students was also investigated. Behaviors of staff (     n‚Çá=‚ÄÇ126) working in 8 inner-city elementary schools offered the screening were compared with those of staff (     n‚ÄÇ=‚ÄÇ135) working in 8 matched comparison schools. Data were collected in self-administered questionnaires 2 wks before and 4 mo after screening. No changes were detected through multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) in cigarette or fat consumption, but Ss exposed to the screening significantly increased their level of physical activity. Also, teachers exposed to screening increasingly supported the notion that teachers have a role in promoting heart-healthy behaviors among their students.

409,Research into the lifeworld of physically disabled children,"Investigated the experiences of physically disabled children, focusing on elementary school aged children not suffering from additional intellectual disability. During a 5-yr period, open interviews and participant observations were made of 65 children. In about a quarter of the cases, Ss' parents, teachers, and (para)medical staff were also interviewed. Ss reported their perceptions of their bodies, problems concerning friendship, and the role of experts. Perceptions of the body were categorized as the rebellious body, the unreliable body, the sensitive body, the body in therapy, the dependent body, the conspicuous body, and the vital body. Problems with making friends entailed trying to participate in collective activities, despite the Ss' physical limitations. Ss reported a number of conflicts of interest between themselves and their experts.

A number of conflict constructs were examined including goals, oppositions, strategies, outcomes, and the teacher's role in peer conflict. Ethnographic data were collected through the use of field notes and videotaping. These data were gathered to develop categories surrounding the conflicts that emerged in the integrated classroom. Results showed that: (a) CWDs were in more conflicts than TDCs; (b) conflicts were more likely to occur between CWDs than between TDCs; (c) most conflicts involved teacher intervention; and (d) most frequent outcomes resulted in a win-lose situation where the children separated. Findings show the need for active teacher involvement when CWDs participate in conflicts in integrated early childhood classrooms.

The literature search covered the period 1935‚Äì1990. Interviews were conducted with 44 tribal elders, 10 heads of schools, 45 teachers, and executives and government officials in organizations having to do with the disabled. Teachers and elders were able to describe the characteristics of most kinds of disability, except for mild to moderate intellectual ability, learning disability, and emotional problems. Beliefs seemed to be centered around the abilities of the disabled. Three folk songs convey the message that the disabled are persons with basic human needs and emotions. Three riddles point to the fact that disability can befall anyone. The integration of the disabled into everyday community life is emphasized.

BD students were identified through psychological and academic achievement tests, behavior checklists, classroom observations by teachers, medical evaluations, and social and family histories. A rating scale sociometric instrument, the Ohio Social Acceptance Scale (OSAS), was administered in 33 physical education classes that had BD students enrolled. Results indicate that BD Ss, compared to matched nonhandicapped students, were lower in regular classroom sociometric status. BD Ss were as well-known as their matched peers and rated fellow BD students in the same classes higher than did nonhandicapped raters.

One hypothesis predicted that the effort required for NHI and HI students to communicate would lead to frustration, withdrawal, exclusion, and rejection; the other stated that cooperative learning experiences would lead to cross-handicap interpersonal attraction regardless of communication difficulties. 20 NHI and 10 HI 3rd graders were assigned to cooperative and individualistic learning conditions on a stratified, random basis controlling for handicap, sex, and ability level. They participated in the study for 55 min/day for 15 instructional days. Ss completed measures of achievement, interpersonal attraction, instructional interaction, attitude, and perspective taking. Results, in support of the 2nd hypothesis, indicate that Ss involved in cooperative learning experiences performed higher on measures of interaction and interpersonal attraction between NHI and HI students than did Ss involved in individualistic learning experiences. NHI Ss who worked cooperatively with HI peers were more accurate in taking the perspective of their HI classmates than were NHI Ss in the individualistic condition.

425,Educator perceptions of behavior problems of mainstreamed students,"Assessed the perceptions of 39 regular elementary school teachers, 31 secondary school teachers, 7 special education teachers, 5 school counselors, and 23 people holding various other positions in the schools (e.g., librarian, administrator) regarding the seriousness and recommended treatments for behavior problems of 6 hypothetical students who might be found in a mainstreamed classroom. Ss appeared to perceive student behavior problems as more serious when displayed by nonhandicapped or physically handicapped students than when displayed by mentally handicapped students. The same Ss recommended more behavioral treatments having an authoritarian orientation for nonhandicapped than for physically handicapped students. Results indicate that educators need to develop attitudes and skills necessary for behavior management in the mainstreamed school environment.

426,Considerations for socially integrated school environments for severely handicapped students,"Examines variables that influence the integration of severely handicapped students into less restrictive school environments, including opportunities for naturally occurring social interaction; identification of expected social responses in both handicapped and nonhandicapped peers; activities in education transition programs that accompany integration; and the roles of students, teachers, and administrators in integrating schools. It is suggested that educators should consider the multitudes of interaction opportunities for social skill training available in naturally occurring integrated settings and the opportunity to use newly acquired skills. Such settings may contain the necessary requisites for social competence, (e.g., naturally occurring reinforcers, an increased number of peer ""teachers,"" and a wide variety of social situations). How social responses of handicapped children and their nonhandicapped peers may constitute classes of behavior necessary for successful social integration is discussed, and the use of multimedia awareness productions to promote social and physical integration is considered. Three overlapping roles that have been identified for nonhandicapped peers include peer as trainer, peer as helper, and peer with accepting responses. Ways in which special education teachers, regular education teachers, and school administrators can implement integrated school programs are discussed.

427,Perceptions of parents of handicapped children about school and parent‚Äìteacher partnership,"352 parents of exceptional students in 5 categories (behavioral disorders, mild mental handicaps, learning disabilities, physical and multiple handicaps, and speech and language impairments) responded to a 30-item questionnaire about parental involvement, attitudes, interest, and knowledge. Findings show that while Ss had an accurate perception of both their child's problems and the services provided, they perceived themselves as having low levels of involvement in school, including meetings for the development of individualized education programs. The majority were satisfied with the child's education. The time of school meetings, transportation, and lack of benefit from attendance were reported as barriers to involvement. It is suggested that efforts need to be made to train and prepare parents for the roles expected of them and that educators must also be trained to lower the barriers to participation.

428,Perceptions of school life among physically disabled mainstreamed pupils,"Examined the perceptions of school life among 75 9‚Äì12 yr old physically disabled pupils learning in regular classrooms in Israel. Three groups (     n‚ÄÇ=‚ÄÇ25 per group) of pupils‚Äîextremely short, diabetic, and orthopedically impaired‚Äîcorresponding to E. Goffman's (1963) categorization of stigmatized persons responsed to the Israeli Quality of School Life Scale. Significant differences between the groups were found on 4 of the 7 subscales. Short Ss as compared to orthopedically impaired Ss were more satisfied with social aspects of schooling but reacted less positively to their teachers. Diabetic Ss were also less satisfied with their teachers than were orthopedically impaired Ss, and they demonstrated relative dissatisfaction with affective components of schooling. It is concluded that Ss did not form a monolithic group in their perceptions of school life and that unique reactions to schooling were characteristic of each group. Implications for designing more appropriate school environments for mainstreamed physically disabled pupils are discussed.

Data were collected to determine their characteristics and the external and educational support they received. Results show that Ss received medical, social work, and education attention. Most parents regarded their initial contact with professionals as poor or very poor; the majority believed they needed more help from outside agencies. Most parents expressed satisfaction with the response of teachers to the needs of their children. Most parents felt that they had played an important part in the decision to place their child in a regular school, and they were satisfied with that placement. Data show that measured IQ for spina bifida Ss was of questionable value and that there was a lack of interest in measures of social integration and adjustment for these Ss on the part of psychologists.

430,Group programmes for parents of children with various handicaps,"Four programs were conducted with groups of parents of school-aged, physically handicapped, hearing-impaired, and mildly and moderately mentally handicapped children. This paper discusses the salient features of the organization of these parent programs. Programs have involved 6‚Äì8 weekly 2-hr sessions. The format of each session included both lecture presentation and discussion in small groups. Discussions were led by educational psychologists using a combination of reflective and behavioral procedures. Evaluation, by means of postprogram questionnaires and attendance checks, has shown that parents have found programs to be valuable. An integral part of the parent programs has been the training of special education teachers in the attitudes and skills necessary for working with parents of handicapped children. The introduction of group programs is considered to complement the individual training and counseling services already available to such parents in New Zealand.

436,"Orthopedic disability, restriction, and role-taking activity","Explored social experiences in the declining egocentrism of children between the ages of 6 and 12 yrs. The social and cognitive development of 80 orthopedically disabled and nondisabled children were compared. 40 Ss were selected from a hospital school for the orthopedically disabled, and 40 were selected from public schools. The 2 groups were matched according to age, sex, and IQ, and were administered the Concrete Operations Tasks, Children's Role-taking Task, and the Children's Social Relations Interview Scale. Ss' teachers observed the children for 1 wk and rated them on the Children's Social Relations Interview Scale. Ss' teachers observed the children for 1 wk and rated them on the Children's Social Relations Rating Scale. Results support the general hypothesis that achievement of concrete operations and role-taking activity is fostered by the child's enacting the agent role and retarded by his/her enacting the patient role.

437,Gym-based exoskeleton walking: A preliminary exploration of non-ambulatory end-user perspectives.,"Robotic walking devices (RWD) have shown many physical benefits in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) rehabilitation. No study to date has explored end-user perceptions of these devices or gained insight into the use of these devices in a gym-based setting.
This preliminary study explores the perspectives of four non-ambulatory individuals with SCI on using an exoskeleton walking device in a gym-based community setting.
In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with four SCI individuals living in the community. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis established common overarching themes and subthemes.
Four primary themes emerged addressing ""The Psychological Adjustments Around Using RWDs with Respect to Disability"", ""Perceived Physical, Social and Psychological Benefits of Using an Exoskeleton"", ""The Role of External Influences"", and ""A Wellness Model to Health"". A fully integrated gym setting was found to provide a positive and encouraging space to utilise the device. In addition, both the ability to set training goals and the positive attitude of robotic trainers were deemed to be important factors.
This preliminary study provides detailed perspectives of four non-ambulatory individuals with SCI on utilising an exoskeleton walking device in a community setting. It suggests that gym-based RWDs impact positively on the users' lives and enhance their perceived wellbeing and sense of community integration. Enabling access to similar, community-based facilities should be prioritised for those with longstanding SCI disability.",Robotics;Spinal cord injury;Robotic walking devices;Qualitative research;Exoskeleton;Community integration;Walking;Surveys and Questionnaires;Spinal Cord Injuries;Self-Help Devices;Quality of Life;Patient Satisfaction;Mobility Limitation;Middle Aged;Male;Humans;Female;Exoskeleton Device;Disabled Persons;Community Participation;Adult,"Cahill, Aoife and Ginley, Orna Mc and Bertrand, Courtney and Lennon, Olive",2018.0,0,432
438,Screening for glucose intolerance and development of a lifestyle education programme for prevention of type 2 diabetes in a population with intellectual disabilities: the STOP Diabetes research project,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is believed to be higher among people with intellectual disability (ID) than in the general population. However, research on prevalence and prevention in this population is limited.
The objectives of this programme of work were to establish a programme of research that would significantly enhance the knowledge and understanding of impaired glucose regulation (IGR) and T2DM in people with ID; to test strategies for the early identification of IGR and T2DM in people with ID; and to develop a lifestyle education programme and educator training protocol to promote behaviour change in a population with ID and IGR (or at a high risk of T2DM/CVD).
Leicestershire, UK.
Adults with ID were recruited from community settings, including residential homes and family homes. Adults with mild to moderate ID who had an elevated body mass index (BMI) of ‚â•‚Äâ25‚Äâkg/m2 and/or IGR were invited to take part in the education programme.
The primary outcome of the screening programme was the prevalence of screen-detected T2DM and IGR. The uptake, feasibility and acceptability of the intervention were assessed.
Participants were recruited from general practices, specialist ID services and clinics, and through direct contact.
A total of 930 people with ID were recruited to the screening programme: 58% were male, 80% were white and 68% were overweight or obese. The mean age of participants was 43.3 years (standard deviation 14.2 years). Bloods were obtained for 675 participants (73%). The prevalence of previously undiagnosed T2DM was 1.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5% to 2%] and of IGR was 5% (95% CI 4% to 7%). Abnormal IGR was more common in those of non-white ethnicity; those with a first-degree family history of diabetes; those with increasing weight, waist circumference, BMI, diastolic blood pressure or triglycerides; and those with lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We developed a lifestyle educational programme for people with ID, informed by findings from qualitative stakeholder interviews (health-care professionals, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ14; people with ID, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ7) and evidence reviews. Subsequently, 11 people with ID (and carers) participated in pilot education sessions (two groups) and five people attended education for the feasibility stage (one group). We found that it was feasible to collect primary outcome measures on physical activity and sedentary behaviour using wrist-worn accelerometers. We found that the programme was relatively costly, meaning that large changes in activity or diet (or a reduction in programme costs) would be necessary for the programme to be cost-effective. We also developed a quality development process for assessing intervention fidelity.
We were able to screen only around 30% of the population and involved only a small number in the piloting and feasibility work.
The results from this programme of work have significantly enhanced the existing knowledge and understanding of T2DM and IGR in people with ID. We have developed a lifestyle education programme and educator training protocol to promote behaviour change in this population.
Further work is needed to evaluate the STOP Diabetes intervention to identify cost-effective strategies for its implementation.

439,"Health status, physical activity, and orthorexia nervosa: A comparison between exercise science students and business students.","Orthorexia nervosa is described as an exaggerated fixation on healthy food. It is unclear whether students in health-oriented academic programs, highly focused on physical exercise, are more prone to develop orthorexia nervosa than students in other educational areas. The aim was to compare health status, physical activity, and frequency of orthorexia nervosa between university students enrolled in an exercise science program (n¬†=¬†118) or a business program (n¬†=¬†89). The students completed the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and ORTO-15, which defines orthorexia nervosa as a sensitive and obsessive behavior towards healthy nutrition. The SF-36 showed that exercise science students scored worse than business students regarding bodily pain (72.8 vs. 82.5; p¬†=¬†0.001), but better regarding general health (83.1 vs. 77.1; p¬†=¬†0.006). Of 188 students, 144 (76.6%) had an ORTO-15 score indicating orthorexia nervosa, with a higher proportion in exercise science students than in business students (84.5% vs. 65.4%; p¬†=¬†0.002). Orthorexia nervosa in combination with a high level of physical activity was most often seen in men in exercise science studies and less often in women in business studies (45.1% vs. 8.3%; p¬†<¬†0.000). A high degree of self-reporting of pain and orthorexia nervosa in exercise science students may cause problems in the future, since they are expected to coach others in healthy living.

440,Applying an ecological framework to understand transition pathways to post-secondary education for youth with physical disabilities.,"The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of youth with physical disabilities and clinicians who support them in their transition to post-secondary education (PSE). Most research on transition to PSE has focused on youth with intellectual disabilities while there is a lack of research on youth with physical disabilities.
This study drew on 30 interviews with 20 youth with disabilities and 10 clinicians. We used Bronfrenbrenner's ecological framework to inform our analysis.
Our results showed that there are several important individual skills that youth need to be successful in transitioning to PSE. Youth with disabilities experienced supports from peers and family that influence their transition to PSE. Several disability-specific issues (e.g., coping, self-care, disclosure, and accommodations) were often a barrier to transitioning to PSE. Clinicians and youth both reported that improved inter-professional collaboration and inter-agency partnerships were needed to enhance the transition experience. Societal attitudes (stigma and discrimination), policies, and the timing of transitions also influence youth's transition.
Applying an ecological approach helped to provide a more holistic perspective of the PSE transitions and emphasizes the need to consider more than just preparing individuals but also where they are transitioned. Implications for rehabilitation Clinicians and educators should continue to promote the development of relevant life skills (e.g., self-advocacy, disclosure, and navigating public transportation) that youth need to succeed in post-secondary education. Clinicians should continue to educate and support youth regarding the process for disclosing their condition and how to request and set up accommodations in PSE. Clinicians should connect youth with disabilities to appropriate resources that can support them and continue to help them to set career goals and develop career plans. There is a critical need for improved inter-professional collaboration among clinicians providing transition services and inter-agency partnerships among high schools, disability organizations, and PSEs to enhance transition experiences for youth with disabilities.","Self Disclosure;Disclosure;vocational rehabilitation;transitions;Qualitative;Young Adult;Social Support;Social Stigma;Rehabilitation, Vocational;Prejudice;Male;Interviews as Topic;Interprofessional Relations;Humans;Female;Disabled Persons;Cooperative Behavior;Architectural Accessibility;Adult;Adolescent","Lindsay, Sally and Duncanson, Michelle and Niles-Campbell, Nadia and McDougall, Carolyn and Diederichs, Sara and Menna-Dack, Dolly",2018.0,0,435
441,Integrating Neuroscience Knowledge and Neuropsychiatric Skills Into Psychiatry: The Way Forward.,"Increasing the integration of neuroscience knowledge and neuropsychiatric skills into general psychiatric practice would facilitate expanded approaches to diagnosis, formulation, and treatment while positioning practitioners to utilize findings from emerging brain research. There is growing consensus that the field of psychiatry would benefit from more familiarity with neuroscience and neuropsychiatry. Yet there remain numerous factors impeding the integration of these domains of knowledge into general psychiatry.The authors make recommendations to move the field forward, focusing on the need for advocacy by psychiatry and medical organizations and changes in psychiatry education at all levels. For individual psychiatrists, the recommendations target obstacles to attaining expanded neuroscience and neuropsychiatry education and barriers stemming from widely held, often unspoken beliefs. For the system of psychiatric care, recommendations address the conceptual and physical separation of psychiatry from medicine, overemphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and on psychopharmacology, and different systems in medicine and psychiatry for handling reimbursement and patient records. For psychiatry residency training, recommendations focus on expanding neuroscience/neuropsychiatry faculty and integrating neuroscience education throughout the curriculum.Psychiatry traditionally concerns itself with helping individuals construct meaningful life narratives. Brain function is one of the fundamental determinants of individuality. It is now possible for psychiatrists to integrate knowledge of neuroscience into understanding the whole person by asking, What person has this brain? How does this brain make this person unique? How does this brain make this disorder unique? What treatment will help this disorder in this person with this brain?","Brain;United States;Psychiatry;Neurosciences;Neuropsychiatry;Mental Health Services;Mental Disorders;Internship and Residency;Interdisciplinary Communication;Humans;Education, Medical, Graduate;Clinical Competence","Schildkrout, Barbara and Benjamin, Sheldon and Lauterbach, Margo D",2016.0,0,436
442,"Association of Characteristics, Deficits, and Outcomes of Residents Placed on Probation at One Institution, 2002-2012.","To describe the population of residents placed on probation, identify learner characteristics associated with being placed on probation, and describe immediate and long-term career outcomes for those placed on probation as compared with matched controls.
The authors collected data for residents at the University of Colorado School of Medicine placed on probation from July 2002 to June 2012, including postgraduate year placed on probation, deficits identified, mandated evaluation for physical and mental health, duration of probation, disability accommodations requested, and number of additional training months required. They were retrospectively compared with 102 controls matched for specialty, matriculation, and postgraduate year. Variables assessed included demographics, academic performance, license status, specialty, state board certification, and board citations.
Of 3,091 residents, 3.3% were placed on probation (88 residents; 14 fellows). Compared with controls, those on probation were more likely to be international medical graduates, married, not Caucasian, older (all P < .001), male (P = .01), to have transferred from another graduate medical education training program, and to have taken time off between medical school and residency (all P < .001). Among those currently in practice, 53 (63.9%) were board certified compared with 93 (100%) of the controls. Placement on probation was associated with failure to graduate and lack of board certification. All 7 graduates cited by state medical boards were in the probation group.
Further research is needed to understand these associations and to determine whether changes in curricula or remediation programs may alter these outcomes.","Education, Medical, Graduate;United States;Professional Misconduct;Male;Internship and Residency;Humans;Female;Employee Discipline;Colorado;Clinical Competence;Certification;Case-Control Studies;Career Choice;Adult","Guerrasio, Jeannette and Brooks, Elizabeth and Rumack, Carol M and Christensen, Alicia and Aagaard, Eva M",2016.0,0,437
443,Outcome expectations and physical activity in persons with longstanding multiple sclerosis.,"Research suggests that persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) are much less physically active than the general population and that increased physical activity in persons with MS is associated with numerous benefits such as improvements in fatigue, mobility, and quality of life (). Potentially modifiable theory-based determinants of physical activity behavior need to be identified so that researchers may study their effectiveness in randomized clinical trials and clinicians may integrate them into practice to promote physical activity in this population. The purpose of this study was to explore the multidimensional (physical, social, and self-evaluative) outcome expectations for physical activity among persons with longstanding MS. A sample of 369 participants diagnosed with MS for more than 15 years completed surveys to measure multidimensional outcome expectations for exercise, MS functional limitations, and physical activity using two different instruments: one measuring physical activity engagement and the other measuring physical activity capability. Results indicated that MS functional limitation was the strongest predictor of both physical activity engagement and physical activity capability. Physical and social outcome expectations contributed to the model explaining 12% of the variation in physical activity engagement, whereas none of the outcome expectancy dimensions (physical, social, or self-evaluative) contributed to the model explaining variation in physical activity capability. Although analyses of cross-sectional data do not infer causation, these findings suggest that positive physical and social outcome expectations for physical activity are associated with engagement in physical activity as well as being potential sources of motivation for increasing physical activity behavior in individuals living with longstanding MS.","Treatment Outcome;Self Concept;Neuroscience Nursing;Multiple Sclerosis;Motor Activity;Middle Aged;Male;Long-Term Care;Humans;Health Surveys;Female;Disability Evaluation;Aged, 80 and over;Aged;Adult;Activities of Daily Living","Morrison, Janet D and Stuifbergen, Alexa K",2014.0,0,438
444,Innovative web-based multimedia curriculum improves cardiac examination competency of residents.,"Proper diagnosis of cardiac disorders is a core competency of internists. Yet numerous studies have documented that the cardiac examination (CE) skills of physicians have declined compared with those of previous generations of physicians, attributed variously to inadequate exposure to cardiac patients and lack of skilled bedside teaching. With growing concerns about ensuring patient safety and quality of care, public and professional organizations are calling for a renewed emphasis on the teaching and evaluation of clinical skills in residency training.
The objective of the study was to determine whether Web training improves CE competency, whether residents retain what they learn, and whether a Web-based curriculum plus clinical training is better than clinical training alone. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2008;3:124-133. (c) 2008 Society of Hospital Medicine.
This was a controlled intervention study.
The intervention group (34 internal and family medicine interns) participated in self-directed use of a Web-based tutorial and three 1-hour teaching sessions taught by a hospitalist. Twenty-five interns from the prior year served as controls.
We assessed overall CE competency and 4 subcategories of CE competency: knowledge, audio skills, visual skills, and audio-visual integration.
The over mean score of the intervention group significantly improved, from 54 to 66 (P = .002). This improvement was retained (63.5, P = .05). When compared with end-of-year controls, the intervention group had significantly higher end-of-year CE scores (57 vs. 63.5, P = .05), knowledge (P = .04), and audio skills (P = .01). At the end of the academic year, all improvements were retained (P <or= .04) except visual skills (P = .75).
A Web-based interactive educational program with minimal hospitalist involvement led to significant improvement in CE competence and was better than clinical training alone.","Physicians, Family;Physical Examination;Multimedia;Models, Educational;Male;Internship and Residency;Internet;Internal Medicine;Humans;Female;Educational Measurement;Diagnostic Techniques, Cardiovascular;Curriculum;Computer-Assisted Instruction;Clinical Competence;Adult","Criley, Jasminka M and Keiner, Jennifer and Boker, John R and Criley, Stuart R and Warde, Carole M",2008.0,0,439
445,Physical training as a substance abuse prevention intervention for youth.,"Program evaluation data from school and community applications of a physical fitness drug prevention program is presented. A train-the-trainer methodology was applied to install the program in twenty-two settings within the state of Illinois. The physical training program consisted of exercise and educational modules delivered over a twelve-week time period that focused on learning values and life skills through exercise. Complete pre-post data were obtained on 329 participating youth at six school and community based sites. Significant increases were demonstrated in physical activity and physical fitness (cardiovascular endurance, strength, and flexibility). Youth self-report data indicated significant decreases in risk factors such as low self-concept, poor school attendance, anxiety, depression, and number of friends who use alcohol and drugs. There were significant reductions in the percentage of youth who used cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and alcohol. It was concluded that a strong relationship was demonstrated for increased fitness leading to lowered risk factors and usage patterns. Likewise, the train-the-trainer model was shown to be an effective installation approach to expand fitness programming within prevention settings.","Tobacco, Smokeless;Self-Evaluation Programs;Substance-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse Treatment Centers;Self Concept;School Health Services;Risk Factors;Psychology, Adolescent;Program Evaluation;Program Development;Prisons;Physical Fitness;Male;Illinois;Humans;Female;Exercise Therapy;Adolescent Behavior;Adolescent;Absenteeism","Collingwood, T R and Sunderlin, J and Reynolds, R and Kohl, H W",2000.0,0,440
446,Self-perceived social function among disabled children in regular classrooms.,"Disabled children represent an important ""at-risk"" group for emotional and behavioral problems. This study determined how they assess their own social function in regular classrooms and compared them with their able-bodied peers. School principals identified 60 visibly disabled children who were integrated into regular classes for at least 50% of the time. A comparison group of 56 randomly selected, same-gender classmates was identified. Children completed the Perceived Competence Scale and a classroom sociometric scale. Parents and teachers were asked to rate each child's social function. Disabled children rated themselves lower on physical competence (mean = 2.53 vs 2.92, p = .002) but not on social or cognitive competence. However, disabled children had fewer friends and scored lower on the classroom sociometric measure than did their able-bodied classmates (mean = 2.06 vs 2.39, p = .01). There was no difference between disabled and control children when social function was assessed by parents or teachers. For all children two variables were significantly associated with the child's self-perceived social competence: the child's self-perceived physical competence (R2 = .27) and the peer sociometric rating (R2 = .13). Teacher perception (R2 = .35) and self-perception (R2 = .10) of social function were most strongly associated with the perception of peers. In both cases whether the child was disabled contributed little to the observed association. These findings support the importance of peers in the successful social function of children and suggest that teachers can have an impact on how children are perceived by other children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Only Child;Disabled Children;Sociometric Techniques;Social Environment;Social Desirability;Social Behavior;Social Adjustment;Self Concept;Personality Assessment;Peer Group;Male;Mainstreaming (Education);Humans;Female;Disabled Persons;Child;Activities of Daily Living,"Armstrong, R W and Rosenbaum, P L and King, S",1992.0,0,441
447,Self-Advocacy in Physical Education for Students with Physical Disabilities,"Many educators recommend that students with disabilities learn how to become better advocates for themselves in all aspects of their lives. One area where students with disabilities can learn to become better self-advocates is in physical education. At present, most students with disabilities have accommodations made for them by their teachers, specialists, and assistants. However, in many cases, students with disabilities can learn to effectively advocate for themselves in physical education in terms of what they should learn (IEP objectives), how they should be accommodated, and when they need to rest or be active. The purpose of this article is to introduce the concept of self-advocacy for students with disabilities into physical education. The article begins with a case study that followed a student with a physical disability in general physical education and shows how she learned to become a self-advocate. The article concludes with some general recommendations on how to help students with disabilities become self-advocates in physical education.",Learning Disorders;Learning;Disabled Persons;Physical Education and Training;Individualized Education Programs;Adapted Physical Education;Inclusive Schools;Physical Disabilities;Physical Education;Self Advocacy;Grade 8,"MacDonald, Cathy and Block, Martin E.",2005.0,0,442
448,Menstrual Irregularity and Musculoskeletal Injury in Female High School Athletes.,"Context: The female athlete triad describes the interrelatedness of energy availability, menstrual function, and bone density. Although associations between triad components and musculoskeletal injury (INJ) have been reported in collegiate athletes, limited information exists about menstrual irregularity (Ml) and INJ in the high school population. Objective: To determine the prevalence of and relationship between Ml and INJ in high school athletes. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: High schools. Patients or Other Participants: The sample consisted of 249 female athletes from 3 high schools who competed in 33 interscholastic, school-sponsored sport teams, dance teams, and cheerleading or pom-pon squad during the 2006-2007 school year. Each athlete remained on the roster throughout the season. Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants completed a survey regarding injury type, number of days of sport participation missed, and menstrual history in the past year. Results: The prevalences of Ml and INJ were 19.7% and 63.1%, respectively. Athletes who reported Ml sustained; higher percentage of severe injuries (missing >22 days of practice or competition) than did athletes who reported normal menses. Although the trend was not significant, athletes with Ml were almost 3 times more likely to sustain an injury resulting in 7 or more days of time lost from sport (odds ratio = 2.7, 9591 confidence interval = 0.8, 8.8) than those who sustained an in jury resulting in 7 or fewer days of time lost. Conclusions: The incidences of Ml and INJ in this high school population during the study period were high. Athlete; who reported Ml sustained a higher percentage of severe injuries than did athletes who reported normal menses. Education programs to increase knowledge and improve management o Ml and its potential effects on injury in female high school athletes are warranted.

450,{Exploring weight-related teasing and depression among overweight and obese adolescents},"{Introduction. - Weight-related stigma is pervasive and often is founded on the assumption that weight is controllable; therefore, those who are overweight and obese are thought to be weakwilled, lazy, and lacking self-control. As targets of weight stigma, over 30\% of overweight and obese youth experience weight-related teasing, which is associated with depression, a serious mental health condition that puts young people at risk for myriad of other health problems. To date, little is known about the psychological mechanisms that underlie the teasing-depression relationship. Objective. - Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine self-esteem and body satisfaction as possible mediators of the association between weight-related teasing and depression among overweight and obese middle school boys and girls. Method. - Participants included 143 girls and 200 boys in grades 6 through 8 with measured BMIs 85th percentile for age and sex. Demographic information and pubertal development were collected via questionnaire. Height and weight were measured during state mandated school-based physical fitness testing. Participants also completed the Weight/Size Teasing subscale of the Physical appearance Related Teasing Scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children, General Self-Esteem scale from the Self-Description Questionnaire II, and Body subscale of the Body Parts Satisfaction Scale-Revised (girls)/Body Parts Satisfaction Scale for Men (boys). Results. - Weight-based teasing was positively related with depression; teasing and depression were inversely associated with self-esteem and body satisfaction. Bootstrap confidence interval mediation models were tested. Self-esteem and body satisfaction mediated the relationship between teasing and depression, with gender, BMI percentile, race, and pubertal status controlled for in the models. Selfe-steem accounted for 48\% of the total model, body satisfaction accounted for 9\% of the total model. Conclusion. - The results of this study extend previous research by identifying self-esteem and body satisfaction as possible psychological constructs that help to explain the nature of the relationship between weight-related teasing and depression among overweight and obese youth. Results indicated that overweight and obese adolescents, self-esteem and body dissatisfaction may play a role in the extent to which weight-related teasing is associated with depression. Low self-esteem and body dissatisfaction may exacerbate the experience of teasing whereas positive general self-evaluations may protect against the deleterious influence of teasing on depression. Although public health efforts often focus on weight loss and behavior change as a way to enhance mental health, these results suggest that intervening on protective mechanisms may offer an alternative approach. Additional research is needed to determine if and how self-esteem and body satisfaction can be enhanced among overweight and obese youth via interventions in order to reduce the possible influence of teasing on depression.

451,{A Pelvic Health Curriculum in School Settings: The Effect on Adolescent Females' Knowledge},"{Study Objective: In this pilot study we ascertained baseline knowledge of pelvic anatomy and function among female adolescents and tested the educational effectiveness of a pelvic health curriculum among female adolescent students with the hypothesis that teaching pelvic anatomy, muscle, and organ function, and pelvic hygiene increases pelvic health knowledge. Design: Intervention-control group, community-based effectiveness study. Setting: Three Chicago area schools with racial minority and low-income student populations were selected as study sites. Participants: One hundred sixty-eight students with a mean age of 14.1 (+/- 0.1) years. Most (69\%) self-reported race as black or African American; 23.8\% reported Hispanic ethnicity. Interventions: Pelvic health teachers delivered 6 weekly, 1-hour classes (intervention group, n = 103; control group, n = 65). A comparison control group received standard curricula (physical education or science). Main Outcome: Measures Knowledge change was measured using the Adolescent Bladder and Pelvic Health Questionnaire. We used ?2 tests to compared bivariate differences between study arms and generalized equation estimate to test for before and after change across groups. Results: Baseline pelvic anatomy and function knowledge was minimal. The level of anatomical knowledge was very low with few in either group correctly able to identify where urine exits the body or the number of openings in the vulva. After intervention, significant increases in knowledge included pelvic floor muscle awareness in the control and intervention group (20\% vs 89\%; P < .001), pelvic floor muscle exercise benefit (31\% vs 78\%; P < .001), and knowledge that urine loss was abnormal (25.4\% vs 60\%; P < .001). More participants correctly identified organs within the pelvic structure, the vagina (21.5\% vs 51.5\%; P < .001), pelvic floor (16.9\% vs 57.3\%; P < .001), and the bladder (12.3\% vs 42.7\%; P < .001). Conclusion: In this study we identified pelvic-related knowledge deficits among female adolescents and suggest that short-term pelvic health educational intervention results in significant knowledge acquisition.}",Chicago;Pilot Projects;Adolescent,"Hebert-Beirne, Jennifer M. and O'Conor, Rachel and Ihm, Jeni Donatelli and Parlier, Molly Kirk and Lavender, Missy D. and Brubaker, Linda",,0,446
452,{Developmental and physical-fitness associations with gross motor coordination problems in Peruvian children},"{The aims of this cross-sectional study were to examine the developmental characteristics (biological maturation and body size) associated with gross motor coordination problems in 5193 Peruvian children (2787 girls) aged 6-14 years from different geographical locations, and to investigate how the probability that children suffer with gross motor coordination problems varies with physical fitness. Children with gross motor coordination problems were more likely to have lower flexibility and explosive strength levels, having adjusted for age, sex, maturation and study site. Older children were more likely to suffer from gross motor coordination problems, as were those with greater body mass index. However, more mature children were less likely to have gross motor coordination problems, although children who live at sea level or at high altitude were more likely to suffer from gross motor coordination problems than children living in the jungle. Our results provide evidence that children and adolescents with lower physical fitness are more likely to have gross motor coordination difficulties. The identification of youths with gross motor coordination problems and providing them with effective intervention programs is an important priority in order to overcome such developmental problems, and help to improve their general health status.

453,{A prospective study of the impact of child maltreatment and friend support on psychological distress trajectory: From adolescence to emerging adulthood},"{Background: Transition into adulthood is a critical developmental period that may be influenced by adverse life events as well as by protective factors. This study aimed at investigating the effect of different forms of child maltreatment experienced prior to age 14 (i.e., sexual abuse, physical abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence), and of friend support at age 14 on the psychological distress trajectory from age 14 to 24. Methods: Participants were 605 adolescents from the general population involved in a 10-year longitudinal study. Psychological distress was evaluated at ages 14, 16, 18 and 24. Child maltreatment prior to 14 years was retrospectively assessed at 14 and 24 years while perception of support from friends was evaluated at age 14. Results: Multilevel growth modeling indicated that psychological distress followed a significant decreasing curvilinear trajectory, with participants reporting fewer distressing psychological symptoms after 18 years. All three forms of child maltreatment, as well as their cumulative effect, predicted more psychological distress over 10 years above and beyond the protective effect of support from friends. Higher support from friends at age 14 was related to lower distress at baseline andover 10 years, beyond the effect of child maltreatment. Limitations: Self-report nature of all measures, attrition, and measures of child maltreatment forms. Conclusions: Psychological distress decreased during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood. Results also revealed the detrimental impact of child maltreatment and the promotive role of friend support, which underscore the importance of early intervention. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

454,{Preventing Eating Disorders among Young Elite Athletes: A Randomized Controlled Trial},"{Purpose To examine the effect of a 1-yr school-based intervention program to prevent the development of new cases of eating disorders (ED) and symptoms associated with ED among adolescent female and male elite athletes. Methods All 16 Norwegian Elite Sport High Schools were included (intervention group {[}n = 9] and control group {[}n = 7]). In total, 465 (93.8\%) first-year student athletes were followed during high school (2008-2011, three school years). The athletes completed the Eating Disorder Inventory 2 and questions related to ED before (pretest), immediately after (posttest 1), and 9 months after the intervention (posttest 2). Clinical interviews (Eating Disorder Examination) were conducted after the pretest (all with symptoms {[}n = 115, 97\%] and a random sample without symptoms {[}n = 116, 97\%]), and at posttest 2, all athletes were interviewed (n = 463, 99.6\%). Results Among females, there were no new cases of ED in the intervention schools, while 13\% at the control schools had developed and fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for ED not otherwise specified (n = 7) or bulimia nervosa (n = 1), P = 0.001. The risk of reporting symptoms was lower in the intervention than in the control schools at posttest 1 (odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.45, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.23-0.89). This effect was attenuated by posttest 2 (OR = 0.57, 95\% CI = 0.29-1.09). The intervention showed a relative risk reduction for current dieting (OR = 0.10, 95\% CI = 0.02-0.54) and three or more weight loss attempts (OR = 0.47, 95\% CI = 0.25-0.90). Among males, there was one new case of ED at posttest 2 (control school) and no difference in the risk of reporting symptoms between groups at posttest 1 or 2. Conclusion A 1-yr intervention program can prevent new cases of ED and symptoms associated with ED in adolescent female elite athletes.}",Eating;Adolescent;Eating Disorders;Sports,"Martinsen, Marianne and Bahr, Roald and Borresen, Runi and Holme, Ingar and Pensgaard, Anne Marte and Sundgot-Borgen, Jorunn",,0,449
455,"{The CLIMATE schools combined study: a cluster randomised controlled trial of a universal Internet-based prevention program for youth substance misuse, depression and anxiety}","{Background: Anxiety, depressive and substance use disorders account for three quarters of the disability attributed to mental disorders and frequently co-occur. While programs for the prevention and reduction of symptoms associated with (i) substance use and (ii) mental health disorders exist, research is yet to determine if a combined approach is more effective. This paper describes the study protocol of a cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the CLIMATE Schools Combined intervention, a universal approach to preventing substance use and mental health problems among adolescents. Methods/design: Participants will consist of approximately 8400 students aged 13 to 14-years-old from 84 secondary schools in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland, Australia. The schools will be cluster randomised to one of four groups; (i) CLIMATE Schools Combined intervention; (ii) CLIMATE Schools -Substance Use; (iii) CLIMATE Schools -Mental Health, or (iv) Control (Health and Physical Education as usual). The primary outcomes of the trial will be the uptake and harmful use of alcohol and other drugs, mental health symptomatology and anxiety, depression and substance use knowledge. Secondary outcomes include substance use related harms, self-efficacy to resist peer pressure, general disability, and truancy. The link between personality and substance use will also be examined. Discussion: Compared to students who receive the universal CLIMATE Schools -Substance Use, or CLIMATE Schools - Mental Health or the Control condition (who received usual Health and Physical Education), we expect students who receive the CLIMATE Schools Combined intervention to show greater delays to the initiation of substance use, reductions in substance use and mental health symptoms, and increased substance use and mental health knowledge.}",Internet;Anxiety;Mental Disorders;Physical Education and Training;Adolescent,"Teesson, Maree and Newton, Nicola C. and Slade, Tim and Chapman, Cath and Allsop, Steve and Hides, Leanne and McBride, Ny and , a and Mewton, Louise and Tonks, Zoe and Birrell, Louise and Brownhill, Louise and Andrews, Gavin",,0,450
456,"{The combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines and the total number of vaccines are not associated with development of autism spectrum disorder: The first case-control study in Asia}","{Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and general vaccinations, including measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, in Japanese subjects, a population with high genetic homogeneity. Patients and methods: A case-control study was performed. Cases (n = 189) were diagnosed with ASD, while controls (n=224) were volunteers from general schools, matched by sex and birth year to cases. Vaccination history and prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal factors from the Maternal and Child Health handbook, which was part of each subject's file, were examined. To determine the relationship between potential risk factors and ASD, crude odds ratios (ORS) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were calculated, and the differences in mean values of the quantitative variables between cases and controls were analyzed using an unpaired t-test. Moreover, MMR vaccination and the effect of the number of vaccine injections were investigated using a conditional multiple regression model. Results: For MMR vaccination, the OR was 1.04 (95\% CI, 0.65-1.68), and no significant differences were found for the other vaccines. For all of the prenatal, perinatal and neonatal factors, there were no significant differences between cases and controls. Furthermore, regarding the presence of ASD, MMR vaccination and the number of vaccine injections had ORs of 1.10 (95\% CI, 0.64-1.90) and 1.10 (95\% CI, 0.95-1.26), respectively, in the conditional multiple regression model; no significant differences were found. Conclusions: In this study, there were not any convincing evidences that MMR vaccination and increasing the number of vaccine injections were associated with an increased risk of ASD in a genetically homogeneous population. Therefore, these findings indicate that there is no basis for avoiding vaccination out of concern for ASD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004 in 100 primary schools of a large French region, with 2,341 children aged 6-11 randomly selected. Child weight and height, lifestyle variables (leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), watching television (TV), playing video games), and socioeconomic characteristics were collected in parent-administered questionnaires. Child psychopathology outcomes were assessed using child-and parent-reported instruments (Dominic Interactive (DI) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)). Overweight and obesity were estimated according to the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) definition. Response rates to the parent questionnaire and DI were 57.4 and 95.1\%, respectively. Final sample size was 1,030 children. According to the IOTF, 17.3\% of the children were overweight, of whom 3.3\% were obese. In univariate analysis, correlates of overweight were low parental education, low monthly income, Disadvantaged School Areas (DSAs), self-reported generalized anxiety, parent-reported conduct disorders, emotional problems, and peer difficulties. High monthly income was less frequently associated with overweight. In multivariate analysis, parent-reported peer difficulties (odds ratio (OR) = 2.06; 95\% confidence interval = 1.27-3.35) and DSAs (1.88; 1.03-3.44) were independent factors significantly associated with child overweight. There was a trend of being overweight with elevated TV times (P for trend = 0.02). The psychosocial burden of excess weight appears to be significant even in young children. Findings should be considered for preventing strategies and public health interventions. School-based overweight prevention programs should be implemented first in disadvantaged areas together with information about weight stigmatization and discrimination.}",Child;Cross-Sectional Studies;Only Child,"Pitrou, Isabelle and Shojaei, Taraneh and Wazana, Ashley and Gilbert, Fabien and Kovess-Masfety, Viviane",,0,452
458,{Low Back Pain in Adolescents: A Comparison of Clinical Outcomes in Sports Participants and Nonparticipants},"{Context: Back pain is common in adolescents. Participation in sports has been identified as a risk factor for the development of back pain in adolescents, but the influence of sports participation on treatment outcomes in adolescents has not been adequately examined. Objective: To examine the clinical outcomes of rehabilitation for adolescents with low back pain (LBP) and to evaluate the influence of sports participation on outcomes. Design: Observational study. Setting: Outpatient physical therapy clinics. Patients or Other Participants: Fifty-eight adolescents (age = 15.40 +/- 1.44 years; 56.90\% female) with LBP referred for treatment. Twenty-three patients (39.66\%) had developed back pain from sports participation. Intervention(s): Patients completed the Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire and numeric pain rating before and after treatment. Treatment duration and content were at the clinician's discretion. Adolescents were categorized as sports participants if the onset of back pain was linked to organized sports. Additional data collected included diagnostic imaging before referral, clinical characteristics, and medical diagnosis. Main Outcome Measure(s): Baseline characteristics were compared based on sports participation. The influence of sports participation on outcomes was examined using a repeated-measures analysis of covariance with the Oswestry and pain scores as dependent variables. The number of sessions and duration of care were compared using t tests. Results: Many adolescents with LBP receiving outpatient physical therapy treatment were involved in sports and cited sports participation as a causative factor for their LBP. Some differences in baseline characteristics and clinical treatment outcomes were noted between sports participants and non-participants. Sports participants were more likely to undergo magnetic resonance imaging before referral (P = .013), attended more sessions (mean difference = 1.40, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.21, 2.59, P = .022) over a longer duration (mean difference = 12.44 days, 95\% CI = 1.28, 23.10, P = .024), and experienced less improvement in disability (mean Oswestry difference = 6.66, 95\% CI = 0.53, 12.78, P = .048) than nonparticipants. Overall, the pattern of clinical outcomes in this sample of adolescents with LBP was similar to that of adults with LBP. Conclusions: Adolescents with LBP due to sports participation received more treatment but experienced less improvement in disability than nonparticipants. This may indicate a worse prognosis for sports participants.

459,{A Cross-cultural Study of the Back Pain Beliefs of Female Undergraduate Healthcare Students},"{Objectives: To determine if country (Australia, Taiwan, Singapore), undergraduate healthcare course (physiotherapy, nursing), low back pain (LBP) history, and year of course influenced various back pain belief's in undergraduate female healthcare Students. Methods: Three hundred and 82 female undergraduate nursing and physiotherapy students completed questionnaires examining: the inevitability of future life with low back trouble, the LBP beliefs held by healthcare providers and fear avoidance belief's related to physical activity. Also participants completed questionnaires to determine their LBP status. General linear models were used to determine whether differences existed for back beliefs scores. Results: Differences were evident in the future consequence of LBP between Countries (P < 0.001), undergraduate course (P < 0.001), and LBP status (P = 0.021). Healthcare provider beliefs were found to be significantly influenced by course only (P < 0.001). Fear avoidance beliefs related to physical activity were influenced by country (P = 0.002) and undergraduate course (P < 0.001). When compared with white Australians, Taiwanese and Singaporean Chinese displayed more negative back beliefs regarding the future consequence of LBP (P < 0.001) and more fear avoidant beliefs toward physical activity (P = 0.021 and P < 0.001, respectively). Further, nursing students had more negative back pain beliefs than physiotherapy students (P < 0.001) and, the experience of LBP was associated with more positive beliefs on the future consequence of back trouble (P = 0.021). Discussion; Findings of this study highlight the importance of country, education, and LBP experience on back pain belief's. The more negative back pain beliefs found in Taiwan and Singapore may reflect current pain beliefs and management attitudes.}",Australia;Questionnaires;Nonlinear Dynamics;Singapore;Taiwan;Physical Therapy Modalities,"Burnett, Angus and Sze, Ching Ching and Tam, Suet May and Yeung, Ka Man and Leong, Michelle and Wang, Wendy T.

460,{Prevalence of and Traits Associated with Low BMD among Female Adolescent Runners},"{Purpose: Identify the prevalence of and traits that may increase the risk of low bone mineral density (BMD) among 93 female adolescent competitive endurance runners. Methods: Participants were 93 high school runners, ages 13-18 yr, from southern California. Eating attitudes and behaviors were assessed using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Menstrual and sports participation history were evaluated using an interviewer-assisted, self-report questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine (L1-L4), total hip, and total body were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The -2 and -1 BMD age-matched, gender-specific z-score cutoffs were used to categorize girls as having low bone mass for age. Results: Among the female runners, 11.8\% and 28\% met the -2 and -1 BMD z-score cutoffs, respectively, whereas 25.8\% reported menstrual irregularity (MI). Total hip BMD, lumbar spine BMD, and lumbar spine BMD z-score were significantly lower in runners with MI after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and lean tissue mass. Runners that participated in five or more compared with three seasons of endurance running exhibited a significantly lower total body and lumbar spine BMD z-score after adjusting for BMI, lean tissue mass, and number of menstrual cycles in the past year. Multiple regression analysis indicated that MI, participation in five or more seasons of endurance running, BMI, and lean tissue mass were independent predictors of low BMD.

461,"{PREVIOUS SUCCESS IN RELATION TO PRIMARY TEACHERS' ATTITUDE TOWARD INCLUSION} - {ERD 2017 - EDUCATION, REFLECTION, DEVELOPMENT, FIFTH EDITION}","{The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between past success and attitude towards the inclusion of students with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream schools. A number of 75 Romanian primary school teachers filled in a questionnaire structured in three parts, with demographic items, attitudes towards the inclusion of pupils with different types of disabilities, perceptions regarding the benefits and inconveniences of inclusive practices and previous experience in teaching students with disabilities. The results of the study revealed an ambivalent attitude towards inclusive education. Although aware of the benefits of inclusion, the majority of the subjects considered that pupils with SEN should rather learn in special schools due to the lack of teachers' abilities to manage inclusive classrooms. Attitude towards inclusion also varies according to the nature and severity of the disability, teachers being more willing to accept pupils with social and mental/learning disabilities than students with behavioural or physical/sensory disabilities. The previous success in teaching students with disabilities was associated with more positive attitudes. Demographic variables like age, level of training or teaching experience had no significant impact on teachers' attitude. The findings of this study highlight the need for teacher support in the inclusive process. Positive inclusive teaching experiences are needed in order to create a sense of success, necessary to increase teachers' responsiveness to inclusive philosophy.

Embedded within the ``core expertise{''} of inclusive pedagogy, the study draws on a sample of twenty-one mainstream ECD teachers purposively selected from the educational province. Entrenched within qualitative phenomenological methodology, individual semi-structured interviews, non-participant observation and document analysis were conducted to collect data. The study used a constant comparative approach of data organisation with continual adjustment throughout the analysis. Participants had systemic concerns about inclusion in mainstream ECD including the lack of physical facilities, time, clear and specific policy, finance, support services and flexible curricula. Participants also had teaching related concerns about inclusion including stakeholders' negative attitudes, large class sizes, inadequate professional preparation and the nature and severity of disabilities. The institutionalisation of individual and institutional capacity building strategies could optimise inclusion in mainstream ECD in Zimbabwe.}",Zimbabwe,"Majoko, Taw and , a",,0,457
463,{The differentiated impact of Kangaroo Class programmes in Quebec primary schools: examining behavioural improvements in relation to student characteristics},"{Inspired by Nurture Groups, Kangaroo Class (KC) programmes have been gradually expanding in francophone schools throughout the Canadian Province of Quebec. These classes are designed for primary students with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties (SEBDs) and aim to provide children with a nurturing and predictable environment. To date, KC research data show only moderate improvements in attendees' behaviour. The aim of this study is to differentiate the characteristics of children with a positive behavioural trajectory from those with a negative behavioural trajectory after 2 years of attending KC by examining the sample group in light of their prior educational history, family-specific factors and types of SEBDs. Results indicate that the primary school children whose behaviour improved after 2 years attending KC had entered the programme displaying higher levels of adjustment difficulties and a greater incidence of internalising behaviours in contrast to those whose behaviour deteriorated. These preliminary results, although obtained through a very small sample size, might warily suggest that when a KC admission choice must be made between a range of potential programme candidates, selecting children with internalising behaviours over those with externalising behaviours would likely lead to more effective outcomes.}",Child;Only Child;Macropodidae;Quebec,"Lavoie, Christine and Couture, Caroline and Begin, Jean-Yves and Masse, Line",,0,458

The playground was specifically designed to promote gross motor skills in preschool children; in this study 71 children from local kindergartens came to the park once a week for ten consecutive weeks and were exposed to 30 minutes of free play and 30 minutes of structured activities. Before and after the ten visits, each child completed nine tests to assess levels of motor skills, three for fine-motor skills and six for gross-motor skills. As control, motor skills were also assessed on 39 children from different kindergartens who did not come to the park. The results show that the experimental group who practiced gross-motor activities in the playground for 1 hour a week for 10 weeks improved significantly in 4 out of the 6 gross motor tasks and in none of the fine motor tasks. The data indicate that limited transfer occurred between tasks referring to different domains of motor competences while suggesting cross feeding for improvement of gross-motor skills between different exercises when domains related to physical fitness and strength of specific muscle groups are involved. These results are relevant to the issue of condition(s) appropriate for maintaining and developing motor skills in this age group as well as for the planning, organization and implementation of play and physical activities in kindergartens.}","Child, Preschool;Child;Only Child;Motor Skills","Tortella, Patrizia and Haga, Monika and Loras, Havard and Sigmundsson, Hermundur and Fumagalli, Guido",,0,459

It is the institutions' responsibility to include all people, accept differences, adapt physical spaces and existent structures, and adjust pedagogical practices to meet the specific needs of each student, to support and facilitate their learning and academic success. Given the consolidate increase of students with disabilities in Higher Education it is of utmost importance to investigate whether the trajectories of these students in higher education institutions have been guided by principles of inclusive education or if, instead, they consist of a merely integrative process. In addition to the pedagogical component, it is important to understand if students with disabilities socialize with their peers and to what extent they consider to be included in the school community. For this purpose, we intend to analyse in this study the perceptions of ten students with disabilities in the University of Aveiro (UA) about their path in higher education, in a pedagogical, institutional and sociability perspective. Results suggest that students with disabilities consider that the UA is well prepared to receive them and has a support structure to accommodate and help students with disabilities. Also, there are readily available services to respond to the needs of students with disabilities and the procedures implemented facilitate the student's academic path. Findings also suggest that socialization practices and other academia activities promote the inclusion of students with disabilities in the context of normalization.}",,"Ferreira, Joana and Fonseca, Henrique and Santos, Lucilia and Ambrosio, Susana",,0,461

Methods: Fifteen students (aged 12-18) with physical disabilities, included in mainstream classrooms in Sweden, and their teachers took part in the intervention. Pre-, post-, and follow-up data were collected with Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), a computer usage diary, and with the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS). Teachers' opinions of goal setting were collected at follow-up. Results: The intervention improved the goal-related computer usage in educational tasks and teachers reported they would use goal setting again when appropriate. At baseline, students reported a positive impact from computer usage with no differences over time regarding the PIADS subscales independence, adaptability, or self-esteem. Discussion: The AT intervention showed a positive effect on computer usage as AT in mainstream schools. Some additional support to teachers is recommended as not all students improved in all goal-related computer usage. A clinical implication is that students' computer usage can be improved and collaboratively established computer-based strategies can be carried out by teachers in mainstream schools.}",Pilot Projects;Disabled Persons;Self-Help Devices,"Borgestig, Maria and Falkmer, Torbjorn and Hemmingsson, Helena",,0,462

Nine- and 12-year-old Swiss children (N = 351) from inclusive and noninclusive classrooms provided moral judgments and moral emotion attributions following six vignettes about social exclusion of children with disabilities. Children also reported on their level of sympathy towards children with disabilities and their contact intensity with children with disabilities. Overall, children condemned disability-based exclusion, attributed few positive emotions to excluder targets, and expressed high sympathy for children with disabilities, independent of age and educational setting. However, younger children from inclusive classrooms exhibited more moral judgments and moral emotions than younger children from noninclusive classrooms. Moreover, children who expressed high sympathy towards children with disabilities were more likely to report frequent contact with children with disabilities. The findings extend existing research on social exclusion by examining disability-based exclusion and are discussed with respect to developmental research on social and moral judgments and emotions following children's inclusion and exclusion decisions.

In order to examine these, we analysed a series of statements made by students in Finland, Norway and Sweden. The specific aims were to see how these views can be seen as supportive or challenging for inclusion in schools. A questionnaire with one closed question and two open-ended questions was used in all countries. The results show that students in similar Nordic countries have different views about inclusion. Norwegian students mostly supported inclusion while Finnish students expressed the most reservations. The arguments about inclusion by Norwegian students were the most pupil-focused; those by Finns were teacher-focused, with Swedes being in between. The results seem to reflect the educational policy in these countries. Discussions, more information, as well as good models of inclusion seem to be needed.

The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of and risk factors associated with stunting among urban school children and adolescents in Abeokuta, Nigeria. Five hundred and seventy children aged 5-19 years were selected using the multi-stage random-sampling technique. Stunting was defined as height-for-age z-score (HAZ) of <=-2 standard deviation (SD) of the National Center for Health Statistics reference. Severe stunting was defined as HAZ of <=-3 SD. The mean age of the children was 12.2 +/- 3.41 years, and 296 (51.5\%) were males. Ninety-nine (17.4\%) children were stunted. Of the stunted children, 20 (22.2\%) were severely stunted. Identified risk factors associated with stunting were attendance of public schools (p<0.001), polygamous family setting (p=0.001), low maternal education (p=0.001), and low social class (p=0.034). Following multivariate analysis with logistic regression, low maternal education (odds ratio=2.4; 95\% confidence interval 1.20-4.9; p=0.015) was the major contributory factor to stunting. Encouraging female education may improve healthcare-seeking behaviour and the use of health services and ultimately reduce stunting and its consequences.}",Child;Prevalence;Nigeria;Only Child;Risk Factors;Adolescent,"Senbanjo, Idowu O. and Oshikoya, Kazeem A. and Odusanya, Olumuyiwa O. and Njokanma, Olisamedua F.",,0,465

Whether VWD is associated with health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in children is unknown. Objectives: This nationwide cross-sectional study measured HR-QoL in children with moderate or severe VWD. Our primary aim was to compare HR-QoL of VWD patients with that of reference populations. Additionally, we studied the impact of bleeding phenotype and VWD type on HR-QoL. Methods: HR-QoL was assessed with the Infant/Toddler QoL Questionnaire (0-5 years) and Child Health Questionnaire (6-15 years), and compared with reference population scores. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the influence of type of VWD and bleeding phenotype on HR-QoL scores. Results: Preschool children (0-5 years, n = 46) with VWD had lower HR-QoL scores for general health perceptions and parental time than reference populations. School children (6-15 years, n = 87) with VWD had lower scores for physical functioning, role functioning - emotional/behavioral, general health perceptions, and physical summary. Type of VWD was associated with HR-QoL in school children for bodily pain, general health perceptions, parental emotion, family activities, and physical summary. Scores of children with type 3 VWD were, on average, 15 points lower than those of the reference population on the above-mentioned scales. A more severe bleeding phenotype was associated with a lower score on 11/15 physical, emotional and social scales. Conclusion: HR-QoL is lower in VWD children than in reference populations, in particular in school children. The negative impact of VWD is sensitive to type of VWD and bleeding phenotype; as well as physical scales, emotional and social scales are affected.}",Questionnaires;Only Child;Infant;Child;Cross-Sectional Studies;Phenotype;Quality of Life,"de Wee, E.

Little is known about this relationship in an adolescent competitive sports population. Objective: To examine the relationship among disordered eating, menstrual dysfunction, and low bone mineral density (BMD) and musculoskeletal injury among girls in high school sports. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: The sample consisted of 163 female athletes competing in 8 interscholastic sports in southern California during the 2003-2004 school year. Each participant was followed throughout her respective sport season for occurrence of musculoskeletal injuries. Main Outcome Measure(s): Data collected included daily injury reports, the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire that assessed disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan that measured BMD and lean tissue mass, anthropometric measurements, and a questionnaire on menstrual history and demographic characteristics. Results: Sixty-one athletes (37.4\%) incurred 90 musculoskeletal injuries. In our BMD z score model of <=-1 SD, a history of oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea during the past year and low BMD (z score <=-1 SD) were associated with the occurrence of musculoskeletal injury during the interscholastic sport season. In our BMD z score model of <=-2 SDs, disordered eating (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire score >= 4.0), a history of oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea during the past year, and a low BMD (z score <=-2 SDs) were associated with musculoskeletal injury occurrence. Conclusions: These findings indicate that disordered eating, oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, and low BMD were associated with musculoskeletal injuries in these female high school athletes. Programs designed to identify and prevent disordered eating and menstrual dysfunction and to increase bone mass in athletes may help to reduce musculoskeletal injuries.}",Prospective Studies;Eating;Eating Disorders;Sports;Bone Density,"Rauh, Mitchell J. and Nichols, Jeanne F. and Barrack, Michelle T.",,0,467

The survey was conducted in October-November 1999, approximately four years after the war.RESULTSAt the time of survey, well-being of children in Sarajevo was still heavily impacted by many various unhealthy life conditions and psychosocial stressors. Many school-age children lived in unhealthy and dangerous environment, including overcrowded living conditions (40%), unsafe playgrounds (68%), and no access to sports fields (52%). Most felt unsafe on streets (74%), many (73%) coped with one or more school problems, and even 84% were ill at least once during the past 12 months. General poverty was the prime stressor (common variance explained: 23.5%), followed by school- and health-related risks (common variance explained: 17.0%). At the third place were family-associated risk factors impacting children's health and development, such as overcrowded living conditions and lack of social support within their own family (common variance explained: 10.5%). Parents and teachers also lived and worked in stressful life conditions and were concerned for both their children's and their own well-being. Despite all that, most children tended to use healthy strategies in coping with stressful events in their everyday lives.CONCLUSIONThe reinforcement of children with positive (healthy) coping skills and strengthening of their social support networks seems to be the most important intervention strategy to help the war-traumatized children in Bosnia and Herzegovina.","Social Support;Parents;Only Child;War;Adaptation, Psychological;epidemiology;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Warfare;diagnosis;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Population Surveillance;Child;Bosnia and Herzegovina;Female;Stress, Psychological;Adolescent;Self Concept;Child Behavior;Regression Analysis;Sampling Studies;Urban Population;Male;Probability;Child, Preschool;Risk Factors;Psychology;Humans;Prognosis;Severity of Illness Index;Index Medicus","Bar√†th, Arp√°d",2002.0,0,471

Design: Cluster two arm randomised controlled trial. Setting: National Health Service trust, England. Participants: 37 office clusters (146 participants) of desk based workers: 19 clusters (77 participants) were randomised to the intervention and 18 (69 participants) to control. Interventions: The intervention group received a height adjustable workstation, a brief seminar with supporting leaflet, workstation instructions with sitting and standing targets, feedback on sitting and physical activity at three time points, posters, action planning and goal setting booklet, self monitoring and prompt tool, and coaching sessions (month 1 and every three months thereafter). The control group continued with usual practice. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was occupational sitting time (thigh worn accelerometer). Secondary outcomes were objectively measured daily sitting, prolonged sitting (‚â• 30 minutes), and standing time, physical activity, musculoskeletal problems, self reported work related health (job performance, job satisfaction, work engagement, occupational fatigue, sickness presenteeism, and sickness absenteeism), cognitive function, and self reported psychological measures (mood and affective states, quality of life) assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equation models, accounting for clustering. Results: A significant difference between groups (in favour of the intervention group) was found in occupational sitting time at 12 months (‚àí83.28 min/workday, 95% confidence interval ‚àí116.57 to ‚àí49.98, P = 0.001).

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of a 9-month school intervention focusing on physical self-worth, self-perceived sport competence, body attractiveness, social competences and global self-worth in children aged 10‚Äì13 years. Methods: Taking self-determination theory as its starting point, the intervention was developed and pilot-tested in close co-operation with schools. It targeted 1) PE lessons, 2) in-class activity outside PE, and 3) physical activity during break-time. It used a cluster-randomized design to select 24 Danish schools either for intervention or for control. Survey data on self-perception variables, socio-demographics and physical activity was collected prior to intervention and after 9 months. Results: A total of 2797 children were included in the analyses. All five self-perception variables increased between baseline and follow-up, and there were no significant differences between intervention and control schools. Sub-group analyses of gender, social class, body image and leisure sport revealed significant differences at baseline for most self-perception variables. For students with no leisure sport participation at the intervention schools, the follow-up results showed a more positive development for global self-worth. Conclusions: Despite limited overall intervention effects on self-perceived competence and self-worth, the intervention appeared to diminish the gap between those groups with most and those with least self-confidence. Even though many of the new activities and approaches were implemented, some teachers were challenged to create a positive social climate.

There is a need to document health and function in the everyday lives of young children with cancer using the multidimensional framework and language of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health‚ÄìChildren and Youth (ICF‚ÄêCY). Aims: The aims of this study were (1) to document health and functioning in the everyday lives of young children with cancer using ICF‚ÄêCY codes and (2) to identify a comprehensive code set that can aid clinical assessment. Method: Interviews with children diagnosed with cancer and their parents, were transcribed, reviewed for content and coded to the ICF‚ÄêCY using linking procedures. Results: A comprehensive code set (     n = 70) for childhood cancer was identified. The majority of content identified to codes was related to activity and participation describing social relations with family, peers and professionals, preschool attendance and play, as well as issues related to support and independence. Conclusions: The ICF‚ÄêCY can be used to document the nature and range of characteristics and consequences of cancer experienced by children. The identified comprehensive code set could be helpful to health care professionals, parents and teachers in assessing and supporting young children's health and everyday life through the cancer trajectory. The comprehensive code set could be developed as a clinical assessment tool for those caring for young children with cancer. The universal language of the ICF‚ÄêCY means that the utility of a clinical assessment tool based on identified codes can have wide reaching effects for the care of young children with cancer.

Moreover, older children more consistently coordinated disability type with context of exclusion. There were also significant differences depending on the type of classroom. The findings extend existing research on exclusion by investigating exclusion based on disability across different age groups and educational settings.

481,Who do students with mild disabilities nominate as cool in inclusive general education classrooms?,"Examined the nominations that elementary students with mild disabilities made for peers they perceived as cool. The total sample was comprised of 948 students (496 girls, 452 boys) from the metropolitan Chicago area and North Carolina and included 107 (11.3%) students with mild disabilities. Overall, students with mild disabilities nominated prosocial and athletic peers who affiliate with students with mild disabilities. However, aggressive boys who are central in the social network were highly likely to view aggressive peers as cool. Results are discussed in relation to implications for social interventions for students with mild disabilities.

482,The self-concept of young people with spina bifida: A population-based study,"Studied self-concept in young people with spina bifida. 79 young people with spina bifida (38 boys and 41 girls) were given a psychological, medical, carer, and occupational therapy assessment. 79 matched able-bodied young people (38 boys and 41 girls) received the psychosocial interview. All Ss were aged 7‚Äì18 yrs 11 mo. The disabled group felt themselves to be less competent in academic, athletic and social aspects of self-concept, less supported by classmates, equally supported by parents and friends and more supported by teachers than the able-bodied group. Disabled Ss experienced greater discrepancies between competence and importance in most academic, athletic, social, and physical appearance aspects of self-concept. Disabled girls assigned very high importance to physical appearance. Physical appearance was more stongly associated with general self-esteem than any other area of self-concept.

483,Responses to music and movement in the development of children with Down's syndrome.,"Physical responses to rhythmic stimuli and music, of different degrees of complexity were registered from 25 children with Down's syndrome and 25 other mentally handicapped children. Required performances were taught and then recorded on video-tape, after which they were assessed by experienced teacher/judges. Whilst there were no overall significant differences between the groups, important differences were detected between the children in different schools with attendant implications for differential treatment. Apart from an overall and general assessment of performance, analysis was made of demographic variables, for example, sex, intelligence, age and social development. It is concluded that specific teaching approaches can significantly effect the development of children with Down's syndrome in such creative aspects of the curriculum as music, movement and dance.",Disabled Children;Only Child;Time Perception;Music;Motor Skills;Motor Activity;Male;Humans;Female;Education of Intellectually Disabled;Down Syndrome;Dancing;Child Development;Child;Adolescent,"Stratford, B and Ching, E Y",1989.0,0,478
484,Psychosocial and Sexual Outcomes in Adolescents following Surgery for Proximal Hypospadias in Childhood,"Purpose: We evaluated psychosocial outcomes, psychosexual development and sexual function in adolescents who had undergone surgery for proximal hypospadias. We hypothesized that these outcomes would be impaired compared to peers. Materials and Methods: We identified 55 males age 14 years or older who underwent surgery for penoscrotal to perineal (intraoperatively defined) hypospadias between 1996 and 2005. A total of 33 patients with a median age of 17.5 years (range 14 to 25) answered a Web based questionnaire with self-constructed questions, completed the validated Psychological General Well-Being Index, Body-Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults and Penile Perception Score, and underwent clinical evaluation. A total of 31 patients with distal hypospadias (median age 19 years, range 14 to 35) and 25 age matched healthy men (17.5 years, range 14 to 25) served as controls. Results: Interest in sex, age at sexarche and satisfaction with sexual experiences were comparable between patients and controls. Three patients with proximal hypospadias (10%) and 1 control (4%) reported occasional erectile problems. Three patients with proximal hypospadias (11%), 1 patient with distal hypospadias (3%) and 1 control (4%) affirmed anejaculation. There were no differences in results between validated questionnaires. Patients with proximal hypospadias were more dissatisfied with penile length (39%) compared to controls (12%, p = 0.049). Concerning physical contact, 10 patients (38%) expressed uncertainty. Extra support in school was more frequent among patients with proximal hypospadias (p = 0.024 vs distal hypospadias, p = 0.068 vs control group). Conclusions: Despite concerns regarding penile length, sexual experiences were comparable to those of other adolescents, although more than a third of patients with proximal hypospadias demonstrated uncertainty on questions relating to desire for physical contact. Specialized tutoring in school was more common in patients with proximal hypospadias.

485,Effect of participation in Taegkyeon on peer status and problem behaviors of infants,"This study is to investigate the influence of Taegkyeon participation on peer status and problem behavior of infants. 70 infants at age 6~7 were selected as the study subjects. 37 infants who participate in Taegkyeon class voluntarily were sampled as experimental group and the other non-participating 33 ones were sampled as control group. The Taegkyeon course was conducted twice a week for 16 weeks. The control group was asked to only go through the regular class schedule at kindergarten. The data were under the t-test, paired t-test. The results were as follows. First, there was no significant difference between experimental and control group in peer status according to Taegkyeon class participation of infants. Second, there was significant difference problem behavior according to Taegkyeon class participation. 6 years old infants showed significant difference between experimental and control group`s attention deficit and noncooperation. And 7 years old infants showed significant difference hyperactivity problem between experimental and control groups.

486,Cognitive behavioral approaches to chronic pain,"Pain is a frequently reported symptom in children, adolescents, and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) (1-4). The negative implications of pain in CF are well-documented, and include associations with lower mood, decreased health-related quality of life, decreased ability to engage in work, general activities, and CF disease management, and poorer physical functioning (4-9). In addition, an increased risk was found for more frequent CF exacerbations and mortality with higher reported pain levels (4). It is helpful to differentiate between acute and chronic pain. Acute pain is typically the result of an identifiable injury and is time-limited, with improvement occurring with healing. Chronic pain is defined as lasting more than 3 months, persisting in the absence of a known cause or beyond an expected time of healing, and can be understood as a condition to be managed (10). There are few studies available of specific interventions to manage pain in CF, and none examining specific psychological approaches to chronic pain management (9). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach, however, that has become a first-line psychosocial treatment for chronic pain (11). CBT is brief, structured, and emphasizes an active problem-solving approach that is rooted within a strong, collaborative therapeutic relationship (10). CBT has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of chronic pain, reducing pain, distress, interference with activities, and associated disability, with small to moderate effect sizes (11,12). CBT can also play an important role in disease-related pain management. For example, there is strong evidence for CBT as a treatment for reducing cancer pain at the time of diagnosis and during treatment (13). Consideration of modest effect sizes may be weighed with associated risks, which are considerably smaller for CBT interventions than for pharmacological approaches to pain management (11). Another potential benefit is that CBT is useful in addressing co-occurring mental health needs. Pain is highly comorbid with depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, and CBT has a large evidencebase for the treatment of these conditions as well (14). Overall, CBT may be considered a useful component of a comprehensive multipronged, individually tailored approach to pain management. A description of cognitive behavioral approaches to pain management follows, with consideration of how a CBT intervention may require tailoring to the specific needs of individuals with CF. The goals of CBT for chronic pain are generally three-fold. First, individuals may find direct symptom relief from behavioral strategies such as relaxation skills. Second, chronic pain is often associated with functional impairment. CBT strategies can help scaffold a return to function, even when there is not a reduction in pain. For example, a CBT approach for a young person who has missed school due to pain would support graded reintegration into the school setting. Third, chronic pain and suffering are often accompanied by feelings of hopelessness, frustration, fear and anxiety, which can in turn exacerbate pain and further limit functioning. CBT emphasizes adaptive attitudes and expectations, including problem-solving when that is effective, as well as balanced, realistic and self-compassionate attitudes to mitigate pain-associated distress. Developmental considerations will also guide treatment. For children, CBT interventions will involve parents, and include coaching on how to best support the child in utilizing coping skills to manage pain, minimizing avoidance behavior, and reinforcing re-integration into an active lifestyle (15). There are several components of a typical CBT intervention for chronic pain. One of the most important is education about the chronic pain cycle in which pain leads to decreased activity and physical deconditioning, which then leads to negative thoughts and emotions. Avoidance of physical activity and social withdrawal in turn leads to further physical disability, distress, and pain (10). The goal of CBT is to break this cycle. Active coping skills taught generally include relaxation techniques to induce the body's natural relaxation response, characterized by slower and more efficient breathing, lower blood pressure, reduced muscle tension, and a feeling of increased well-being. Physical activation is encouraged along with a thoughtful approach to pacing activities. Behavioral activation, the identification and incorporation of meaningful and enjoyable activities, decreasing avoidance and social withdrawal, is a vital component of CBT treatment for both chronic pain and depression. Cognitive strategies work to modify pain-related negative thoughts. For example, many people think in ‚Äúshoulds,‚Äù such as ‚ÄúI shouldn't be having this pain,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI should be able to work a full-time job.‚Äù Harsh, unrealistic expectations fail to motivate as expected and lead to more distress. Pain catastrophizing or believing that the worst-case scenario is inevitable, ‚ÄúI can't do anything when I have pain like this‚Äù can be particularly detrimental. One study in adults with CF found that pain catastrophizing was a predictor of decreased quality of life, suggesting that negative emotions may modulate the pain experience in CF (7). While CBT is known to be useful for chronic pain management, barriers may prevent individuals from accessing these interventions, including lack of availability of trained providers, lack of time, a preference for pharmacology, and lack of interest or motivation (11). The way in which CBT is introduced to patients is likely to be an important factor in uptake of available services. It is important to validate the noxiousness of the pain experience, and directly combat the myth that a psychological referral suggests that pain is ‚Äúonly in the patient's head‚Äù or that the patient is doing a poor job of coping. CBT is not an appropriate referral if the cause of pain has not yet been thoroughly investigated, or without discussion of CBT as one component of a multidisciplinary approach to pain treatment. Tailoring of traditional CBT protocols may also be necessary to meet the unique needs of individuals with CF. A modified CBT would specifically address the emotional challenges and stressors associated with managing CF, how pain interacts and interferes with CF self-management, and barriers to access care. It may be useful to consider the integration of CBT provision with routine CF care and innovative models of delivery, such as telehealth.","Cystic Fibrosis;Problem Solving;Adaptation, Psychological;Motor Activity;Child;Relaxation Therapy;Cognitive Therapy;Pain Management;Adult;Disease Management;Behavior Therapy;Only Child;Adolescent;Quality of Life;wellbeing;telehealth;sleep disorder;skill;self care;relaxation training;quality of life;psychosocial withdrawal;problem solving;physical disability;physical activity;patient referral;nonhuman;muscle tone;motivation;mortality;mood;mental health;male;lifestyle;injury;hopelessness;head;functional disease;full time employment;frustration;female;expectation;effect size;education;distress syndrome;disease exacerbation;diagnosis;cystic fibrosis;coping behavior;conference abstract;cognitive behavioral therapy;chronic pain;catastrophizing;cancer pain;breathing;blood pressure;avoidance behavior;anxiety;animal model;animal experiment;analgesia;adult","D., Friedman",2018.0,0,481
487,"Eating disorder mental health literacy: What do psychologists, naturopaths, and fitness instructors know?","At present, there are no known studies investigating the eating disorder mental health literacy (ED-MHL) of common frontline health providers such as psychologists, naturopaths, and fitness instructors. Little research also exists around practitioner knowledge for the spectrum of eating disorders. The current study sought to fill these research gaps and comprised 115 health practitioners who completed an online survey. A fictional vignette describing a female (Sarah) experiencing a subthreshold bulimic variant without purging was presented alongside common ED-MHL items. Almost 4 in 10 psychologists, 7 in 10 natural therapists, and 8 in 10 fitness instructors failed to detect a general eating disorder, with the latter two groups more likely to believe the problem was a self-esteem issue. Perceived helpfulness of people and interventions varied from best practice clinical guidelines, with physical/medical risk management not prioritized, pharmacotherapy viewed poorly, and doctors seen as one of the least helpful people. Although Sarah‚Äôs problem was seen as severe and highly common (which may speak to the volume of undetected eating disorders), alarmingly 36.7% of fitness instructors viewed her predicament as desirable given weight lost. This novel study highlights the need for specific training interventions to improve health practitioners‚Äô ED-MHL, particularly around atypical eating disorder presentations, which may facilitate earlier detection and help-seeking for evidence-based interventions rather than expenditure on unhelpful or even harmful treatments, leading to improved community health and lives saved.",Risk Management;Cathartics;Mental Health;Eating;Mental Disorders;Eating Disorders;young adult;training;school child;retrospective study;research;psychologist;program acceptability;prognosis;prevalence;preschool child;practice guideline;polypharmacy;obesity;mental health;male;major clinical study;Likert scale;life expectancy;intervention study;incidence;ICD-10;human;health service;health practitioner;health literacy;health care organization;health care cost;general practitioner;female;evidence based medicine;eating disorder;disease severity assessment;dietitian;demography;cooperation;community care;child;bulimia;body weight loss;article;anorexia nervosa;analysis of variance;alternative medicine;adult;adolescent;accuracy;antidepressant agent,"K.A., Worsfold and J.K., Sheffield",2018.0,0,482

When these symptoms persist, they can impair function and progress to a somatic symptom and related disorder (SSRD), resulting in increased health care use and increased demands on primary care providers (PCPs). We performed a needs assessment among PCPs to better understand how best to support providers caring for children with SSRDs. Pediatric PCPs (n = 77) were surveyed to better understand their training, experience, perceptions, and practices of SSRD care. Findings indicate that PCPs have limited training in SSRD care but express interest in learning more. Many barriers to effective care were reported.

489,Democracy or fellowship and participation with peers: what constitutes one‚Äôs choice to self-segregate?,"Democracy in an inclusive discourse in education relates to all children‚Äôs rights to comment upon and influence matters concerning their interest in education. The article‚Äôs empirical data are based on a girl categorised with intellectual disability who through her surroundings is granted the right to influence her physical placement in school, which results in her often choosing to segregate herself from the fellowship with peers. This creates a dilemma for the school, which is faced with the question of overruling her decision in favour of other aspects of inclusion such as fellowship and participation or to continue supporting her decision to segregate. Based on theoretical contributions by Ian Hacking and Lev Vygotskij, this article discusses how schools and teachers approach children that are categorised as intellectually disabled and how the category influences the construction of their identity. Further, constructions of identity govern how the child views themselves and their surroundings. How they understand themselves in relation to the context and situations they are part of will ultimately affect what needs, wishes and compensation strategies the child develops.

490,Changes in return to work among patients in vocational rehabilitation: a self-determination theory perspective,"PURPOSE: The aim of the current study was to examine whether patient perceptions of autonomy support from the treatment team in a vocational rehabilitation program will be associated with change (increase) in need satisfaction, autonomous motivation, perceived competence, well-being, physical activity, and return to work (RTW), and whether the self-determination theory (SDT) Model of Health Behavior will provide adequate fit to the data.     METHOD: A total of 90 participants were enrolled in a longitudinal study and completed measures at four time points over 15 months.     RESULTS: Participants reported increases in all variables, and in general these changes were maintained at six weeks post-rehabilitation and at 15 months post-baseline. As well, the SDT Model of Health Behavior provided adequate fit to the data.     CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the importance of health care practitioners' providing support for their patients' autonomy, competence, and relatedness to improve well-being, physical activity, and RTW in the context of vocational rehabilitation. Implications for Rehabilitation Vocational rehabilitation that emphasizes physical activity is associated with increases in patients' well-being, physical activity, and return to work (RTW). It is important for health care practitioners to provide support for their patients' autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the context of vocational rehabilitation, as doing so is associated with increases in patients' autonomous motivation, perceived competence, and psychosocial outcomes.","Rehabilitation;Longitudinal Studies;Rehabilitation, Vocational;vocational rehabilitation;satisfaction;return to work;personal autonomy;motivation;male;longitudinal study;human;health behavior;female;exercise;adult","A., Farholm and H., Halvari and C.P., Niemiec and G.C., Williams and E.L., Deci",2017.0,0,485
491,The long term follow up of functional health status of adolescents who have undergone cardiopulmonary bypass in infancy,"Background: Congenital heart surgery survivors are at risk of poorer functional health outcomes compared with healthy peers. 35 neurologically normal infants aged less than 6 months underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for congenital heart disease between 1999 and 2001. Assessment at 1 and 5 years post procedure demonstrated impaired cognitive, behavioural and neuropsychological performance. This study describes the neuropsychological and functional health of adolescents with congenital heart disease followed since infancy. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. Participants underwent medical review, genetic screening, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment and a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Parents also completed rating scales. Results: 21 patients, 95% of whom had a biventricular circulation, were assessed at median age 15.4 years (range, 14-17 years). All patients were NYHA classification 1, reporting peak physical activity ranging from sedentary to competitive sport. A deletionwas detected on 8q22.3 following SNP array analysis in one patient. While global intelligence was in the average range (94.3+12.7; p=0.06), adolescents scored significantly lower than expected across various neurodevelopmental areas compared to the general population including cognitive domains of working memory and processing speed. Participants also performed below expected on a test of mathematical achievement. Deficits in attention, executive function and visual-spatial ability were found. In social-emotional and adaptive domains, participants reported more learning problems, poorer attitude to teachers, higher sense of inadequacy and poorer selfreliance. Parent scales indicated poorer home living abilities in their children. Adolescents described more positive family relations, while parents reported less aggression and fewer externalising problems. Adolescents and parents reported significantly lower HRQoL across all domains. Conclusions: These results are consistent with previously described outcomes for this cohort, and with patterns of impairment reported in international studies.

492,Contextual factors that impact on the life of children with vision impairment,"Purpose: Existing research on children with low vision has been limited mainly to investigation of functional vision and participation. The aim of this cross-sectional qualitative study was to obtain and analyse output from focus groups with children with vision impairment and related persons to develop themes on vision-related participation restrictions, personal and environmental contextual factors that impact on children with vision impairment to better understand its impact for delivery of services. Methods: Children aged from 8 to 17 years with vision impairment in regular or special schools, their peers with normal vision (age 8-17 years), parents, teachers, and vision rehabilitation specialists participated in 74 focus groups in urban and rural areas of southern India; all were lead by the same person. Statements were recorded and entered into a database. Three levels of sorting were conducted to group items from all participants. For triangulation 3 people conducted the final grouping of statements into categories and collaborated to finalise the inclusion and grouping of statements. Results: A total of 537 people (194 children with low vision, 212 peers, 28 parents, 51 teachers and 12 rehabilitation specialists) generated 1,617 statements. After the three stages of sorting to group similar items, 522 items were grouped in 4 major areas: body functions (sensory, vision, mental), activities and participation (social, personal interactions, learning and applying knowledge, mobility), environmental (attitudes of others, support and relationships, products and services, policies) and personal factors. The further sorting of statements by 20 participants (including 12 children with low vision) resulted in > 100 themes. Of the 522 statements 76% were rated as important and 72% relevant. The majority of statements were barriers with attitudinal statements most common. Conclusions: It was not only vision related statements of a person's activity and participation but the physical, social and attitudinal, environment and personal contextual factors that were of importance for inclusion. The next stage using concept mapping will help develop a questionnaire which could be used to guide low vision rehabilitation service delivery and setting policy for inclusion of children with vision impairment.","Child;Vision, Low;Only Child;teacher;school child;school;rural area;rehabilitation center;rehabilitation;questionnaire;qualitative research;mental performance;male;major clinical study;low vision;learning;information processing;India;human;female;controlled study;conference abstract;concept mapping;child;adolescent","J.E., Keeffe and V., Gothwal and S., Resnikoff and D., Bagga",2017.0,0,487

Design Single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Setting General community. Participants Convenience sample of adults with SCI (N=84; mean time post-SCI, 9.9y; mean age, 46y; 73.8% men; 44% with paraplegia; 58% white). Interventions Trained peer health coaches applied the person-centered health self-management intervention with 42 experimental subjects over 6 months on a tapered call schedule. The 42 control subjects received usual care. Both groups received the MCMC Resource Guide. Main Outcome Measures Primary outcome‚Äîhealth self-management as measured by the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). Secondary outcomes‚Äîglobal ratings of service/resource use, health-related quality of life, and quality of primary care. Results Intervention participants averaged 12 calls over 6 months (averaging 21.8min each), with distinct variation. At 6 months, intervention participants reported a significantly greater change in PAM scores (6mo: estimate, 7.029; 95% confidence interval,.1018‚Äì13.956; P=.0468) compared with controls, with a trend toward significance at 4 months. At 6 months, intervention participants reported a significantly greater decrease in social/role activity limitations (estimate, ‚àí.443; P=.0389), greater life satisfaction (estimate, 1.0091; P=.0522), greater services/resources awareness (estimate, 1.678; P=.0253), greater overall service use (estimate, 1.069; P=.0240), and a greater number of services used (estimate, 1.542; P=.0077). Subgroups most impacted by MCMC on PAM change scores included the following: high social support, white persons, men, 1 to 6 years postinjury, and tetraplegic.

494,Health-related outcomes of the Feldenkrais method in children and adults: State of the art and future perspectives,"Background The Feldenkrais (FK) Method is a contemporary mindful exercise with two techniques: the group method called Awareness Through Movement (ATM) and the one-to-one learning process called Functional Integration (FI). The FK teacher guides students through a sequence of movements either verbally (ATM) or with a gentle, and non-invasive touch (FI). FK has been widely used in the performing arts and in various clinical settings. This review answers questions such as: Who can benefit from FK? What health conditions can be address with FK? And what are the costs? Methods Databases were searched for articles published between January 1976 and September 2016. Additionally, reference lists and conference proceedings were scanned. A systematic review of the retrieved studies was performed and included health condition, study design, type and duration of the intervention, outcome measures and findings. Results The majority of studies applied ATMs to musculoskeletal disorders such as back pain, neck and shoulder complaints in adults or focused neurological diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinsons disease). Based on RCTs there is evidence that FK improves balance and mobility in older adults. Some findings suggest positive effects of FK on cognitive function, anxiety, symptoms of depression, body image and self-confidence. FK interventions with children frequently combined the two techniques FI and ATM to address special needs. Conclusions Future studies should examine whether the beneficial effects of FK on balance and mobility can be replicated in clinical populations with movement limitations.

495,Student teachers‚Äô beliefs about the teacher‚Äôs role in inclusive education,"The main aim of this research is to examine the basic features of student teachers‚Äô professional beliefs about the teacher‚Äôs role in relation to teaching mainstream pupils and pupils with developmental disabilities. The starting assumption of this analysis is that teacher professional development is largely dependent upon teachers‚Äô beliefs about various facets of their professional work. These concepts strongly influence the way that teachers teach and the way that they develop as teachers. The participants in the research are 314 student teachers at the Faculty of Teacher Education of the University of Zagreb who are being prepared to teach in lower grades of primary school. The beliefs were explored using a metaphor technique derived from cognitive theory of metaphor. The differences between beliefs about the perceived teacher role in general, and the perceived teacher role in the education of pupils with developmental disabilities were analysed. The results indicate that the dominant belief about the teacher‚Äôs role in teaching mainstream pupils is of the teacher as a transmitter of knowledge, while the findings regarding the dominant belief about the teacher‚Äôs role in teaching pupils with developmental difficulties appeared to be self-cantered orientation. No differences were found between student teachers at different study levels. The findings are discussed in the light of the curriculum of initial teacher education.",Pupil;Developmental Disabilities;vocational education;teaching hospital;teacher training;student attitude;special education;self concept;school teacher;school attendance;professional development;priority journal;primary school;physical education;high school;education;developmental disorder;article,"V., Domoviƒá and Vlasta V., Vidoviƒá and D., Bouillet",2017.0,0,490
496,"Outcomes, supports and barriers related to intensive exercise participation for adults with chronic moderate-to-severe acquired brain injury","Background and Purpose: Effects of high-intensity group exercise on the endurance, advanced mobility, and gait speed of adults with chronic severe acquired brain injury (ABI) living in brain injury group homes were investigated. In a subsequent qualitative study, supports and barriers related to participation in exercise from the perspectives of participants, residential staff and family members were investigated. Participants: Fourteen adults with chronic severe ABI in supported independent living who could stand with minimal or no assist and walk with or without ambulation device were studied. Initially, eight presented with low ambulatory status, six with high ambulatory status. Interviews were conducted with all 14 intervention subjects, one person who dropped out, four family members and four residential staff. Methods: Participants received a 6-week high-intensity exercise group intervention for 60-90 minutes, 3 days/week assisted by personal trainers under physical therapist supervision. Measures (6-Minute Walk Test, High-level Mobility Assessment Tool and 10-Metrer Walk Test) were collected at baseline, post intervention and 6 weeks later. Analysis included repeated measures T-test and the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. The qualitative study involved a brief survey and semi-structured interviews, conducted 2-6 months after the intervention, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis used preexisting and emerging codes (concepts), and data were double-coded using qualitative data analysis software (atlas.ti). Results: Significant post-intervention group improvements were achieved on all three outcome measures (6 MWT, HiMAT and 10MWT) and were greater than the minimal detectable change (MDC) for this population. 10MWT outcomes indicate that three participants transitioned from low to high ambulatory status and maintained the change 6 weeks later. Qualitative findings identified environmental and personal barriers and supports. Environmental barriers to participation included transportation (inconsistent, delayed), group format (not always person-centred) and negative family attitudes towards programming developed in-house. Personal barriers to participation were physical (vision, balance, incontinence), cognitive (memory, executive function, lack of self-awareness), behavioural (anxiety) and tendency towards a sedentary lifestyle (watching television). Environmental barriers to being physically active between exercise sessions included: staff fear for participant safety, broken equipment and lack of access to supportive affordable fitness opportunities for this population. Environmental and personal supports for participation included enthusiasm of trainers, group format (encouraged mutual support), investments in transportation, pre-injury participation in sports and motivation to do something meaningful that involved interacting with others. Discussion and Conclusion: People living with chronic ABI can improve endurance, demonstrate ability to do advanced gait, and improve ambulatory status with 6 weeks of intensive exercise. Challenges to sustainability of exercise programmes for people with chronic severe ABI include costs and transportation. Efforts to support better lifestyle choices (improved nutritional choices, increased physical activity between sessions) are needed to enhance functional benefits of the intervention.",Adult;Brain;Brain Injuries;Gait;Wilcoxon signed ranks test;vision;velocity;television;Student t test;staff;sport;six minute walk test;sitting;semi structured interview;safety;residential home;qualitative research;physiotherapist;personal trainer;motivation;mobilization;memory;male;lifestyle;investment;independent living;incontinence;human;gait;female;family attitude;exercise;executive function;endurance;DNA transcription;data analysis software;clinical article;awareness;anxiety;adult;acquired brain injury,"A., Charrette and L., Lorenz and J., Fong and T.M., O'Neil-Pirozzi and M., Demore-Taber",2017.0,0,491
497,Integrative power of pathophysiology in postgenomic era of precision medicine,"From a broader prospective, the living human body may be viewed as an open system with the permanent import and export of mater/energy and information with the environment. Living body is fully dependent on oxygen, macronutrients and some micronutrients import. Daily produced and used biological energy enables structural and functional channelling of informational exchanges between the genome and environmental demands. In addition, some categories of macromolecules, generated within the body subsystems, serve as the information-containing and conveying units. The information and energy interplay serves as a driving principle that maintains the basic structure and physiology of the body. From the conception of zygote on, throughout development, growth, maturation and body involution, the bidirectional open system is governed by a set of internal rules. Quantity and quality of human body responses are guided within the limits of life compatibility. At the level of clinical phenomenology body physiology shows a high reactive variability, adaptive and chronobiological plasticity. Genome provides basic biological information pool which is used and maintained during the individual life span. Transcriptomic, proteomic and reactomic genome expression is guided by the permanent physiological demands. Self-maintenance and functional performance from cellular to whole-body level may be analysed as a response to the environmental conditions. For example, antigens, mechanical trauma and body exercise do turn on complex patterns of inflammation/immune, repair/regeneration and reactivity build-up, respectively. Components of those challenges are recognized by human body as unique sets of information to which adaptive responses are generated. Body adaptive responses are usually described to follow nonlinear patterns. Nonlinearity stems from several levels of body functional organization. They include macromolecular functional features (e.g., enzyme kinetics, molecular turn-over), cellular level (e.g., integration of multiple signals, triggering division versus death pathways), tissues levels (e.g., remote effect of hormones/cytokines) and regulatory levels (e.g., endocrine/neural homeostasis, mirror-j physiology), etc. Nonlinearity contributes to a complexity pattern of natural responses in health and disease. The complexity of human body physiology, additionally, stems from parallel pathways, multiplicity of regulatory homeostatic/homeodynamic loops (feedback and feed-forward), biological redundancy, genomic variability, inter-dependence on physiological gradients, chronobiological alterations of reactivity robustness and plasticity of function/structure maintenance. The nature of scientific method in biomedicine is dominantly reductionistic quantitative approach. Tacit scientific reasoning implies that knowledge of the elements will necessarily tell us the story of the whole system. Understanding of biomedical life phenomena is thought to be reducible to the levels of chemistry, physics and information. Simplified models are developed and widely used. Those models provide testable, reproducible, and ethically approvable condition. They are easily controlled, and thus suitable for extensive quantitative analysis. In depth knowledge gain is facilitated by sophisticated methods and their growing refinements. We learn and reason in a way of ‚Äúmore and more about less and less‚Äù. Out of methodological simplification the whole body reactivity has been envisioned as the sum of elementary mechanisms. Integrative physiology of the organism as whole has tacitly been derived from elements, with rarely proper testing of integral reactivity. All those approaches have inherent problem of simplification and methodological ‚Äúignorance‚Äù of complexities. In general, they tend to ignore parallel pathways, regulatory loops, biological redundancy, inter-dependence on physiological gradients, chronobiological alterations (etc) that are functional in the integral body system. It is obvious especially with the big data of omics-methodologies, which are pending for a new interpretations schemes and their integration into the classical phenomenology. The study of human physiology in health and disease is faced with two demands related to two different and partially overlapping dimension of the same problem. The clinical pragmatisms to deliver the health benefits and the nature of scientific investigation of the integral complex systems emerge as the two central pivots of medicine. Both sides generate relevant data and construct putative patterns of body reactivity. Both sides silently impose their own methodological, conceptual and professional guidelines to their approaches, and thus contribute to ways of interpretation of human body phenomena. Both sides contain strong and weak features with respect of certainty of interpretations and integration. Results, methodical strategies, comprehensive insights and visions of both sides, should serve as raw material in attempts of integrative understanding of physiological performance of the body. Medical doctors are inclined to reason along a macro-scale knowledge and diagnostics of clinical reality. They include a qualitative interpretation and perception along with available quantitative diagnostic data. Therefore symptomatology and semeiology of disease processes at clinical level are seen as highly variable, nonlinear, often redundant and with low predictability. Physician's practical teleology is a benefit of a patient. The precision medicine and demands of personalized approaches to individual patient's problem have been additional enforcing the need of integrative synthesis. Such demand reiterates the cognitive and diagnostic issues of the whole body versus local reactivity. Understanding of etiology and pathogenesis networking and their relations to symptoms, signs and dysfunctions remains the critical challenge. Due to a complexity of body structure/function dynamics the principal etiology is not always identifiable, and thus therapeutic interventions are not necessarily corrective at the right (causative) place. They often achieve positive clinical effect via interference with secondary, tertiary (etc) pathways. For example, therapeutic reduction of fever improves patients' condition regardless of its real cause. The mission of general pathophysiology studies is to enable a synthetic view of heterogeneous types of information and to stimulate an integrative study process. Stemming from nanomolecular and macromolecular level, general pathophysiology makes bridges towards inheritance, subcellular, cellular and tissue as well as organism level. It aims towards study of common etiopathogenatic pathways. It tries to figure out a reliable frame of reference of pathobiological processes responsible for a given clinical problem. Synthetic pathophysiology outlines and crystallizes pathways, taxonomic orders, distribution of disease phenomena and describes the dynamics of processes. General pathophysiology has been defined as ‚Äú an integrative branch of medicine which deals with the causative (etiological) and processual (pathogenetic) aspects of disease.‚Äù (The Beijing Declaration -International Society for Pathophysiology). Etiological factors (chemical, physical, live agents, inherited genomic polymorphisms) induce a variable set of body reactions, which differ both in a quantity and in a quality. Pathophysiology uses clinical and basic data and knowledge and applies new methods, with a growing sophistication of existing methods - imported methods coming from chemistry, physics, biology, information technologies (etc). Proper pathophysiological framework should integrate vertical, horizontal and longitudinal dimensions of the disease/ disorder states. It should facilitate a rational usage of both quantitative scientific knowledge and qualitative descriptive knowledge information plethora and mastering professional demands. In order to improve the efficacy of teaching/learning approach we developed the algorithmic analysis/synthesis method, which became attractive and friendly to students, as well as from teachers point of view. The method is a matrix-guided educational model with four steps. The first part is the exposition of problem, which provides short presentation of ‚Äúraw data‚Äù derived from patient records, selected publications with experimental data, etc.",Oxygenators;Proteomics;Genomics;Genome;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;zygote;vision;thinking;teaching;teacher;synthesis;student;structure activity relation;regeneration;quantitative analysis;publication;protein function;practice guideline;plasticity;physiology;physics;physician;phenomenology;personalized medicine;ordo;omics;nonlinear system;nervous system;medical record;maturation;macronutrient;macromolecule;lifespan;learning;involution;injury;inheritance;information technology;inflammation;human;homeostasis;genome;genetic association;fever;exercise;enzyme kinetics;endocrine system;educational model;death;crystallization;controlled study;conference abstract;conception;China;adult;trace element;oxygen;hormone;endogenous compound;cytokine;biological product;antigen,"Z., Kovaƒç",2017.0,0,492
498,Quality of life change in children with physical disabilities after participation in an adaptive ski and snowboard program,"Background and Objective(s): Children with cerebral palsy (CP) and other diagnoses affecting physical function may have limited ability to participate in sports. Adaptive sports allow these individuals to participate at the same level as their able-bodied peers, and have been shown to improve function, mood, and health perception. However, few studies investigate the effect of adaptive skiing and snowboarding on quality of life (QoL) in this population. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Study Participants & Setting: This study enrolled 76 children, aged 8 to 19 years, who participated in the Adaptive Recreation for Childhood Health Ski Program from 2011-2015. The majority of participants had a diagnosis of CP. One parent or guardian of the child was also enrolled. The adaptive program consisted of 5 ski days with a trained instructor at Winter Park in Colorado. Materials/Methods: The KIDSCREEN-52 (K52) was completed within 1 month of the first and last program days. The K52, administered separately to the child and parent, measures 10 QoL domains: physical activities, psychological, moods and emotions, self-perception, autonomy, family, financial, peers, school, and bullying. Paired t-tests were used to analyze pre- to post-season change in K52 measures. Multi-year trends in QoL were also examined for those with 3 or more years of participation. Results: After their first year, children had significant increases in mean t-scores in 2 domains. For parents, 6 of the 10 domains had significant increases following their child's first season (Figure 1). Twenty-nine children and parents participated in the program for 3 or more consecutive seasons. For these children, a significantly increasing trend was found for financial, peers and bullying. A significant downward trend was seen for self perception (Figure 2). Parents demonstrated increasing trends in financial and bullying. Conclusions/Significance: This study quantifies the positive influence of an adaptive ski and snowboard program on QoL after just 1 season of participation. Improvements are more pronounced in parent reports. Long-term effects of the program are also shown in peer and bullying domains, reflecting increased feelings of equality to able-bodied peers. The downward trend for self-perception may reflect the participant's transition into adolescent years, highlighting the importance of monitoring this QoL aspect in adaptive programs.

499,Enabling support systems for creating inclusion through sports,"Aim: To examine the role and impact of the enabling support provided by coaches on the sports field and administrators in schools on the creation of an inclusive and accepting environment for people with and without intellectual disabilities (ID). Method: Eight coach interviews were conducted where coaches discussed ways in which they have promoted social inclusion, the benefits of Unified Sports, and changes they have seen in participants. In addition, 21 Unified Strategy school site visits were conducted to understand how administrators impact social inclusiveness in schools. Results: Coaches mentioned improved confidence, enhanced communication, and improved social inclusion as a result of Unified Sports participation. In schools, teachers encouraged students to be leaders to determine collaboratively how to best implement socially inclusive activities. Conclusions: With the support of the coaches and education leaders to facilitate inclusive activities, there are more opportunities for people with and without ID to learn and grow through sports.",Intellectual Disability;Sports;teacher;student;sport;leadership;interview;intellectual impairment;human experiment;human;education;administrative personnel,"A., Shellard and K., Haas and M., Merritt and A., Cahn",2016.0,0,494

METHOD: People with USN ‚â•6 mo poststroke participated in a single-group, repeated-measures study. Attendance, total repetitions, and satisfaction indicated feasibility and pain indicated tolerability. Paired t tests and effect sizes were used to estimate changes in upper-extremity use (Motor Activity Log), function (Action Research Arm Test), and attention (Catherine Bergego Scale).     RESULTS: Twenty participants attended 99.4% of sessions and completed a high number of repetitions. Participants reported high satisfaction and low pain, and they demonstrated small, significant improvements in upper-extremity use (before Bonferroni corrections; t = -2.1, p = .04, d = .30), function (t = -3.0, p < .01, d = .20), and attention (t = -3.4, p < .01, d = -.44).

501,"Prospective, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of smart glasses on vestibular examination skills","This proof-of-concept trial explored whether using Google Glass to augment instruction of vestibular assessment and treatment skills increased student competence. In 2015, 103 physiotherapy students with no prior vestibular examination training participated in a lab for adults with vestibular dysfunction led by experienced clinicians. Half were randomised (blocked on gender and self-efficacy) to standard lab instruction and half to the experiential lab wherein the instructor used the Google Glass video function in real time, along with verbal instruction. Students completed a pretest questionnaire to establish self-reported skill level in vestibular dysfunction assessment and treatment. Another faculty member assessed students‚Äô competence in these clinical skills after 7 days. A student evaluation of teaching was completed after the teaching session. No between-group differences existed regarding change in self-efficacy scores for vestibular assessment and treatment skills preintervention and postintervention. Students in the Google Glass group scored slightly better on the clinical skills check (median score of 19 (range 16‚Äì20) versus 18 (range 16‚Äì20); p=0.03). 40 students (77%) in the Google Glass group performed the assessment satisfactorily versus 30 (59%) (p=0.049) in the standard lab group.

502,Psychodermatologic effects of atopic dermatitis and acne: A review on self-esteem and identity,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) and acne vulgaris are among the most-prevalent skin diseases in children. Both have been well documented in the literature to have significant negative effects on quality of life. Herein, we discuss the results of a comprehensive literature review aimed at assessing the impact of acne and AD on self-esteem and identity. We highlight clinical tools for their assessment and offer coping strategies for patients and families. Multiple factors including relationships with parents and classmates, sports participation, and the sex of the patient contribute to the development of self-esteem and identity in individuals with AD and acne. Atopic dermatitis was found to have significant behavioral effects on children, ultimately resulting in a lack of opportunity to develop proper coping. AD had a more-prominent role in identity formation and gender roles in girls. Acne vulgaris was found to have a more direct effect on self-esteem, self-confidence and identity, especially in girls. The Cutaneous Body Image Scale is reviewed and offered as an easy and reliable tool to evaluate a patient's mental perception of the appearance of their skin. Coping strategies that may be offered to patients and families include empowerment and cognitive adaptation.","Skin;Dermatitis, Atopic;Acne Vulgaris;teacher;systematic review;social psychology;social isolation;social interaction;skin disease assessment;sex role;sex difference;self esteem;self concept;review;problem behavior;priority journal;physical activity;peer group;human;groups by age;General Health Questionnaire;empowerment;emotional disorder;disease severity;Cutaneous Body Image Scale;coping behavior;conduct disorder;child parent relation;child behavior;atopic dermatitis;adolescent behavior;acne vulgaris","C.M., Nguyen and J., Koo and K.M., Cordoro",2016.0,0,497
503,Adolescent internet use and social integration: Analysis from a longitudinal cohort survey,"Purpose: The overarching goal of the study is to contribute to the understanding of the reciprocal impact of leisure internet use on social integration among adolescents and potential protecting mechanisms in adolescents' developmental phase. Children with problematic internet use may have chronic interpersonal dysfunction and are more likely to experience impairments in physical and cognitive development, leading to some adverse outcomes in later life. Not much work has done using a national representative sample of Taiwan; hence, it remains necessary to examine in detail interaction between social integration and internet use as well as the relevant health consequences. We aimed to explore the relationship between social integration and leisure internet use among adolescents. Methods: Data for this study were from the Taiwan Education Panel Survey (TEPS). TEPS is a longitudinal study that started in 2001 and surveyed a total of 4261 junior high school students (1988/1989 birth cohort) and their parents and teachers from about 333 junior high schools (Wave 1). Following the same survey method, 3 more rounds of survey (Wave 2-Wave 4) were conducted in year 2003, 2005 and 2006. The measure of social integration included participation in school clubs and organizations, volunteering activities, and part-time job. The outcome variable was represented by duration and purpose of internet use. Correlation analysis and logistic regression models were applied to investigate the relationship between internet use and social integration. Results: The average use of internet was 6.37 (¬±3.14) hours per day. School participation was negatively correlated with leisure internet use. Participation in extramural activities was however not related to their internet use. In the regression models, school participation was also shown to reduce heavy uses of internet with 0.77 folds (95% confidence interval 0.61-0.97). Conclusions: Our study delineated the role of social integration in Taiwanese adolescent internet use. Reinforcing students' bonding to school may prevent heavy internet users. These results may contribute to inspire future studies or empirical work on adolescent internet use and management of internet overuse.",Longitudinal Studies;Adolescent;child;cognitive development;student;Taiwanese;education;longitudinal study;high school student;confidence interval;parent;outcome variable;teacher;high school;organization;adverse outcome;work;logistic regression analysis;health;correlation analysis;model;Taiwan;leisure;school;adolescent;adolescent health;society;integration;Internet;human,"C.-T., Lee and M.-C., Tsai and Y.-L., Liang and C., Strong and C.-Y., Lin",2016.0,0,498
504,"Health-Related Quality of Life Among Chinese Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis: The Predictive Roles of Fatigue, Functional Disability, Self-Efficacy, and Social Support","BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure in chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, there is a paucity of literature from mainland China on HRQoL and factors that influence it in people with RA.     OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess HRQoL and to determine which factors, based on the Wilson and Cleary model, contribute to the prediction of HRQoL among persons with RA in mainland China.     METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used. Persons with RA (N = 207) were recruited from the outpatient clinics of a university-affiliated hospital in central China. Participants responded to a demographic data questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, the eight-item Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the effects of factors from the Wilson and Cleary model on HRQoL.     RESULTS: Scores on all SF-36 subscales were significantly lower in patients with RA compared with a general Chinese sample. Lower self-efficacy, greater fatigue, greater functional disability, lower social support, being unemployed, higher disease activity, more comorbidities, lower income level, being female, living in rural settings, and being older were directly or indirectly significantly and negatively associated with HRQoL; 67% of the total variance of HRQoL scores was explained.     DISCUSSION: Patients with RA in mainland China experience impaired physical and mental health. Targeted and culturally sensitive interventions should be strengthened to improve the HRQoL of this population. Essentials in improving the HRQoL are enhancing self-efficacy, relieving fatigue, delaying the onset of disabilities, increasing social support, and controlling disease activity.","Fatigue;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Social Support;Quality of Life;young adult;unemployment;social support;sex difference;severity of illness index;self concept;rural population;rheumatoid arthritis;questionnaire;quality of life;psychology;pathophysiology;middle aged;male;income;human;female;fatigue;disability;cross-sectional study;comorbidity;China;aged;age;adult","G., Gong and J., Mao",2016.0,0,499
505,"Understanding the three dimensional perspective to prevent risky health behaviours of adolescents: Family, school and family physician","Aim: Determination of the prevalence of risky health behaviors (RHB) of adolescents and evaluation of knowledge of family, school and family physician about RHB. Methods: The study was performed in high schools situated in a district in Ankara. Sample of this research included 1,467 adolescents. Data was collected using a standardized questionnaire under observation from adolescents. Face to face interviews were conducted with mothers, teachers and family health practitioners of some adolescents. Frequencies, ANOVA and independent t test; linear regression analysis were used when appropriate. Ethical consent was taken from Hacettepe University. Results: Mean age of adolescents was 17.15¬±0.45. In the study, 567 of them had risky health behaviors. The mean score of RHB scale score (t:-0.992, p: 0.321) and the mean scores of subgroups of physical activity (t: 2.261, p: 0.024), nutrition (t:0.48, p: 0.962), hygiene (t:-0.418, p: 0.676), psychosocial t:-2.772, p:0.006) and substance abuse (t:-1.273, p:0.203) of governmental high school adolescents were statistically higher than Anatolian high school adolescents (p<0.05). Families, teachers and family physicians were unaware of RHBs of adolescents (p<0.001; p=0.002; p=0.001). Conclusions: Consequently, this study was important for health professionals worked in primary health services and school health services. The study is evidence that shows school type effects health behaviors of adolescent. On the other hand, it‚Äôs seen that family is the most important side of behavioral development.

506,Synthetic Cannabinoid Abuse in Adolescents: A Case Series,"Background Synthetic cannabinoids, referred to as ""Bonzai"" in Turkey, are relatively new recreational drugs of abuse. Although the use of synthetic cannabinoids has been dramatically increasing in young populations in many countries, their adverse effects are not well known. Objectives To report on the clinical features and social history of pediatric patients with a diagnosis of synthetic cannabinoid intoxication and to highlight the dangers of these drugs to public health. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 16 cases presenting to our Emergency Department (ED) with synthetic cannabinoid intoxication in the last 10 months. Usage characteristics and the psychoactive, physical, and metabolic effects of synthetic cannabinoids were analyzed. Results The mean age of the 16 patients with a diagnosis of synthetic cannabinoid intoxication was 15.4 ¬± 1.7 years (15 males, 1 female). The most common physical symptoms were eye redness, nausea/vomiting, sweating, and altered mental status; the main psychoactive findings were agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, and perceptual changes. We observed hypotension and bradycardia in 8 (50%) and 5 (31.3%) of the patients, respectively. Although most patients were discharged from the ED, 25% were transferred to an intensive care unit. They all had reduced school attendance and performance. The rates of cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking were also significantly higher. Conclusion Synthetic cannabinoids are unsafe and potentially harmful drugs of abuse; they may even cause life-threatening effects. It is important for pediatricians to be familiar with the signs and symptoms of consumption of synthetic cannabinoid products.

507,‚ÄúSchool mental health in india‚Äù: Good practices models towards inclusion in schools,"Background: Children are the most important assets of any country and the most important human resource for overall development. In India, Children and adolescents constitute 40 % - 44 % of over 1200 million population. Schools are one of the settings outside the home where children can acquire new knowledge and skills to grow into productive and capable citizens, who can involve, support and help their communities to grow and prosper. The school plays a crucial role in the development of cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and moral functions and competencies in a child. However, in the contemporary system of education, schools have seriously marginalized and compromised on their role in guiding and regulating the psychological development of children with disabilities. According to National Census of India (2011), children and adolescents with disability in age group of 5 years to 19 years are 3.36%. World Bank Report (2007) highlighted that 38 per cent of the children with disabilities in the age group 6-13 years are out of school. It is now widely acknowledged that to achieve the goal of universal education in India and in order to fulfil provisions laid out in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 (Ministry of Human Resource Development, 2009) the education of children with disabilities cannot be put on the back burner. A Health Promoting School is a setting where education and health programmes create a ‚Äúhealth promoting‚Äù, environment that in turn ‚Äúpromotes learning for all‚Äù. Inclusion or the education of children with disabilities in regular classrooms must be adopted both as an ideology and as a practical solution to support the Education for All, and to meet the needs of children with disabilities. Inclusion aims at integrated development of children with special needs through mainstream schooling. It upheld the aim of 'education for all' by suggesting some foundational changes in programmes and policies of nations.Through inclusive education children with disabilities remain on a path that leads to an adult life as a participating member of society. Meeting all their needs together increases their ability to achieve academic and physical growth to their potential, and it enhances their overall quality of life. The symposium envisages to highlight the School's Emerging Potential for Promoting Mental Health and Inclusion. ‚Ä¢ Schools have profound influence on children, their families and the community. ‚Ä¢ Schools can act as a safety net, protecting children from hazards that affect their learning, development and psychosocial well-being. ‚Ä¢ In addition to the family, schools are crucial in building or undermining self-esteem and a sense of competence. ‚Ä¢ School mental health programmes are effective in improving learning, mental well-being, and channelizing management of mental disorders. ‚Ä¢ Young peoples' ability and motivation to stay in school, to learn, and to utilize what they learn is affected by their mental well-being. ‚Ä¢ School infrastructure and environment should be disabled friendly ‚Ä¢ Schools should have special educators in schools on a regular basis. ‚Ä¢ Make further recommendations to encourage mental health professionals to establish good practices in schools. ‚Ä¢ School counselors and their profile needs a revisit for enhancing role and responsibility. ‚Ä¢ Pre-service & in-service training programmes for teachers and counselors. ‚Ä¢ Teachers have often received some training in developmental principles.

508,Motor performance in turner syndrome,"The aim of this presentation is to give an overview of motor disabilities in girls with Turner syndrome (TS), the impact on daily life and suggestions for treatment. Girls with TS show substantially lower performance in gross and fine motor function tests and motor milestones are achieved relatively late. Moreover, girls with TS frequently encounter problems in specific motor functioning i.e. oral-motor and visualmotor coordination, motor learning and problems with accuracy and movement speed. In our clinic, evaluation of motor function is part of the routine multidisciplinary evaluation in patients with TS. At the age of 5, 11, and 16 years, patients are screened for motor performance impairments by means of the movement assessment battery for children-2 (MABC-2). Visual coordination of visual perception in relation to finger-hand movements is tested by means of the developmental test of visual motor integration (VMI) and if appropriate a test for handwriting difficulties is used. In this presentation, we present the results of our motor screening. Impaired motor ability can result in multiple practical problems that are age specific. Examples of these practical consequences include feeding difficulties (infant), problems with writing, participation in sports (school age), choice of study and employment (adolescents). We discuss practical suggestions for coaching and treatment. In our opinion, adequate counseling by an experienced physical therapist and physician is important to optimize support for girls with TS at the level of activities and participation.",Adolescent;Infant;infant;adolescent;vision;Movement Assessment Battery for Children;learning;counseling;velocity;sport;school;employment;motor dysfunction;writing;physiotherapist;physician;function test;hospital;hand movement;handwriting;screening;feeding difficulty;patient;girl;female;human;motor performance;endocrinology;society;Turner syndrome,"Alfen J., Van",2014.0,0,503
509,Increasing physical activity in primary school children: A case study,"Background: Low levels of physical activity are a direct and indirect risk factor for diabetes and other disorders. Nearly 1 in 5 of all year 6 children in Northamptonshire (Midlands) are obese; rates of obesity at the start of primary and secondary school have increased at a faster rate than the national average. Aims: This study evaluates a scheme of placing sports coordinators in primary schools who provided bespoke programmes with the aim of increasing physical activity levels to prevent obesity and cardiometabolic disorders. Methods: The intervention was evaluated using pre- and post-internet surveys and was completed by children as part of classroom sessions in years 3 and 4, in four county schools; 254 and 211 children participated at baseline and post-intervention respectively (even gender split, mean age at baseline 7.7 years). Semi-structured interviews were carried out with a subset of children, the coordinators and teachers. Ethical approval was granted by the University of Northampton. Results: Self-reported participation in sports increased across all schools (p < 0.05), but this hides considerable variation between schools. Attitudes to physical activity were overall very positive at baseline and improved non-significantly at post-intervention. The social dimension of sport and exercise was important. Semi-structured interviews indicated that all parties judged the scheme a success, but again differences between schools were noteworthy. Conclusion: The placement of sports coordinators in primary schools is an effective way of improving physical activity levels; the schools' ethos and commitment to the scheme played an important role in achieving successful outcomes.",Child;Obesity;Motor Activity;Sports;Only Child;university;Internet;gender;teacher;exercise;risk factor;high school;semi structured interview;diseases;obesity;child;sport;school;physical activity;United Kingdom;diabetes mellitus;case study;human;school child;primary school,"J.W., Huber and J.A., Sixsmith and R., Ryder and E., Doe and J., Browne",2014.0,0,504
510,Concussion advocacy and legislation: A neurological surgeon's view from the epicenter,"Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death and disability in the world for adolescents according to the World Health Organization. Sports-related concussion is a small but perhaps one of the most preventable causes of that morbidity. Legislation to protect student athletes is one of the ways in which we can advocate for safety in sports. This paper reviews the legislative history of the first concussion law passed to protect youth athletes: Washington State's Zackery Lystedt Law. This history is viewed from the point of view of one of the participants in the efforts to pass laws in all 50 states. The key provisions of the Zackery Lystedt Law include (1) education for parents, athletes, and coaches; (2) immediate removal from play during a game or practice, after a suspected concussion with no return to play until (3); (3) written clearance by a concussion expert for return to play; and (4) uniformity of rules for all schools who use public land. Last, the nature of this legislative process, which included attorneys, legislators, and physicians, demonstrated that effective collaboration of local, state, and national leaders can address a critical public health challenge such as concussion affecting student athletes.",Adolescent;Cause of Death;Brain;Sports;Brain Injuries;teamwork;sports medicine;sport injury;recreation;public health problem;physician attitude;parent;nonmedical occupations;neurosurgeon;minority group;medical expert;legislator;leadership;lawyer;law;informed consent;human;education program;coach;brain concussion;athlete;article,"R.G., Ellenbogen",2014.0,0,505
511,"Musculoskeletal disorders among dentists in the Greater Athens area, Greece: Risk factors and correlations","Aim: To quantify the magnitude of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in dentists working in the Greater Athens area in relation with personal characteristics, work and psychological risk factors. Methods Using cross-sectional methodology and by means of a self-administered questionnaire, 80 dentists provided information on personal characteristics, employment history, use of specific dental instruments, working and personal habits, perception of the job's physical and psycho-social demands, general health status, need for recovery at the end of a regular working day, the affected body region and the MSDs frequency. Results: A total of 83 % dentists reported at least one MSD (past year), 54 and 70%reportedmonotonous/repetitive movements and strenuous back postures, respectively, while 38 % sought medical help for MSDs of the cervical/shoulder and back region. Direct vision in the oral cavity was significantly related with a higher frequency of chronic pain in the cervical region (odds ratio, OR=6.8). Absence of a dental assistant and use of manually handled endodontic instruments were significantly related with a higher prevalence of hand senso-neural disorders (OR=3 and 3.4 respectively). Passive free-time activities were significantly related with a higher prevalence of MSDs in the shoulder region (OR=4.16). Smokers had significantly higher need for recovery at the end of a working day compared to non-smokers (OR=2.6). Conclusions Dentists could prevent or alleviate MSDs, by adopting appropriate work practices and by modifying personal habits. Education in dental ergonomics and correct working postures is of paramount importance and should preferably be introduced during undergraduate dental practice. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2012.",Neck Pain;Posture;Risk Factors;work capacity;risk factor;questionnaire;prevalence;physical activity;musculoskeletal disease;middle aged;male;major clinical study;human;help seeking behavior;health status;Greece;female;employment;dentist;dental practice;dental device;cross-sectional study;correlation analysis;chronic pain;body regions;article;aged;adult,"A., Zoidaki and E., Riza and A., Kastania and E., Papadimitriou and A., Linos",2013.0,0,506
512,Remaining active-barriers and facilitators for persistent participation in physical activity for adolescents with and without physical disability,"Introduction: Adolescents are less physically active than children, and people with physical disabilities are less physically active than peers without disabilities. Participation in physical activity for youth/young adults are more challenging for people with physical disabilities. The aim of this study was to explore barriers and facilitators related to physical activity for adolescents with and without physical disabilities. Participants and Methods: Qualitative study using six focus groups with 32 participants, 15 females and 17 males, from 15 to 25 years with various experiences of participation in physical activity. Recruitment was from two health sports centres, a fitness centre for young people with physical disabilities and a mainstream high school. Twenty four participants had a physical disability, and eight adolescents served as a reference group. Each focus group lasted 1-11/2 hours and was audiotaped. Recordings were transcribed and then analysed using systematic text condensation and content analysis to identify the most important barriers and facilitators for remaining physically active. Results: Adolescents with physical disabilities seem to have a more reflective attitude to barriers and facilitators for physical activity than peers without disabilities. Support from peers and instructors, intrinsic motivation and opportunity to participate in motivational activities in the local community are important factors that make a difference to adolescents' level of physical activity. Internet and relations to active people are important ways of finding relevant activities. Conclusion: Because of variation in factors that are essential for adolescents' level of physical activity, interventions must be initiated both by professionals and the adolescents themselves.",Motor Activity;Disabled Persons;Adolescent;child;adult;health;community;motivation;sport;Internet;female;fitness;high school;recording;male;content analysis;implantable cardioverter defibrillator;qualitative research;information processing;physical activity;disability;adolescent;childhood;physical disability;human,"B., Gjessing and R., Jahnsen and A., Nyquist",2013.0,0,507
513,An exploratory analysis of factors that impact self concept (SC) in children with cerebral palsy (CP),"Background/Objectives: Self concept (SC) predicts success in the school setting and the personal arena. The purpose of the study was to describe the factors that influence SC in children with CP including intelligence (IQ), educational placement (EP), and physical function. Several studies have investigated the relationship between individual variables and SC in children with CP. The current research investigated the same major variables with the addition of IQ and EP and their relationship to SC in children with CP. We hypothesized there are no relationships between IQ, EP, age and physical function with SC. We also hypothesized there were no interactions between IQ, EP, age and physical function as they relate to SC and that these same factors would not be able to predict SC. Design: Descriptive Study: survey, cross sectional. Participants and Setting: A sample of convenience of children with CP was drawn from a specialized care center, primary care setting, and general community (N=79; Age: mean=10yr 0mo; Range=5yr 9mo to 13yr 11mo). Parents of participants and the children were individually surveyed. Exclusionary factors: Cognitive functioning at moderate or lower level, non-English speaking. Materials/Methods: Parents of participants completed a demographic form that included questions on age, gender and EP. Standardized outcome measures completed for each child included the: Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test: Second Edition (KBIT-2), Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) for physical function, and Self Description Questionnaire-I for SC. ANOVAs and regressions were used to assess for relationships between age, gender, EP, IQ, and physical function with SC, and for interactions among variables. Significance level was set at 0.05. Results: Statistically significant one way ANOVA results showed that gender effects general SC (P=0.033) and EP effects physical appearance (P=0.044). Statistically significant ANOVAs demonstrated two way interaction effects with physical function and total nonacademic SC (P=0.029), peer relations SC (P=0.010) and physical ability SC (P=0.009). Additionally, the linear regression demonstrated that age predicts SC in physical ability (P=0.023) and SC in math (P=0.031). EP predicts SC in physical appearance (P=0.042), and gender predicts SC in total self (P=0.041). Conclusions/Significance: The results demonstrate that a child with CP with or without a cognitive impairment is similar to a typical child who may or may not have a cognitive impairment in terms of SC. All populations have multiple factors that affect SC, interact with each other, and at times predict SC. Thus, it is critical that clinicians and educators consider the child's personal factors and environment when considering SC because this may make them more successful as adults.","Child;Only Child;Factor Analysis, Statistical;Cerebral Palsy;analysis of variance;adult;intelligence;environment;Gross Motor Function Classification System;questionnaire;peer group;primary medical care;linear regression analysis;community;population;school;implantable cardioverter defibrillator;speech;intelligence test;parent;cognitive defect;physical performance;physical capacity;gender;intelligence quotient;self concept;child;human;cerebral palsy","Der Luft G., Von and B., Deboer and S., Martino",2013.0,0,508
514,Management of obesity by general practitioners: Self-reported difficulties and suggestions for improvement,"Rationale: 15% of French people >15 yrs were obese in 2012. However, a few data on the self-perception ofmanagement of obesity by general practitioners (GP) are available. Aims of the study were to note the reported GP difficulties faced to obesity, their suggestions for improvement and their opinion on care. Methods: 200 GP of a French district fulfilled an anonymous questionnaire reporting epidemiological GP data, their perceived difficulties about obesity, suggestions for improvement and global opinion. Statistical tests were Chi2 Fisher's Student's t tests, variance analysis. Results: 34.0% of GP responded. 6.5% of their patients were obese. GP related to patients the five most cited difficulties: poor respect of physical activity advice (94.1%) of diet advice (91.1%) of psychological advice (72.0%) lack of motivation (92.6%) presence of eating disorders (83.8%). 58.8% of GP felt themselves ineffective, 52.9% thought they had too little time and 50.0% too little training. 28.0% were not interested by obesity. Lack of training was positively related to feeling of inefficacy (p = 0.007) lack of time (p = 0.03) disinterest for obesity (p = 0.0002). The main suggestions for improvement were to achieve a family feeding and school education (83.8% and 80.9%), better manage childhood obesity (83.8%), improve psychological care (76.5%), warn on effects of time spent in front of screens (70.5%) repay consultations by dieticians (69.1%). 82.4% of GP were unsatisfied by their global care of obesity. Conclusion: Coaching obese patients is important in GP activity but leaves them unsatisfied. They mainly relate obstacles to patients, but the lack of medical training is badly felt, with an impact on their self-perceived effectiveness. They think that family and school preventive actions are priorities.

515,Peer mentorship teaches social tools for pain self-management: A case study,"Pain in children can become chronic and disabling, associated with high degrees of social isolation from schooling absences, physical limitations that prevent participation in social settings, and difficulties forming self-identity. This lack of social support network impairs social coping skills and can lead to worsening pain symptoms. Objective: In this case study, we describe a new program to disrupt the cycle of social isolation and chronic pain by emphasizing social coping skills via peer mentorship. The program aimed to utilize peers who have learned to selfmanage their own chronic pain to assist patients with social coping skills to reduce isolation caused by chronic pain conditions. Study Group: Children and adolescents with chronic pain. Methods: This case describes the experience of a 17 year-old, African American boy with diffuse chronic body pain as a participant (""the mentee"") in the program; his mentor was a 19 year-old girl with chronic pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The mentor received six hours of training and she mentored the patient in 10 weekly sessions. Results: The mentee connected very well with his mentor through sharing similar pain experiences. He demonstrated improvements in positive affect, sleep, social coping, and perception of bodily pain on a variety of quantitative measures. Qualitative data from interviews also suggested that the mentee learned important social coping skills through peer mentorship. Conclusions: A peer mentoring approach to chronic pain may help alleviate social isolation in adolescents and result in improvements in a number of associated symptoms. ¬© Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Social Isolation;Child;Adolescent;Mentors;Pain Management;Only Child;Adaptation, Psychological;yoga;university student;treatment duration;thinking;teaching;teacher;social isolation;social interaction;social behavior;sleep quality;sleep disorder;sleep;self care;sedentary lifestyle;quantitative analysis;physiotherapy;peer mentor program;peer group;nociception;neck pain;mood;male;low back pain;leg pain;learning;juvenile rheumatoid arthritis;interview;human;headache;flu like syndrome;fibromyalgia;female;feedback system;disease duration;depression;coping behavior;concentration loss;cognitive therapy;chronic pain;case study;case report;article;analgesia;African American;affect;adult;adolescent;acupuncture;absenteeism","D., Goldenberg and L.A., Payne and L.P., Hayes and L.K., Zeltzer and J.C.I., Tsao",2013.0,0,510
516,A novel osce curriculum for teaching the musculoskeletal exam to internal medicine residents,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Musculoskeletal complaints are among the most common presenting symptoms to a primary care provider. Despite the high burden of musculoskeletal disorders, physicians are often underprepared to manage such disorders due to inadequate training during medical school and residency. We present here a novel experiential curriculum to teach internal medicine residents the evaluation and management of joint specific disorders using a multi-station objective structured clinical exam model (OSCE). The objectives were to improve trainee knowledge of and confidence in the musculoskeletal exam for a range of conditions common to primary care practice. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one of forty-six residents from Yale's Primary Care Internal Medicine Program rotated over a period of 6 months through the musculoskeletal curriculum during their ambulatory blocks. Participants included all 3 years of residency training. Eleven Yale Medical Student volunteers who had received 45 min of training served as standardized patients. Two chief residents and nine clinical faculty served as evaluators and instructors at each OSCE station. DESCRIPTION: Three musculoskeletal teaching workshops (Neck Pain, Back Pain and Knee Pain) were created. Each workshop was preceded by a 1 h lecture which reviewed relevant anatomy, history, exam findings, work up and treatment. The workshops themselves consisted of three to four case-based OSCE's through which residents rotated over a 90 min period. Residents were evaluated on exam technique, assessment and treatment plan and received feedback from faculty instructors and medical student standardized patients. EVALUATION: Outcomes assessed in this study include: formative assessment of the individual residents by faculty instructors; perceived educational value of the curriculum as assessed by anonymous surveys of participating faculty, residents, and students; and efficacy of the educational intervention as assessed by a formal post-workshop OSCE exam and a confidence and knowledge based questionnaire. As half the residency program had yet to participate in their ambulatory block OSCE, we are able to compare participants of the curriculum to internal controls using a retrospective cohort analysis. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Whereas previous studies have utilized OSCE's to evaluate resident medical knowledge, this curriculum aims to utilize the OSCE itself as a standardized teaching tool. Preliminary data suggests improved disease specific knowledge, as well as improved confidence and competence in the musculoskeletal exam among participating trainees. Furthermore, both resident and student participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the curriculum. Importantly, our curriculum involves learners across several levels of medical training including medical students, residents, and faculty, thus meeting both undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education needs. The voluntary and enthusiastic participation of medical students in our study suggests a cost-effective and pragmatic model for combining medical student and resident physical exam education as well as a tool to generate interest in primary care medicine among medical students. We have shown that it is possible to implement an effective OSCE-based musculoskeletal exam curriculum in a medium sized training program. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether this intervention leads to sustained improvements in musculoskeletal exam confidence and competence in the outpatient setting.","Internal Medicine;Education, Medical;Internship and Residency;Primary Health Care;physician;residency education;training;satisfaction;volunteer;graduate;education;neck pain;outpatient;feedback system;medical school;knee pain;questionnaire;cohort analysis;model;patient;competence;medical education;diseases;backache;musculoskeletal disease;workshop;primary medical care;student;medical student;human;curriculum;society;teaching;internal medicine","T., Siddharthan and S., Soares and S., Holt",2013.0,0,511
517,Musculoskeletal teaching and training in Saudi Arabia: A national survey,"Background Musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms are the most common reason for patients to seek medical attention, accounting approximately 20% of both Primary care and emergency-room visits. Despite the high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in all fields of clinical practice, doctors continue to describe poor confidence in their musculoskeletal clinical skills. Studies report the neglect of musculoskeletal examination skills in clinical practice and insufficient competence to carry out MSK history taking and physical examinations among clinicians. Objectives The main purpose of the study is to investigate the importance of Musculoskeletal (MSK) medicine in daily practice and the self-confidence to demonstrate MSK clinical skills (history taking and physical examinations) from the prospective of residents of Internal Medicine in Saudi Arabia. The study will also highlight factors that may affect respondents confidence, explore the educational and training opportunities provided in undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and determine possible barrier. Methods Paper-based, close-ended questionnaire with 5point Likert scale is developed based on intensive literature reviews. The piloted questionnaire consisted of 31 item that focus on four major themes:The study population is Residents of the Internal Medicine in Saudi Arabia. Results 296 residents of Internal Medicine complete the questionnaire with 42% response rate, representing 21 residency programmes in ten different cities that covering five regions of Saudi Arabia:The study indicate residents' lower confidence in demonstrating MSK Physical Examinations with total mean (10/24). There is a significant difference in residents' perception of their confidence in demonstrating MSK physical examination regarding their gender: Male residents show higher confidence in demonstrating MSK physical exam: in general, of the hips and pelvis, of foot and ankle, and of back. Respondents have general agreement that MSK problems are common in patient visits and indicate the importance of MSK clinical screening in all standard clinical examination of patients, yet they point to current inappropriate practice in handling most cases: Residents indicate their inattention to perform MSK physical examination unless there is a serious complication. Respondents have a lower perception of undergraduate and postgraduate training, regarding the inadequate training and assessment in MSK, and teachers ignorance of MSK training in other departments. In addition, most residents agree that integrated medical training and practice with a constancy of MSK physical examinations training and education are essential to develop graduates and residents skills. Conclusions The study shows a major threaten in clinical practice: most Internal Medicine residents in the Saudi Arabia have a lower confidence in MSK physical exam. Most medical schools and Internal Medicine residency programmes do not effectively educate future physicians on MSK medicine in spite of the increasing prevalence of MSK conduction across medical practice.An urgent national study must focus on integrating teaching and training with standardised approach and to emphasis rapid MSK clinical screening in all standard clinical examination.","Primary Health Care;Clinical Competence;Questionnaires;Arabia;Physical Examination;Emergency Service, Hospital;Emergency Medical Services;male;primary medical care;gender;hip;pelvis;teacher;postgraduate education;ankle;hospital patient;emergency ward;examination;competence;medical education;education;graduate;postgraduate student;structured questionnaire;city;medical school;Likert scale;population;musculoskeletal disease;physician;patient;clinical examination;anamnesis;screening;questionnaire;prevalence;clinical practice;skill;internal medicine;physical examination;human;teaching;rheumatic disease;rheumatology;Saudi Arabia","R., Zaini and H., Almoallim and A., AlRehaily and M., Samannodi and M., Bawayan and W., Hafiz and D., Attar and S., Awan and H., Hafiz",2013.0,0,512
518,Long-term effects of cognitive behaviour therapy and exercise for chronic widespread pain,"Background Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and exercise have been shown to result in improved outcomes for patients with fibromyalgia or chronic widespread pain (CWP), although whether they can deliver long-term benefit is unknown. Objectives To determine the long-term health effects of telephone-delivered CBT (tCBT), exercise, and combined treatments compared with treatment as usual (TAU) among patients with CWP. Methods The MUSICIAN Trial was a 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial. Patients with CWP were identified from a screening survey sent to patients over 25 years old registered at 8 UK general practices. Eligible individuals were patients meeting the ACR definition of CWP, reporting disability, who had consulted their family physician in the last year and with no cause for their pain identified requiring alternative treatment. They were randomly assigned to one of four study arms: tCBT, exercise, combined tCBT and exercise, or TAU. Participants receiving tCBT had 8 telephone sessions provided weekly with a therapist involving techniques to manage pain, and had follow-up calls at 3 and 6 months. Patients in the exercise group followed a 6 month exercise program to improve cardiovascular fitness individually designed for them by a fitness instructor with whom they had monthly reviews. Patients assigned to combined treatment received both interventions concurrently, while the TAU group received usual care from their family physician. Participants were followed up at 30 months post-randomisation with a postal questionnaire or by telephone (in case of non-response). The primary outcome (change in health since entering study) was considered positive if a subject scored at least 6 (‚ÄúI feel much better‚Äù) on a 7 point scale from 1 (‚ÄúI feel very much worse ‚Äù) to 7 (‚ÄúI feel very much better ‚Äù). Analysis was by logistic regression which adjusted for age, gender, centre and baseline predictors of outcome, to obtain measures of improvement in the active treatment groups compared to the TAU group. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results A total of 442 persons entered the study and 361 persons provided responses at 30 months follow-up. Median age of participants was 57 years (interquartile range, 47-65). Of 94 respondents at 30 months follow-up in the TAU group, 12 (12.8%) reported a positive outcome, compared to 29 out of 82 in the tCBT group (35.4%), 27 out of 92 in the exercise group (29.4%) and, 29 out of 93 in the combined group (31.2%). Odds of improvement compared to TAU, after adjustment were: tCBT, OR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.8-8.7); exercise, 2.9 (1.4-6.3); combined, 3.5 (1.6-7.5). Odds of improvement were not significantly different across the three active treatment groups and specifically there was no added benefit of receiving both interventions.

519,"Awareness and knowledge of developmental co-ordination disorder among physicians, teachers and parents.","Obtaining a diagnosis of developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) is a long, inconsistent and frustrating journey for families, with apparently little awareness of DCD in schools or the medical community. An online survey was completed by 1297 participants: parents (n = 501), teachers (n = 202), family/general physicians (n = 339) and paediatricians (n = 255). Only 20% of the sample had knowledge of DCD, with 41% of the paediatricians and 23% of family/general physicians familiar. Of participants who have awareness, only 11-59% have knowledge of the impact of DCD on social, emotional and physical health. Less than 30% of physicians have awareness of the secondary consequences. Few physicians diagnose DCD and less than one-third believe it is easy to make a diagnosis; this is in contrast to the fact that most parents report confidence in their physician's ability to make a timely diagnosis. If less than one-half of physicians have knowledge of DCD and even fewer are knowledgeable of the secondary consequences of the condition, it is not surprising that DCD is infrequently diagnosed and that families need to search for support. This survey confirms observations that the condition is not well known and there is a need for greater awareness of DCD. ¬© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Awareness;university;United States;United Kingdom;standard;psychomotor disorder;psychological aspect;preschool child;parent;medical staff;male;human;general practitioner;female;developmental disorder;clinical competence;child;Canada;attitude to health;article,"B.N., Wilson and K., Neil and P.H., Kamps and S., Babcock",2013.0,0,514
520,"Locomotor training effects on functional mobility, health, and emotional well-being in three adolescents with incomplete spinal cord injuries - A case series","The purpose of this case series is to describe the effects of locomotor training delivered in an outpatient therapy setting on gait, balance, overall health, and participation in school and community activities in 3 adolescents with incomplete spinal cord injuries. Background/Purpose: Rehabilitation of children following a spinal cord injury (SCI) has traditionally focused on the use of compensatory strategies. Over the past decade, there has been a shift in adult neurorehabilitation after SCI from the sole use of compensatory strategies to a focus on promoting recovery of neuromuscular activity below the level of the lesion. Locomotor training (LT) is an activity-based therapy that aims to retrain walking and postural control after SCI and is an effective intervention strategy with adults with incomplete SCI. The purpose of this case series is to describe the effects of LT delivered in an outpatient therapy setting on gait, balance, overall health, and participation in school and community activities in 3 adolescents with incomplete SCI. Procedures: Patients were recruited from centers participating in the NeuroRecovery Network (NRN). Inclusion criteria included a history of nonprogressive spinal cord lesion above T11, discharged from inpatient rehabilitation, and a medical referral by a physician. Standardized selection, evaluation, treatment, and discharge criteria were utilized and patients participated in LT following the program protocol. Patients were evaluated using standardized outcome measures focusing on neuromuscular control, motor, balance, walking, and functional skills. All procedures were in compliance with the institutional review boards of each NRN site. Intervention: All 3 patients participated in 90-minute sessions, consisting of 60 minutes of training on the treadmill with partial body weight support and 30 minutes of assessment overground and integration of skills into community/home activities. Training strategies were adapted to improve motivation of the adolescent patients while addressing the specific goals. Parents were involved in instruction for carryover of skill acquisition in the home. Goals were determined with patient and parent input, and any medical concerns were documented and monitored throughout the intervention period (eg, pain, spasticity). Case Descriptions: Patient X was a 15-year-old male diagnosed with a T5 AIS D injury following a snowboarding accident. He initiated LT 3 months after injury, completing 75 sessions over 7 months. Goals included returning to school at an ambulatory level, walking from school to the sports field to help coach, and return to drumming in his band. Patient Y was a 14-year-old male diagnosed with T5 AIS C paraplegia due to AVM rupture. He began LT 11 months after injury and completed 3 separate bouts of LT lasting 1 month, 5 months, and 15 months, respectively. His goals were to walk without assistance and return to school. Patient Z was a 14-year-old male diagnosed with C4 AIS D SCI sustained during a football game. He initiated LT 2 months after injury and received 45 sessions over 9 weeks. This patient's specific goals were to walk without dragging his foot and without falling. Outcomes: Both Patient X and Y transitioned from being primary manual wheelchair users to ambulating independently with bilateral single point canes (SPC) in the community. Patient X also walked in his home without an assistive device (AD). Patient Z, who was ambulatory without an AD prior to training, reduced his gait deviations of left genu recurvatum and left toe drag. All 3 patients demonstrated improvement with ambulation speed as measured on the 10-meter walk test. Patient X improved from 0.16 m/s with a rolling walker (RW) to 1.22 m/s without an AD; Patient Y from 0.12 m/s with a RW to .45 m/s with B SPCs; Patient Z from 1.3 m/s without AD to 1.72 m/s. Berg Balance Scale (BBS) scores improved from 8/56 to 48/56 and 7/56 to 31/56, respectively, for Patients X and Y while Patient Z reached a ceiling effect, scoring 55/56 at his initial evaluation. All patients reported improved social participation and were able to return to school, sports, or other age-appropriate social activities. These adolescents were weaned from antispasticity and anti cholinergic medications. Further medical issues, such as changes in bladder and bowel management and musculoskeletal issues, will be discussed. Discussion: These cases demonstrate that LT can be effectively applied for rehabilitation of adolescents resulting in meaningful improvements in balance, ambulation, and participation in school and community. Progression in therapy was within the context of multiple strengths and challenges commonly present among pediatric patients, including physical functioning during therapy, motivation and emotions, and family support. Developmentally appropriate adaptations to the therapy and parental involvement appear critical to success of therapy and will be discussed. Qualitative reports from adolescent patients suggested that returning to ambulatory levels with less restrictive assistive devices, without bracing, and with increased gait speed resulted in improved self-esteem, allowing them to increase their participation in their premorbid social activities and to set future personal goals to integrate more fully in the community.",Emotions;Self-Help Devices;Child;Only Child;Gait;Spinal Cord Injuries;Adolescent;child;institutional review;treadmill;drug therapy;bladder and bowel management;emotion;adaptation;brace;self esteem;body weight;pain;spasticity;genu recurvatum;skiing;accident;spinal cord lesion;paraplegia;rupture;football;hospital patient;manual wheelchair;gait disorder;physician;toe;Berg Balance Scale;social participation;devices;velocity;outpatient care;adult;compliance (physical);social behavior;neuromuscular function;parent;procedures;mobilization;sport;motivation;male;rehabilitation;skill;walking;gait;injury;therapy;community;school;patient;health;wellbeing;case study;human;adolescent;spinal cord injury;cholinergic receptor stimulating agent;steel,"E., Watson",2013.0,0,515
521,Listeners' attitudes toward children with voice problems.,"To investigate the attitudes of school teachers toward children with voice problems in a Chinese population. Three groups of listeners participated in this study: primary school teachers, speech-language pathology students, and general university students. The participants were required to make attitude judgments on 12 voice samples using a semantic differential scale with 22 bipolar adjective pairs. The voice samples were collected from 6 children with healthy voices and 6 children with dysphonia. The 22 bipolar adjective pairs were intended to cover nonspeech characteristics about the child's personality, social characteristics, and physical appearance. The mean attitude ratings received by children with dysphonic voice were significantly lower (i.e., less favorable) than those received by children with healthy voices in all of the 22 adjective pairs (all ps < .002). The attitude ratings made by the 3 groups of listeners were not significantly different from one another ( ps > .05). To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the authors examine listeners' perception toward children with voice problems in the Chinese population. The results suggest that voice problems in children warrant attention, and their effects on the child should not be underestimated. The findings also highlight the importance of early identification and intervention for children with voice problems.",Child;Attitude;Only Child;young adult;voice;university;student;speech perception;speech;social characteristics;semantics;psychological aspect;physical appearance;personality;pediatric voice disorders;noise;negative stereotype;male;listeners' perception;human;female;dysphonia;child psychology;child;attitude;Asian;article,"E.P., Ma and C.H., Yu",2013.0,0,516
522,Commentary: Reflections on diversity and inclusion in medical education,"The authors discuss how the strategy of fostering greater diversity and inclusion regarding minorities can help decrease health disparities and improve health outcomes. They propose that examining admission to medical school of qualified individuals with physical disabilities and fostering better communication with these individuals should be part of that strategy. Whereas people with disabilities constitute about 20% of the population, only between 2% and 10% are practicing physicians. The two major barriers to having more persons with disabilities as medical students are the cost of accommodating these persons and medical schools' technical standards. The authors offer suggestions for overcoming these barriers, and the additional barrier of communication with persons with various disabilities, such as deafness or visual impairment.The authors also discuss some of the issues involved in having greater representation of minorities in medicine. In addition, they stress the need for more training in cultural awareness for students and residents and for physicians well along in their careers. Medical educators will be increasingly called on to create new models designed to sensitize students and faculty to racial, ethnic, and other types of diversity, while documenting the efficacy and costs of extant ones, from the standpoint of both practitioner and consumer.The authors hope that the moves toward greater diversity and more training in cultural awareness will increase the efficacy of health care while reducing its cost. The demands of these efforts will require the commitment of diverse, intellectually capable, and compassionate people at many levels of academic medicine.","Education, Medical;United States;review;psychological aspect;personnel management;minority group;Disabled Persons;medical student;medical school;medical education;human;education;disabled person;curriculum;cultural competence;cultural anthropology;communication disorder","J.A., Delisa and J.J., Lindenthal",2012.0,0,517
523,"Association of hemostaseology assistants, Germany","The aim of our poster is to highlight important factors for improvement of patient compliance. As a result of the discussion of a recent workshop on this topic, and due to our own long-lasting experiences, current challenges will be presented and potential solutions towards a better patient-compliance management are discussed. Compliance in hemophilia - requirements for an enduring quality of life:Patient compliance in medicine means cooperative behaviour by the patient during medical treatment. Due to the chronic nature of their disease, patients with hemophilia have to cope with problems every day that are much different than problems resulting from other chronic diseases. As a matter of fact, hemophilia patients always have to carry their medication with them and need to have the skills that are necessary to administer the respective factor concentrate intravenously. Furthermore, they need to follow the directives of the medical team in order to be able to lead a relatively normal rather than handicapped life. The medical team of the hemophilia comprehensive care centre is always there, following a 24/7 hotline approach. ‚ÄúCan do‚Äù attitude: patients need to remember the time when they learned the self-administration of factor concentrate.

524,CP-PARTICIPATE: Facilitators and barriers to participation and independence of young people with cerebral palsy in education settings,"Objective: Extensive research describes participation preferences of young people with cerebral palsy (CP) and interventions to improve capacity for participation. However, despite the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) describing function as a product of person-environment interactions, there is limited research about the impact that environmental factors play in participation experiences. CP-PARTICIPATE is a study mapping how environmental and personal factors interact to facilitate and/or create barriers to independence and participation across home, education, work and community domains for people with CP. This paper describes the person-environment factors impacting experiences of young people in education. Design: Cross-sectional Cohort. Method: All young people aged 13-25 years with cerebral palsy registered with the Cerebral Palsy League, Queensland were invited to participate. Sixty-nine young people replied (42 males; GMFCS I=20, II=10, III=5, IV=11, V=23; 61% secondary school, 39% post-school). Participants completed the CP-PARTICIPATE survey which included a section that explored how participation experiences in secondary and post-school education settings were affected by environmental factors as defined by the ICF: e1 Products and Technology, e2 Natural/Human-made Environment, e3 Supports and Relationships, e4 Attitudes, and e5 Services, Systems and Policies. Response formats included survey (hardcopy, email, online, or PCS symbols) or interview (face-to-face or phone). Content analysis and thematic analysis were performed on descriptive responses. Results: Environmental barriers to education participation were reported by 66% of young people. Only 19% reported no barriers. The activities most frequently affected in secondary school were: physical education/ sports (64%), toileting/changing (62%) and getting about school (59%); and in post-school programs were: gaining a place (42%), completing assessment (58%) and social activities (58%). The most common environmental barriers included: inadequate 'Supports' (e3) e.g. aide time (30%); poor 'Attitudes' (e4) from students/teachers e.g. stigma about CP (28%); inadequate 'Technology' (e1) for task adaptations like writing (27%) and other functions (21%); inaccessible physical 'Environments' (e2) (22%). Many participants expressed multiple concerns, especially insufficient time/task adaption (28%) and limited support/ task adaption (28%). These barriers mainly resulted in inadequate time to participate optimally in class (30%). Strongest facilitators to participation were adequate carer/ therapist 'Supports' (e3) (26%), supportive 'Attitudes' (e4) of students/teachers (22%) and assistive 'Technology' (e1) for task adaptations (24%). Conclusion: Environmental factors greatly influence education experiences for young people with CP. Young people report needing more therapy support (e3) and assistive technology (e1) to enhance communication, mobility and performance in class; education to reduce stigma/ignorance of others (e4); and more flexible learning programs that accommodate factors such as additional time needs.","Cesarean Section;Cerebral Palsy;Gross Motor Function Classification System;therapy;interpersonal communication;community;male;learning;policy;e-mail;interview;Australia;content analysis;thematic analysis;sport;social behavior;writing;adaptation;technology;assistive technology;high school;International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health;environmental factor;school;environment;independence;education;human;cerebral palsy","L., Stafford and R., Smedley and L.M., Johnston",2012.0,0,519
525,Reality in field area in finding and confirming new cases,"National Leprosy Eradication Programme has been integrated with general health care system since 2004. Now entire responsibility of NLEP has been entrusted to general health care system. In the field the general health care system start from village level to District HQ Hospital level. At the village level, ASHA are stationed @ one ASHA in every 1000 population. ASHA is a lady activist belongs to same village and lives in the same village where she works. They are responsible for all health activities carried out at village level. HW (M/F) they support and supervise the work of ASHA from sub center level. At the sector level, one PHC functions in every 30000 population headed by one MO and supported by Health Supervisor(HS) and Pharmacist. They support and supervise the functions and activities of HWs. At Block level one Community Health Center (CHC) functions in every 1 lakh population headed by one Sr. MO supported by HS, Pharmacist, Block Extension Educator (BEE) and many other ancillary staffs. He/ she with his/her teams supervise work of PHC and SC. As per job chart of ASHA they are supposed to suspect a case of leprosy and refer the case to nearest PHC/CHC for confirmation of case. After st confirmation 1 dose of MDT is delivered to patient at PHC/CHC where patient has been confirmed and subsequent doses are delivered by the concerned HW of SC through ASHA. ASHA is also supposed to monitor the regularity of treatment till treatment completion. Under the programme ASHA is being paid incentive @ Rs.300/- per PB case and Rs.500/- per MB case referral but payment is done after successful completion of treatment. HW of SC collects MDT BCP every month from PHC from pharmacist and updates the PHC treatment register as well as case card. Pharmacist PHC/CHC indents the MDT, procure the drugs and keep the records updated at PHC / CHC level. Medical officer of PHC is trained in leprosy can confirm a case of leprosy and if not trained refer the case to MO CHC who is leprosy trained MO. He can confirm a case of leprosy and also complications if any and can advise treatment. Difficult to diagnose cases are referred to DLO/MO DN by MO CHC for confirmation in consultation of Dermatologist working at District HQ Hospital. Case card is prepared at the time of confirmation of case and transferred to respective SC. Finding of case mainly happens by two ways; 1. Suspects directly reporting before health system either to ASHA, HW or MO PHC/CHC 2. Suspects identified by field level health functionaries and referred to health centers. Self reporting of cases before system varies from place to places. This depends on; ‚Ä¢Awareness level of people/ community regarding early signs and symptoms of leprosy and its curability. ‚Ä¢Availability of trained manpower and responsive health system to receive the reporting case, listen his problem and solve the problem. ‚Ä¢Accessibility of health system or manpower. ‚Ä¢Stigma prevails in the community or person himself. Various studies conducted reveals that awareness level in community for the diseases is fairly well because of IEC activities conducted time to time since inception of programme. People believe on curability of disease with MDT. There is visible decline in occurrence of new cases and disability amongst new cases which are realized by all because of successful implementation of MDT programme since last 30 years. Availability of trained manpower and their sustenance is a problem. Even trained personnel are available but they are not responsive because of more other programmes they deal. Health systems in many places are not responsive. Somehow system's priority is decided by someone else. Many other interventions draw major intensions of system deviating them from regular planned strategy. Accessibility is a problem in many places but because of NRHM supports and availability of ASHA in every village they are easily accessible to people but actual place of confirmation and treatment is some time far away and also not available in regular basis. Stigma is also a major hindrance in reporting of the cases. Though it has come down but still persists. Above mentioned facts are realities in the field which prevent a suspect to report before health system and get service. Identification of suspects in the field is one of the job responsibilities of ASHA. As we know that ASHAs are not regular paid staff of Health & FW dept. rather they are activists. Their main job is to care pregnant women. Now they are being involved in almost all health programmes for which they are being paid incentives for different jobs. They are now overburdened with limited knowledge. Identification of leprosy cases or leprosy suspects by ASHA depends on her interest, rate and regularity of incentive payment and level of knowledge and her proximity and popularity with population. As we know, as such person having signs and symptoms of leprosy usually do not report unless enquired frequently. ASHA can reach each suspect through IPC or a suspect can frankly disclose his/ her signs and symptoms to ASHA but reality is that people consider ASHA as care taker of pregnant women only in non tribal areas where a suspect likes to disclose his or her findings to either ANM or MO PHC or leprosy worker but in outreached or in tribal areas suspect report to ASHA. That is the reason why percentage of case detection through ASHA referral is 20-60% in tribal areas where as in non tribal areas it is less than 10% of total case detection in Odisha. Before ASHAs were inducted under NRHM, identification of case was the responsibility of HWs. Confidence level of people on HWs particularly on ANM is very high than ASHA. HWs have earlier have participated in all leprosy campaigns and were backbone of provision of leprosy services under General Health care System. But since ASHAs were inducted and paid incentives for case identification, HWs are not taking much interest in case identification activity. But still a good number of cases self report to ANM for identification and treatment. Percentage of referral of suspects through HWs is 20-30% in Odisha. In urban areas case identification is a problems. AWWs and HWs posted under the ICDS and urban revamping programmes particularly in urban slums play a major role in identification of cases in urban slums. Moreover the self reporting of cases directly to Urban Health Centers much high. House hold and healthy contact survey has again been introduced in the programme. This activity is mainly done by Leprosy workers retained under integrated set up. Their numbers are going down because of their retirement and no new posting has been done since last 15 years. Hence contact survey in all areas is not uniform. Case detection through contacts examination is still a good and cost effective method of cases identification. Routine case identification activities through referral, contacts examination and self reporting methods are sustainable strategies but in reality we miss almost same number of cases what we detect every year and they remain undetected and source of infection in the community. This was revealed during Intensive Case detection Drive conducted in Odisha during 2010-11 in 50 high endemic blocks. We detected 1567 new cases in 47.78 lakhs of population during drive where as in same population 789 cases were detected through routine activities in previous year (2009-10). Similarly in NSS conducted in 2010-11, 129 new cases were detected by examining 971468 population in 10 Blocks and 1 urban areas. In the same population 114 cases were detected during the same year through routine methods. It means we are missing almost same number of cases or more what we detect through routine methods. As far as confirmation of case is concerned, it the job of MO PHC/CHC to confirm the case. Case is being confirmed on the basis of cardinal signs but diagnosis of early lepromatous leprosy cases with macular or fine infiltrative lesions in the field situation is difficult. Diagnosis of pure neural types of leprosy or facial lesions is difficult to confirm by MO PHC/CHC. Many a times if history taking is not complete or examination of case is not done properly or MO PHC/CHC does not know (Table Presented) about atypical presentation of case or if the circumstances in OPD is not conducive, the MO likely to miss the diagnosis. Such cases are either declared non case or kept under observation. If referred, the case does not feel to go to District Headquarter Hospital and remain undiagnosed till disability develops. So under diagnosis is a problem in rural areas. In urban areas, cases mostly go to DHH or Medical College where services of Dermatologists are available. But chances of recycling of cases or over treatment are much more in urban areas. Odisha is first State in the country to introduce 100% validation of cases in 2005-06 after a sample survey conducted by NIH&FW in 2 districts of Odisha in 2004-05. The finding revealed that around 40 % cases in Odisha are being wrongly diagnosed and registered for treatment. The DTST team of ILEP and MO DN were given responsibility to conduct 100% validation of cases confirmed at PHC/CHCs before registration. Simultaneously MO PHC/CHC were provided hands on training by MO DN and Modular training at State level to built up their capacity for correct diagnosis of leprosy cases. This has resulted in reduction of wrong diagnosis of leprosy cases at PHCs/CHCs considerably. The correctness of diagnosis has improved from 60% in 2004-05 to 92-96% in 2010-11. Now entire responsibility of confirmation of cases has been entrusted to MO CHC and now necessity of validation of all the cases by MO DN is not felt.",Referral and Consultation;Pharmacists;Leprosy;personnel;self report;medical personnel;rural area;deterioration;retirement;consultation;infection;lepromatous leprosy;anamnesis;medical school;recycling;register;diseases;registration;patient;pregnant woman;worker;female;dermatologist;disability;hospital;manpower;physical disease by body function;examination;health center;community;health care system;pharmacist;urban area;work;health care;responsibility;health;diagnosis;population;leprosy;human;Indian,"P.K.B., Patnaik",2012.0,0,520
526,Israeli Arab teachers' attitudes on inclusion of students with disabilities,"The paper describes a study done in middle schools, grades 7-9, in Israel of Arab teachers' attitudes towards inclusion in general and in their school in particular. A specially designed questionnaire was used for the survey. The sample was composed of 325 randomly selected middle school Arab teachers in Israel. Findings revealed conflicting attitudes. On the one hand, high commitment was reported by the teachers to the inclusion of students with special needs in regular education in the areas of learning, social inclusion and emotional development. Similarly, they reported a positive view of the feasibility of adapting teaching materials for their special needs students. On the other hand, teachers expressed the view that the inclusion of students with special needs does not contribute to the ""regular"" students in the academic studies and regarding the social and personal-emotional areas. They also did not feel that typical students benefited from the additional assistive technologies that are brought into their classroom. In addition, teachers did not see the benefits of inclusion to the overall schools' reputation. Three quarters of the respondents said that the school had no formal written statement concerning the inclusion of students with special needs. However, they were of the opinion that they had satisfactory opportunities to discuss issues concerning inclusion with their school administration (i.e. the school principal or his/her deputy) and they had fairly satisfactory assistance from the special education local area consultants. As far as accessibility goes, more than one half of the teachers expressed the view that their school was only partially accessible. Relations between school teachers and families were found to be very limited.",Attitude;Arabs;teacher;special education;sex difference;questionnaire;physical disability;normal human;male;Israel;human;gender;female;employee attitude;disabled person;controlled study;college student;attitude to disability;article;Arab;adult,"N., Kami and S., Reiter and D.N., Bryen",2011.0,0,521
527,Health promotion in music schools an international project tale,"Purpose: The purpose of the presentation is to introduce physiotherapists to a project to assist Music Schools to prevent occupational injuries associated with learning and performing music. In a first phase we proposed to identify health habits and postural and other musculoskeletal risks related to musical activities. At the same time we intend to aware and provide knowledge to students, teachers and parents to prevent injuries and develop and implement healthpromoting strategies (course and audiovisual materials to complement the learning process) supervised by a group of physiotherapists and musical educators. Relevance: Musical activities, performed by professionals or students, involve physical and psychosocial domains. Technical movements and constant search for perfection leads to the musicians beyond their physical limits, being permanently exposed to musculoskeletal risks. The specificity of these problems becomes more important as each musical instrument is associated with a unique set of injuries that are related to the physical and postural demands of playing that instrument. Widespread interest in health promotion increases demand for Physiotherapy, to help people to increase their control over determinants of health and well-being. This is accomplished by teaching people the importance of fitness and physical activity, while showing them how to avoid injuries associated with learning and performing music. Description: An extensive literature review and experts counselling were conducted to identify general and specific instruments to assess musicians frequent complaints. Within an exploratory study, data has been collected by self-administered questionnaires using a physical and psychological protocol that included Functioning Index for Instrumental Musicians, Young People's Activity Questionnaire - Music (YAQ-m), Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire, Physical Exercise Self- Efficacy Scale, health behaviours and demographics. Cooperation between Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra, College of Health Technology - Physiotherapy and UmeaÀö University, Community Medicine and Rehabilitation - Physiotherapy was established. Since January 2010 we have discussed strategies to develop blended learning teaching techniques; develop materials about anatomy/physiology, epidemiology, ergonomics, physical activity and exercise, stress, relaxation, sleep and recovery to teach undergraduate students in the field of health promotion in music schools; implement the program in music schools (in Portugal and Sweden); analyse previous research projects in both countries on evaluation of health promotion in music schools; preparing future research (comparative study). Evaluation: After one year, we prepared and implemented a face-to-face 2 hours session for musical students, educators and parents. Participants reported high satisfaction and motivation to keep involved in future. So far, we got preliminary data that confirms musician have pain and mild difficulty in musical activities. Self-efficacy for physical exercise was assessed and we completed a first draft of 15 session course. Conclusions: These findings suggest that musicians are constantly at risk of wide range of physical and psychological problems, which can endanger their learning and musical performance. Implications: Together, we plan to develop a new field of study, keep learning from different educational methods and different perspectives, and develop blended learning teaching techniques in health promotion and preventive work.",Association Learning;Physical Therapy Modalities;Posture;Music;Health Promotion;occupational accident;teacher;satisfaction;shoulder;Sweden;health behavior;undergraduate student;audiovisual equipment;college;epidemiology;technology;university;wellbeing;community medicine;rehabilitation;ergonomics;sleep;habit;arm;fitness;Portugal;comparative study;counseling;motivation;pain;disability;parent;physical activity;self concept;physiotherapist;injury;exercise;health;teaching;student;questionnaire;musician;learning;human;risk;physiotherapy;school;music;health promotion,"A., Martins and A., Fjellman-Wiklund and A., Leite",2011.0,0,522
528,Profile of Brazilian pregnant women with urinary incontinence and lower urinary tract symptoms attended at basic health units,"Hypothesis / aims of studyThis study aimed to identify the profile of pregnant women with urinary incontinence (UI) attended at the basic health units in thecity of Fortaleza/CE/Brazil, and the association of UI with other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).Study design, materials and methodsQuantitative study, cross-sectional, descriptive and exploratory, held on 29 basic health units that performed prenatal care, onall six Executive Regional General Offices in Fortaleza/CE. The simple random sampling formula was used, which resulted on96 pregnant women, thus, 6 more women were included, and the total was 102 pregnant women. The participants had between20 and 39 years old, one fetus and gestational age (GA) of 32 to 41 weeks. To be included on the study, the participants had tobe registered on the Family Health Center of the Brazilian Public Health System, and present any type or intensity of UI on thelast tree months. The pregnancy must have been considered of low gestational risk factor, with only one fetus. The womencould be of any skin color, social, economic or cultural level. There were excluded from the study women with multiple fetus,hypertension, collagen disease, Diabetes Mellitus, neurological and/or respiratory disease, history of spine and/or pelvic surgery(except caesarian), in use of parasympathicomimetic drug or sympatholitic, and having any kind of impairment to communicate.Information was obtained in the Prenatal Chart and/or by previous history. Eight research assistants interviewed the pregnantwomen. An interview containing socialdemografic and obstetrics information was used to collect data. All participants signed aconsent form. Data was collected between July and September of 2009, after the ethical approval for the study was obtainedfrom a research ethical committee (by the report #264/2009). Data was coded and transferred to the Statistical Package forSocial Services (SPSS) 13.0 version for Windows Software. Analysis was carried out on such a way that socialdemographicand obstetrics variables were summarized in absolute and relative frequencies, and the descriptive analysis meant toc haracterized the population of the study. The results were considered statically significant if p ‚â§ 0.05.ResultsMean age was 28.57 years (sd= 5.28); the amount of single and married women were the same; 48% completed high school;the majority were housewives. There were 4.75 residents/bathroom/house. Mean family income was 1.18 minimum salary.Women's skin color was categorized into white - 37.3% (n=38) - and non-white - 62.7% (n=64) - due to the fact that 44% ofBrazilian's population is considered mulatto, expressing a multiracial society. Mean number of pregnancies was 2.67; 1.4 ofbirths and 0.33 of abortion - the greater part were primiparous, without co-morbities, sedentary, got pregnant without planning,and the mean GA was 34,8 weeks. The multiparous had two times more vaginal delivery than cesarean section, and positiveassociation for episiotomy (88.9%). There was 44.4% of newborns with birth weight above 3500g. Most women were on thebeginning of 3rd trimester (70.588%, n=72). The most significant correlations were between vaginal delivery with episiotomyand number of episiotomies (p=0,001). Although all women had UI, other urinary symptoms were described: increased urinaryfrequency (97.1%), nocturia (96.1%), stress UI (86%), urgency (85.3%), urgency UI (78.4%), recurrent urinary tract infections(70.6%), bladder pain (69.6%), voiding symptoms (59.8%), coital incontinence (57.8%) e nocturnal enuresis (55.9%). The studyidentified that many pregnant women believed UI was a normal event during pregnancy and did not know how to prevent it.When pregnancy was not previously planned, there was significant correlation to three urinary symptoms: nocturnal enuresis(p=0.013), intercourse leakage (p=0.021) and bladder pain (p=0.033). Single mothers presented more urgency incontinence(p=0.053). When the familiar income was < 2 minimum salaries, the LUTS affected were nocturnal enuresis (p=0.024) andcoital incontinence (p=0.018). There was no statistical association concerning physical exercise practice, episiotomy and/orLUTS.Interpretation of resultsMost women participating on the study seamed surprised by the questions of the interview. They did not considered themselvessick (because of the UI), and did not know about a way of preventing or minimizing the effects of urinary loss. Some womenshowed lack of interest, because they supposed that UI was a normal fact during pregnancy and it should disappear afterdelivery - as some friends and family members have suggested. It was reported that health disadvantages happen primarily ongroups socially vulnerable and have cumulative effects [1]. If this is true, a correct mapping, selection of sources and the dadabasis could be a solution for the study's problem. The use of a health technology - Prenatal Chart - should guarantee anadequate antenatal care; however it lacks some precious information about UI, challenging integrality and equity care. Thestudy revealed that most women were on the beginning of 3rd trimester (70.588%, n=72) and by this time, a great part ofantenatal health professionals have not asked about the occurrence of UI during pregnancy (89.2%). They also have notexplained what women should do if they experienced UI (94.1%). It has been proved an increase on the occurrence of LUTSand in bladder's pressure as pregnancy progresses; meanwhile there is a decrease on urethral sphincter and an overweight ofthe pelvic floor. The two LUTS more prevalent were frequency and nocturia. They were even more prevalent than SUI and UUI.This study confirms the results of other studies [2, 3]. These symptoms could be explained by the physiological modifications onbladder pressure and volume, and by the stress pregnancy produces over the pelvic floor (and vaginal birth), which couldincrease the sensation of urinary loss (greater during pregnancy than on nuliparous pre-menopause women).Concluding messageUI is a silent disease, however it is not contemplated as a public health goal in Brazil. Most women were non-white - 62.7%,during the beginning of 3rd trimester and were primiparous. The multiparous had two times more vaginal delivery than cesareansection, and positive association for episiotomy (88.9%). There was 44.4% of newborns with birth weight above 3500g. The increased urinary frequency (97.1%) and nocturia (96.1%) were the two LUTS most cited. The study revealed that singlepregnant women, white skin colored and whose pregnancy was not planned, showed direct correlation with some LUTS. Theantenatal health professionals did not conduct properly the UI during pregnancy, probably because there is no place on thePrenatal Chart and a more specific direction on the Antenatal and Puerperium Manual promoted by the Health GovernmentAdministration. This fact justifies the necessity of an adequate hearing and humanized care by health professionals involved onthe antenatal and after birth period.","Levonorgestrel;Public Health;Cesarean Section;Family Health;Infant, Newborn;Pregnancy;Urinary Incontinence;Humanism;Humanities;Humans;high school;exercise;salary;mother;sexual intercourse;urinary tract infection;cesarean section;planning;abortion;married woman;software;scientist;pelvis surgery;spine;respiratory tract disease;diabetes mellitus;collagen disease;hypertension;risk factor;tree;health care;family health;gestational age;sampling;manager;study design;hypothesis;obesity;bladder sphincter;bladder pressure;book;puerperium;skin;urinary frequency;Brazil;premenopause;hearing;sensation;technology;friend;population;skin color;income;newborn;birth weight;prenatal care;cystalgia;public health;interview;obstetrics;pelvis floor;fetus;health practitioner;health;nocturia;nocturnal enuresis;incontinence;vaginal delivery;episiotomy;pregnancy;continence;health center;urine incontinence;pregnant woman;lower urinary tract symptom;society;human;female","J., Pires and Silva R., Da",2011.0,0,523
529,Knowledge and perceptions of qualified and student teachers towards ADHD and the role of medication,"Some 5% of school-aged children are thought to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). School teachers are often charged with containing ADHD behaviours. Recent Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guidance recommends that teachers become more closely involved in the diagnostic and/or treatment process.1 This assumes that they have a sound knowledge of the disorder and its treatment. Analyses of teacher training programmes at Scottish universities revealed that none of them offer courses that cover the diagnosis and medical treatment of ADHD. Teachers are therefore left to access ADHD information by their own means; including use of ‚Äúthe media, friends and parents of children with ADHD‚Äù.2 The potential for misinformation, culminating in incorrect or inappropriate feedback to the clinician, is exacerbated by this situation. AIMS: To determine and compare the knowledge and attitudes of qualified and student teachers towards ADHD and its treatment. The nature of information resources was also investigated. METHOD: A self-administered questionnaire was developed using items from validated questionnaires used in similar studies' and distributed among teachers attending undergraduate and postgraduate courses at the University of Strathclyde. Knowledge was determined by True/False/Don't know responses to 15 statements related to general issues about ADHD, followed by 18 medication specific statements. Beliefs and attitudes were identified by a five-point Likert scale response to 12 statements.1 RESULTS: Sixty-eight questionnaires were returned by 43 qualified teachers (response rate = 92%) and 25 student teachers (78%). Forty-four individuals had taught a child with ADHD and 25 had received formal training about the condition. The mean number of correct responses to 15 ADHD knowledge statements was 5.1 (SD 2.3) for qualified teachers and 5.4 (standard deviation [SD] 2.5) for student teachers. On medication specific issues, student teachers had a greater number of correct responses (mean 3.6 [SD 3.4] compared with 3.3 [SD 2.8]) but this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.64). There was general agreement that teachers should be aware of medication side effects, and that they should be more closely involved in monitoring a child's response to medication. The most popular sources for information about the disorder were found to be ‚Äúother colleagues‚Äù (87%) and the internet (86%). Knowledge and use of previously evaluated4 high-quality ADHD websites was low - eg, only 11 respondents were aware of ADDISS (the national Attention Deficit Disorder Information and Support Service) and only 10 were aware of Mind's ADHD website. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Teachers lack knowledge of the basic concepts of ADHD and also seem ignorant about the cognitive and adverse effects of ADHD medication. The potential for inadvertently attributing improvements or relapses in the child's functioning to the medication or the disorder are therefore high. This is a particularly worrying since all the qualified teachers were designated ‚Äúsupport teachers‚Äù with responsibility for children with ‚Äúadditional support needs‚Äù and so should be bener informed than their unqualified counterparts. This suggests that there is an unmet need in the education and training of teachers. Moreover, there appears to be a reliance for information on ‚Äúother colleagues‚Äù, who may be similarly misinformed, and the internet. Unfortunately, awareness of government health or education-based websites was low, again compromising the quality of information accessed by teachers. The training of school teachers in medication-associated issues appears to be an area ripe for pharmacist involvement. Training need not be limited to advising on the physical effects of medication but could address other medication-specific issues such as administration, storage and misuse.",Questionnaires;Child;Only Child;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;therapy;postgraduate student;side effect;pharmacist;storage;health;government;monitoring;friend;adverse drug reaction;relapse;parent;responsibility;feedback system;diagnosis;university;education;Internet;questionnaire;school;diseases;child;attention deficit disorder;drug therapy;pharmacy;student;mental health;teacher;college;human,"G., Akram and A.H., Thomson and A.C., Boyter and M., McLarty",2011.0,0,524
530,Perceived climate in physical activity settings,"This study focused on the perceived climate for LGBT youth and other minority groups in physical activity settings. A large sample of undergraduates and a selected sample including student teachers/interns and a campus Pride group completed a school climate survey and rated the climate in three physical activity settings (physical education, organized sport, exercise). Overall, school climate survey results paralleled the results with national samples revealing high levels of homophobic remarks and low levels of intervention. Physical activity climate ratings were mid-range, but multivariate analysis of variation test (MANOVA) revealed clear differences with all settings rated more inclusive for racial/ethnic minorities and most exclusive for gays/lesbians and people with disabilities. The results are in line with national surveys and research suggesting sexual orientation and physical characteristics are often the basis for harassment and exclusion in sport and physical activity. The current results also indicate that future physical activity professionals recognize exclusion, suggesting they could benefit from programs that move beyond awareness to skills and strategies for creating more inclusive programs. ¬© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Sports;Motor Activity;Adolescent;Homosexuality, Male;sport;social psychology;social environment;school;race;physical education;perception;minority group;male;human;homosexuality;female;disabled person;article;adult","D.L., Gill and R.G., Morrow and K.E., Collins and A.B., Lucey and A.M., Schultz",2010.0,0,525
531,The performance of school integration according to the perception of specialist teachers in therapeutic pedagogy,"The main purpose of this article is to analyse the perception that specialist teachers in therapeutic pedagogy have of the integration of students with specific needs for educational support. Diverse groups of students are differentiated. More specifically, it aims to know how teachers perceive students' performance and participation, and also certain attitudes towards the students (acceptance, involvement of fellow students...). Teachers' opinions of various measures to improve integration are also analysed as are the diverse preferred means of schooling and support. For this purpose, a 114-item Lickert-type questionnaire, with 8 additional personal identification items, was used. The sample comprised 106 specialist teachers who work in Asturias, out of an entire sample of 406. The results reveal that specialist teachers do not perceive the same attitudes in the different groups studied. Students with behaviour disorders are the most rejected and the ones from whom teachers can expect the least. The group of ethnic minorities needs to improve family involvement. The specialists demand more human and physical resources and most of them think that ordinary centres provide the most suitable form of schooling. ¬© 2010 Psicothema.",Humanism;Humanities;Humans;university;Spain;questionnaire;psychological aspect;professional practice;perception;middle aged;methodology;mental deficiency;male;human relation;human;handicapped child;female;curriculum;child;behavior disorder;attitude;article;adult,"M.√Å., Campo-Mon and P., Castro-Pa√±eda and E., √Ålvarez-Martino and M., √Ålvarez-Hern√°ndez and E., Torres-Manzanera",2010.0,0,526
532,Randomized trial of peer-supported physical activity for persons with severe mental illness in community psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: Persons with severe mental illness (SMI) carry a tremendous burden of medical comorbidity and die on average 25 years earlier than the general population due in large part to CVD. Regular physical activity decreases CVD risk, yet effective physical activity interventions tailored to SMI are lacking. Social support influences physical activity in the general population, and peer support programs are gaining popularity among mental health consumers. Peer-supported physical activity may be effective in persons with SMI. We designed and piloted a physical activity intervention based in a peer-support model for persons with SMI. METHODS: We conducted a randomized clinical trial in 2 urban adult community psychiatry clinics. We enrolled participants and exercise peer leaders with SMI. Participants were randomized to group exercise (control) or group exercise+peer support (intervention). Fitness instructors led exercise classes 3x/week. Exercise peer leaders received social skills training and motivational techniques, participated in exercise, and provided support for intervention participants to attend and participate. They also met weekly with participants to track progress and conduct practical problem solving. The primary outcome at four months was cardiorespiratory fitness measured by time on submaximal exercise treadmill test. We also report changes in 6-minute walk test, (increased distance represents fitness improvement), and exercise self-efficacy. RESULTS: Across 4 cohorts, 93 participants were randomized to intervention or control and 22 exercise peer leaders enrolled. Intervention, control and peer leader groups had similar baseline characteristics: mean age 47; 77% women; 72% African American; 1/4 not high school graduates; 1/4 had schizophrenia; 1/4 had bipolar disorder and 1/2 had severe depression. Twenty-five% attended at least 1/2 of the 4 month, 3 x per week exercise classes; attendance was similar in intervention and controls. Two-thirds completed follow-up measurements; follow-up was higher in intervention attenders. Exercise treadmill test time increased from pre- to post- for the intervention group (2.3 minutes, 22% change, p<0.016) and for the controls (1.6 minutes, 13%, p<0.08), P=.6 for intervention/control comparison. Peer leaders also increased exercise time (n=20,1.4 minutes, 10%, p<0.04). The intervention group increased a mean of 128 (SD 294) ft (10%) on the 6-minute walk (p< 0.04) compared to controls, mean -20 ft (SD 232) (-15%) (p<0.69); intervention/control p<0.066. Intervention compared to control participants reported exercise self-efficacy improvement: exercise when depressed (p<0.05); exercise with others even if they are too fast/ slow (p<0.008); and exercise when undergoing stressful life change (p<0.016). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of a peer-supported physical activity intervention in persons with SMI in 2 community psychiatry programs including training mental health consumers with SMI as peer leaders. We confronted challenges with data collection at off-site locations (e.g., GCRC) and attendance at midday classes without parking or transportation reimbursement. We found modest improvements in the 6-minute walk test and exercise self-efficacy in the group receiving peer-support compared to controls. These results will contribute to designing future, critically needed programs to increase physical activity participation and decrease cardiovascular disease risk among persons with severe mental illness.",Personality Disorders;Community Psychiatry;Motor Activity;Comorbidity;Mentally Ill Persons;Exercise Test;information processing;bipolar disorder;schizophrenia;high school graduate;African American;female;problem solving;social adaptation;hospital;adult;clinical trial;model;social support;comorbidity;cardiovascular disease;reimbursement;traffic and transport;risk;treadmill;population;follow up;consumer;mental health;self concept;fitness;peer group;exercise;mental disease;social psychiatry;society;internal medicine;physical activity,"G., Daumit and L., Appel and E., Leatherman and C., Latkin and A., Dalcin and B., Goggins and G., Jerome",2010.0,0,527
533,Pregnancy outcomes among daycare employees in Finland,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether working as a daycare employee increases the risk of perinatal death, pre-term birth, low birth weight, smallness for gestational age, or congenital malformations. Methods: We conducted a register-based cohort study among daycare employees and women from various occupations of healthcare (reference group). Study subjects were identified from the files of Finnish trade unions and the National Authority for Medicolegal Affairs. Pregnancy outcomes, antenatal occupation, and working status were obtained by linkage to national registers. The final data consisted of 13 299 and 12 182 singleton births in the study and reference groups, respectively. We analyzed pregnancy outcome data using generalized estimating equations and linear regression. Results: The occurrences of pre-term birth [odds ratio (OR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.79-1.06], perinatal death (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.62-1.34), smallness for gestational age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91-1.12), and congenital malformation (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.92-1.32) were similar among the children of the daycare employees and the reference group. The adjusted mean birth weight of the children of the daycare employees was slightly higher (14 g, 95% CI -1-29) than that of the reference group, but the difference was attenuated to 6 g in the subset of the first births. Conclusion: Daycare employees were not, in general, at an increased risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome. However, efforts should nevertheless be made to prevent their exposure to harmful viruses and heavy physical load during pregnancy.",Term Birth;Pregnancy Outcome;Pregnancy;trade union;teacher;small for date infant;register;priority journal;premature labor;pregnancy outcome;perinatal death;occupational hazard;nursery school;nurse;major clinical study;low birth weight;human;high risk behavior;Finland;female;employment status;day care;controlled study;congenital malformation;cohort analysis;birth weight;article;adverse outcome;adult,"A., Riipinen and M., Sallm√©n and H., Taskinen and A., Koskinen and M.-L., Lindbohm",2010.0,0,528
534,Sports injuries in young athletes: Long-term outcome and prevention strategies,"Physical activity plays a significant role in the physical and emotional well-being of a child. In the past 15 to 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in sports participation at a young age, which has offered numerous health benefits, including self-esteem, confidence, team play, fitness, agility, and strength. Children are playing sports at younger ages. This article assesses the long-term outcome of sports injuries in young athletes, with suggestions on how to prevent such injuries. There are no definitive epidemiological data on withdraw from sports activities due to injury in young athletes. Disturbed physeal growth as a result of injury can result in length discrepancy, angular deformity, or altered joint mechanics, and may cause significant long-term disability. Sequelae of Osgood-Schlatter lesion include painful ossicle in the distal patellar tendon. Fragmentation or separation of the apophysis appears to be the result of adaptive changes to the increased stress that occurs in overuse activities. The presence of these changes undeniably demonstrates an osseous reaction, although they are not disabling. Promotion of a physically active lifestyle is encouraged worldwide, particularly with regard to the many health benefits. Reduction of only a moderate proportion of all sports injuries is of significance for the young athletes' health and could have a long-term economic impact on health care costs. It is therefore important to convince medical doctors, physical therapists, athletic trainers and coaches, as well as athletes of the necessity to implement active prevention measures in their therapy and training programs, thus decreasing the injury and re-injury rate and enhancing athletic performance. ¬© The Physician and Sports Medicine.",Child;Only Child;Sports;Motor Activity;Athletic Injuries;zygapophyseal joint;training;sport injury;physical activity;patellar ligament;outcome assessment;osteoarthritis;long term care;lifestyle;knee injury;human;health care cost;economic aspect;disability severity;athlete;article,"N., Maffulli and U.G., Longo and F., Spiezia and V., Denaro",2010.0,0,529
535,Evaluation of an adaptive ice skating programme for children with disabilities,"Objective: To describe an adaptive ice skating programme designed by paediatric therapists. Methods: Twenty-two children, ages 512 years, with developmental disabilities participated in this once per week skating programme lasting 6 weeks. Ice skating instructors led the group lessons, while university student coaches provided individualized assistance to the children. The programme was evaluated using a summative evaluation design. Outcomes included participant attendance, incidence of injuries, skating skills and parent and student coach survey data. Results: On average, participants attended 83 of the sessions and one minor injury was reported. Participants' parents were very satisfied with the programme and reported improvements in their child's skating skills, leg strength, endurance, balance, self-esteem/confidence and ability to participate in a group. Student coaches also reported high levels of satisfaction with this programme and reported similar improvements in the children they coached. Conclusion: The programme appeared promising, but may require minor modifications. ¬© 2009 Informa UK Ltd.",Child;Only Child;Skating;Disabled Children;university student;strength;sport;skill;sensory dysfunction;self esteem;satisfaction;priority journal;pediatrics;parent;outcome assessment;morbidity;Moebius syndrome;male;leg;human;hearing impairment;female;endurance;emotional disorder;disorders of mitochondrial functions;developmental disorder;confidentiality;clinical evaluation;clinical article;child;cerebral palsy;behavior disorder;autism;article,"M.A., Fragala-Pinkham and H.M., Dumas and M., Boyce and C.Y., Peters and S.M., Haley",2009.0,0,530
536,School reintegration for children and youth with acquired brain injury,"Objectives: To determine the limitations and barriers to successful school reintegration for children and youth living with the effects of ABI via quantitative evaluation of student, educator, and school-based factors using standardized measures. Statistically verify student variables (preinjury academic status, impairment measures, postinjury physical, and neurocognitive abilities) with educator's awareness, attitude, and educational approach. Determine if programming support and environmental priorities of the school may be predictive of improved performance for this specialized population in terms of their outcomes for school adjustment, classroom participation, sense of school membership, and academic competence. Method: Using a multicentered approach, currently enrolled Ontario students between ages 6 and 18 (and their associated family, teacher(s), and the principal) who have experienced a moderate or severe ABI, are at least 2 years postinjury, and have returned to their community school environment are identified by our partner centers. Students, parents, educators, and administrators complete comprehensive tests measuring school performance, social integration, cognition, behavioral/emotional status, physical ability of the student, and educational approaches and protocol of the school environment. Hierarchical regression analyses are identifying those factors that best predict success in the classroom for students with moderate to severe ABI. Results: Our research aims to identify those variables and school/systemic factors that influence and alter successful scholastic experiences and reintegration of students who have experienced ABI. These results have implications for transitional follow-through, school policy, and future outcomes for students with the capacity to return to the social and educational opportunities in the classroom.",Child;Brain;Only Child;Brain Injuries;Adolescent;physical performance;parent;community;teacher;Canada;competence;population;policy;regression analysis;physical capacity;cognition;integration;administrative personnel;environment;academic achievement;student;juvenile;child;brain injury;school;society,"D., Good and P., Rumney and J., McDougall and S., Bennett and R., Martinussen and C., DeMatteo and P., McKeever and D., Guerriere and S., Loyst and J., Kumpf and N., DeCourville",2009.0,0,531
537,Friendship experiences among children with disabilities who attend mainstream Australian schools,"Purpose. To explore the experiences of friendship for children with disabilities who attend mainstream Australian schools. Background. Being a friend is an important occupational role for all children. However, the literature suggests that physical inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools does not necessarily develop social inclusion. Methods. Phenomenology was used to explore friendship experiences of 10 primary school children with disabilities. Findings. Five themes emerged from the data: (1) self-identity; (2) meaning of friendship; (3) classroom experiences; (4) playing together; (5) longing for friendship. These themes reflected the importance of friendship in the children's lives, the influence of the children's beliefs and values, and the impact of the attitudes and actions of educational staff and other students. Implications.

538,Friendships of children who have cerebral palsy and complex communication needs,"Background: Little is known about friendships between typically developing children and their peers who have cerebral palsy (CP) and complex communication needs (CCN), despite these relationships being a primary goal of inclusive education programs. Children with a disability experience less social participation than typically developing children, and have fewer reciprocal friendships with non-disabled peers. The friendships that they do form may be different from those between typically developing children. Awareness of how these friendships are initiated and maintained, and how typically developing children view their friend's disability and communication needs may (1) help to promote integration, and (2) inform programs facilitating social interaction between children with and without CP and CCN. Objectives: To investigate the friendship experiences of typically developing children with children who have CP and CCN. Design: This qualitative study used in-depth interviews and narrative methodology. Participants/Setting: Six typically developing children (7 and 14 years) identified as having shown an interest in a classmate with CP and CCN were interviewed at school. Materials/Methods: Children participated in two in-depth interviews lasting 30-60 minutes. Interviews were digitally audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Narrative analysis of the children's stories of friendships occurred concurrently with data collection. At the second interview, the de-identified re-storied narratives were shared with participants to check the authenticity of the interpretations and to gain further understanding of their experiences. Results: Participants expressed a diverse range of attitudes towards friendship with children with CP and CCN including commitment to the friendship; the additional responsibilities expected of them (e.g. physical care, mentoring and advocacy); and inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream activities. Common themes included friendship establishment, roles and expectations, and the nature of shared activities and interactions. The participants viewed their friendships with peers with CP and CCN positively. Most did not perceive mobility or communication limitations as a significant barrier to friendship. Conclusions/Clinical implications: Results of this small qualitative study indicate that there are key factors that influence the development of friendships between children with and without a disability, including (1) the motivations behind friendship initiation and maintenance, (2) the qualities of each child in the friendship, and (3) the roles and responsibilities fulfilled by the typically developing friend. Consideration of these issues by clinicians, educators and parents may facilitate, support and extend the friendship experiences of children with cerebral palsy.",Child;Only Child;Disabled Children;Cerebral Palsy;social interaction;motivation;parent;information processing;school;methodology;education program;disabled person;responsibility;qualitative research;friend;narrative;disability;interview;interpersonal communication;cerebral palsy;friendship;child,"K., Anderson and S., Balandin and S., Clendon and B., Hemsley",2009.0,0,533
539,Screening for motor coordination challenges in children using teacher ratings of physical ability and activity,"We examined the effectiveness of a teacher-based rating scale called the teacher estimation of activity form (TEAF) to screen for developmental coordination disorder (DCD) in children. A random selection of 15 of 75 schools from the District School Board of Niagara in Ontario, Canada was chosen for this study. Every consented child in Grade 4 (n = 502) was evaluated for probable DCD (pDCD) in school using the short form Bruininks-Oseretsky test of motor proficiency (BOTMP-SF). Each student also completed the children's self perceptions of adequacy in and predilection toward physical activity (CSAPPA) scale, participation questionnaire, and L√©ger 20-meter shuttle run, and had their height and weight measured. The 27 children (5.1%) who scored below the 5th percentile on BOTMP-SF were designated as pDCD cases and the 475 children who scored above the 5th percentile served as controls. Results showed that mean TEAF scores were significantly lower for pDCD children than controls (p < .001). Total TEAF scores ranging from 28 to 32 were preferred in maintaining good sensitivity (.74, 95% CI = .55-.87 to .85, 95% CI = .68-.94). The area under the ROC curve was .77 (95% CI, .68-.86) for the TEAF total score, and some individual items performed approximately as well as the full scale. The TEAF was positively correlated with measures of physical activity and fitness. The TEAF appears to be an effective tool in screening for DCD, particularly in a population setting. Considering the brevity of the TEAF and the discriminative power of individual items, this instrument would be effective in an abbreviated version.

540,Girls' hyperactivity and physical aggression during childhood and adjustment problems in early adulthood: A 15-year longitudinal study,"Context: The co-occurrence of hyperactivity and conduct problems in childhood seems to increase the risk of early adulthood adjustment problems in males. However, little is known about this topic in females. Objectives: To describe the joint developmental trajectories of female hyperactivity and physical aggression during childhood and to examine the extent to which high trajectories of hyperactivity and physical aggression predict adjustment problems in early adulthood. Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 881 females from a population-based sample were studied. Developmental trajectories were described using teachers' ratings of behavior problems from the age of 6 to 12 years. Main Outcome Measures: Age 21 years self-reports of substance use problems, criminal behaviors, aggression in intimate relationships, early pregnancy, educational attainment, and welfare assistance. Results: Between the ages of 6 and 12 years, the frequency of hyperactivity and physical aggression tended to decrease for most girls. Those on a trajectory of high hyperactivity (HH) and high physical aggression (HPA) and a trajectory of HH alone were significantly more likely to report nicotine use problems (odds ratio [OR], 2.16 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.30-3.56] and OR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.39-3.58], respectively), mutual psychological aggression in intimate relationships (OR, 2.28 [95% CI, 1.24-4.18] and OR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.19-3.85], respectively), and low educational attainment (OR, 4.09 [95% CI, 2.33-7.18] and OR, 3.21 [95% CI, 1.84-5.59], respectively) compared with the other females at the age of 21 years. Only the HH-HPA females were significantly more likely to report physical aggression (OR, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.41-4.37]) and psychological aggression (OR, 2.54 [95% CI, 1.48-4.36]) in intimate relationships, early pregnancy (OR, 2.31 [95% CI, 1.17-4.56]), and welfare assistance (OR, 2.68 [95% CI, 1.33-5.41]) compared with the other females. Conclusions: Elementary school girls with elevated levels of hyperactivity should be targeted for intensive prevention programs. These interventions should take into account the presence or absence of HPA. ¬©2008 American Medical Association.

541,Methods to optimize recruitment and retention to an exercise study in Chinese immigrants.,"BACKGROUND: To counter pervasive disparities in healthcare and guide public health prevention programs, culturally sensitive recruitment and retention strategies for Chinese immigrants participating in health-related research studies are needed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop and implement recruitment and retention strategies with Chinese immigrants in a Tai Chi exercise study. METHODS: After substantial project planning and incorporating community-based research principles, a multidimensional approach was used to ensure minimal loss to follow-up. Recruitment strategies included partnering with a community-based agency, distributing study information using a multimedia approach, communicating in the native language, and demonstrating cultural sensitivity. Retention strategies included establishing a tracking method during recruitment, providing personalized feedback, maintaining the same location for all aspects of the study, eliminating potential linguistic barriers, providing personal attention and encouragement, monitoring attendance, utilizing a charismatic Tai Chi instructor, respecting Chinese culture, providing appropriate incentives, and maintaining good communication. RESULTS: Sixty persons showed interest in the study, 52 persons were screened, and 39 persons were enrolled. Recruitment was completed within 3 weeks. An advertisement in the Chinese newspaper was the most fruitful recruitment source, yielding approximately 60% of the study participants. Retention in the study was also very high (97%, n = 38).

542,Life with communication changes in Parkinson's disease,"Background: acoustic and perceptual changes to speech in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been widely studied. Little empirical evidence exists concerning the individual's own perception of changes, the impact these have on their life and coping strategies to deal with them. Objective: to establish if, and how, changes in communication impact on the lives of people with PD. Design: in-depth interviews with qualitative analysis of content. Setting: community. Subjects: twenty-three men and 14 women with PD. Methods: participants were purposively sampled to give a mix of men, women, family circumstances, stage and duration of PD and severity of speech symptoms. Individuals were interviewed at home. Interviews were transcribed. Emergent themes were identified and fed back to participants for confirmation and clarification. Results: participants identified changes to voice and articulation. Language changes featured prominently. Four impact themes: (i) interaction with others, (ii) problems with conversations, (iii) feelings about intelligibility and (iv) voice; and four corresponding coping themes (a) helping others understand, (b) managing conversations, (c) monitoring and adjusting and (d) physical strategies emerged. Of main concern was not the nature of speech-voice-language changes, but how these affected self-concept, participation inside and outside the family and family dynamics. Individuals employed a range of fluid coping strategies moving from background withdrawal to foreground striving strategies. Conclusions: speech and language changes in PD impact upon individual and family life long before frank impairment of intelligibility is apparent.

Data were collected primarily through interviews and questionnaires. The results indicate that the integration process proceeded more slowly than originally intended. There were still unresolved matters on the structural/organizational level, and the sports federations' officials were uncertain about the extent of their responsibility and the role of the new sports organization for persons with a disability. More relevant competence was needed in the organization. All organizations reported improved attitudes toward individuals with a disability and indicated that integration was a demanding enterprise. ¬© 2006 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Sports for Persons with Disabilities;Disabled Persons;Sports;Humans;Humanism;Humanities;strategic planning;sporting event;sport;questionnaire;organizational structure;Norway;law;interview;integration;human experiment;human;financial management;experience;devices;disability;controlled study;competence;attitude to disability;article,"M., S√∏rensen and N., Kahrs",2006.0,0,538
544,Psychiatric and neuropsychological issues in sport medicine,"Mental health issues may be a significant aspect of patient presentation in the sports medicine clinic, complicating the management of medical issues and independently creating prominent patient care concerns. Depression/mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, adjustments to injury, eating disorders, and impulse control disorders may be subtle or obvious, but require good general clinical skills and awareness to assess the complex interplay among personality, medical, and environmental factors. Although it is thought that the frequency of such psychiatric issues in athletes generally parallels the incidence and prevalence of psychiatric issues in the general population, there has been little empirical study of just how prominent these issues are, or how to most effectively treat them in athletes of any age or ability. Stigma and the lack of education may obfuscate discussion and identification of mental health problems, and may impede referrals to appropriate psychological or psychiatric specialists for treatment. In addition, discussion of confidentiality, any limits of confidentiality, and the safeguard of this trust is essential to optimizing collaborative and integrated care. The authors' hope is that further investigation of how sports medicine clinics assess and manage these issues will permit a more systematic evaluation of various treatment approaches to better care for and protect the mental health, and overall health, of athletes. To facilitate this goal, collaboration of sports medicine professionals with psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals can improve communication, debunk the myths associated with mental health care, and ensure specialized care within this important area of functioning. In designing this collaboration, sports medicine physicians or athletic trainers often have the closest rapport with athletes, and the vote of confidence given to mental health consultants is critical to establish hope and trust in athletes regarding the potential benefits of such treatment. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

545,Factors relating to regular education teacher burnout in inclusive education,"The aims of the research were to identify the environmental factors that relate to the work of regular school teachers who have students with special needs in their classroom, and to find out the correlation between these factors and teacher burnout. A total 330 primary school teachers filled in a questionnaire that had three parts: (1) personal background data; (2) the Friedman's burnout questionnaire, and (3) environmental features typical of the work of school teachers that include students with special needs in their classroom, in four areas: psychological features, organizational, structural and social. Results show that the background data that related significantly to burnout was teachers' attitudes towards inclusion. The more positive the attitude was, the more the teacher experienced burnout in the category of self-fulfilment. This finding was contrary to the hypothesis of the research. Two other background variables were found to relate to the de-personalization aspect of burnout, teaching higher-grade students and having an additional administrative role in school. Two other findings that were found to correlate with higher burnout rates were the number of students with special needs in class (more than 20%) and very little assistance provided to the teacher. Three environmental factors were found to have negative correlation with burnout: the organizational factor, the psychological and the social, with the latter being the most significantly negatively correlated with burnout - i.e. the less social support the teacher experienced, the higher was her level of burnout. ¬© 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Questionnaires;workload;work environment;work capacity;teaching;teacher;statistical significance;social support;social aspect;scoring system;rating scale;questionnaire;psychological aspect;productivity;priority journal;primary school;mental stress;major clinical study;learning disorder;job satisfaction;job performance;hypothesis;human;environmental factor;depth perception;correlation function;burnout;article;adult,"R., Talmor and S., Reiter and N., Feigin",2005.0,0,540
546,Elementary school children's willingness to help and be friends with their disabled peers,"The school inclusion of children with disability can create negative reactions in classmates unless educators and teachers implement specific intervention aimed at enhancing the disabled child's social integration. Identifying what factors can facilitate or impede inclusion therefore represents an essential first step toward developing effective programs. The present study interviewed 160 children, aged 6 through 11 years, who were asked to respond to two questions concerning their willingness to be friends with and to help a child with physical or intellectual disability. One-half of the participants then received additional information about the classmate's needs. It was thought that this information would heighten the participants' perceptions of a greater risk of involvement with the disabled peer. A repeated-measures MANOVA was run, with the dependent variables of friendship, helping, and type of ability and with the independent variables of risk/no-risk condition and participant age. The results clearly showed that children were more willing to help than be friends with a disabled classmate and felt more well-inclined toward their peers with physical disability, vs. intellectual disability. These effects interacted with the children's age and their perception of risk of involvement in the relationship.

547,The relationship between school environment and participation for students with disabilities,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between participation in school activities of students with disabilities and their school environment. Children and youths with disabilities rated their own participation in school activities while teachers and special education counsellors rated the student's school environment. Statistical methods used in this study were the Pearson's correlation coefficient and one-way-ANOVA. The results revealed that neither the amount of support given nor the general school environment was statistically related to students' participation. Further, the individual's specific environment, especially when rated as availability to activities by the students themselves, was related to students' participation. This might indicate that when investigating important environmental factors related to participation, students' own perceptions of his/her niches is important to investigate. The support students were given related more to type and number of disabilities than to students' participation. ¬© 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",statistical analysis;special education;social support;school;priority journal;physical disability;physical activity;perception;patient education;male;major clinical study;human;female;family counseling;environmental factor;daily life activity;childhood disease;child care;child;article;academic achievement,"L., Eriksson",2005.0,0,542
548,Development and evaluation of an integrated musculoskeletal disease course for medical students,"Background: A recent survey of medical and surgical residents in the United States suggested that our current training of physicians may be inadequate to meet the increasing demand for diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. In response, we developed an integrated, multidisciplinary course to teach knowledge and skills related to musculoskeletal disease to second-year medical students. A three-year prospective outcomes study was conducted to evaluate the new course. Methods: The primary outcomes that were studied during the first year of the new course were the gains in knowledge, changes in levels of confidence, and long-term retention of skills. Secondary outcomes consisted of student and faculty satisfaction. Ten-item pre-tests and post-tests covering core course concepts were administered to students. A matched-pairs t test was used to evaluate the difference between pre-test and post-test scores. Students were also asked to rate, on a 10-point scale, how much confidence they had in their ability to perform the musculoskeletal physical examination before and after the institution of the new curriculum. A general linear model analysis with post hoc pairwise comparisons (F test) was used to evaluate the changes in the confidence levels of the students. Also, a knee examination station was organized to compare students' scores before and after revision of the course. At the conclusion of the course, students rated each aspect of it on a scale of 1 to 5. Instructors were asked to rate the effectiveness of all elements of the course on the same scale. Results: On the basis of student satisfaction and confidence and faculty satisfaction, the most effective changes in the curriculum were the introduction of a physical examination workshop and simulated clinical situations. Students' knowledge increased significantly (p < 0.001), and their level of confidence increased significantly in thirteen specifically targeted areas (p < 0.0001). On the end-of-the-year examination assessing retention of physical examination skills, the scores for the skills emphasized in the revised course increased significantly whereas the scores for a skill not emphasized in the course remained the same. Revisions made in the second and third years after implementation of the course expanded the more successful elements and further improved student ratings. Conclusions: Integration of the three clinical disciplines related to musculoskeletal disease-orthopaedics, rheumatology, and physical medicine and rehabilitation-resulted in a highly effective introductory course for second-year medical students. The heuristic strategy of introducing core content through lectures and workshops followed by small-group teaching sessions for practice with the new knowledge effectively increased students' knowledge, confidence, and satisfaction.","Curriculum;Nonlinear Dynamics;Physical Examination;Students, Medical;Musculoskeletal Diseases;United States;training;skill;scoring system;resident;prospective study;priority journal;physician;physical examination;patient satisfaction;musculoskeletal disease;medical student;medical education;human;health survey;curriculum;article","K., Saleh and R., Messner and S., Axtell and I., Harris and M.L., Mahowald",2004.0,0,543
549,School Refusal in Children and Adolescents,"School refusal is a problem that is stressful for children, families, and school personnel. Failing to attend school has significant short- and long-term effects on children's social, emotional, and educational development. School refusal often is associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. It is important to identify problems early and provide appropriate interventions to prevent further difficulties. Assessment and management of school refusal require a collaborative approach that includes the family physician, school staff, parents, and a mental health professional. Because children often present with physical symptoms, evaluation by a physician is important to rule out any underlying medical problems. Treatments include educational-support therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, parent-teacher interventions, and pharmacotherapy. Family physicians may provide psychoeducational support for the child and parents, monitor medications, and help with referral to more intensive psychotherapy.

550,Valuing diversity: Helping medical students explore their attitudes and beliefs,"The General Medical Council of the United Kingdom has defined a set of standards for doctors dealing with patients, including respecting the diversity of lifestyles and beliefs of patients. These have been incorporated into the Personal and Professional Development (PPD) course unit of the undergraduate medical curriculum at Leeds University. The objectives of PPD include helping students understand how age, gender, culture, sexuality and disability affect how events are experienced or perceived. In 2002 seminars were run on valuing diversity to encourage students to develop insight into and reflect on their own attitudes to diversity. The sessions were evaluated and assessed by means of student feedback and as part of a written PPD exercise. Students rated the sessions highly and appeared to learn a great deal about diversity including approaches to communication and breaking down stereotypes.

551,"Self-management interventions for people with chronic conditions in primary care: Examples from arthritis, asthma and diabetes","The increasing prevalence of chronic conditions has implications for health care provision, particularly primary care which acts as the gatekeeper to other services and provides long-term support for patients with enduring needs. One means of coping with this increasing patient demand centres on enhancing the ability of patients to successfully self-manage the day-to-day realities of their condition in partnership with health care professionals. Hence, it is not surprising that the provision of self-management style programmes has seen a rapid growth in the past five years, primarily in relation to hospital-based programmes led by health professionals. There are exceptions such as the community-based self-management interventions that are organised and delivered by voluntary organisations using peer educators. The value of increasing self-management provision through primary care is discussed in relation to three conditions that form a large part of the primary care caseload: arthritis, asthma, and diabetes. The typical management tasks associated with each condition are considered in terms of differences and commonalities. The implications of such similarities and differences for implementation of self-management on a much wider scale in primary care are discussed.",Arthritis;Primary Health Care;Asthma;self care;priority journal;primary health care;physical disability;patient monitoring;patient compliance;patient attitude;osteoarthritis;major clinical study;human;health education;health behavior;general practice;diabetes mellitus;diabetes control;controlled study;chronic disease;asthma;article;arthritis,"J.H., Barlow and J., Sturt and H., Hearnshaw",2002.0,0,546
552,Secondary sexual characteristics in children with cerebral palsy and moderate to severe motor impairment: A cross-sectional survey,"Objectives. To compare the development of secondary sexual characteristics in children with cerebral palsy (CP) of moderate to severe motor impairment to children in the general population and to relate their sexual maturation to a measure of their body fat. Methods. A multicenter, cross-sectional survey of 207 children who were 3 to 18 years of age and had CP of moderate to severe motor impairment (Gross Motor Functional Classification System [GMFCS] levels 3, 4, and 5) was conducted at 6 geographic sites; attempts were made to identify all eligible children through multiple methods and enroll them in the study. Trained research assistants performed anthropometric measurements, including subscapular skinfold thickness, determined GMFCS level, and assessed sexual maturation by Tanner stage. Secondary sexual characteristics were compared with the general population of children using cross-sectional surveys of the American Academy of Pediatrics Pediatric Research in Office Settings network and of the National Center for Health Statistics National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III. Girls were classified as having begun puberty when they were at Tanner stage 2 or greater for pubic hair and breast development and to have completed puberty when they were at Tanner stage 4 or greater for pubic hair and breast development. Boys were classified as having begun puberty when they were at Tanner stage 2 or greater for pubic hair and genital development and to have completed puberty when they were at Tanner stage 4 or greater for pubic hair and genital development. Results. The mean age (standard deviation) of subjects was 9.6 (4.6) years. Of the 207 subjects, 71% were white, 21% were black, and 8% were of other races; 59% were boys, and 41% were girls. Girls with CP (n = 84) 0entered puberty earlier than did boys with CP (n = 123). In contrast, girls with CP tended to complete puberty later than did boys with CP. Black boys and girls with CP (n = 43) entered puberty earlier than did white boys and girls with CP (n = 147). No difference between races was found in completion of puberty. Only for white children with CP were there a sufficient number of subjects for comparisons of sexual maturation to race-matched children in the general population, using data from the American Academy of Pediatrics Pediatric Research in Office Settings network and the NHANES III study. White girls with CP initiated pubic hair development (Tanner stage 2 or greater) earlier than in the general population, but the age of onset of breast development was similar to the general population, although the age distribution was different. A greater proportion of white girls with CP had early onset of breast development (Tanner stage 2 or greater), and a greater proportion had delayed onset of breast development than in the general population. White girls with CP completed breast development later than in the general population but not pubic hair development. For white boys ages 8 to 18 years with CP (n = 75), pubic hair and genital development both began earlier than in the general population, but genital development was completed later. The estimated median age of menarche for white girls with CP was 14.0 years, which was 1.3 years later (95% confidence interval:0.7-2.3) than for the general population (estimated median age: 12.8 years; NHANES III). Relationships between sexual maturation and nutritional state, as assessed by subscapular skinfold thickness z score, were determined separately in white boys and in white girls with CP, between the ages of 8 and 18 years. For white girls with CP, more advanced sexual maturation was associated with more body fat, adjusting for age and GMFCS level (Spearman partial correlation: 0.41). In contrast, for white boys with CP, the opposite relationship pertained: more advanced sexual maturation was associated with less body fat (-0.29). Conclusions. The pattern of sexual maturation in children with CP of moderate to severe motor impairment differs from that of children in the general population. Puberty begins earlier but ends later in white children with CP, compared with white children in the general population. In addition, menarche occurs later in white girls with CP.

553,Adolescent sexuality and disability,"Regardless of what our beliefs about sex and disability may be, as health care providers we can promote the health and well being of our patients with disabilities in several ways. First and perhaps foremost, physical and programmatic barriers to accessing general health care including routine gynecologic care must be dramatically reduced. The promise of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act must be aggressively extended to our health care system to ensure equal access to routine health care for all. Second, knowledge of community resources that can support the healthy development and exercise of responsible and satisfying sexuality is critical. For example, health care providers should know about adaptive and assistive technologies as well as the use of personal care assistants to support the healthy although sometimes nontypical expression of one's sexuality. Centers for Independent Living are community resources that are often underutilized by the medical profession. These centers - run by and for people with disabilities - are likely resources and allies for providing education, role models, and peer mentoring around relationships, intimacy, sexuality, sexual expression, and parenting with a disability. Finally, sex education is a must and should include the following: ‚Ä¢ Basic facts of life, reproduction, and sexual intercourse; ‚Ä¢ Human growth and development ‚Ä¢ Human reproduction and anatomy ‚Ä¢ Self-pleasuring/masturbation and the use of sexual aids ‚Ä¢ Intimacy and privacy ‚Ä¢ Pregnancy and child birth ‚Ä¢ Contraception and abortion ‚Ä¢ Family life and parenthood ‚Ä¢ Sexual response and consensual sex ‚Ä¢ Sexual orientation ‚Ä¢ Sexual abuse ‚Ä¢ HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases The question should not be whether sex education is provided to persons with disabilities, but rather how it is most effectively provided. Healthy sex education must include the development of effective communication skills, decision-making skills, assertiveness, and the ability to say ""no."" It must also include ways to create satisfying relationships.",Disabled Persons;Sexual Behavior;Health Promotion;Adolescent;Humanism;Humanities;Humans;wellbeing;sexuality;sexual education;sexual behavior;review;priority journal;human;health promotion;health care;disability,"J.A., Neufeld and F., Klingbeil and D.N., Bryen and B., Silverman and A., Thomas",2002.0,0,548
554,Physiotherapists' role in integration of children with cerebral palsy into mainstream schools,"Background. As society and parents of children with disabilities become more aware of their right to and the benefits of inclusive education, pressure to provide such a service is increasing. This research explores the role of physiotherapists, as seen by themselves and teachers, in aiding the successful integration of children with cerebral palsy into mainstream schools. It investigates problems experienced, the perceived adequacy of service provision and impediments to its implementation. Methods. Two questionnaires were formulated to investigate the perspectives of 21 physiotherapists and 48 teachers working with children with cerebral palsy in mainstream primary schools. Results. Questionnaires were returned by 17 physiotherapists and 32 teachers. Seventy-six per cent of physiotherapists (n = 13) and 78% of teachers (n = 25) considered that physiotherapists can significantly aid the integration of children with cerebral palsy. Roles identified by the physiotherapists and confirmed by the teachers' results include the children's physical preparation (n = 16), providing information to teachers (n = 16) and teaching handling skills (n = 14). Lack of training (n = 31 ), knowledge (n = 26) and difficulties posed by physical education (n = 27) were problems for teachers. Eighty-eight per cent of physiotherapists (n = 15) thought that service provision was inadequate. Conclusion. Physiotherapists are key figures in promoting successful integration of children with cerebral palsy. To address the needs of service provision, this study advocates an expansion of community physiotherapists' role with an essential increase in hours and staffing levels. Convening of case conferences to discuss problems and progress was suggested by four physiotherapists surveyed. Physiotherapists are crucial in training teachers for managing children with disabilities.

555,The aims of special education schools and units in Kenya: A survey of headteachers,"The paper reports a questionnaire survey of headteachers of special schools and special units in Kenya, focusing in particular on their educational aims. The study is located in the broader context of special educational provision and developments in Africa. These include the colonial legacy, the influence of indigenous and traditional concepts of education and disability, and national policies engaging with issues of curriculum and inclusion. The aims the headteachers said were important were wide-ranging and included conventional academic achievement, personal and social development and citizenship, alongside skills of personal care and the control of difficult behaviour. However, the relative emphasis given to different aims suggests that the importance of traditional aims of special education in terms of control, containment and care still outweigh those of a broad and balanced educational provision. Surprisingly, there was relatively little emphasis on the importance of preparation for employment. The analysis suggests that although there have been rapid developments in the provision for special educational needs in Kenya, there remains a gap between the ambitions of national policy and actual provision at school level.",visual impairment;teacher;social evolution;self care;school;questionnaire;priority journal;policy;physical disability;mental deficiency;male;Kenya;human;hearing impairment;female;employment;education program;curriculum;concept formation;article;Africa;academic achievement,"J., Muuya",2002.0,0,550
556,Teachers' attitudes towards integration/inclusion: A review of the literature,"On the assumption that the successful implementation of any inclusive policy is largely dependent on educators being positive about it, a great deal of research has sought to examine teachers' attitudes towards the integration and, more recently, the inclusion of children with special educational needs in the mainstream school. This paper reviews this large body of research and, in so doing, explores a host of factors that might impact upon teacher acceptance of the inclusion principle. The analyses showed evidence of positive attitudes, but no evidence of acceptance of a total inclusion or 'zero reject' approach to special educational provision. Teachers' attitudes were found to be strongly influenced by the nature and severity of the disabling condition presented to them (child-related variables) and less by teacher-related variables. Further, educational environment-related variables, such as the availability of physical and human support, were consistently found to be associated with attitudes to inclusion. After a brief discussion of critical methodological issues germane to the research findings, the paper provides directions for future research based on alternative methodologies.",Only Child;Attitude;Humans;Humanism;Humanities;teacher;social support;social behavior;school;review;priority journal;politics;methodology;medical research;human;experience;environmental factor;education;disease severity;disability;child behavior;attitude,"E., Avramidis and B., Norwich",2002.0,0,551
557,Educational issues in rheumatology,"Musculoskeletal conditions are the most common cause of severe long-term pain and physical disability, affecting hundreds of millions of people around the world. Nearly a quarter of all consultations in primary care are concerned with rheumatic disease, yet undergraduate education in rheumatology is under-developed all over the world and does not get the attention it deserves. This has important consequences for the early diagnosis of rheumatic disease and the proper care of rheumatic patients in general, as well as for the esteem of rheumatology as a profession. Because the high prevalence and impact of rheumatic disease are not reflected in medical curricula, the International League of Associations for Rheumatology developed the Undergraduate Medical Education in Rheumatology 2000 Project. The project embodies three fundamental concepts: (1) to convince medical faculties and schools educating health professionals world wide that skills in examination, a knowledge of the management of musculoskeletal disease and a positive attitude to disability are the basis of good medical practice; (2) that rheumatology is valuable for acquiring skills in problem-solving, clinical reasoning and understanding basic genetic, immunological and biochemical mechanisms, as illustrated by rheumatic disease; and (3) to orient these programmes to the needs of individual patients in the context of the population at large, knowing that 20% of all primary care consultations involve musculoskeletal disease. The movement of doctors throughout the world, especially within Europe, is leading to initiatives to harmonize standards of specialist training. The importance of ensuring the highest standard of clinical care, achieving the greatest gain in health alongside a rapid advance in knowledge and clinical practice, is increasing the priority for continuing medical education and methods to ensure that doctors remain competent at all stages of their career.","Education, Medical;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Disabled Persons;Rheumatic Diseases;training;teaching;teacher;rheumatology;review;professional standard;priority journal;medical specialist;medical education;learning;human;evaluation study;curriculum;continuing education;clinical practice;attitude","J., Dequeker and J.J., Rasker and A.D., Woolf",2000.0,0,552
558,The safety practices of sporting clubs/centres in the City of Hume,"Sports injuries are a significant public health problem in Australia. However, little information is available about community level sports injuries, or about the sports safety policies and practices of community level sports organisations in Australia. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a survey of local clubs and sporting centres in the City of Hume, a local council in Victoria. This is the first reported survey of safety practices of sporting clubs/centres at the community level in Australia. Sixty-four clubs/centres participated in the survey, which involved face-to-face interviews with representatives from the participating clubs/centres. A major finding was that whilst sports bodies perform certain activities typically associated with preventing sports injuries, they often do not have formal policies or written objectives which recognise the safety of their participants as an important goal. The sports safety measures reported to be adopted by the surveyed clubs/centres included use of protective equipment, accredited coaches, sports trainers, encouraging warm- ups, modified rules for juniors and checking of playing areas and facilities for environmental hazards. The provision of first aid services (including personnel and equipment) varied across the sporting clubs/centres. The major barriers towards improving sports safety were reported to be a lack of funds, the media's attitude towards sports injuries and the role of the local council as the owner of sporting facilities. There is also a clear role for researchers to improve the dissemination of key findings from their injury prevention research in a form that can be readily used at the grass roots of sports participation.",Victoria;Sports;Athletic Injuries;sport injury;recognition;quality of life;health survey;health promotion;health hazard;health care policy;disability;Australia;article,"C.F., Finch and M., Hennessy",2000.0,0,553
559,"Long-term physical, psychological, and social functioning of children with esophageal atresia","Background/Purpose: Little is known about the long-term psychosocial functioning of children with esophageal atresia (EA). The physical, psychological, and social functioning of children with EA was studied using standardized assessment procedures, and relations between medical and social background variables and outcome were investigated. Methods: Subjects were 36 children (20 boys, 16 girls; mean age 10.2 years) with EA. Fourteen children had minor and 11 children had major associated congenital anomalies. According to the 'Montreal' classification, eight children with major congenital anomalies who also had been dependent on artificial ventilation as newborns fell into the high-risk class. The children were subjected to an intelligence test. Parents completed standardized questionnaires concerning emotional and behavioral problems, psychosocial stress, and family functioning; children completed questionnaires concerning depression and self-esteem; and teachers completed questionnaires concerning emotional and behavioral problems. Results were compared with normative data from the general population, and correlations between background and outcome variables were computed. Results: According to Desjardins' classification, 16 children had excellent, nine children had good, and four children had fair outcome. The mean intelligence quotient (IQ) of the children was 90.2, which is almost 10 points lower than the standardized norm of 100 (P < .01). High-risk children (n = 7) had a significantly lower IQ (mean IQ, 79.4; P < .05). Five times as many children (n = 8; 22%) as in the general population (4%) required special education (P < .001). More than twice as many children (30% to 35%) as in the general population (15%) showed elevated rates of emotional and behavioral problems as reported by parents and teachers (P < .02). The children did not report more negative self-esteem or more depressive symptoms than children in the general population. Children with a lower IQ reported lower scholastic competence (r = .38, P < .05) and showed more emotional and behavioral problems as reported by teachers (r = -.43, P < .05). Family functioning and levels of psychosocial stress were the same as in the general population. Children in worse functioning families showed more emotional and behavioral problems as reported by parents (r = .37, P < .05) and higher depression scores as reported by themselves (r = .47, P < .01). Conclusions: In a follow-up study using standardized assessment procedures, it was shown that children with EA have more learning, emotional, and behavioral problems than children in the general population. A high-risk group of children with major associated congenital anomalies who had been ventilated as a newborn, were at special risk for cognitive problems.","Emotions;Child;Ventilators, Mechanical;Only Child;Infant, Newborn;social psychology;self esteem;school child;priority journal;mental stress;male;intelligence quotient;human;follow up;female;esophagus atresia;emotional stress;depression;congenital malformation;cognitive defect;clinical article;behavior disorder;artificial ventilation;article","N.H., Bouman and H.M., Koot and F.W.J., Hazebroek",1999.0,0,554
560,Psychological outcome in children treated for brain tumor,"The cognitive and psychosocial functions of 16 children with brain tumor, treated with whole-brain or local radiotherapy, were studied. Fifteen nonirradiated children with acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) served as a comparison group. Mean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised Full Scale IQ score and mean Visual-Motor Integration Test (Beery VMI) standard score were significantly decreased in the brain tumor group. The Achenbach checklists were filled in by mothers (Child Behavior Checklist, CBCL) and teachers (Teacher's Report Form). Overall adjustment was rated lower in the children with brain tumor. Although most of the children in the ALL group were well adapted, one third of them had low CBCL Social Competence scores relative to nonclinical norms. On a visual analog scale a significantly decreased tempo was assessed by mothers and teachers in the children with brain tumor, and low speed and hypoactivity seemed to limit the majority of these children in school and daily life activities.",Brain;Child;Only Child;Brain Neoplasms;sociology;social adaptation;psychomotor disorder;psychological aspect;neuropsychological test;male;human;female;controlled study;cognitive defect;clinical article;childhood cancer;child;brain tumor;article;adolescent,"A., Fossen and T.G., Abrahamsen and I., Storm-Mathisen",1998.0,0,555
561,Intervention approaches and children with developmental coordination disorder,"Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have a marked impairment in the performance of functional motor skills required to succeed at school. Longitudinal studies show that without intervention children: with DCD often do not improve with development and the poor motor behaviour appears to have a detrimental effect on other aspects of functioning such as school achievement, behaviour and self esteem. Outside of clinical situations, there are only a small number of controlled empirical investigations, and from this small number two types of approaches emerge. The first concentrates on processes underlying motor skills and purports to improve areas such as kinesthesis or sensory motor processes. The second concentrates on teaching functional tasks aiming to specifically intervene in the deficient areas. Evaluations of these approaches show that they both work, producing significant improvements over Control groups but show no differences between other approaches. It is hypothesized that more general learning principles are producing the effect, such as accurate assessment and tailoring activities to meet the needs of any individual child. Further, it is suggested that work with non-specialists in the motor area, such as teachers and parents, is a way forward with all but the most severely affected children.",Child;Motor Skills;Longitudinal Studies;Only Child;Motor Skills Disorders;task performance;sensorimotor function;review;priority journal;motor control;learning disorder;human;disability;developmental disorder;childhood disease;child;autism,"D.A., Sugden and M.E., Chambers",1998.0,0,556
562,Adolescent medicine training in pediatric residency programs: Are we doing a good job?,"Objectives. To determine how pediatric residency programs are responding to the new challenges of teaching adolescent medicine (AM) to residents by assessing whether manpower is adequate for training, whether AM curricula and skills are adequately covered by training programs, what types of teaching methodologies are used to train residents in AM, and the needs for new curricular materials to teach AM. Design. A 3-part 92-item survey mailed to all US pediatric residency training programs. Setting. Pediatric residency programs. Participants. Residency program directors and directors of AM training. Main Outcome Measures. AM divisional structure, clinical sites of training, presence of a block rotation, and faculty of pediatric training programs; training materials used and desired in AM; perceived adequacy of coverage of various AM topics; competency of residents in performing pelvic examinations in sexually active teens; and manpower needs. Results. A total of 155/211 (73.5%) of programs completed the program director and the AM parts of the survey. Ninety-six percent of programs (size range, 5-120 residents) had an AM block rotation and 90% required the AM block; those without a block rotation were more likely to be larger programs. Only 39% of programs felt that the number of AM faculty was adequate for teaching residents. Almost half of the programs reported lack of time, faculty, and curricula to teach content in substance abuse. Besides physicians, AM teachers included nurse practitioners (28%), psychologists (25%), and social workers (19%). Topics most often cited as adequately covered included sexually transmitted diseases (81.9%), confidentiality (79.4%), puberty (77.0%), contraception (76.1%), and menstrual problems (73.5%). Topics least often cited as adequately covered included psychological testing (16.1%), violence in relationships (20.0%), violence and weapon-carrying (29.7%), and sports medicine (29.7%). Fifty-eight percent of 137 respondents thought that all or nearly all of their residents were competent in performing pelvic examinations by the end of training; there was no difference between perceived competence and the residents' use of procedure books. Seventy-four percent used a specific curriculum for teaching AM; materials included chapters/articles (85%), lecture outlines (76.1%), slides (41.9%), videos (35.5%), written case studies (24.5%), computerized cases (6.5%), and CD- ROMs (3.2%). Fifty-two percent used Bright Futures, 48% used the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services, and 14% used the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services for teaching clinical preventive services. Programs that used Bright Futures were more likely to feel that preventive services were adequately covered in their programs than those who did not (78% vs 57%). A majority of programs desired more learner-centered materials. Conclusions. Although almost all pediatric programs are now providing AM rotations, there is significant variability in adequacy of training across multiple topics important for resident education. Programs desire more learner-centered materials and more faculty to provide comprehensive resident education in AM.",Sexual Behavior;Teaching Materials;Psychological Tests;Internship and Residency;Adolescent;violence;sports medicine;sexually transmitted disease;residency education;puberty;priority journal;pediatrics;menstruation disorder;medical education;contraception;confidentiality;clinical education;child health care;article,"S.J., Emans and T., Bravender and J., Knight and C., Frazer and M., Luoni and C., Berkowitz and E., Armstrong and E., Goodman",1998.0,0,557
563,Epilepsy patients: Health status and medical consumption,"Objective: To study the health status and medical consumption of outpatients with active epilepsy in comparison with the general population. Design: Descriptive population study (multi-stage random sample). Setting: Structured questionnaire. Patients: Thirty-nine epilepsy patients compared with a general population of 12,975. Results: Epilepsy patients revealed poorer health, a higher mean complaint score (5.3 versus 3.7, P < 0.05), a higher score on the General Health Questionnaire (P < 0.05), a somewhat higher score on the biological problem list (BIOPRO) (1.8 versus 1.4, P > 0.05), less active sports engagement (16% versus 39%, P < 0.01), more fatigue (46 vs 29%, P < 0.05), dizziness (33 vs 10%, P < 0.01), nervousness (28 vs 18%, P > 0.05), sleep disturbance (23 vs 15%, P > 0.05) and excitability (33 vs 15%, P < 0.01) when compared with the general population. The BIOPRO showed problems in epilepsy patients on specific items related to self-confidence (P < 0.001). Epileptic patients do not show more absence due to illness, from work, school or at home (15 vs 18%, P > 0.05) and/or more problems at work or in the family when compared with the general population. Almost half of epilepsy patients had consulted a specialist in the past 2 months (46 vs 23% of the general population, P < 0.001). Epilepsy patients consulted the family physician slightly more often than other responders (3.0 versus 2.3, P > 0.05) and contacted the family physician's assistant considerably more often (2.3 versus 0.7, P < 0.001). One-third of epilepsy patients consulted an alternative healer in the past 5 years versus 14% in the general population (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The study shows an excess of psychosocial problems and medical consumption in epilepsy patients, but not more absence from work or problems at work or in the family.

Through a survey of special education teachers, effects on students' socialization, behavior, attitudes, attendance, academic skills, functional skills, and relationships with non-disabled peers are explored. Promising results are found for adolescents with mild disabilities in attendance and academic skills, and for adolescents with moderate to profound disabilities in socialization and relationships with non-disabled peers.

565,Eating disorders among adolescent female athletes: influence of athletic participation and sport team membership.,"Female athletes have been identified as a potential risk group for the development of eating disorders. Although adolescents in general are particularly vulnerable to the onset of eating disorders, little research has examined the problem among high school female athletes. The present study explored this population by comparing female athletes and nonathletes in terms of (a) behavioral and psychological traits associated with eating disorders and (b) use of pathogenic weight control techniques (laxatives, vomiting, fasting, and diet aids). Sport-by-sport comparisons were also investigated to determine if athletes in specific sports were more at risk. Moreover, in an attempt to link athletic participation and eating disordered behavior, the gender-role orientation of athletes was examined. Results indicated that (a) athletes were more likely than nonathletes to possess certain behavioral and psychological correlates of eating disorders, (b) there were few differences among the various sport teams, and (c) gender-role orientation was generally not a critical variable. Although group comparisons yielded limited significant differences, athletes nevertheless reported traits associated with eating disorders as well as use of pathogenic weight control techniques. The unique contributions of the sport context and coaching practices exacerbating disordered eating are discussed.",Mental Disorders;Eating;Eating Disorders;Sports;Adolescent;statistics;sport;risk factor;psychometry;psychological aspect;personality test;low calorie diet;human;gender identity;female;eating disorder;bulimia;body image;article;anorexia nervosa;adolescent,"D.E., Taub and E.M., Blinde",1992.0,0,560
566,Validation and use of a mainstreaming attitude inventory with physical educators,"This two-part article concerns: The validation of an attitude measuring inventory, and its use with physical educators in connection with mainstreaming handicapped children at their schools. Directors of physical education (N=66) in New York State served as subjects for the study in which attitude change toward mainstreamed pupils was investigated as a function of inservice training in response to PL 94-142 ('The Education for All Handicapped Children Act'). A reliable and valid revised form of the Learning Handicapped Integration Inventory served as the attitude measurement instrument. Data gathered immediately prior to and after two-day inservice training institutes were analyzed along with data retrieved approximately four months after training. Results indicated a significant positive attitude shift from pre- to post-testing. The authors conclude that one-shot attempts at inservice training can be catalytic in affecting appropriate attitudes toward handicapped pupils; yet, they recommend the application of additional inservice delivery approaches to further enhance training outcomes. The revised attitude inventory is also offered as a future research tool.",Child;Only Child;Pupil;Inservice Training;Disabled Children;Disabled Persons;Physical Education and Training;training;psychological aspect;physical education;normal human;human;handicapped child;education;child;attitude,"P., Jansma",1982.0,0,561

569,Inclusion and Participation in Everyday School Life: Experiences of Children with Physical (Dis)Abilities,"This study explores the school experiences of children with physical (dis)abilities. Based on 39 interviews with 15 Norwegian children, participation in everyday school life is introduced as a central theme and divided into three sub-themes: community and independence; adequate help and influence in the classroom; and influence in planning and decision-making. The findings presented that the children want to participate in school activities the ""regular way"", but on their own terms. Achieving this goal depended on their ability to make the necessary adjustments, as well as adequate support from teachers and school aides. Children reported that they were sometimes given ""too much help"" by school aides and ""too little"" by teachers. They felt that they had some influence over their classroom situation; however, they rarely had occasion to take part in formal school meetings dealing with academic issues and individual assistance, which might have enhanced their inclusion and participation at school. Our findings reflect the significance of incorporating children's own experiences and personal history of (dis)ability into the planning process. We conclude that children with (dis)abilities are willing to make great efforts to participate and be included, primarily so they can be engaged with the other children.","Child;Only Child;Cooperative Planning;Interviews;Social Influences;Paraprofessional School Personnel;Early Adolescents;Physical Disabilities;Helping Relationship;Teacher Student Relationship;Role;Student Experience;Foreign Countries;Student Attitudes;Attitude Measures;Inclusion;Student Participation;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);Norway","Asbj√∏rnslett, Mona and Engelsrud, Gunn Helene and Helseth, S√∏lvi",2015.0,0,563
570,A Comparison of Saudi and Canadian Children's Knowledge of the Causes of Learning Difficulties,"In this comparative study, students from inclusive schools in Canada and Saudi Arabia shared their beliefs about factors associated with learning difficulties. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 36 Canadian and 62 Saudi elementary students in Grades 5 and 6. Thematic analysis uncovered six themes: lack of knowledge, achievement or academic skills; cognitive and social-emotional barriers; lack of attention and/or motivation and behavioural issues; home and parental concerns; teacher-related issues; and physical/sensory disabilities and innate conditions. Although participants from both countries had a general understanding of the factors associated with learning difficulties, Canadian students showed a deeper understanding of cognitive and social-emotional factors associated with learning difficulties. Educational and research implications are discussed.","Cognition;Only Child;Child;Teacher Effectiveness;Qualitative Research;Physical Disabilities;Knowledge Level;Comparative Analysis;Social Problems;Academic Ability;Learning Problems;Comparative Education;Interviews;Familiarity;Cognitive Ability;Academic Achievement;Behavior Problems;Family Environment;Foreign Countries;Emotional Problems;Student Attitudes;Beliefs;Attention Span;Grade 6;Elementary Education;Middle Schools;Intermediate Grades;Grade 5;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);Saudi Arabia;Canada","Felimban, Huda and Nowicki, Elizabeth A. and Dare, Lynn and Brown, Jason",2016.0,0,564
571,The Transition to School of Children with Developmental Disabilities: Views of Parents and Teachers,"The transition from early intervention programs to inclusive school settings presents a range of social challenges for children with developmental disabilities. In Queensland, in the year of transition to school, many children with developmental disabilities attend an Early Childhood Development Program for two to three days each week and also begin attendance in a mainstream program, with the latter increasing to full-time attendance during the year. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected by questionnaires regarding 62 children participating in the ""Transition to School Project."" Their parents and teachers were asked for their perceptions of the success of the transition process and the benefits and challenges of inclusion. Both parents and teachers saw a range of benefits to children from their inclusion in ""regular"" classrooms, with parents noting the helpfulness of teachers and their support for inclusion. Challenges noted by parents included the school's lack of preparation for their child's particular developmental needs, especially in terms of the physical environment, while teachers reported challenges in meeting the needs of these children within the context and resources of the classroom. Parents were more likely than teachers to view the transition as easy. Correlational analyses indicated that teachers were more likely to view the transition as easy when they felt the child was appropriately placed in a ""regular"" classroom. Findings from this project can inform the development of effective transition-to-school programs in the early school years for children with developmental disabilities.

572,Moving to Inclusion: A Socio-Cultural Analysis of Practice,"Difference, like nature, calls forth possibilities for developing transformative relationships. According to Keller in 1985, ""Difference thus invites a form of engagement and understanding that allows for the preservation of the individual. Self and other survive in a structural integrity?"" Moving towards inclusion requires that we consider teaching as relational where resources for joint actions emerge, promoting an awareness of possibility rather than an adherence to limitation. In this paper, I will argue that disability is a way of seeing the world via the social and cultural constructions that prioritise values and bias actions. My intent is that it furthers the on-going inclusion debate, which at times has polarised positions into the non-inclusion/inclusion camps. A social constructionist lens will be used to examine the underlying assumptions, beliefs, and resultant practices that describe how educators and students negotiate inclusive practices. As a complimentary focus, the medical and social models will highlight the discourses that inform teaching and learning. Finally, a social-relational model will be introduced as an alternative for conceptualising inclusion.","Integrity;Early Childhood Education;Teaching Methods;Models;Theories;Inclusive Schools;Learning Processes;Social Development;Physical Education;Disabilities;Constructivism (Learning);Grade 8;Grade 3;Elementary Secondary Education;Elementary Education;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)","Grenier, Michelle",2010.0,0,566
573,The Golden Rule of Providing Support in Inclusive Classrooms: Support Others as You Would Wish to Be Supported,"Inclusion is a way of thinking--a deeply held belief that all children, regardless of ability or disability, are valued members of the school and classroom community. Inclusive classrooms are places where all students ""are integral members of classrooms, feel a connection to their peers, have access to rigorous and meaningful general education curricula and receive the collaborative support to succeed."" Because 54% of the 6 million students with disabilities spend more than 80% of their school day in general education classrooms, a common support strategy is one-on-one support. The current ratio is 1 special education paraprofessional for every 17 students with disabilities. But as schools integrate more services into the classroom, adult support will also involve a special educator, a speech and language clinician, an occupational therapist, and physical therapists or a school psychologist. In this article, the term ""adult support"" refers to any professional who supports a student with a disability in an inclusive classroom. The author states that adult help can be seamless and effective--and thereby fully support the purposes of inclusion. The golden rule for adult support in inclusive classrooms is to support others as one would wish to be supported. Adequately applying the golden rule requires knowledge and imagination. Educators need to know the effect of their actions on students. The author also discusses the need for fading support, as reflected in the literature.

575,"An Evaluation on Mainstreaming Practices of Primary Schools According to the Views of School Administrators, Teachers, and Parents","Individuals are born with various skills and needs. They enter into a life-long process of meeting these needs and developing the correct usage and appropriateness of these skills. The process of making intentional changes in one's life through behavior is called education. No one can be deprived of their right to education. Education is every individual's constitutional right and it is compulsory. This is stated in the 59th amendment of the Northern Cyprus Constitution as follows: ""Every child regardless of gender must receive education until the age of fifteen and they have the right to free education until the age of eighteen."" This study investigates through comparison the views of administrators, teachers, and parents on the application of mainstreaming in primary schools. This research uses the qualitative research method. In order to consult the opinions of the participants on mainstreaming applications, a semi-structured interview form was prepared. The data collected from the research was analyzed using the content analysis method. The data from the content analysis was analyzed in four stages. These stages are coding the data, finding the themes, arranging the data according to the codes and themes, and interpreting the data. For the study group, 10 administrators, 14 teachers, and 12 parents were included in the research. This study found that the requirements for mainstreaming are not sufficient nor is there enough information, that normal class teachers are insufficient in their knowledge, that families cannot accept their child's situation, that there is little participation in class, that classes are disorderly, and that there is also a problem with ""normal"" children in their approach to children with special needs. As a result of the study, the majority of participants agreed that special education teachers should either work on their own or in collaboration with class teachers during the preparation stage of mainstreaming. Almost a quarter of the participants stated that preparations for mainstreaming are done by the class teacher. More than 75% of the participants stated that support services are provided for mainstreaming applications, while less than 75% of them said partial support is provided.","Mainstreaming (Education);Only Child;Qualitative Research;Regular and Special Education Relationship;Physical Disabilities;Pervasive Developmental Disorders;Elementary Schools;Content Analysis;Autism;Mild Intellectual Disability;Special Education;Learning Disabilities;Mainstreaming;Foreign Countries;Semi Structured Interviews;Hearing Impairments;Teacher Attitudes;Administrator Attitudes;Parent Attitudes;Elementary Education;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);Cyprus","Dagli, G√∂kmen and √ñznacar, Beh√ßet",2015.0,0,568
576,Early Childhood Teachers' Ideas about Including Children with Disabilities in Programmes Designed for Typically Developing Children,"This study examined the influence of information about children's disabilities on preschool teachers' responses toward integrating children with disabilities in their classroom. Of particular interest was whether the severity of the child's educational needs and information about diagnosis were related to teachers' responses. Data were collected from 155 preschool teachers in two Midwest states in the United States to examine their responses in terms of levels of comfort, classroom adaptation, and need for support. Results showed that teachers responded differently to the types of disability regardless of the diagnostic labels; that is, teachers responded more positively to children with mild disabilities (e.g., children with Down syndrome) and those with physical disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy). In addition, compared with children with diagnostic labels, teachers responded more positively to those with no diagnostic labels. Teachers' education and experience working with children with disabilities were associated with their levels of comfort. Implications and recommendations for service delivery and teacher training are discussed.

579,The Importance of Educating Student Teachers in Inclusive Education: A Disability Perspective,"In schools today inclusion involves a challenge to attitudes and expectations within educational communities. ""The New Zealand Disability Strategy"" (Minister for Disability Issues, 2001), is a guide for government action to promote a more inclusive society. Out of its 15 Objectives, Objective 1 encourages and educates the community and society to understand, respect and support disabled people. Objective 3 looks at providing the best education for disabled people. Objective 5 fosters leadership by disabled people. The summary states that New Zealand will be fully inclusive when it's ""a society that highly values our lives and continually enhances our full participation"". Educators must be committed to ""The New Zealand Disability Strategy"" because its main focus is about a fully inclusive community. Often, through role models, strong messages challenge negative assumptions and prove that there are alternative ways of looking at the world. Generally those who are the most critical to implementing inclusion, such as teachers, are introduced to the notion by individuals for whom it is a theoretical, rather than a lived concept. This article involves a sharing of experiences of two women who are involved in teaching inclusion at tertiary level, who live with physical disabilities and who have proved this to be a powerful combination in changing attitudes.","Disabled Persons;Equal Education;Social Attitudes;Preservice Teacher Education;Females;College Faculty;Physical Disabilities;Profiles;Barriers;Role Models;Federal Legislation;Mainstreaming;Foreign Countries;Disabilities;Civil Rights;Social Values;Public Policy;Inclusion;Student Teachers;Leadership;Higher Education;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);New Zealand","Neilson, Wendy and Brink, Ashlie",2008.0,0,570
580,Including Young People with Disabilities: Assessment Challenges in Higher Education,"Within a European context, facilitating the increased participation of marginalized groups within society has become a cornerstone of social policy. In higher education in Ireland this has generally involved the targeting for support of individuals representing groups traditionally excluded on the grounds of socio-economic status. More recently, people with disability have been included in this consideration. This approach has tended to focus on physical access issues and some technical supports. However, access is multi-faceted and must include a review of pedagogic practices, assistive provision (technological and personal), student's engagement with their workload (e.g. recording) and evaluation procedures: achieving accreditation levels commensurate with ability. This small-scale Irish study examined the experiences of two groups of young people with physical disabilities and with dyslexia in two higher education institutions. It was apparent that for students with physical disabilities and with dyslexia, assessment practices were fraught with additional limitations. Assessment practices were mediated for these students through the physical environment, the backwash effect of assessment on curriculum, the availability and use of assistive technology, and through the attitudes of staff and students. It can be concluded that access issues within higher education have been inadequately conceptualized and as a result failed to address fundamental issues around assessment for students with physical disabilities and with dyslexia.","Disabled Persons;Evaluation Methods;Dyslexia;Physical Disabilities;Assistive Technology;Educational Technology;College Students;Access to Education;Mainstreaming;Inclusive Schools;Foreign Countries;Student Attitudes;Alternative Assessment;Young Adults;Student Evaluation;Teacher Attitudes;Physical Environment;Higher Education;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);Ireland","Hanafin, Joan and Shevlin, Michael and Kenny, Mairin and Mc Neela, Eileen",2007.0,0,571
581,Inclusive Education at the Post-Secondary Level: Attitudes of Students and Professors,"Little research has focused on inclusion of students with disabilities at the university level. We asked students and professors at the University of Lethbridge to indicate their acceptance of three levels of inclusion (included in classes, provided with assistance and provided with professorial accommodation) for students with five categories of disabilities (sensory, language, motor, attention and psychiatric disabilities). Participants' attitudes were rated on a seven point scale. Attitudes were more negative toward students with psychiatric and attention disabilities than those with sensory, language, or motor disabilities. Providing professorial accommodations was also rated as less favourable than inclusion in classes and providing assistance. Attempts must continue to be made to ensure full inclusion at the university level. Increased awareness of professors, students and the general public is required before individuals with disabilities can overcome the barriers preventing them from full acceptance.

582,Survey of Educator Attitude Regarding Inclusive Education within a Southern Arizona School District,"Inclusive Education for students with special educational needs is a global phenomenon, a major event of momentous proportions affecting directly and indirectly a significant percentage of the world's population. In response to international and national mandates requiring its implementation, educators everywhere are engaged in the daily task of providing educational services within inclusive general education classroom settings. It is expected that inclusion in the United States will become more prevalent in classrooms across the nation over the next ten years due to progressively more stringent federal and state mandates. In order for inclusion to result in adequate yearly progress for all student subgroups, it is imperative that it be properly implemented. Research has established that a critical component for proper implementation is an understanding of baseline attitudes in regard to inclusive education held by educators. The purpose of this study is to explore the attitudes of pre-K-12 general and special education teachers, school site administrators, school psychologists, paraprofessionals, physical and occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, certified non-teaching, school office staff and special education office staff in a medium sized school district in southern Arizona. This study examines the attitudes held by educators, their foundations of knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and opinions that shape their attitudes, and potential recommendations for implementation strategies that are predicted to be successful by these educators.","School Personnel;Secondary School Teachers;Regular and Special Education Relationship;Teacher Collaboration;Special Education Teachers;Faculty Development;Surveys;Likert Scales;Preschool Teachers;Mainstreaming;Disabilities;School Districts;Focus Groups;Attitude Measures;Elementary School Students;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Inclusion;Administrator Attitudes;Teacher Attitudes;Elementary Education;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);Arizona","Harkins, Bradford and Fletcher, Todd",2015.0,0,573
583,Creating Permeable Boundaries: Teaching and Learning for Social Justice in a Global Society,"In their call for proposals for this themed issue, the editors maintain that higher education institutions should graduate future P-12 teachers who think globally, have international experience, demonstrate foreign language competence, and are able to incorporate a global dimension into their teaching. In contrast, the authors argue that future educators should be inclusive educators who use teaching strategies that are inclusive of all students, think globally, and include global dimensions in their teaching. Inclusive educators honor the diverse cultural, linguistic, physical, mental, and cognitive complexities of their students. They argue that a focus on teaching for social justice is where global education, special education, and disability studies converge. They assert that this begins with teaching respect for those who are different within one's own environment--tolerance from the inside out, and they believe that it is only when convergence among global education, special education, and disability studies is forged that true respect may emerge. Students must experience tolerance in their own lives in order to teach respect. To do this, teachers must both model tolerance and respect and give students real opportunities to be in what Schon (1990) calls the ""murky swamp"" of decision making in which they examine their own beliefs and choose respect as the best action. In this paper, they examine the questions: who are the teachers and students? What are their images of diversity? Then they describe the convergence of global education, inclusive education, and disability studies. Next they explore what it means to teach for social justice. From this stance, they describe several teaching strategies that teacher educators can use for creating permeable boundaries.

The CLASS project (Creating Laboratory Access for Science Students) is a unique initiative offering training and resources to help educators provide students with a variety of physical, sensory and learning disabilities equal access in the science laboratory or field. To determine whether participants believed a 2-week residential workshop sponsored by CLASS raised disability awareness and provided teacher training in inclusive science teaching practice, a multipoint Likert scale survey and questionnaire was completed by all participants (N = 20) in four workshops. Participants reported large gains in their preparedness to teach science to students with disabilities. Participants also reported gains in their familiarity with instructional strategies, curricula, and resources and their ability to design, select, and modify activities for students with disabilities. Finally, shifts in attitudes about teaching science to students with disabilities were noted.","Likert Scales;Learning Disabilities;Inclusive Schools;Teaching Methods;Workshops;Science Instruction;Science Teachers;Teacher Attitudes;Consciousness Raising;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);Individuals with Disabilities Education Act","Kirch, Susan A. and Bargerhuff, Mary Ellen and Turner, Heidi and Wheatly, Michele",2005.0,0,575
585,Inclusive Education and Training Systems: Illusion or Reality? The Story of Nothemba,"This article explores the challenges facing the South African National Department of Education in its commitment to provide equal educational opportunities for all. ""The Story of Nothemba"" is central to the theme of this paper. It describes the story of a South African girl born in eQebe, whose physical disability and systematic disregard for her constitutional rights dashed her life time dream and passion to become a lawyer in a democratic South Africa. The paper argues for a critical interrogation of the following dynamics that have the potential to complicate both the implementation and optimization of the Inclusive Education Policy: (1) Understanding the social stereotypes about disability, (2) Teacher empowerment, (3) Systemic imbalance between support and expectations, (4) Adopting relevant curriculum policy and assessment strategies and practices, and (5) Utilizing the research logic to inform policy implementation. The paper further calls for a robust interrogation at conceptual level about ""disability"" to inform the current policies on education and training, teacher training and development, curriculum and assessment strategies.","Teacher Empowerment;Equal Education;Expectation;Females;Educational Opportunities;Curriculum;Physical Disabilities;Student Rights;Social Bias;Politics of Education;Access to Education;Mainstreaming;Stereotypes;Inclusive Schools;Foreign Countries;Educational Policy;Attitudes toward Disabilities;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);South Africa","Monyooe, Lebusa A.",2005.0,0,576

588,"High Expectations Require Supporting New Teachers, Educating the School Community","This article discusses the experience of recent graduates' part of a study from the master's program at Gallaudet University. New teachers for deaf students with disabilities report they simply were not prepared for the low expectations communicated by school principals or the exclusionary practices faced in the school community. They noted teacher education programs do not present sufficient information for teachers about students with disabilities or for special education teachers about strategies to work effectively with deaf students. Teacher education programs do not prepare those who will teach these students for the reality of the lack of understanding and indifference that they will face from their educator peers. They asked-How can young teachers be expected to maintain strong expectations for their students when they find their classes, their work, and their professional selves being constantly diminished and devalued? The teachers in the study offered some corrective suggestions: (1) that teacher education programs begin addressing the environment that soon-to-graduate teachers will face and teach these new graduates advocacy skills, (2) that inter-school socializing and participation in athletics might be venues in which deaf students and students with disabilities could be included, (3) mentoring-pairing new teachers one-on-one with experienced teachers to receive support and perhaps meaningfully assistance with problems, including negative perceptions of other teachers, and (4) university programs setting-up and providing access to chat rooms or discussion boards where new teachers have access to other new teachers, more experienced teachers, and university faculty. Raising expectations for deaf students, especially those with a disability, is a multi-faceted challenge. Giving teachers the tools they need to advocate for themselves and for their students within their school communities will promote success.","Teacher Education Programs;Expectation;Work Environment;Social Networks;Accessibility (for Disabled);Teacher Collaboration;Beginning Teachers;Advocacy;Special Education Teachers;Mentors;Career Readiness;Educational Resources;Educational Practices;Hearing Impairments;Inclusion;Educational Strategies;Deafness;Elementary Secondary Education;Higher Education;Postsecondary Education;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)","MacGlaughlin, Heidi M. and Mertens, Donna M.",2014.0,0,579
590,"Dis/ability, Agency, and Context: A Differential Consciousness for Doing Inclusive Education","In any sociocultural context, efforts to promote inclusive education may evoke trajectories of change that are as unpredictable as they are inexhaustible, stimulating the production of a range of disability subjectivities, performances, and constructions. This article unearths such local constructions by focusing on the experiences of nongovernmental organization educators and families of students with disabilities in Chennai, India, as they collectively engaged in inclusive education activity. Using the framework of ""differential consciousness"" (Sandoval, 2000) I explore the oppositional agency of participants in securing equitable opportunities for students with disabilities in mainstream settings. My aim in doing thus is to animate the links between local practices and global concepts of inclusive education. Even though the narratives of participants index ""place"" as the predominant signifier of inclusion, their decision making within hugely inaccessible contexts discloses their compulsory movement through multiple, sometimes contradictory, positions to achieve equitable schooling. I subsequently draw on these narratives and more broadly on U.S. third world feminist scholarship to suggest a few lines of inquiry that can serve a transnational theory of inclusive education.

593,Let's Talk about Teacher Aides,"Since 1989, teacher aides have become a familiar part of our classrooms as they support students with special educational needs. International and New Zealand research shows that despite many teacher aide practices that effectively support student learning in inclusive settings, there are some practices that work against the inclusion of some students and therefore, their academic and social learning needs are not being met. As part of a study that examined friendships and social relationships, four secondary school students with severe physical disabilities, teacher aides and teachers shared their stories. These stories complement other research studies and indicate that some schools are not addressing issues relating to the use of teacher aides. This study provides recent narrative data to inform policy and practice in relation to the use of teacher aides in inclusive settings.

596,Comparing Different Short-Term Service Delivery Methods of Visual-Motor Treatment for First Grade Students in Mainstream Schools,"To compare the efficacy of three different short-term service delivery methods on first grade children with soft neurological signs who suffer from visual-motor difficulties. One hundred and forty seven first grade students who scored below the 21st percentile on the Visual-Motor Integration Test (VMI) were recruited from schools and randomly divided into three intervention groups and an additional control group. One group received Direct Treatment Model (DT), the second group received Collaborative-Consultation Treatment Model (CC) and the third group received a Combined Treatment Model (CT). The CC included treatment administered by teachers, after Collaborative-Consultation with an occupational therapist (OT). The CT included the two models (DT, CC), administered simultaneously. Pre- and post-intervention tests were administered to both groups. Students in all three intervention groups made significant gains in comparison to the control group suggesting that all three service delivery methods had the same effect on children's visual-motor skills. Therapists in school settings who are obliged to be more efficient are encouraged to use the CC or the CT service delivery methods which would enable them to treat more children during the same time-frame, with full confidence that the treatment goals will be achieved as if using the DT.

597,Recess--It's Indispensable!,"The demise of recess in many elementary schools--and of outdoor play in general--is an issue of great concern to many members of the Play, Policy, and Practice Interest Forum. Most people remember recess as an important part of the school day. It was a time to be outdoors; to organize games; to play on the swings, slides, and other playground equipment; or just to hang out with friends. In contrast, children today are likely to have 10 to 15 minutes of outdoor playtime during the school day, if they are lucky. No wonder there is an upswing in childhood obesity and an increase in childhood heart disease and type 2 diabetes. No wonder teachers are concerned about a generation of children who can't entertain themselves, have social difficulties, and are fidgety and off task in class. In the late 1980s, some school systems began cutting back on recess to allow more instructional time. The trend accelerated with the passage of No Child Left Behind in 2001 and was particularly widespread in urban schools with high numbers of children from marginalized populations. The arguments against recess involved both academics and safety issues. Some administrators believed their school's test scores would improve if children spent more time on school work. Some feared lawsuits from playground injuries. A number of school systems have a recess policy; others allow the principals or teachers to determine whether the children go out to play. Officially having recess and ""actually"" having recess are two different issues. In this article, the authors list some cognitive, social-emotional, and physical benefits of recess. They call on readers to stand up for recess and provide some steps readers can take.","Child;Only Child;Injuries;Interpersonal Competence;Urban Schools;Safety;Physical Fitness;Playgrounds;Physical Development;Play;Federal Legislation;Cognitive Development;School Administration;Heart Disorders;Obesity;Grade 3;Grade 1;Elementary Education;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);No Child Left Behind Act 2001;Pennsylvania","Jarrett, Olga and Waite-Stupiansky, Sandra",2009.0,0,583

601,Assistance to Pupils with Physical Disabilities in Regular Schools: Promoting Inclusion or Creating Dependency?,"Drawing on the perspectives of pupils with physical disabilities, their parents and teachers, this study explored the adult support provided to pupils with physical disabilities in regular schools. Data were collected through observations at schools and qualitative interviews. In all, 49 individuals participated in this study: 14 pupils with physical disabilities, 17 parents, and 18 teachers. Six themes emerged that characterised the provision of assistance: (1) roles and responsibilities; (2) quantity and content of support (3) proximity to the pupil, (4) school priorities, (5) independence and autonomy of the child; and (6) the relationship between the teacher and the assistant. An over-reliance on adult support was found for some pupils and contexts, while this support appeared to be under-utilised or ineffectively delivered in other situations. Lack of modifications of the traditional curriculum, teacher instructions, and educational activities increased the pupils' need for adult support in school. While it is acknowledged that teacher assistants can make valuable contributions in promoting participation and learning among pupils with disabilities, it is argued that the constant presence of an assistant can result in limited use of the children's strengths and may possibly create unnecessary or unhealthy dependencies. The findings signify that the education system must align with important stakeholders--the pupils, their parents, and external support services--to identify alternative ways to promote participation and learning of pupils with disabilities in regular schools.

602,Higher Education Provision for Students with Disabilities in Cyprus,"Internationally, the number of students with disabilities entering higher education institutions is on the rise. Research estimates that 8-10% of students attending higher education are registered with disability, with learning difficulties being the most commonly reported disability. Widening participation in higher education has been supported by legislative changes, inclusive education practices, the use of ICT and accessible facilities and programs and, ultimately, an increasing belief among students with disabilities that higher education maximizes their opportunities for employment and independent living. Within the Cypriot context, research on disability, access and provision in higher education is limited. This study was a part of a large-scale study (PERSEAS) funded by the EU. From the original sample, 15 students attending private higher education institutions in Cyprus reported disability (i.e., sensory impairment, dyslexia, physical disabilities) and were selected for focus group discussions. Also, interviews and focus groups were conducted with the Headmasters and teachers, respectively, in 10 private higher education institutions. This study yielded interesting results regarding the current state of provision (e.g., concessions for exams and assignments, infrastructure, teaching modification, counseling services) as well as issues of social inclusion, equality of opportunity and entitlement to education.","Equal Education;Private Colleges;Special Needs Students;Curriculum Development;Testing Accommodations;Access to Education;Mainstreaming;Inclusive Schools;Foreign Countries;Student Attitudes;Disabilities;Civil Rights;Focus Groups;Attitudes toward Disabilities;School Counseling;Administrator Attitudes;Teacher Attitudes;Higher Education;Student Needs;Postsecondary Education;ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE);Cyprus","Hadjikakou, Kika and Hartas, Dimitra",2008.0,0,586

Participants were five Japanese PE teachers (one women and four men). The research was descriptive and qualitative, using an interviewing method. Data were gathered in interviews, analysed and presented as descriptive narratives and themes. Themes that emerged from the data were: satisfactions, ambivalences and concerns; professional preparation inadequacies; and communication, collaboration and support. PE teacher education faculty must provide apposite training for teachers to more competently teach students with disabilities and better ensure that they have satisfying experiences doing so. The study brings to the literature information on Japanese PE teachers' beliefs about integration and teaching students with disabilities. This is particularly important as teachers in Japan grapple with the current historic, societal and educational transition from segregated to integrated schools.

612,Trainee and Recently Qualified Physical Education Teachers' Perspectives on Including Children with Special Educational Needs,"Background: In recent years within the UK the inclusion of children with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream physical education (PE) has escalated up the statutory and political agenda. Despite this increased focus in schools, empirical research demonstrates that inequalities still exist in relation to the readiness of government, teacher training providers, schools and PE teachers to deliver this agenda. Furthermore, there is little empirical research regarding the experiences of trainee and recently qualified PE teachers related to the development of their knowledge, understanding and application of strategies to include children with SEN. Aims: The present study aimed to examine the views and opinions of trainee and recently qualified PE teachers to gain an insight into their views and experiences of both their initial teacher training, and confidence once in schools to include children with SEN. Methods: Five PE teacher training providers in England were identified as the sample group in which the views and opinions of 202 trainee and 19 recently qualified teachers (up to 2 years' post qualifying experience) were examined. A mixed methodological research design was constructed in order to examine ""the extent to which trainee and recently qualified PE teachers' perceived readiness to include children with SEN was evident"". Data were collected via two questionnaires comprising a series of open and closed responses (one to trainee teachers, and one to recently qualified PE teachers). Questions focused upon respondents' present experiences and perceived confidence in teaching children with SEN; reflections on the effectiveness of their training; professional development and training; links with schools and mentors; interpretations of inclusive PE and general values and attitudes. Data were analysed via the Statistical Package for Social Scientists. The open-ended responses were analysed using protocol analysis in order to code key themes and provide a rich insight into the general and specific issues related to trainee and recently qualified PE teachers' perceived readiness to include children with SEN. Results: The study found training experiences gained by students and recently qualified teachers to be rather mixed, with many indicating a lack of perceived readiness to include children with SEN satisfactorily. Eighty-four percent of recently qualified PE teachers, and 43% of trainees identified their initial teacher training had not prepared them sufficiently to work with children with SEN in schools. Conclusion: In the future, trainee PE teachers need more opportunities to work, and be assessed on SEN as part of their school-based experiences, alongside gaining practical PE experience. Moreover, it is evident trainee teachers need opportunities to experience the full continuum of learning needs if they are to respond effectively to the individual needs of all pupils. A key factor in addressing this in the future will necessitate schools, training providers and government listening to the voices of trainee and qualified PE teachers and children with SEN in order to address the high levels of dissatisfaction that are currently present.

613,Self-efficacy of physical education teachers in including students with cerebral palsy in their classes.,"Children with cerebral palsy (CP) are often mainstreamed into the general education system, but are likely to be excluded from physical education (PE) classes. A questionnaire was constructed and utilized to measure PE teachers' self-efficacy (SE) toward inclusion of students with CP in each of three mobility categories (independent, using assistive devices, using wheelchair mobility) and the impact of experience and training on teachers' SE. Participants in the study were 121 PE teachers from different parts of Israel (mean age: 41.02¬±9.33 years; range: 25.00-59.00 years). Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the structure of the sub-scales' factors' structure and Cronbach's Alpha reliability was satisfactory (range 0.872-0.941). Independent t-tests were calculated in order to compare the SE of teachers with and without adapted PE experience. Repeated Analysis of Variance was performed to measure within-group differences in SE. Results revealed that the PE teachers' SE in teaching students who use mobility assistive devices or wheelchairs was significantly lower compared to teaching those who walk and run unaided (F=19.11; p<0.001). The teachers' SE towards including CP children who independently ambulate was influenced (p<0.05; d=0.94) by the teacher's experience (elementary school practicum). SE in the mobility with assistive device group was also significantly influenced (p<0.05; d=0.1) by teaching experience (previous experience and having a specialization in adapted PE). Finally, SE when teaching the wheelchair mobility group was influenced by having an adapted PE specialization (p<0.05; d=0.82). Specialized training in this particular area should be enhanced to increase teachers' SE and enable greater participation of children with CP in general physical education classes.","Participation;Mobility;Exclusion;Self-Help Devices;Self Efficacy;School Teachers;Reproducibility of Results;Physical Education and Training;Middle Aged;Male;Mainstreaming (Education);Israel;Humans;Female;Factor Analysis, Statistical;Cerebral Palsy;Adult","Hutzler, Yeshayahu and Barak, Sharon",2017.0,1,593
614,Attitudes of Greek Physical Education Teachers towards Inclusion of Students with Disabilities in Physical Education Classes,"Over the last decade the idea of inclusion of students with disabilities and special educational needs (SEN) in general schools has become increasingly the focus of national and international policies. Inclusive education has also made enormous progress in Greece recently. The purpose of this study was to examine the attitudes of Physical Educators toward the inclusion of students with disabilities and SEN in general Physical Education (PE) classes and to compare them with those teachers who taught the course of Olympic/Paralympic Education (O/PE) as well as examine gender differences. Four hundred and ten PE teachers (200 male and 210 female) of an average age of 33.58 years from different prefectures of Greece completed a modified version of the questionnaire ""Attitudes toward Teaching Individuals with Physical Disabilities in Physical Education"" (ATIPDPE) of Kudlacek et al (2002). Two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data. The results revealed positive attitudes of all teachers toward teaching students with disabilities and SEN in PE classes; however, there were no significant differences between those who taught different type of PE courses as well as between males and females. It is strongly suggested an ongoing assessment should examine the changes in education of students with disabilities and SEN and their inclusion in the general schools and how.

615,Elementary Physical Education Teachers' Attitudes towards the Inclusion of Children with Special Needs: A Qualitative Investigation,"Laws and legislation have resulted in children with special needs being placed in general physical education (GPE) classes with general physical educators. The purpose of this study was twofold; (a) to identify two practicing teachers with positive attitudes towards inclusion of students with mild to moderate disabilities and two teachers with negative attitudes towards inclusion of students with disabilities using Rizzo's (1993) Physical Education Attitudes Toward Individuals with Disabilities survey (PEATID), and (b) to investigate, through in-depth interviews, how their attitudes were formed and how it affected their teaching. Teachers with positive attitudes; (a) identified multiple focus areas and objectives in their teaching, (b) developed written lesson plans that incorporated several different teaching styles, (c) had received training in modifying and adapting physical education for students with disabilities, and (d) desired their students to be successful in their classes. The findings have implications for the field of physical education teacher education (PETE). PETE programs should develop programs of study that include adapted physical education classes. Additionally pre-service teachers should be taught how to plan, modify, and deliver developmentally appropriate activities for children with and without special needs.",Attitude;Child;Only Child;Physical Education and Training;Qualitative Research;Measures (Individuals);Developmentally Appropriate Practices;Lesson Plans;Attitudes toward Disabilities;Teacher Attitudes;Special Needs Students;Physical Education Teachers;Disabilities;Negative Attitudes;Inclusive Schools;Teaching Styles;Adapted Physical Education;Preservice Teacher Education,"Combs, Sue and Elliott, Steven and Whipple, Kerry",2010.0,1,595
616,High School Physical Educators' Beliefs about Teaching Differently Abled Students in an Urban Public School District,"The purpose of this study was to examine general physical education (GPE) teachers' beliefs about teaching differently abled students in inclusive classes.The participants were 5 GPE teachers from a large urban school district. The research method was explanatory multiple-case study situated in planned behavior theory. Data were gathered using a demographic questionnaire, attitude survey, and interviews. Survey data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and revealed that the teachers' judgments vary on inclusion and their level of acceptance in teaching differently abled students. The teachers agreed that more professional training was a need. Interview data were analyzed with constant comparative method.The emergent themes were: (a) teachers' pedagogies troubled, (b) dependent self-efficacy, (c) paradoxes, (d) motives, and (e) concerns. Findings thus implied that urban school districts should regularly engage teachers in professional development focused on teaching differently abled students.

617,Swedish Primary-School Teachers' Attitudes to Inclusion--The Case of PE and Pupils with Physical Disabilities,"Teachers play a decisive role in making inclusive education a reality. The particular case of inclusion in physical education (PE) poses a specific challenge to teaching practice. How PE teachers view inclusion may provide special insights into teachers' general attitudes toward inclusion and inclusive practices in the general school curriculum. The aim of this study is to investigate Swedish PE teachers' attitudes to inclusion of pupils with physical disabilities in mainstream PE classes at primary school. The sampling frame was members of the Swedish Teachers' Union who had registered themselves as PE teachers and who indicated a current e-mail address (n = 560). Respondents were invited to complete an e-mail questionnaire with questions covering demographics, general attitudes, support from school management and staff, possible hindrances and personal experiences of inclusion. A total of 221 teachers (39%) responded, equal numbers of males and females with a bimodal age distribution (means of 28 and 44) with an average of eight years of service. On average, Swedish PE teachers are very positive to inclusion of pupils with physical disabilities into general PE. Gender, age, years of service and work satisfaction had no impact on general opinions of inclusive PE. PE teachers with actual previous experience of teaching pupils with physical disabilities were slightly more positive to inclusive PE. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to establish a predictive model of positive attitudes to inclusion based on: (1) having adequate training; (2) having general school support (from management and staff); and (3) demands on resources. This yielded an adjusted R[squared] that explained 33% of variation in attitudes.

618,The Effect of Teachers' Attitude toward Inclusion on the Practice and Success Levels of Children with and without Disabilities in Physical Education,"The purpose of this study was to ascertain the relationship between teachers' attitudes toward the inclusion of children with mild to moderate mental disabilities in physical education settings and the amount of practice attempts performed and the levels of success attained by these students compared to their peers without disabilities. The findings suggested a relationship between teacher attitude toward inclusion and teacher effectiveness. Teachers with a positive attitude toward inclusion provided all of their students with significantly more practice attempts, at a higher level of success.

619,Attitudes of Greek Physical Education Teachers toward Inclusion of Students with Disabilities,"The purpose of this study was to examine the attitudes of Greek physical education teachers toward the inclusion of students with disabilities in regular education settings and to compare the results with the findings of similar studies. The sample consisted of 93 participants, all physical education teachers working at different schools of Athens. Each subject completed the Teacher Integration Attitudes Questionnaire (Sideridis and Chandler, 1997), which assesses scores for four factors: skills, benefits, acceptance and support. The results of the study showed that the attitudes of physical education teachers toward the inclusion of students with disabilities in their regular classes are related to the level of knowledge that the teachers believe they have for the special needs conditions; in addition, they doubt that inclusion could be workable, due to the lack of appropriate support services. In the light of the findings, the concept of inclusion was further analysed.

620,High School Physical Education Teachers' Beliefs about Teaching Students with Mild to Severe Disabilities,"The purpose of this study was to analyze high school physical education teachers' beliefs about teaching students with disabilities in inclusive physical education. The participants (3 men, 2 women) were certified physical education teachers at four suburban high schools. The research method was descriptive-qualitative using a case study approach (Stake, 2000) situated in the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1991). Data sources were demographic questionnaires and focused interviews (Yin, 2003). Interview data were analyzed using constant comparative method (Merriam, 1998) and uncovered four major recurrent themes, which were: (a) teaching practice troubled, (b) dependent self-efficacy, (c) contradictions, and (d) intrinsic motivates. The teachers desired more professional training geared specifically on teaching students with severe disabilities, emotional-behavioral disorders, hyperactivity, and attention deficits. Implications are that school districts should do more to engage teachers in professional development training that focuses on effective strategies for teaching students with disabilities in physical education.

621,Japanese Physical Educators' Beliefs on Teaching Students with Disabilities at Urban High Schools,"The purpose of this study was to analyse Japanese physical education teachers' beliefs on teaching students with disabilities in integrated classes. The participants were five physical education teachers in Japan. Situated in planned behaviour theory developed by Icek Ajzen in 1985, the research method was descriptive-qualitative case study as described by R.E. Stake in 2000. The primary sources of data were focused interviews. The interview data were analysed using constant comparative method. Results indicate that the teachers believed teaching students with disabilities, particularly those with severe disabilities, is difficult and complicated. Despite their concerns, the teachers worked at teaching students with disabilities largely because they were motivated to do so in compliance with significant referents and policies supporting integrated schooling. Japan's Special Support Education policies create a legal base for establishing teacher education programmes, ensuring that there is professional development training designed to prepare physical education specialists to competently teach students with disabilities in integrated settings.

622,High School General Physical Education Teachers' Behaviors and Beliefs Associated with Inclusion,"The purpose of this study was to describe the behaviors and beliefs of secondary general physical education (GPE) teachers relative to inclusion and teaching of students with disabilities. Participants were nine experienced high school GPE teachers from suburban school districts in California, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The research method was naturalistic inquiry. Qualitative data were collected using observer field notes and interview schedules. Findings were presented using descriptive summaries and thematic narratives. These teachers regularly verbally interacted with and expressed mostly favorable beliefs about teaching students with disabilities. Teacher interviews revealed three recurring themes: (a) teachers were positively disposed to inclusion as an educational philosophy, (b) teachers had differential efficacy in achieving successful inclusion, and (c) teachers encountered challenges to establishing inclusive practice. Despite their mostly favorable beliefs about inclusion, several teachers felt inadequately prepared or lacked support and resources to effectively teach students with more severe disabilities.

623,Secondary Physical Education Teachers' Beliefs and Practices in Teaching Students with Severe Disabilities: A Descriptive Analysis,"The purpose was to describe the beliefs and practices of general physical education (GPE) teachers at the high school level on inclusion and teaching students with severe disabilities. Participants were two experienced GPE teachers at separate suburban high schools. The research paradigm was descriptive using a combination of naturalistic observation and interviewing (Fontana & Frey, 2000; Gay, 1996). Data were collected from eighteen lessons using field notes, wireless microphones, a video camera, an observation instrument, and interviews. Descriptive statistics and thematic narratives were used to present findings. The teachers mostly verbally interacted with those students who had severe disabilities. They varied in their teaching efficacy. Three recurring themes emerged from the data: (a) wavering beliefs; (b) complexities of inclusion; and (c) troubled confidence. Teachers must believe they are adequately prepared, well equipped, and supported to confidently exhibit effective inclusive GPE pedagogies.

624,The Examination of Physical Education Teachers' Perceptions of Their Teacher Training to Include Students with Disabilities in General Physical Education.,"Despite legislative mandates, only 32% of states require specific licensure in adapted physical education (APE); consequently, general physical educators are challenged with including students with disabilities into regular classrooms. Although physical education teachers are considered qualified personnel to teach students with disabilities in general physical education (GPE), teachers expressed the need to receive additional training toward inclusion. In the United States, Public Law 108-446 governs that schools allow individuals with disabilities to participate equally with GPE students. Though legislation mandates that these students have full inclusion it is evident that oftentimes students with disabilities are not provided with equal opportunities as compared to their counterparts in physical education and activity. Because of the lack of participation in physical education, these students are legally excluded from the same educational experiences as their peers. Physical education teacher education (PETE) programs should significantly impact pre-service teachers' ability to support inclusion. If university teacher preparation programs are responsible for preparing educators to promote inclusion for students with disabilities, then examining the perceptions of physical education teachers' initial training could ensure these programs are meeting their intended goals. The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to examine physical education teachers' perceptions of their teacher training to include students with disabilities in GPE. Five certified physical educators from a K12 urban school district in central Kansas served as participants in this study. Data collection was conducted through anonymous online interviews using SurveyMonkey. QRS NVivo software was employed to systematically organize codes from the interviews. Three themes emerged in relation to the research questions. Implications were: (a) teacher training raised awareness toward students with disabilities, (b) more specific teacher training related to students with disabilities is needed, and (c) a lack of resources is the primary obstacle teachers encounter when including students with disabilities in GPE. It is recommended that efforts to evaluate PETE training methods, ensure physical education teachers are adequately prepared toward inclusion, and provide students with disabilities fair and equal opportunities in physical education endure.","United States;Physical Examination;Program Evaluation;Exploratory Research;Qualitative Studies;Interviews;Surveys;Internet;Students, Disabled;Physical Education and Training;Human;Attitude to Disability;Teachers;Perception","Townsend, Amy",2017.0,1,604
625,Physical educators' concerns about integrating children with disabilities: a cross-cultural comparison.,"The purpose was to conduct a qualitative cross-cultural comparison of the concerns of physical educators in two countries about integration of children with and without disabilities. In-depth interviews were held with 30 regular elementary physical education teachers in Berlin (7 males, 9 females) and in the Dallas-Ft. Worth (DFW) area (2 males, 12 females), and observations were made of school settings. The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) of Hall, Wallace, and Dossett (1973) guided the study. Data were analyzed by grounded theory procedures. Many concerns about integration were generalizable across cultures. In both countries, teachers reported concerns at only four of the seven stages of CBAM: personal, management, consequence, and collaboration. Most concerns focused on management. The major cultural difference was that DFW teachers reported more personal concerns (uncertainty about everyday demands and competence to meet these demands) than Berlin teachers. A dynamic systems model was proposed to guide future research.","Child;Only Child;Disabled Children;Cross-Cultural Comparison;Human;Comparative Studies;Audiorecording;Evaluation;Job Experience;Descriptive Statistics;Middle Age;Adult;Pilot Studies;Semi-Structured Interview;Validity;Questionnaires;Interview Guides;Purposive Sample;Students, Elementary;Grounded Theory;Models, Theoretical;Observational Methods;Female;Male;Texas;Germany;Ethnological Research;Qualitative Studies;Teachers;Cultural Values;Psychosocial Factors;Physical Education and Training;Child, Disabled","C, Lienert and C, Sherrill and B, Myers",2001.0,1,605
626,PERCEPTION OF PHYSICAL EDUCATORS TOWARD TEACHING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN AN INCLUSIVE CLASS SETTING IN NIGERIA.,"The study examined physical educators' perceptions regarding the impact of teaching students with disabilities in inclusive class on social acceptance, developing self-concept, demands on existing equipment, classroom management, teachers' workload, and learning motor skills for students without disabilities. Sixty-seven physical educators teaching in junior secondary schools in Nigeria participated in the study, and a survey research design was adopted using adapted PEATH. Findings revealed positive social acceptance (M = 3.45-3.90 < 3.00), positive development of self-concept (3.67 < 3.00), discipline problems and disruption of classroom harmony (3.12 - 3.18 < 3.00), demands on specialized equipment (4.47 < 3.00), increase in workload (3.66 - 4.01 < 3.00), negative impact on motor skills acquisition of students (3.67 - 3.69 < 3.00). Multiple regression showed F = 2.13 was not statistically significant. p-value = .08 greater than 0.05.

627,ATTITUDES OF IN-SERVICE PHYSICAL EDUCATORS TOWARD TEACHING CHILDREN WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES IN GENERAL PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES IN CYPRUS. / ATTITUDES DES ENSEIGNANTS D'EDUCATION PHYSIQUE ENVERS DES ENFANTS ATTEINTS DE HANDICAPS MOTEURS EN MILIEU SCOLAIRE GENERAL EN CHYPRE.,"Over the last two decades the idea of inclusion of students with special educational needs (SEN) in general schools has become increasingly the focus of Inclusive education in Cyprus. The passage of new laws mandating school inclusion, the new educational physical education curriculum as well as the attention that has been given to physical education teachers' training, are significant changes towards school inclusion. The aim of this study was to identify the attitudes, and predictors of attitudes, of in service Cypriot secondary school physical education teachers towards the inclusion of students with physical disabilities in general physical education (GPE) classes. The Greek translated version of the questionnaire ATIPDPE-GR (Doulkeridou, Evaggelinou & Kudlacek, 2010) originally developed by Kudlacek, Valkova, Sherrill, Myers and French (2002) was used. The instrument was designed based on the ""Theory of Planned Behavior"" (TPB) by Ajzen (1991). Statistical analysis included one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Stepwise multiple regression demonstrated the percentage of variability of variance of intention as explained by the Attitude Toward Behavior and Perceived Behavioral Control subscales (R Square = 0,547). The Perceived Behavioral Control had the strongest correlation on intention to include students with physical disabilities in general Physical Education (p < 0.01). The subscale Attitude toward Behavior had the second strongest correlation on intention to include students with physical disabilities in general Physical Education (p < 0.05). In addition, results show no significant difference between females and males towards intention for inclusion. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Durante las √∫ltimas dos d√©cadas el concepto de la inclusi√≥n de alumnos con necesidades educativas especiales (NEE) en las escuelas normalizadas en Chipre tiene cada vez m√°s un enfoque hacia la educaci√≥n inclusiva. El objetivo de este estudio fue identificar las actitudes y los predictores de dichas actitudes de los profesores chipriotas de educaci√≥n f√≠sica en activo en secundaria hacia la inclusi√≥n de estudiantes con discapacidades f√≠sicas en las clases de educaci√≥n f√≠sica general. Fue utilizada la versi√≥n griega traducida del cuestionario ATIPDPE-GR (Doulkeridou, Evaggelinou y Kudlacek, 2010) desarrollado originalmente por Kudlacek, Valkova, Sherrill, Myers y French (2002). El instrumento fue dise√±ado en base a la ""Teor√≠a del comportamiento planificado"" (TCP) por Ajzen (1991).

Im Laufe der letzten zwei Jahrzehnte r√ºckte die Idee der Inklusion von Sch√ºler(inne)n mit sonderp√§dagogischem F√∂rderbedarf (SspF) in allgemeinen Schulen zunehmend in den Fokus der inklusiven Erziehung in Zypern. Das Ziel dieser Studie war es, die Einstellungen und Einstellungspr√§diktoren von Bewegungserzieher(inne)n in zypriotischen Sekundarschulen gegen√ºber der Inklusion von Sch√ºler(inne)n mit k√∂rperlichen Behinderungen im regul√§ren Sportunterricht zu ermitteln. Es wurde die ins Griechische √ºbersetzte Version des ATIPDPG-GRFragebogens (Doulkeridou, Evaggelinou & Kudlacek, 2010), urspr√ºnglich entwickelt von Kudlacek, Valkova, Sherrill, Myers und French (2002), verwendet. Dieses Instrument wurde auf der Basis der Theorie des geplanten Verhaltens (TPB) von Ajzen (1991) entwickelt. Die Ergebnisse der stufenweisen multiplen Regressionsanalyse ergaben f√ºr R¬≤ = .547 und zeigten damit den Prozentsatz der Variabilit√§t der Varianz der Intention, die durch die Einstellung gegen√ºber dem Verhalten und der wahrgenommenen Verhaltenskontrolle erkl√§rt wird. Die wahrgenommene Verhaltenskontrolle hatte die st√§rkste Korrelation mit der Absicht Sch√ºler(innen) mit k√∂rperlichen Behinderungen in den allgemeinen Sportunterricht zu inkludieren mit p<0.01. Die Subskala Einstellung gegen√ºber Verhalten hatte die zweitst√§rkste Korrelation mit der Absicht, Sch√ºler(innen) mit k√∂rperlichen Behinderungen in den allgemeinen Sportunterricht zu inkludieren mit p<0.05.

629,COMPONENTS OF ATTITUDES TOWARD THE INCLUSION OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN THE ATIPDPE-GR INSTRUMENT FOR GREEK PHYSICAL EDUCATORS. / N√ÅZORY NA ZAƒåLENƒöN√ç STUDENT≈Æ S POSTI≈ΩEN√çM DO HODIN TƒöLESN√â V√ùCHOVY V N√ÅSTROJI ATIPDPE-GR PRO ≈òECK√â UƒåITELE TƒöLOCVIKU.,"BACKROUND: Over the last decade the idea of the inclusion of students with disabilities and special educational needs (SEN) in general schools has become increasingly the focus of national and international policies in Greece. An important factor that affects the success of inclusion is attitude and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) provides a useful framework for the study of attitudes toward people with disabilities. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine the structure of the attitudinal scale, modified for Greece, of the Attitudes Toward Inclusion of Individuals with Physical Disabilities in Physical Education - Greece (ATIPDPE-GR), an instrument based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) of Ajzen (2000), aiming to measure Greek physical educators' attitudes. METHODS: Participants were 155 physical educators (85 females and 70 males) with a mean age of 37.68 years teaching either the physical education (PE) course or the Olympic & Paralympic education (O & PE) course in seven different prefectures of Greece. RESULTS: Based on the one way ANOVA, the attitudinal scale of ATIPDPE-GR measures two psychological properties (components). Two components, which come from a principal component analysis, explain more than 42% of the variance. The two components are: a) positive outcomes for students and b) negative outcomes for teachers and students. CONCLUSION: Our present results indicate that the ATIPDPE-GR can be a reliable instrument that measures PE teachers' attitudes and that the theory of planned behavior can provide a sound theoretical framework for the study of the attitudes of physical educators.

630,A Preliminary Study on Primary Physical Educators' Attitudes toward Integrated Physical Education: Hong Kong Perspectives.,"The aim of the survey was to examine the attitudes of general primary PE teachers toward integrated PE and the relationships of gender, teaching experience, and class size. Eighty three teachers participated in the survey. The results indicated a neutral attitude towards integrated PE by teachers. There was a significant difference between male and female teachers in their perception of whether ""students with disabilities like my teaching"" (p = 0.018), but no significant differences with other attitudes by gender. There was a significant difference between teachers' teaching experiences and their perceptions of whether ""Little support offered to integrated PE"" (p = 0.006), however, no significant differences with other items by experience. There was also a relationship between perceived teaching competency and class size (p < 0.001, r = 0.454). The results were mainly discussed in relation to teaching competency, support, teaching experience and class size.

631,Kuwaiti Physical Educators' Attitudes Toward Teaching Individuals with Disabilities.,"This study examined attitudes of Kuwaiti general physical educators (GPE) toward teaching students with disabilities. Participants were 30 male and 30 female physical educators who taught grades K-12 in Kuwait State public schools. The Physical Educators' Attitude Toward Teaching Individuals with Disabilities (PEATID III) survey and semi-structured open-ended questions were administered. Results of analyses revealed Kuwaiti GPE teachers had negative attitudes toward teaching students with disabilities. GPE teachers had more favorable attitudes toward teaching students with specific learning disability Most unfavorable attitude was for the disabling condition of moderate-severe mental retardation. Analyses by gender revealed female GPE teachers exhibited significantly more favorable attitudes than male GPE teachers toward teaching students with emotional/behavioral disorders. In contrast, male GPE teachers exhibited significantly more favorable attitudes than female GPE teachers toward teaching students with mild-moderate mental retardation. Most GPE teachers with 2 previous classes in adapted physical education had unfavorable attitudes toward inclusion practices. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Die Studie untersuchte Einstellungen von kuwaitischen Sportlehrern/innen zum Unterrichten von Sch√ºlern/innen mit Behinderungen. Probanden waren 30 Sportlehrer und 30 Sportlehrerinnen, die an staatlichen Grund- und Oberschulen in Kuwait unterrichteten. Daten wurden mit Hilfe des ""Einstellungen von Sportlehrern/innen zum Unterrichten von Menschen mit Behinderungen""-Fragebogens (PEATID III) und semistrukturierten offenen Fragen erhoben. Die Ergebnisse der Analysen zeigten, dass kuwaitische Sportlehrer/innen negative Einstellungen zum Unterrichten von Sch√ºlern/innen mit Behinderungen haben. Die Sportlehrer/innen hatten etwas positivere Einstellung zum Unterrichten von Sch√ºlern/innen mit Lernbehinderungen und die negativsten Einstellungen zum Unterrichten von Sch√ºlern/innen mit schwerer geistiger Behinderung. Weitere Analysen ergaben, dass Sportlehrerinnen positivere Einstellungen zum Unterrichten von Sch√ºlern/innen mit Verhaltensst√∂rungen hatten als Sportlehrer. Im Vergleich dazu hatten Sportlehrer deutlich positivere Einstellungen zum Unterrichten von Sch√ºlern/innen mit leichter geistiger Behinderung als Sportlehrerinnen. Weiterhin hatten die meisten Sportlehrer/innen, die zwei Kurse &uunl;ber den Sportunterricht f√ºr Sch√ºler/innen mit Behinderungen belegt hatten, negative Einstellungen zur Integration.

632,Physical educators' perceptions of inclusion: a Hawaii school district perspective.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of physical educators in a Hawaii school district on inclusion. The Physical Educators' Perceptions of Inclusion Inventory (Hodge, Murata, & Jansma, 1994) was mailed to all elementary and high school physical educators within a targeted district (N=52). Of the 52 physical educators surveyed, 26 responded (50 percent). The range of respondents included first year teachers through those with 30 or more years of teaching experience. The majority of the respondents (81 percent) had experience teaching students with disabilities. Data were analyzed across three factors: (a) years of experience teaching physical education, (b) experience teaching students with disabilities, and (c) educational preparation (i.e., coursework at undergraduate and graduate levels). Significant positive results were revealed for physical educators who had enrolled in graduate level adapted physical education courses. However, indecisiveness was revealed for physical educators who had taken graduate level special education courses. Years of experience teaching physical education and experience working with students with disabilities did not significantly influence the perceptions of the physical educators surveyed.","Hawaii;Physical Education and Training;SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS-Integration;INTEGRATION;HAWAII;TEACHERS;ATTITUDE (Psychology);SURVEYS;EDUCATION, Secondary;ELEMENTARY schools;*PEOPLE with disabilities;*PHYSICAL education & training","Maeda, J.K. and Murate, N.M. and Hodge, S.R.",1997.0,1,612

634,Physical Education Teachers' Attitudes Toward Teaching Students With Disabilities.,"Teacher attitudes showed to play an important role in the successful inclusion of children with disabilities in general physical education (GPE). Evidence exists that various attributes can affect GPE teachers' attitudes. The purpose of this study was to extend prior research by assessing the relationship between selected GPE teacher attributes and their attitudes toward teaching students with disabilities. A total of 273 GPE teachers were selected from a sample of New Jersey schools using a stratified randomization. Of the teachers contacted, 168 (79 males and 89 females) responded (62%) to the Physical Educators' Attitude Toward Teaching Individuals with Disabilities-III instrument (Rizzo, 1993). The age range was 25–62 years (M = 44, SD = 10). Years of teaching experience ranged 1–38 (M = 17, SD = 9.9). Of the 168 teachers, 81% taught elementary, 39% middle, and 8% high school level. All teachers had prior experience teaching students with disabilities, and 2% rated their experience as not good, 54% as satisfactory, and 41% as very good. Ninety two percent had completed one or more undergraduate courses in APE. When asked to rate their perceived competence in teaching students with disabilities, 6% reported not being competent at all, 52% reported being somewhat competent, and 42% reported being very competent. The results indicated that attitudes toward teaching students with disabilities were generally favorable (M = 3.39, SD = 0.77), but varied according to type of disability. Teachers were favorable toward students with specific learning disabilities (M = 3.55, SD = 0.79), sensory impairments (M = 3.50, SD = 0.82), intellectual disabilities (M = 3.48, SD = 0.81), and physical disabilities (M = 3.46, SD = 0.82), while unfavorable toward those with emotional/behavioral disorders (M= 2.95, SD = 0.77). A forward stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that perceived competence was the most significant predictor of positive attitudes [R = .52, R_ = .27, F(1, 167) = 38.14, p < .000], followed by gender [R = .56., R_ = .31, F(1, 167) = 23.14, p < .000], quality of experience [R = .59, R_ = .33, F(1, 167) = 17.79, p < .000], and undergraduate coursework in APE [R = .62, R_ = .36, F(1, 167) = 15.33, p < .000]. The findings from this study confirmed that physical education preparation and experience in working with students with disabilities are important in enhancing positive teacher attitudes toward inclusion in GPE.","Physical Education and Training;SPORTS AND RECREATION ACTIVITIES-Adapted physical education;INTEGRATION;TEENAGERS;CHILDREN;EDUCATION, Secondary;ELEMENTARY schools;ATTITUDE (Psychology);TEACHERS;*PEOPLE with disabilities;*TEACHING;*PHYSICAL education & training","Obrusnikova, Iva",2007.0,1,614

Interviews were conducted with 18 Physical Education teachers working in Brazilian public schools. Data collected were examined by content analysis to search for emerging themes. The findings showed that inclusion was understood as participation and learning for all children rather than only for those with disabilities. Team sports were pointed as the main challenge for the inclusion of students with disability. Initial and continuing education programs for teachers need to target effective pedagogical practices to promote inclusion, leading to restructuring Physical Education teachers' training.}",Child;Only Child;Disabled Children;Physical Education and Training,"Tanure Alves, Maria Luiza and Storch, Jalusa Andreia and Harnisch, Gabriela and Strapasson, Aline Mir and , a and Piva da Cunha Furtado, Otavio Luis and Lieberman, Lauren and Gaviao de Almeida, Jose Julio and Duarte, Edison",2017.0,1,615

637,A diversity of voices: Physical education teachers' beliefs about inclusion and teaching students with disabilities,"The purpose of this study was to analyse the beliefs about inclusion and teaching students with disabilities of physical education teachers from various countries and cultures. The participants were 29 physical education teachers from Ghana (Africa), Japan, the US and Puerto Rico. The research method was explanatory multiple-case study situated in the theory of planned behaviour. The primary data sources were attitude surveys and interviews. Survey data were analysed with descriptive statistics and the interview data were analysed using a constant comparative method. Results indicate that the teachers‚Äô beliefs tended to vary on inclusion and teaching students with disablities. Paradoxically, they expressed compelling intrinsic motives while voicing a multiplicity of concerns on teaching students with disabilities. They all desired greater opportunities for relevant professional development, which should be made available more frequently by school districts.

638,Attitudes and attributes of physical educators associated with teaching individuals with severe and profound disabilities,"Assessed the relationship between attitudes and selected attributes of 150 public school physical educators toward teaching students with severe and profound disabilities in regular classes. Ss from suburban school districts in a midwestern state were sent the Physical Educators' Attitude Toward Teaching Individuals with Disabilities‚ÄîIII (PEATID-III). Data showed that physical educators were undecided about teaching students with severe disabilities and disagreed with the teaching of students with profound disabilities in regular classes. Results showed that as the quality of teaching experiences improved and adapted physical education course work increased, attitudes toward teaching students with severe disabilities were more favorable. Favorable attitudes toward teaching students with profound disabilities were associated with an increase of both course work in special education and perceived teacher competence.

639,Physical educators' beliefs and self-reported behaviors toward including students with autism spectrum disorder.,"With an increase in the presence of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the general physical education (GPE) classroom, understanding the current state of GPE teachers' beliefs and behaviors for including these students is warranted. The current study aimed to examine the beliefs and self-reported behaviors of GPE teachers' inclusion of students with ASD. In addition, the study examined potential factors affecting their inclusion behaviors. Using a national stratified random sample, participants were 142 current GPE teachers who submitted surveys anonymously online. Results from a regression analysis indicate that teachers' experience, graduate coursework in adapted physical education (APE), and perceptions of strength in undergraduate training in APE significantly predicted their self-reported behavior for including students with ASD. Although the participant response rate is considerably low, this study provides some support toward the importance of teacher education programs for inclusion training.","Autistic Disorder;United States;Teaching;Physical Education and Training;Middle Aged;Male;Humans;Female;Faculty;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive;Child;Attitude;Adult","Beamer, Jennifer A and Yun, Joonkoo",2014.0,1,619

Subjects in the treated group were matched with the control group by sex, grade taught, and years teaching experience. The control group did not participate in the workshop. Data were collected before the workshop, immediately after the workshop, and about 4 months later. Analysis of covariance indicated although the mean score of the workshop group showed some positive shift in attitudes, no significant differences were evident so the workshop was ineffective in promoting positive attitudes.",Disabled Persons;Physical Education and Training;Mainstreaming (Education);Inservice Training;Humans;Child;Attitude,"Jarvis, K C and French, R",1990.0,1,620
641,Perceptions of Hong Kong physical education teachers on the inclusion of students with disabilities,"Based on Lev Vygotsky‚Äôs social constructivism theory, this study examined the perceptions of Hong Kong physical education (PE) teachers regarding the inclusion of students with disabilities in general PE programmes. Eight secondary PE teachers (female = 5, male = 3) were recruited for individual semi-structured interviews. Data gathered from the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Interview transcripts were analysed and presented as descriptive summaries, as well as underwent content analysis. Three themes emerged based on the content analysis of the teachers‚Äô interview data: (1) favourable, but with concerns, (2) hope to be professional, and (3) lack of connection. Results indicated that the teachers acknowledged the benefits of inclusion in PE; however, the teachers also expressed concern regarding the instructional and environmental barriers to the inclusion of students with disabilities in general PE programmes. The findings demonstrated the need for highly frequent and efficient communication, involvement, and collaboration among stakeholders involved in inclusive PE.

643,Integrating Children With Special Needs in Physical Education: A School District Assessment Model From Finland.,"The purpose was to develop a model to guide assessment for physical education planning for integration and inclusion at the school district level. A secondary goal was to determine if teachers' gender, age, education, and experience of teaching children with special needs are associated with beliefs about barriers to integration. To test the model, data were collected from physical education specialists and classroom teachers in central Finland. The survey instruments were three scales: (a) Awareness of Individual Differences Survey, (b) Survey of Adapted Physical Education Needs‚ÄìFinnish modification (SAPEN-F), and (c) Teacher Beliefs About Physical Education Integration Scale. Results indicated that Finnish teachers know they have students with special needs. PE specialists and classroom teachers share many common beliefs about priority needs. Teachers believe that the most important barrier that hinders physical education integration is attitude. The model described herein worked in Finland and is ready for further testing by other countries.
